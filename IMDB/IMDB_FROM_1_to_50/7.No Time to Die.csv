0,Horst_In_Translation,"Craig's time as 007 ends on a fairly high note, but I still hoped it could be better",6,24 October 2021,"""No Time to Die"" is a co-production between the United States of America and the United Kingdom from 2021 and this is of course the most recent James Bond film we have here. It is a definite contender for most awaited film of the decade because on the one hand the viewer numbers are self-explanatory and on the other hand this film has been delayed so many times because of the corona pandemic that it was truly high time for it to actually hit theaters everywhere. Which it did not too long ago. Being a a huge Bond fan myself, who has seen all the other films (no exceptions), I was curious enough to watch several hours of red-carpet broadcast from London a while ago when the film had its world premiere there and most key cast members showed up and the Royals were also there to check it out. It runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes which makes it a truly long film and even if it is an hour or so longer than another Daniel Craig Bond movie, nobody can really be surprised. It was already an option that Craig could end his Bond career before this one here, but he returned again for a fifth and final 007 performance. Unfortunately, as you can see from the title of my review, I don't think this was as amazing as it could have been. I still think that Casino Royale and Skyfall are his two best movies and clearly ahead of the rest, even if it's not easy at all to pick the number one. But that is another story. Let's look at this one here now. Director is Cary Joji Fukunaga, who is mostly known for his work on True Detective, so the outcome here is surely his biggest big screen success as of now. He is also one of the writers and the other two are again Purvis and Wade who were already there during the Brosnan era. Enough said. They could very well also be there again when the next 007 takes over. Whoever it will be. I mean we already have a Black female 007 in this film, even if I doubt she will become the new lead to the franchise. But we will see.As for the cast, there is nothing to say about Craig anymore. Some of the others are people who reprise their characters from previous movies. Especially the one before. Léa Seydoux is back playing Bond's one and only love interest in this film and it's very serious as we find out, not only because of the child that joins them, but also because of the long sequence early on, which is linked to Vesper Lynd again and her story of betrayal back in Craig's very first Bond movie, so it is a bit of a framework you could say. Is he betrayed again? This time by Madeleine? Christoph Waltz is in this film here too. No surprise obviously, but he does not have a lot of screen time unfortunately. He is an actor I like and I definitely think that there could have been much more to his Blofeld than there was in this film and the previous one. Let's be honest: With what they did with/to him here, it maybe would have been better if he had not been in the film at all. I think Fukunaga was basically only looking for a way to get him out of the picture somehow and put all his focus on the key antagonist in here. That would be the character played by Oscar winner Rami Malek. He is a new addition to the cast and (if we don't count the very first masked scene) it takes quite a while for him to finally join the action, namely when he sits there in Madeleine's presence, but once he is there, he is bound to stay. Great screen presence as always and his villain character is among the better aspects from this film, especially in that scene where he takes the girl from her with the aura of poison all around him. Another antagonist character is played by Dali Benssalah. Very easy to identify too with his physicality. Not just the eye, even if this eye, especially in the final fight scene, and how he/it is taken out is maybe the biggest cult moment from this film and I had to think of Oddjob's hat back in Goldfinger there. I could go on and on. Jeffrey Wright is there again, so is Ralph Fiennes. Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris. New faces with a decent amount of screen time include Lashana Lynch, David Dencik and Billy Magnussen. All no really big names, so they made sure nobody takes away too much attention from Craig's farewell performance.Comedy is once again nothing you find too frequently in here. There was some banter here and there between Bond and the new 007 about who is allowed to carry this number. There was this eye scene linked to the gadget, the one I just mentioned. Oh and maybe for my comedic highlight of it all I must mention Ben Whishaw. His talk about the guest he was about to have was more of a politically correct failure piece of comedy, maybe also linked to the actor's own sexuality, but when he tried to pretend in front of M that he had not seen Bond before this encounter, it was pretty funny. I give them/him that. Big smile there. As for the more dramatic moments, of course the one that stands out the very most is the exact ending. Bond has never died before in these films, so they were taking completely new directions here. I am not sure if I like it though. Big challenge and they probably could not have depicted it any better, but Bond always had this unkillable aura and maybe they should have stayed with it. Like breaking an unwritten rule. Oh well, this was not the first time Blofeld died either and they killed Leiter in the process of it too, but they will all be back sooner or later. In any case, these rockets hitting the island were pretty spectacular. Also bittersweet that they came from his side and 007 ordered them to be fired and you could say that M or MI6 messed up themselves by the fact that they lost this Heracles, this priceless killing program, to the bad side. So his own folks' shortcomings result in Bond's death in this movie. But he still makes sure that evil is buried with him and this gigantic factory of villainy goes down as well. The island between Russia and Asia here I liked the way it was depicted. The isolation of it all, but also these water areas (or liquid areas) in which people were working in thick riot gears. Not sure this is the right word.As for the Bond song by Billie Eilish, I remember not liking it too much when I heard it first. Then it grew a bit on me over the months in the process of looking forward to this film perhaps. Now, as I heard it connected to the movie, I again am not too big on it. Also felt to me as if it was not used on many other occasions except the opening sequence where they always use the Bond song. So yeah, this will surely be one of the more forgettable Bond song and I am pretty sure that it will not repeat the awards success that Adele and Sam Smith had with their previous Bond songs. But we will see. An Oscar nomination seems like a big success already from my perspective. The win is not an option as of now the way I see it. I should probably also mention Finneas as he is co-writer, but I just don't really understand the Eilish hype at all. The music that stands out way more here is certainly Louis Armstrong's ""We Have All the Time in the World"", a timeless classic that you will hear with the closing credits and you also hear the name of this song being referenced on several occasions during this movie, key occasions really. The timelessness of this piece is something Eilish and her brother can only dream of. And it's also a beautiful jump back in time because this was used back in the day during the early 007 movie days already. For Dr. No if I am not mistaken. So yeah, the film had something to offer on the music front as well, not only with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack. The technicality we don't need to criticize. Costumes, sets, makeup, cinematography, sound effects etc. All this is in competent hands here and could not have been much better. But story is key and this is the reason why I don't give a truly high rating. By the way, I thought on some occasion that Madeleine's father here could be Blofeld. I mean we hear about him being a killer, a doctor which he is in the old film, always carries the title Dr. Ernst Stavro Blofeld and here in the previous film he even went with Mr. Bleuchamp, so a French connection was also there. So when we know that Bond can kill Blofeld with his hands because of the virus, I thought that he would kill Madeleine too, but they touched and kissed and she did not die, so we did not find out about her real father.As for Malek's character, he is of course also a tragic figure with what happened to his family earlier and his revenge idea in terms of killing the killer's family can be related to somehow, but what he turns into is definitely insane. I mean this was a touch of Thanos already I felt. Killing millions of people and causing some kind of natural selection this way. While with Thanos we were getting this idea of a relentless god, I still felt that they could have elaborated a bit more there on Safin's approach. Not the tennis player. Sorry, I just had to. Overall, this is of course unsurprisingly another Bond film that people who like the franchise should not miss out on and it is also definitely a better watch in movie theaters. Go see it on the big screen and preferrably do so now while it is still on because I have made the experience that at least here they do not really show past Bond films in movie theaters. The old ones. Maybe because they are all on television still from time to time and actually several times each year. I am not sure what you will like most about this movie, but I think there is enough to pick from and there are definitely more positive moments to the outcome here than negative moments. Actually, almost no negative moments. Ana de Armas could have been given better material. I mean she is second-cast on imdb because of her name, but barely a factor. Oh well, maybe we will see more from her character in the next movie. It's still also never really a great film unfortunately. I feel like Fukunaga was playing it safe overall, which hurt the film.

1,Prismark10,No Time To Die,8,21 October 2021,"Bond is back at last. Daniel Craig is the longest serving Bond with the fewest films.Once again Bond is out of the service, bumming around the Caribbean.It's Felix Leiter who coaxes him back to action. Only to find that M has replaced him with a new 007.The target is a biological weapon that horns in on DNA. The British were developing it but lost it to Spectre, or so they thought.For Bond it's a reunion with Blofeld and Madeleine, a woman he thought he loved but let go, mistakenly. She never did have time to tell him her secret.However there is a new foe called Safin and he is bearing a grudge but it is against Spectre.The movie is long and lacks a spectacular action sequence. It also feels a lot like a Christopher Nolan film. Just check out all those black Range Rovers, the booming bass and the car action scenes.I also thought Safin himself was a weak baddie. I could understand his hatred for Blofeld but not against the world or Bond.The stirrings of a Louis Armstrong song at the beginning gives the impression that the movie will contain several farewells.For Bond there are also a few new character developments. He crosses swords with M. He has regrets and might need to make the ultimate sacrifice.The ending is rather faithful to the novel of You Only Live Twice.One big issue I have and this is something the producers need to consider in the future. The film has three villains with facial disfigurements.",No Time to Die
2,nogodnomasters,It's just a number,5,10 October 2021,"It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no ""Diamonds are Forever."" And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn't they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",No Time to Die
3,kosmasp,No time to say goodbye,9,13 October 2021,"When I first watched Daniel Craig 15 years ago, I was not ready for the direction they were taking the character. It felt like a good movie, but it felt quite divorced from the Bond I grew up with ... the Bond I knew. But apart from that effort being a Bond begins sort of thing (and this being the other end of that ... line), the franchise bit by bit gave us certain things ... we as viewers yearned for. While keeping it fresh.Bond ... James Bond! That line - one of many that are (in)famous in the long list of Bond movies - gets a new spin here. As is the iconic Bond shooting towards the camera. Now I could name many more things that this film revisits and I probably still would miss some. There are many references here, either visually or via audio.The beginning is quite the introduction ... it is almost funny because it takes its time. And it is funny because the rest sometimes feels rushed. There are many loose ends the movie wants to (neatly?) tie up. Another day, another Bond song, another Bond intro - although quite late in the game.Bond has grown - grown not just over the course of the movie Craig played him, but generally speaking. Society changes and Bond has no issue sitting on on the backseat of a motorbike, while a woman is driving. That is not enough for you to go on a rampage and scream ""wokeness"".Many known faces return, but many new ones too. Be it the ever excellent if only shortly used Ana de Armas (no pun intended) or our uber villain Rami Malek. Now while I really liked what I saw and while the running time is 2,5 hours ... there are things that can be seen and called flaws. You can question Bonds love to Eva Greens character ... or him still holding onto her, you can question methods used and how convenient certain things happen - or how some stunts would put the Fast and Furious franchise to shame ... but if you did that, you would derive yourself of a lot of fun.Not being aware of the previous entries may not be necessary, but you'll have a lot of things to discover and smile at, if you have seen at least some of them. Of course if it is only a few of them, make it the Craig Bonds, so you have the whole ... story. Generally speaking I can't wait to revisit all the movies.No time to watch (them)? Well make time ;) Also to conclude with a fun ""fact"": the title No time to Die has been used before ... by another movie in 2006. The year Daniel Craig became Bond! Coincidence? Or full circle? All kidding aside, I have not seen that movie (yet), so don't hate on me if it isn't any good. Otherwise, out with the old ... in with the new - whoever that may be and however the franchise is going to reinvent itself ... I'll be there - I hope you will be there too.",No Time to Die
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"I wasn't expecting that, very entertaining, if long.",8,1 October 2021,"It felt as though we were never going to get to see this, but finally it's here, the question is, was it worth the wait?The answer, yes, really not what I was expecting, of course it's action packed, dramatic and high octane, but it actually boasts a good story, and perhaps shows us a slightly different side to the character.Plenty of action, plenty of style, and a real twist.I thought Daniel Craig was awesome, and I'm genuinely sad that he's leaving, it's fascinating now to know who'll take over.On the downside, it was a bit long, and it did lull a little in parts, but the action was enough to halt any dozing.Overall, very watchable, 8/10.",No Time to Die
5,jboothmillard,No Time to Die,7,24 October 2021,"The twenty-fifth Bond movie, reported as the last for the leading actor, was first delayed by the departure of original director Danny Boyle, due to creative differences, and then three or four times by the impact of COVID-19, with the lockdowns and restrictions. It became probably the most highly anticipated film in the franchise's history and was predicted to be the biggest film to bring audiences back to the cinemas. Finally, after almost two years of delays and waiting, it was released; I am a huge fan of Bond and I was super excited to see it on the big screen, co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag), directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, Beasts of No Nation). Basically, in the opening flashback, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) visits the house of Mr. White, intending to kill him. He is not there, but his wife (Mathilde Bourbin) and daughter, young Madeleine Swann (Coline Defaud), are inside. While Safin kills White's wife, Madeline shoots him and flees, but Safin survives. He chases Madeline onto a nearby frozen lake, and she falls through the ice, but Safin rescues her. In the present, Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) is with James Bond (Daniel Craig) in Matera, following the capture of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) and Bond's resignation. While he is there, Bond visits the tomb of his former lover Vesper Lynd, but he is ambushed by assassins from the Spectre organisation. The assassins, led by mercenary Primo aka ""Cyclops"" (Dali Benssalah), who has a cybernetic eye, chase Bond and Madeleine in Bond's gadget ladened Aston Martin DB5. Although they manage to overpower and evade the assassins, Bond believes Madeleine has betrayed him, despite her pleas, and leaves her. Five years later, MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) is kidnapped from a secret MI6 laboratory. With the approval of M (Ralph Fiennes), Obruchev had developed Project Heracles, a bioweapon containing nanobots that infect like a virus upon touch and are coded to an individual's DNA, rendering it lethal to the target and their relatives but harmless to others. Bond has retired to Jamaica, where he is contacted by his friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), and his colleague Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen). Leiter asks for Bond's help in finding Obruchev, which he declines. But then he meets Nomi (Lashana Lynch), an MI6 agent who has been a Double-O for two years, becoming his successor as 007. She tells him about Project Heracles, after which Bond agrees to help Leiter, despite Nomi's warnings not to interfere. Bond goes to Cuba and meets CIA agent Paloma (Knives Out's Ana de Armas), as they infiltrate a Spectre meeting for Blofeld's birthday where they believe Obruchev will be. Still imprisoned in Belmarsh, Blofeld uses Primo's ""bionic eye"" to lead the meeting and order his members to kill Bond with a ""nanobot mist"". But the mist instead kills all the Spectre members, as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to infect them, on orders from Safin. Bond captures Obruchev and rendezvous with Leiter and Ash on a boat. But Ash reveals himself to be double agent working for Safin, he shoots Leiter and escapes with Obruchev. With a bomb exploded and the boat sinking, Bond is forced to leave the fatally wounded Felix, but he promises, before he dies, he will finish the mission. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) arrange a meeting between Bond and Blofeld in prison to try to find Obruchev. Safin visits and coerces Madeleine to infect herself with a nanobot dose to kill Blofeld, as she has been his only visitor since his incarceration. Bond and Madeleine are speechless seeing each other at Blofeld's prison cell, he touches her and unknowingly infects himself before she leaves. Blofeld confesses to Bond that he staged the ambush at Vesper's tomb to appear as if Madeleine had betrayed him. Bond reacts by attacking Blofeld, unintentionally causing the nanobots to infect and kill him. Bond tracks Madeleine to her childhood home in Norway and learns she has a five-year-old daughter, Mathilde (Lisa-Dorah Sonnet), but she claims she is not his. Madeleine tells him that when Safin was a boy, his parents were murdered by her father on Blofeld's orders. Safin was the sole survivor of Mr. White's dioxin attack on his family, leaving him facially disfigured from chemical burns. Having avenged his family by killing Blofeld and destroying Spectre, Safin continues his rampage with Ash. Safin's army pursue Bond, Madeleine, and Mathilde through the woods. Though Bond kills Ash and his thugs, Safin captures Madeleine and Mathilde. Safin's headquarters is located on an island between Japan and Russia, and harbours a missile base, converted to a nanobot factory, where Obruchev is mass-producing the technology so Safin can use it to kill millions of people. Q enables Bond and Nomi to infiltrate the base. Bond kills many of Safin's men while Nomi kills Obruchev by pushing him into a nanobot vat. Madeleine escapes captivity while Safin lets Mathilde go. Nomi takes Madeleine and Mathilde away from the island while Bond stays behind to open the island's blast-resistant silo doors, calling a missile strike from submarine HMS Dragon to destroy the factory. Bond kills Safin's remaining men, including Primo using electromagnetic pulse in his wristwatch to overload and explode the cybernetic eye in his head. Safin ambushes Bond, shooting and infecting him with a vial containing nanobots programmed to kill Madeleine and Mathilde upon his touch. Despite his injuries, Bond kills Safin after a fight and opens the silo doors. Speaking by radio with Madeleine, Bond tells her he loves her and encourages her to move on without him. In his final moments, Madeleine confirms that Mathilde is his daughter as Bond says goodbye. The missiles hit the island, destroying the nanobot factory and killing Bond. At MI6, M, Moneypenny, Nomi, Q and Tanner (Rory Kinnear) drink in Bond's memory. As Madeleine takes Mathilde to Matera, she tells her about her father, James Bond. Also starring Hugh Dennis as Dr. Hardy, Priyanga Burford as Dr. Symes, and Javone Prince as MI6 Security Guard. Craig makes the most of his final outing as the world's most famous spy being determined but also emotional, Seydoux (so far only the second Bond Girl to return, after Sylvia Trench) is beautiful and memorable as his lover, Lynch is reasonable in her annoyingly underwritten part, de Armas steals her scenes as the bubbly and slightly airheaded CIA agent, Malek is a bit too hammy and not very chilling as the villain, but Waltz gets a terrific Hannibal Lecter style cameo, and there is good support from Fiennes, Wright and Whishaw. It is a good story (the virus aspect being eerily relevant with the times we have lived in), filled with only occasional need for gadgets and gimmicks. It has drama and emotion, plenty of gripping chases, fights and explosive sequences, some humour, and the Billie Eilish title song (the second Bond song to hit Number One) is okay. You will notice things from previous entries popping up, including the Aston Martin V8 Volante from The Living Daylights (people have compared Craig's more aggressive Bond as similar to Timothy Dalton). But the most noticeable is the clever throwback to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with the John Barry theme heard, and the song ""We Have All the Time in the World"". The 1969 film famously ended with Bond's wife being killed, in this one, Bond dies in a genuinely sad way (he goes out with a bang, literally), and the Louis Armstrong song plays in the end credits. There will be fans that will be shocked and maybe angry at producers breaking the golden rule (Bond must never die!), but Casino Royale started with Bond earning his Double-O status, and this is a brave, poignant, and (I think) suitable conclusion to Craig's tenure. It may be two hours and three quarters long, but it didn't feel like it, the time is used well, and this is just the kind of entertainment you need, and don't worry, ""James Bond Will Return"", a terrific spy action adventure. Very good!",No Time to Die
6,searchanddestroy-1,"That remains a James Bond movie for me, more than Skyfall",7,11 October 2021,"Of course the James Bond spirit is not exactly the same as the other films over decades. It is more gloomy, darker, with a total different face of our hero. You have in this movie many unexpected things, but the overall scheme remains à James Bond movie, maybe more than SKYFALL, which was far far more a crime thriller than an OO7 feature. Watch it again and compare. In a way, SKYFALL announced this one, with SPECTRE in the middle. Not the best Bond ever, but not the worst either.",No Time to Die
7,CinemaSerf,A fittingly mediocre conclusion of Craig's custodianship.,6,5 October 2021,"I saw this with a friend who watched the original ""Dr. No"" (1962) at the time, and who proclaimed at the end of this 2¾ hour marathon that this just isn't ""James Bond"". My first ""Bond"" film was some fifteen years later but i was forced to agree with him. This isn't. I have never been the biggest fan of Daniel Craig - he completely lacks charisma on screen. There is no glint in his eye! Add to that the grim determination of the producers to rob the character of his flaws and foibles; to politically correct every aspect of the storylines and to generally sterilise what was always, essentially, a charming tale of light weight male chauvinism with espionage, shameless patriotism, gadgets, double entendre and a damn good theme tune. Here, Craig has precious little chemistry with either of his female co-stars and the baddie features so sparingly (though that maybe because he was double-jobbing for Lord Lloyd Webber at the Opera) that even by the end there just wasn't a sense of accumulated tension, peril or danger - indeed I just felt really quite underwhelmed. Of course, it is a fabulous looking film: the old Aston Martin makes a welcome return - as does the divine Louis Armstrong's ""All the Time in the World"" but I wonder how many of us will recall this film once the dust has settled. It has a role right now; it may well single-handedly rescue cinema from the horrible effects of lockdown, and for that is must be congratulated, but speaking as a lifelong Bond fan, I'd implore those at the helm of the next one: can we please get back to what Bond is entertaining at, what Ian Fleming designed him to be and stop imposing wafer-thin stories on equally thin, undercooked, characterisations and hope that nostalgia and John Barry et al will dupe us into thinking it is great? I don't care if the next 007 is gay/girl/coloured/one legged - but please can we get back to a story laced with humour and personality with a script that allows for nuance, sarcasm and charm. Otherwise, perhaps Bond has just served his purpose, it's time to move on? Sorry - I was really disappointed.",No Time to Die
8,zardoz-13,Is This Curtains for Daniel Craig?,5,26 October 2021,"Daniel Craig delivers a robust farewell performance as 007 in the 25th James Bond movie ""No Time to Die,"" another long, drawn-out, often tedious extravaganza with lackluster villains capped off with a bizarre ending. Mind you, the 007 gang is all back, including Ms. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), gadget guru Q (Ben Whishaw), Chief of Staff Tanner (Rory Kinnear), CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), and 007's crusty boss M (Ralph Fiennes) Head of MI6. Bond's perpetual enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Oscar winner Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds"") lurks on the periphery from his prison cell. Sadly, although he reappears here, Blofeld's screen time is far too minimal. Rami Malik's somnambulist villain Lyutsifer Safin epitomizes every Ian Fleming literary character who ever sought revenge. Worse, Safin's lack of stature in the gallery of audacious Bond adversaries doesn't serve him well. Meantime, too much of anything can be a bore, and Bond 25's biggest shortcoming is its length. Clocking in at a marathon 163 minutes, this 007 outing makes repeated allusions to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969). The least the Bond producers could have done is whittle 45 minutes off this meandering melodrama. Meanwhile, not only does Q have more than his usual number of scenes, but so also does M. Actually, M sets everything in motion with a cloak-and-dagger project codenamed Heracles that he conjured up without approval. Mind you, the $250 million budget makes ""No Time to Die"" look like a travelogue, with the scenic locales overshadowing the larger-than-life shenanigans. Indeed, ""No Time to Die"" boasts impressive production values, with Craig eager to engage his enemies with or without his license to kill. Unfortunately, little about ""Beast of No Nation"" director Cary Joji Fukunaga's entry in the cinematic Ian Fleming franchise is remarkable, except its ending. Ultimately, despite everything you may have heard to the contrary, the closing credits to ""No Time to Die"" conclude with the familiar phrase: JAMES BOND WILL RETURN. Compared with Craig's other Bond movies, ""No Time to Die"" makes Craig's most abysmal outing ""Quantum of Solace"" appear superior on several counts.""No Time to Die"" unfolds in the past, with Madeleine Swann as a child (newcomer Coline Defaud), living with her mother (Mathilde Bourbin of ""Louise""), in a remote but picturesque domicile in the middle of a snow-swept, Norwegian forest on the edge of a frozen lake. Madeleine's mom is Mr. White's wife. Earlier, the notorious Mr. White appeared in both ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) as an enemy agent who tangled with Bond. This opening scene occurs long before either of those Bond escapades. An enigmatic stranger garbed in military apparel, wearing a Japanese Noh mask, and armed with an assault rifle, arrives at Mr. White's house. Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malik) has come to kill Mr. White because he murdered Safin's parents and family. Seeking payback, Safin has to settle for killing White's wife, since White isn't home. Madeleine manages to shoot Safin, but she doesn't kill him. Instead, fleeing from the house, she crosses onto the frozen lake, plunges through thin ice, and almost drowns. Ironically, Safin rescues Madeleine. Afterward, ""No Time to Die"" fast-forwards into the future. We learn James Bond has not only retired from MI6, but he has also fallen in love with an adult Madeleine. If you missed the previous Bond ""Spectre"" (2015), you should watch it. Meantime, the couple are vacationing in sunny Italy near the cemetery where Bond's long, lost ""Casino Royale"" lover Vesper Lynd is buried. Sentimental sap that Bond is, he visits her grave. Moments before the gravesite blows up in his face, Bond spots a business card with Spectre's symbol--an octopus--embossed on it. Naturally, Bond thinks Madeleine wanted to kill him. She didn't, but he doesn't learn this until five years later. More Spectre assassins emerge to kill our hero, but he survives their futile attempts on his life.Meanwhile, terrorists break into a secret MI6 laboratory and kidnap a scientist, Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik of ""The Snowman""), who has been developing Project Herakles, a deadly, top-secret, DNA-based bioweapon teeming with nanobots that can infect a person like a virus. Worst, Herakles was M's brainchild, and it was supposed to enable an assassin to kill a target in a crowd without harming anybody else. Eventually, Madeleine and Bond reunite when MI6 dispatches Bond to a maximum-security British prison where Blofeld is held. Madeleine (Léa Seydoux of ""The Lobster"") is Blofeld's psychiatrist. Blofeld confesses to Bond that he--not Madeleine--tried to kill him in Italy. Anything more about this elaborate plot would either be confusing or spoil the impending revelations. Like a standard issue Bond opus, our hero tracks down Obruchev and finds him on Safin's private island where the villain cultivates poisonous plants in an exotic garden. Mind you, this garden is something the writers took from Ian Fleming's second-to-last Bond novel ""You Only Live Twice.""Apart from two impressive, bullet-riddled, stunt-laden, action scenes featured in the ""No Time to Die"" trailer, nothing here will spike your blood pressure. Typically, the flamboyant villains make Bond movies memorable. Alas, Blofeld has only a couple of scenes, while Safin doesn't pose much of a physical threat. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux generate only a modicum of chemistry as lovers. The other letdown is MI6 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch of ""Captain Marvel""), who has inherited Bond's number 007. She adds little to the fireworks that spotlight her mettle. Altogether, ""No Time To Die"" qualifies as a fair-to-middling thriller.",No Time to Die

Craig's swan song as 007 delivers all the goods with his brute force tactics and surprising vulnerability are on tap when his services are requested after 5 years retirement to stop baddie Lyutsifer Safin (silky Malek) from infiltrating a deadly nanobot virus via DNA into the world populace while also nursing his love for Seydoux who is in the mix in oh so many ways. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (who collaborated on the screenplay with Nal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) infuses death-defying set pieces with visual flair to spare (best viewed in Imax) as well as some much needed dry wit and humor.",No Time to Die
10,neil-476,Terrific,10,20 October 2021,"Newly retired James Bond and bride Madeleine are enjoying scenic travelling despite the secrets they both know the other has. Those secrets blow the couple apart and Bond goes off the grid until - well, reasons.It is difficult to give much plot commentary without risking spoilers and, of all the Bonds, this has more potential for spoilers than any of them. So let me mention specific but non-plot items.The opening sequence is the most genuinely chilling sequence in any Bond film. The multiple nods to previous Bond - both books and films (dialogue, music, set design etc.) - are affectionate and organic rather than knowing nudges. New director Cary Joji Fukanaga shows that Sam Mendes doesn't have a monopoly on making Bond movies look gorgeous. Lea Seydoux, reprising an underwritten Madeleine, is spectacularly good. Ana De Armas features in a sequence which is huge fun, but it's not too difficult to recognise that it was shoehorned in at a late stage, because 2 lines of dialogue would have sufficed to replace it in the story.And perhaps it is fair to comment that a feature of the Craig Bonds has been each film revealing another layer like nesting Russian dolls, and the baddie here has an air of being added to extend the saga after an effective full ending at the conclusion of Spectre. But I'm not complaining because, following Craig's decision to OK, I'll do another one but no more, this is a good, good end to his five Bond films.And I'm now prepared to say that his Bond is the best screen Bond. My reason for this is that his is the only Bond who has been a human being - capable of cold suppression of emotion in order to do his job, but a real person nonetheless. The other Bonds have all been actors playing characters.I choked up at the music choice over the closing credits.",No Time to Die
11,gridoon2021,Craig's last Bond film is also his weakest,6,1 October 2021,"The first 20-25 minutes are superb (from the music to the location to the acting to the action), but then the titles fall (cool titles, bland song), and the movie never quite reaches those heights again. For such a long, bloated running time it's too talky and surprisingly short on action; in fact, there are only two other notable set-pieces, the car chase in the woods and Ana de Armas brightening up the screen as an overeager, bubbly yet skilled and deadly agent. Most of the rest of the action is uninspired, and in the climactic sequence (just a regular attack-on-the-enemy-fortress we've seen hundreds of times) often dim and murky (Tomorrow Never Dies did this sort of thing much better, and so did some of the Roger Moore Bonds). The plot is formulaic (biological weapon....again), and its treatment of several key players from previous installments disappointing. The ending is pretty silly - it leaves a mess behind that the (inevitable) next chapter will either have to work a whale of a story to get around or (more likely) will ignore altogether. Craig does succeed at embodying a very human Bond, yet I can't help but think that he never really got the chance to do a FUN James Bond living the high life: in Casino he is earning his stripes, in Quantum he is seeking vengeance, in Skyfall he is already tired and resigned, in No Time his circle comes to an end. I guess he came closest to having a good time in Spectre, which is why that film is still my favorite of the five he made. **1/2 out of 4.",No Time to Die
12,ferguson-6,Welcome back and Adieu,8,6 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Bond 25 is here, and it's quite a curtain call for actor Daniel Craig. The film's release has been postponed numerous times since September 2019, which has caused expectations and anxiety to build amongst Bond fans. It's been almost six years since SPECTRE (2015), and this is Daniel Craig's fifth and final turn as 007. This production faced challenges even before the pandemic hit. Cary Joji Fukunaga (best known for ""True Detective"" and BEASTS OF NO NATION, 2015) was hired to direct after Danny Boyle stepped down (or whatever happened), and Phoebe Waller-Bridge was brought in to spice up the dialogue on the script from Fukunaga, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade (the latter two having been involved in writing all five Bond movies for Craig). Of course, it's Ian Fleming to whom we stand eternally grateful for the original characters.For those accustomed to the James Bond cinematic formula, you'll notice quite a few differences - beginning with the opening scenes. Traditionally, breathtaking action kicks off the film; but this time a shift in tone and style serves up a tension-filled opening that occurs five years prior to the rest of the story. It takes a few minutes before we get the first true action sequence. Of course, we must keep in mind that we are dealing with a ""retired"" James Bond (don't worry, it's not like ""fat Thor"") ... in fact, there's already a replacement 007 and she (Lashana Lynch, CAPTAIN MARVEL, 2019) packs quite an attitude and skill set.It's his old CIA buddy, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who draws Bond back into the espionage game, and of course, the reason is to save the world (what else could it be?). This year's world-domination-seeking villain is the cleverly named Lyutsifer Safin, and he's played by Oscar winner Rami Malek (BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, 2018). Safin is a low-key baddie whose weapon is a DNA-altering chemical that's probably a bit overly complex for a Bond movie, and it's also a bit strange that Safin/Malek only has a few substantive scenes. For those who saw SPECTRE, you'll recognize many of the faces, including Lea Seydoux as Madeleine Swann, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner, and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Also back for a terrific scene is Oscar winner Christoph Waltz as Blofield. The new faces include the aforementioned Lashana Lynch as Nomi, Billy Magnusson as Logan Ash, and Craig's KNIVES OUT co-star Ana de Armas as Paloma. Ms. De Armas brings a jolt of energy and some smiles to the proceedings, and it's a shame her appearance is so short.It's unusual for a Bond song to win its Grammy before the movie is ever released, but that's exactly what happened for Billie Eilish's achingly somber title song. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer (THE LION KIING) delivers a wonderful score in his first Bond outing (you'll hear how he incorporates the Eilish song), and the cinematography from Oscar winner Linus Sandgren (LA LA LAND) is everything we could hope for in the action sequences (there is no shortage of bombs), as well as the quiet moments.Speaking of the quiet moments, this is undoubtedly the most sentimental and emotional of all Bond films. Sure, we get the amazing set pieces, the crazy stunts, the awesome Aston Martin (until it isn't), the cool gadgets, the wisecracks, and the shootouts - but we also get Bond at his most reflective and personal. There is a line in the film, ""Letting go is hard."" And it is ... both for Bond and for us. So welcome back and adieu, Mr. Bond. Craig. Daniel Craig.The film opens in U. S. theaters on October 8, 2021.",No Time to Die
13,mm-39,Better than average!,7,14 October 2021,"No time to die well is a must watch for Bond fans. I believe No Time to die may put to rest a much tired movie series. The first third starts out with a mystery. Why is the guy there and who is that young gal? Bond has a life of leisure with a true love, but in true Bond fashion Bond is who Bond can not live in peace. There is a memorable bad guy with one eye etc and a conflict with a mysterious girlfriend. 10 out of ten . The middle gets bogged down with the usual government loses something story line. Bond which is a non p c series has some woke characters, the over tough gal, and whippy guy flat characters which drags the story but thankfully the characters become more believable later on. The cool gadgets are back in the middle. The bad guy is interesting, but the story has predictable video game style action. Middle is 5 stars. The bottom third has the usual, eye roll, Bond count down, and Bond saves the world. Bond has a family, which does not mix with Bond's living on the edge lifestyle. Some of the Bond action is video game ish, which is bit much. The story all folds together with an interesting sub plots and a surprise ending. I give the ending a 7. Not the best ending, but a must see for Bond fans. Well directed and acted. 7 stars.",No Time to Die
14,Mr-Fusion,A stunning conclusion,8,31 October 2021,"Much has been made about No Time To Die bringing the Daniel Craig era to completion, so I'll skip past this. No, this is a perfect dose of escapism; intense, emotional and brimming with action. It picks up the best hanging threads from Casino Royale and Skyfall, throws in some callbacks to classic Bond movies and allows Craig to leave an immense mark on this franchise. I'm thankful that he didn't walk away after Spectre, and really delivered something to savor here. Given the runtime, this could've been a last gasp - but far from it. This is a joyride well worth taking.... And lest I forget, the most brilliant use of an f-bomb I've heard in a very long time. Ralph Fiennes is a treasure.",No Time to Die
15,DKosty123,A Lot For All Bond Fans To Enjoy,8,9 October 2021,"Because of a World Wide Pandemic which in some quarters has motives like the ruin the world, James Bond is back again trying to save the world. In order to do so he must deal with the old criminal organization Spectre and Blowfeld who has been the bad guys for many years it seems. The difference here is that they are really red herrings being used by a mad man who wants to kill a majority of the world's population using a high technology bug that is programmed to kill people by their DNA.For the long time Bond fan, the biggest hint about the movie is before the opening credits. There is a long sequence where Bond tells the lovely woman he is with they have ""all the time in the world"". The theme from his Majesty's Secret Service runs through the film. It's closing credits even feature a great stereo remastering of Louis Armstrong doing the original theme from the George L (Bond) only film of the late 1960's.One strange thing in the world of Bond. Years ago Blowfeld was totally bald. This many years later he has hair. Perhaps he saw those Bosley ads for getting rid of baldness in the years after. Lea Seydoux the second French actress to be a Bond Woman in the series and Madeline for the second straight film after Spectre is indeed a tough Bond woman with a gun. Ralph Fiennes continues his role from Spectre (2015) as M. Naomi Harris is in her second straight as Moneypenny though. She played Eve in Skyfall so this is her third straight Bond and along with Maude Adams has played 2 women characters in the series. This generations regulars are all here along with a portrait of one tough special Judi Dench portrait that appears in a hallway late in the film.While the film keeps all the Fleming characters and the usual save the world plot, it is done freshly enough for even viewers not born yet when the series began to enjoy the action and the acting. Since Daniel Craig has been Bond the acting has gained more importance and balance with the action. It has been a welcome change. Each man who played Bond had different ways to do it and there were times that action and special effects took priority over acting. That has changed and is one of the strengths of this one.While the film feels like nonstop action, there is some acting here too. The ending might come as a shock to long time Bond fans, but considering this series it is something which was done in more than 1 of the Bond Films in the beginning, only this time it appears to be done for good. Spoiler- the film also discloses that Bond and Madeline have a daughter now. This is the first actual recorded sibling of Bond though there were enough scenes over the years in Bond films to suggest an episode of Maury Povich doing DNA tests on some of the other ladies he had recreation with. Finally though, yes James, you are the father.Scenery is still a big part of this and many filming locations were used in this one. This tradition has always been a part of the series. At the end it does say ""Bond will return"", but the feeling here is that the form of his return will be as a her. The set up very much looks that way. The Bond women are getting nicer curves, but that is nothing unusual. It is a concession to the times, and is welcome too. Women built thin like guys are not in style as much as years ago after so many young ladies starved themselves. Not enough of them tried to have the nice figure of Ursala Andress and we are finally making up for it.Having lived long enough to remember the late Connery, Lazenby, late Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, late Niven, late Nelson, and Craig is a feat unto itself. Nelson's Climax TV episode live performance of 007 in 1954 led to all the others. It has been an amazing road. While the plots have changed and remained the same, Director Cary Joji Fukunaga does an amazing job making this film feel like it is supposed too. Armstrong at the end is a reminder of how much has changed since all this began. Louis, we've had all the time in the world to follow Bond every step of the way.",No Time to Die
16,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - No Time to Die (2021) 6.5/10,7,5 October 2021,"""NO TIME TO DIE, with a record-breaking 163-minute length, runs out of steam halfway through, after the Cuban part to be specific, where a bombshell Paloma (de Armas, lissom, light-hearted and lethal) knocks us dead with boffolas and her pliability. After that the situation gets glummer, the story goes more formulaic, take the example of the scene where Blofeld (Waltz), the head of SPECTRE, pops his clogs. It is designed to give audience a God's view (we know what is going to happen but Bond doesn't) with Bond suddenly losing his sangfroid and getting steamed up, all just to let him unknowingly pass the nanobots to Blofeld, it is too obvious a plot twist, wielded without much tact though.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",No Time to Die
17,thesar-2,Bland Bond,2,16 October 2021,"For how long and boring this is, you'll actually have plenty of time to die.Wow. This isn't just the most plain looking James Bond movie, it's one of the most ick looking and feeling movies I've seen in a long time. So lifeless, meaningless and despite the significance of this movie - Daniel Craig's last time as Bond, so get ready for a reboot next time, I seriously cannot recommend this film to anyone.Once again, Bond has retired (I think this is his 12th retirement) and found the love of his life (also, 12th ""true love,"") but an old foe is bringing him back in for Queen and Country.I simply cannot get over how dull this movie looks and how uninterested the actors were for being here. We even had two incredible actors as Bond Villains: Christoph Waltz and Rami Malek and both svcked HARD. In fact, Rami seemingly got acting lessons from Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending. Makes sense since they're both Oscar winners and both whisper their way as sleepy villains.Admittedly there are mere moments of delightful cinematography on screen and some of the jokes landed, but there is absolutely nothing here that would/should justify the nearly 3-hour, slowly paced movie. I appreciate them adding in so many of the normal Bond tropes, and yet, even those felt like they just had to be there.I'm sure Craig got paid a lot and good for him. I didn't hate this movie like I did with Spectre, but it did make me want this Craig era to be over. Sad. When he started it all in Casino Royale, 15 years ago, he quickly became my favorite Bond (and with that movie, my favorite Bond song and overall chapter) and now I'm shooing him away and praying the next one will take its time to perfect it with someone who actually cares about playing this historic role.***Final Thoughts: At least we finally found out what ""Q"" stands for.",No Time to Die

19,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A more than satisfying swansong for Daniel Craig as Bond,9,14 October 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJames Bond (Daniel Craig) has retired from active service, and is now living in Jamaica, with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), the girl from his last encounter with SPECTRE. All seems well, until a series of attempts on his life leads him to think she might be behind it. Meanwhile, in London, an armed break in at a chemical laboratory results in the apparent kidnapping of Dr. Obruchev (David Denicik.) It all leads to the path of incarcerated criminal Lyetsifer Safin (Rami Malek), setting a course for Bond and Madeleine's paths to intersect once again.It has felt like a lifetime ago now that the massive hype and eager anticipation for Daniel Craig's final Bond film was first about, before the unthinkable global pandemic struck, and the release date got set all the way back to the present day, where it has absolutely smashed global box office records. At five films, Craig has lasted the course as long as the original greats Connery and Moore, his image now as personified in the character as those whose shoes he had to fill.With that in mind, it's ironic that director Cary Joui Fukanaga pays such an homage to the Bond film starring George Lazenby, who played him only once, in the shape of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Louis Armstrong's melodic theme song We Have All the Time in the World playing over the soundtrack at various points, as well as the downbeat fatalism that defined that Bond outing from all the others. Craig's Bond has been a grittier, more hard edged Bond in general, and in its bowing out here, Fukanaga goes Hell for leather, cranking the brutal intensity of Craig's last four Bond entries all together, and giving it everything with a film running over two and a half hours, with some light humour awkwardly inserted in.It's the final part of what defines Craig's Bond, and in that it's everything you expect it to be, ur it's also a love song to the Bond franchise in general, from the more modern, unflinching stuff, right through to the 'secret organisation' stuff when it began in the 60's nearly sixty years ago, that everyone won't be able to help loving. ****",No Time to Die
20,MOscarbradley,Going out with a bang!,9,15 October 2021,"They tried to tell us it's too long and at 163 minutes ""No Time to Die"" is indeed the longest of the Bond movies but don't let that colour your judgement; this is still one hell of a rollercoaster ride and if Daniel Craig, in his final appearance as Commander Bond, is looking his age, remember he's now 'retired' and probably closer in demeanour to a middle-aged spy than at any time in the franchise. You must also remember that the Craig Bond's, unlike those of his predecessors, have followed a trajectory from ""Casino Royale"", (the first of the Ian Fleming novels), right through to the present, each one a kind of sequel to the one before and while Craig may not be everyone's favourite Bond he is, at least, unique in that respect. You might even say the entire Bond saga belongs to him.The next point to consider, of course, is is it any good or rather is it as good as the others and the answers to both questions is a resounding yes. This is an action flic of the first order, exciting, funny and, for the most part, intelligent. It's also surprisingly old-fashioned. Here is a Bond movie that goes back to the roots of the franchise, all the way to ""Dr. No"" in fact. The gadgets are still there and used to good effect but this is a much more character driven piece and in Rami Malek it has one of the great Bond villains, (could Malek become the first Bond villain to pick up an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor?).Admittedly the plot is quite far-fetched. We may not be in ""Moonraker"" territory but you may still have to see the film twice just to figure out what's going on. Also in keeping with previous Craig Bond's it's not afraid to introduce plot twists that should have a lasting impact on the series, presuming, of course, that the producers wish audiences to take any forthcoming films seriously. In what we now know will be his last appearance in the role it would be nice to say that this is Craig's film and while he certainly brings gravitas to the part it is Malek who steals the movie and if the film itself isn't quite the best of the series it's certainly up there. If this doesn't bring the punters in, nothing will.",No Time to Die
21,dromasca,21st century Bond,7,4 October 2021,"One of my guilty pleasures as a moviegoer is watching James Bond movies and I have no intention of apologising for that. Thus, I watched as soon as I had the opportunity 'No Time to Die' directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the latest film in the series, whose release has already been postponed several times and which finally meets the screens and its viewers this cinematic fall of the year 2021. The James Bond film series is approaching the age of 60. All Bond movies start from the same premises and have the same hero, but the way he looks and behaves and the structuring of the story have evolved over time. This says a lot about how cinematic entertainment was and is perceived and accepted in the movies of the big studios.A lot has happened during these years. The hero evolved from the nonchalant and humorous commander in Fleming's books and played by Sean Connery to the complex and gloomy character in the last series, played by Daniel Craig. The original 007 had gone through the experience of World War II and was active during the Cold War. He was excused for his womanising as many things are excused to war heroes, and there was no room for moral doubt concerning his actions because he lived in an age when it was clear who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. Thee 21st century James Bond lives and acts in the turbulent era after the fall of communism and after the novels of John Le Carre were written. Today's enemies are not ideological, and screenwriters of such films (not just those in the Bond series) often prefer not to identify them politically, ethnically, or religiously. On the other hand, the romantic implications of the character are no longer devoid of substance. James no longer conquers but falls in love. From Bond the Don Juan we now (almost) get Bond the family man. One of the qualities of the script in 'No Time to Die' is that it manages to describe at this stage of the character's evolution a story that is acceptable by today's standards of the big studios and is somewhat credible in terms of character psychology. Craig's James Bond has been throughout this series and is in this film also a real character, not just a two-dimensional comics book figure.What I liked about 'No Time to Die'? Daniel Craig. Action scenes, car chases and stunts that show ingenuity in a few moments (just when we thought we saw everything in this area) and use the landscapes spectacularly, especially in Italian villages. Humour and self-humour. The presence of Ralph Fiennes, an actor who can do anything on screen and I will like it. Ana de Armas, a classic Bond-girl who I hope will survive until the next series. What I liked less? Rami Malek, an actor who constantly disappoints me and who plays a mediocre bad guy here. Lea Seydoux is OK, but her relationship with Bond lacks chemistry. The dose of melodrama introduced in the script towards the end. The scientific pretext, which is thin and I could not understand what they were brewing in those pools (not that it would be important).'No Time to Die' honorably concludes the Daniel Craig chapter of the Bond epic. It's not the best Bond I've ever seen, but it's above average. I look forward to the next reincarnation.",No Time to Die
22,ThomasDrufke,Final Ascent,10,22 October 2021,"There's never been a more emotionally impactful Bond film and likely, there never will be again. No Time to Die doesn't have the best villain of the series, nor the best ""Bond girl"", nor the best action set piece, but it DOES have the most emotionally resonant story. This film does things with the Bond lore that I never thought would be tackled and it was beyond thrilling. Daniel Craig deserved one final bow as James Bond and he got that and more. I can't believe I'm saying this but after a few weeks of sitting on it, No Time to Die is my favorite Bond film of all time, and it's undeniably one of the best.10/10.",No Time to Die

They could have shaved 30 minutes off and its aim would have been more precise. I absolutely loved Ana de Armas as Paloma, though, and wish we could have seen more of her character. Without getting into spoilers, there's a finality to this film that feels somewhat out of place in the Bond franchise, but I understand why the filmmakers did it. I still feel like Spectre would have been a fitting farewell for Daniel Craig.",No Time to Die

Works better as a soap opera featuring characters based on the Bond films than as a Bond film itself. Yes, that is faint praise. And the predictive programming about deadly nanobots will keep historians of the future busy for many decades to come.",No Time to Die
25,tabuno,Average for a Bond Movie,7,30 October 2021,"Daniel Craig's last movie as James Bond. When this movie's theme song does not have the same ""pop"" as two of the abbreviated theme songs used in No Time To Die from previous James Bond movies it does not bode well. Along with the unusual use of an extensive listing of credits in the opening credits, this Bond started off on a strange note. One of the most haunting James Bond songs used occurred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service titled ""We Have All The Time In The World"" by Louis Armstrong one of the greatest of Jazz players ever and has emotional and content relevance to this movie. No Time To Die to have had a chance to become a classic Bond Movie required a Part I and a Part II like this year's Dune (2021). Unfortunately the relational set up for Bond in this movie was way to brief to be effective and required too much mental effort to really enjoy the beginning of the movie to understand what was going on. This movie also included an explosion which did not kill for obvious but incredible reasons, a car that had more weapon-power than the multitude of munitions used on to blast away the car. The attempts at light-hearted jokes fell flat and out of character for the tone of this Bond movie. The Blofeld and Bond scene was a pale version of the amazing stark clash of mental titans in Manhunter (1986) with William Peterson (of CSI fame) and Brian Cox (as Hannibal Lecktor). The early introduction of a British operative will ""little"" training and an attempt at cuteness did not sit well with the actual amazing assault scenes she put on. Additionally the inclusion of a new 00 agent was also underdeveloped and did not get to show off much of her abilities as many earlier Bond movies. Even the sinister antagonist while strong, missed the opportunity to develop a much more complex and compelling character that could have been even more deliciously sympathetic to the audience. In summary, No Time To Die while it had potential came off relatively average for the franchise and not the best way to leave Daniel Craig with his last movie as has been previously announced.",No Time to Die

Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Léa Seydoux's who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek's who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes' who played as M.

28,cruise01,"Triumphant Bond film with exciting action, direction, and Daniel Craig nails it with a high note.",10,10 October 2021,"(5 out of 5 Stars).No Time to Die is an awesome 25th Bond film and one of the best in the series which I would say is triumphant. It is Daniel Craigs fifth and final bond film and the story does give a proper emotional conclusion to his character story arc. I have loved every one of Daniel Craigs Bond movies. Spectre was a slight weaker. No Time to Die is awesome from story, action sequences, casting, and sharp moving direction that takes the series in a different direction which has yet to travel before.The story is awesome and epic. It follows a more retired 007 Bond (Daniel Craig). When the world is at stake again when Safin (Rami Malek) and his paramilitary group are stealing a bioweapon and weaponizing it for their evil plan. Bond is recruited by his old friend Felix (Jeffrey Wright) and having to team up with a new 007 Nomi (Lashana Lynch) to help save the world yet again.It is best to avoid spoilers to where the story goes. And the surprises is best seen on screen than reading it. James Bond does go on a more emotional journey. With past secrets from the people he loves coming out.The film does have a lot of fantastic action sequences that are exciting and breathtaking. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga did a great job in handling the action scenes. Car chases, shoot outs, and fight scenes are well done. The opening sequence takes a different direction from any other Bond movies. It is one of the longest sequence that shows a dark eerie tone of a characters past and introduction to the villain. And than flashing towards the present with Bond and Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) on a getaway in Italy. Only moments later, the past catches up to them. Putting them in a thrilling car chase.There is a lot of exciting action and chases. Bond coming across Paloma (Ana de Armas) was a fun fight sequence with her. And Lashana Lynch is a fun new addition as 007. Rami Malek is a great menacing and tormenting villain with an evil agenda plan towards the world.The cast ensemble is great. Daniel Craig will forever be the best bond ever. It was a fitting end with this movie that does take for an emotional journey and a well deserved ending. Lea Seydoux was great playing his love interest. Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, and Ralph Fiennes all did great.The direction is different for a bond film but great in an exciting new chapter. It is dark and emotional. And action packed throughout. For a run time that is almost three hours, the film felt short and fast paced. Billie Eilish bond theme song in the credit sequence was great and dark and eerie. It worked with the tone of the film. A great new addition is the music score by Hans Zimmer that amped up the Bonds music score. Even has a tiny reference to Majesty Secret Service film.No Time To Die is one of the best films of the year. And best bond films that takes the franchise in a different and dark direction.

29,zkonedog,The Best Since Casino Royale--But Still Not Saying Much,6,13 October 2021,"It is clear right from the beginning that ""No Time to Die"" has a plan. That alone makes it better than half the Bond films ever made. Unfortunately, despite being fairly entertaining overall, Daniel Craig's swan song in the role is filled with lofty ideals undercut by horrible execution.For a very basic overview, ""No Time to Die"" sees Bond (Craig) seemingly enjoying a post-007 life with Madeline Swan (Lea Seydoux). Of course, as so often happens, things go awry and the lovers are pulled back into the espionage game, largely courteous of the enigmatic Lyutsifer Safin (Remi Malek) and a viral terrorism scheme.I'll begin with what this movie does well, as it does possess some redeeming qualities for sure:-Craig remains a great Bond. That hasn't changed since we first saw him in 2006.-Ana de Armas is one of the best ""Bond girls"" (to use that phrase loosely) in the history of the franchise. Her character is a shot in the arm midway through the film.-Because this was Craig's confirmed last don of the tuxedo, director Cary Joji
Fukunaga was able to arc the plot lines to a resolute climax. Absolutely no indecision on that front.-In typical franchise fashion, it provides enough thrills and spectacle to be watchable. You won't be nodding off or anything like that. Truth be told, while walking out of the theater this was more of a 7-star effort.After some further cogitation, however, it is fairly obvious that ""No Time To Die"" suffers from some pretty serious faults, all centered upon this premise: great ideas, horrible execution of them.Some examples:-The opening villain scene? Tremendous--one of the best Bond opens ever. The villain is then hardly referenced at all for close to an hour (if not longer).-Having James Bond fall in love with a woman instead of objectifying/using one is interesting--but not enough time is spent on that topic and I'm not sure if Seydoux (or her character writing) is up to that dramatic task.-Teasing a black, female 00 agent? Again, could have been something really meaningful but instead used only as a wink-and-nod to the camera.-Bond--the most famous big screen womanizer of all-time--as a girl Dad? Very intriguing--so of course utterly ruined by the filmmakers initially telling viewers point-blank ""she isn't Bond's daughter"", and then at the end saying ""oh yeah--she actually was Bond's daughter all along"". Embarrassingly plotted in that sense.-As previously mentioned, de Armas was the best part of this film (at least for me). The epitome of incredible beauty but also precipitating the best action sequence in all of ""No Time to Die"". Predictably, following the pattern here, she appears for maybe 15-20 minutes and is never seen again. Head-scratching.For a film that clocks in at a bloated two hours and 40 minutes, it is a little hard to believe that all the above great concepts were still given short shrift. But that is exactly what happens in ""No Time to Die"". It spends all its time introducing these little nuggets, but none actually following through on them in a compelling way.So, while it was certainly nice to have a big movie spectacle back in theaters as the world claws out of a pandemic, those are the circumstances for which I'll likely remember ""No Time to Die"". It certainly won't be for its tight plots or well-developed characters.",No Time to Die
30,pmtelefon,Who's the audience for this movie?,4,16 October 2021,"Producers will blame the poor box office of ""No Time to Die"" on COVID but that's not why it's bombing. The movie is failing because there is no audience for it. It certainly wasn't made for fans of the Bond films (like me). The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn't that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn't a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn't have even noticed the jokes. It's also about twenty minutes too long. ""No Time to Die"" bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig's not-so-hot tenure as James Bond.",No Time to Die
31,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Blockbuster Entertainer! This Action-filled extravaganza gives a grand farewell to Daniel Craig's Bond Series.,7,1 October 2021,"No Time To Die (2021) :
Movie Review -When it comes to spy-films you already know how some things are gonna turn. Sometimes you even know about it before watching the film that it is gonna be send-off or some other kind of event as stated by the team or media. Whether it is Mission Impossible series or James Bond series (Daniel Craig's), some things are bound to look predictable or rather just say that the filmmaker want them to look so because that's what die hard fans love watching. For some people it becomes too mainstream and that's exactly what has happened with this film. The love factor, husband-wife bond, daughter/son and then hero who plays a father and a Husband sacrifices his life etc. These all things are too mainstream now and if you believe so then you and me have something in common. Rest, die hard fans will find it overwhelming naturally but that's because they don't know that these formulas were born in 40s and 50a decade in Hollywood. Nevertheless, excluding that corny side of the narrative No Time To Die offers a blockbuster entertainer with superb high-tech action extravaganza.Bond has left active service and his wife Madeline and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA turns up asking for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. There is new OO7 to give us that jealous vibes but only for a short time and then we get our main OO7 back even though 'It is just a number'. Like i said, the same husband-wife and Father-daughter formula spoils the engagement here but thankfully it goes well by the end when you see it is being crafted into emotional send-off.Daniel Craig as Bond is very specific about his style this time. He looked little aged but he suits the attitude of the iconic character because it is a tailor-made thing for him. Rami Malek could have made a terrific villain but he is too mild here and completely wasted. In female toles, Léa Seydoux and Lashana Lynch are top performers while rest of the cast is extremely supportive in their own manners. No Time To Die starts-off with a pacy and explosive mode and you don't even check at your watch for an hour. Then, slow section in the second half makes it look little longer than expected but fortunately does not bore you.All the action sequences in the film are pleasant sights to eyes. The entire team has done a fabulous job and what a breathtaking high-tech action it presents.. Simply Outstanding! Watch out for the chase sequence in the beginning only that will immediately glue you to your seats. The screenplay drags a little in the middle but otherwise fine. Dialogues aren't that conversational but fairly decent. Background score is chilling. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga has given a complete package, in which, viewers with different demands will find what they are seeking. That's quite a job you know. Overall, a grand-style farewell to one of the most iconic character of modern action cinema and every James Bond Fan is gonna love it.RATING - 7/10*",No Time to Die
32,imseeg,BEWARE: the jokes are gone! No actor's chemistry either. No great villain either. Lasts too long. And worst of all it is kinda boring to watch.,5,1 October 2021,"BEWARE: this director only has made 2 lovey dovey, sentimental arthouse movies beforehand. Those movies were quite good actually, but somehow this director destroyed all the classic Bond vibes:1
The jokes are gone. What is a Bond film without some funny oneliners? NOTHING.2
There is NO villain to speak of. What is a Bond film without a great, mean villain? NOTHING.3
The Bond girl is pathetic. No actor's chemistry whatsoever. And the few great supporting actors have too little screentime to make an impression. What is a Bond film without a smashing Bond girl? NOTHING.4
It lasts too long. Bond movies tend to be about 2 hours, but this edition is stretching the length to 2 hours and 45 minutes! It becomes tedious to watch in the middle. What is a Bond film without excitement and a fast paced story? NOTHING.5
James Bond has become a girly picture. Everybody is complaining about that. James Bond used to be butch and mischievous and a womanizer. Now James Bond has become a girl...",No Time to Die
33,southdavid,"Shaken, rarely stirred.",7,6 October 2021,"Having revisited the previous Daniel Craig Bond films in preparation, we went to the Cinema to see ""No Time to Die"" last weekend. I found the film to be reasonably good, and I liked the tone, which felt like it was a genuine ending for many of the characters, but I did feel the extended run time, especially in the middle section of the film.Unable to trust Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) James Bond (Daniel Craig) ends their relationship following an attack by SPECTRE. Several years later, a retired Bond is asked to help locate a missing scientist by his old friend Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The investigation puts him at odds with MI6 and specifically their new 007 (Lashana Lynch) but Bond's ties to this mission run much deeper than he could have foreseen.I liked the performances in ""No Time to Die"". Daniel Craig's tiredness with the role reflects well with an aging Bond seemingly relatively settled into (yet another) retirement before being pulled back in for one last job. I get that some people don't enjoy the ""moodiness"" of Lea Seydoux's Madeline, but it's fitting for a relatively sad life, that's been integrated with murder since childhood. The two new agents are a lot of fun and particularly Ana De Armas' Paloma is an all too short burst of life in the film. The practical driving effects are really well done, and they seem to be the majority of the stunt work in this one, perhaps to reflect the damage the role has done to it's lead.But as I say, I could feel the length of the film particularly in the middle, where the action sags. Rami Malik proves another dull, polite, reasonable villain for the franchise and I never really got to grips with why he wanted to go further, once he achieves his entirely reasonable goal. (Trying to keep that as spoiler free as I can).I like the melancholy sense that pervades the film, that the end is nigh for all these characters and that the hard reboot is coming and though it has its moments, it's not a film I can see me revisiting again too often.",No Time to Die
34,paul-allaer,The end of an era (on many levels),7,11 October 2021,"""No Time To Die"" (2021 release; 162 min.) is the 25th release in the long-running James Bond franchise. As the movie opens, young Madeleine watches in horror as an assassin murders her mother. In a clever montage, young Madeleine morphs into today's Madeleine as Bond's, James Bond's, girlfriend. They are in Italy where Bond visits the grave of Vesper Lynd, but before we know it, someone is out to kill Bond. Mayhem ensues... At this point we are 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the 25th James Bond movie seemed snake-bitten from the start. The movie started developing in early 2016, yes almost 6 years ago. Creative differences led to the departure of the original director and then the original screenwriters, and for good measure eventually also the original soundtrack composer. Once filming started, there were more delays due to Craig Daniel's injury. Then when the movie was FINALLY completed and readied for release (in April, 2020), a little thing called COVID-19 brought the entire film industry onto it knees. Now 18 months later the movie is finally released. Would anyone still care? Well, I did. Was it worth the wait? It was, sorta. The good things: as we've known for years, this is Daniel Craig's swan song as 007 and he relishes his last stab at it, with fervor and dogged determination. Bond will not be denied! The production, locations and photography are first class, per the usual. (The scenes in Matera, Italy now make me to want to go visit this town and see it for myself.) Léa Seydoux reprises her role from Spectre and does quite well again. As for the not so good: the movie is at least 20 min too long for its own good (at almost 2hrs. 45 min. It is by far the longest Bond film ever). The plot is byzantine yet the evil that threatens the world is surprisingly simple. Rami Malek is one of the lamest/tamest ""bad guys"" ever in Bond history. Where the Bond franchise goes from here (if anywhere at all), truly nobody knows. If on the other hand this is it for James Bond, then this was a worthy last stand. Far from perfect, ""No Time To Die"" is nevertheless an entertaining and worthy addition to the Bond franchise.""No Time To Die"" opened in theaters this weekend after a 1 1/2 yr delay. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I'm guessing about 50 people--in a theater that seats about 2 or 3 times that many). Indeed, the box office weekend gross was only $56 million, far below expectations. Given the production cost of ""No Time To Die"" (a reported $250-300 mill, add to that the advertising budget), and one must wonder if a movie of this magnitude is still possible. One thing is clear: the viewing habits of audiences have changed dramatically since COVID-19, and possibly or even likely, will never return to what they were pre-COVID. It all feels like the end of an era, to be honest. All that aside, if you are a James Bond fan, I encourage you to check it out, hopefully in the theater (for the maximum viewing experience), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",No Time to Die
35,subxerogravity,Fun movie! Going back to the old school Bond?,8,8 October 2021,"The thing about Daniel Craig's version of Bond is that it tells an origin story about how James Bond became 007, and they did this in a really serious manner that coincided with the success of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy that meshed up being real and being dark, but as Craig started to become more and more the Bond, we all know, the serious tone began to chip away a little. This was actually good for Craig because he got to show a lot more personality as his Bond movies moved on.Spectre for me was the completion of Craig's Bond. You did not have to go any further than this. Not to say that No Time to Die is not a great movie and should not have been made but it was a huge risk because Spectre was when Craig fully became Bond in my book.Though No Time To Die, as it turns out was not just an episode in the Bond series, it would mean far more than that, for the most part it took Bond even further back to his grass roots than Skyfall.More gadgets than in any other Craig led bond or rather the gadgets went back to that extreme we remember in the old days with an Aston Martian that projected spike balls and had machine gun headlights. In the Casino Royale days it was more important to make the gadgets as real as possible, but I feel like we actually live in a world where technology is to the point where we can believe easily that a dude can have an eye similar to Steve Austin's in the Six-million-dollar man.Speaking of which, No Time to Die has an evil henchman that goes up there with characters like Jaws, Odd Job and Nic Nac. I did love Dave Bautista in Spectre but his Bond Villain was still on a real serious tone while the dude they got up in here is a little more playful a character. I will say that Rami Malek as the main villain could have used far more screen time.I think Lea Seydoux is the first bond girl to return and make another movie officially, so that's history. It's also saying something about the type of Bond Craig has always been over the other Bonds, starting with Casino Royale. I will say that Ana De Armas may have redefined a Bond girl as they are saying, but she's no Michelle Yeoh. In no fault of her own because she did good...with the very little amount of time they gave her, but she did make every moment count.What truly hope they intent on trying to keep was the new 007, Nomi. Now when it comes to Bond...Women, that was different and cool to watch.Last I wanted to note Billie Eilish being selected to sing the Bond theme song was such a cliché on pop culture. I'm not trying to insult someone who I never listened to but I found it fascinating that the moment I heard the song I knew it was Eilish without even hearing her sing ever.Overall, if this is going to be Craig's last time behind the Bond wheel he did go out at top speed. It's a good movie.",No Time to Die
36,jtindahouse,A game-changing film that is almost impossible to fault,10,10 October 2021,"Wow! I can see why the filmmakers were adamant this film be released at a time when the most people possible would be able to see it in theatres. It's a damn masterpiece. I actually wasn't ready for how good this film was. It caught me off guard in the best way possible.The first thing you'll notice when watching this movie is that it's not afraid to break the rules. Everything that you love about Bond films is present, but at the same time a lot of things are just a little bit different. The opening scene to this film is absolutely incredible, but it breaks Bond tradition. I loved that. It gives a sense of uniqueness while also ensuring the die-hard traditionalists won't be disappointed.The cast were incredible. Rami Malek nailed it as 'Safin' exactly like I knew he would. He was born to be a Bond villain. Ana de Armas was terrific in the little time we actually got with her. I didn't realise it was going to be such a small role and kept hoping she would come back. She nailed it and looked like she had so much fun doing it. Give her a spin-off I say.Finally, Daniel Craig. What an amazing ride it has been with him as James Bond. He was born to play the role. He may not have loved every minute of the journey but it never once effected his on-screen performance. He will be missed but his legacy as Bond will live on forever I suspect.The film is nearing three hours long, however the credits are rolling before you know it. The pacing is insanely good. The film never stops. I also loved how easy it was to follow. Sometimes I find Bond films get a little too complex in their plots and it can take away from the enjoyment. That was never the case here. I knew exactly where we were and why we were there at all times.I can't say enough good things about this film. If you are on the fence about seeing it, thinking perhaps that it will just be another run of the mill Bond film, I would implore you to see it. It is a game-changer. 10/10.",No Time to Die

The story is about James Bond is called out of retirement, when a mysterious villain(Rami Malek) steals a mysterious device that is a danger to the world.I always liked Daniel Craig has James Bond, he always played Bond more human than just a action hero, and he shows it more in this film. Rami Malek really chews up the scene when ever he's on camera, I think he's a great villain. Action scenes are great, so does the supporting cast, let's not forget Ana De Armas.",No Time to Die

It's been 5 years since Daniel retired as a 00 agent-and the end of the last movie-when Jeffrey, his old C. I. A. Buddy Felix Leiter, shows up needing his help. A new bad guy, Rami, is wanting to unleash a biochemical weapon that targets a person by their DNA and Daniel is the only one that can stop him. Daniel meets his replacement, Lashana, that is using his old designation 007-it's just a number, remember-and Lea plays his love interest during his retirement. Lea & Rami also have a connection. As is the case, people have their secrets and Daniel has his work cut out for him on who he can trust and it's not long before bad guys start popping up on motorcycles and fast cars, trying to kill Daniel. There are surprise deaths-both good guys & bad guys-and a surprise ending that has never been done before in a James Bond movie-and believe me, I've seen them all. If you listen to the soundtrack closely, you will hear a familiar song from a previous Bond movie-On Her Majesty's Secret Service-and of course, the usual notice is after the end credits, 'James Bond Will Return'. It just won't be with Daniel Craig.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 43 minutes.I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",No Time to Die

40,alindsay-al,A Great Satisfying end to Craig's time as Bond,8,2 October 2021,"After 4 films and 15 years we are finally at the end of Daniel Craig's run as James Bond with No Time To Die and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Bond attempting to start a new life with Madeleine when he is dragged back into the fray.Main Character
Daniel Craig has been James Bond for so long and you can tell he really wanted to go out on a high and he does a fantastic job here. He really gives it his all and manages to combine the charisma and grit that has defined his time as the character, this might even be his best performance in the role. The character goes through a lot in this film and you see just how much he has progressed since Casino Royale and real credit has to go to Craig for that.Supporting Characters
I admitted that I wasn't a huge fan of Lea Seydoux's character of Madeleine in Spectre but I thought she did a much better job here. I actually bought the chemistry between her and Craig and the whole romance option was much improved and it actually provided a lot of great dramatic moments. Lashana Lynch plays a new 00 here and she is also great, I really liked her competition with Bond and how her character shows how the world has changed even since the Craig films started. Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, Ben Whishaw and Jeffery Wright reprise there roles from previous films and they are all great and actually get some decent screen time and plenty to do. I also just wanted to give a shoutout to Ana De Armas, she is barely in the film but she gives a really great performance and is so fun and likeable, it is just a shame there wasn't more of her here. Rami Malek plays the villain here and you can tell he is clearly trying, but the character is so poorly written that it gives him no chance, at the end his acting isn't the issue but this is a weak villain for sure.Story
The film delivers a really good and personal story for James Bond and the characters that are around him. It feels like a big deal and the chemistry between the characters is what drives it through and things are just improved from some of the other films. But the issue is that there is just too much here and some doesn't make much sense, take the bad guys plan, it makes zero sense and it makes it hard to care about that element of the film. The story could have been tightened up and shortened the run time which would have benefitted the overall film.Script
The script is great, there is some real drama here that adds real depth to the characters and there individual stories. But the playfulness and slight bits of humour are there too and it really builds this great script that will keep you invested in this really long film.Style
The action scenes are great, they have been the biggest strength of Craig's time in the role and they are once again great with the stakes being really high and the stunts really delivering. But the biggest issue in the film is the length, its nearly 3 hours long and it really doesn't need to be, if the plot had been more cohesive you could have shaved plenty of time off of the film.Overall
Overall, No Time To Die is a great film that ends Craig's time in the role in a satisfying and enjoyable way that is a good time in the cinema.",No Time to Die
41,Chris_Docker,Licensed to make-over,7,3 October 2021,"This is a well-made if formulaic continuation of a franchise - one that cannot afford a disaster. It has all the elements of fast cars, exciting chases, a contemporary plot intended to strike terror, some attractive ladies and a nice sprinkling of hi-tech.Daniel Craig does an admirable job with the material given him - the ageing Bond pulled out of retirement - and although it just about covers his physical appearance it falls short elsewhere. What it doesn't have is the original character of Bond as created by Ian Fleming. Bond in his retirement, it seems, has suffered a woke makeover.",No Time to Die

This is certainly better than Quantum of Solace and Spectre and up there with Skyfall and Casino Royale in terms of quality. This one shows the usual tough Bond, but this time with a tad more gentleness and romance and much more a creature of this century.There is good support all around as usual with a particularly enjoyable turn by Ana de Armas as a effervescent young CIA agent and Lashana Lynch as the OO agent who covered for Bond in his absence.On the slightly negative side, Rami Malek as the main villain is a bit weird and not totally convincing and it does drag slightly in the 2nd act. These are though minor quibbles in a strong and enjoyable thriller which in many ways is less Bond-like than many before it. It is great fun and not to be missed.",No Time to Die

45,kluseba,An appropriate conclusion to Daniel Craig's era,9,14 October 2021,"No Time to Die is the twenty-fifth movie in the James Bond series created by Eon Productions. This is also the longest of these movies. It's the fifth and final movie with Daniel Craig and concludes the more emotional and personal sequence of films on a very high note.This film convinces on several levels. Without revealing too much, this movie brings the person James Bond to life more authentically than most other films except for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Casino Royale and Skyfall. The movie has a dramatic depth that might make quite a few viewers shed a few tears towards the end.The movie introduces several interesting side characters. Lashana Lynch convinces as new agent with cool, resilient and tough charisma. Ana de Armas has an impressive cameo as bubbly agent who seems nervous at first contact but focused when put in danger.The locations have been chosen with care before the madness of the pandemic occurred. The film moves from the snow-covered landscapes of Norway over isolated islands in the Pacific to heated soils of Italy. In this regard, the film certainly offers something for every taste.The plot is a spy thriller by the numbers which means that those who don't like the genre won't change their minds with this movie while genre enthusiasts get exactly what they could expect which is a relief in troubled times like these.There are few negative things to mention. Even though Rami Malek is doing a decent job at portraying a tormented villain, his character could have benefitted from some additional background information and further scenes.Another thing that hasn't impacted the rating but that needs to be pointed out is that the release strategy of this movie has been absolutely dreadful which cannot just be excused by the pandemic. It's great that a movie that was so difficult to make turned out to be so amazing but it should have already been released more than two years ago as I'm writing these lines. I hope that the next entry in the series will come around much faster.At the end of the day, No Time to Die is in the top section of James Bond movies and a rewarding conclusion to the sequence of films starring Daniel Craig that have featured a more emotional, personal and vulnerable agent. The mixture of action, crime and drama is balanced, captivating and entertaining. So far, in a year that hasn't had many cinematic highlights, No Time to Die qualifies as the greatest movie of the year.",No Time to Die

47,drystyx,Little girl saves the film,7,21 October 2021,"Plot, Bond saves the world, and some people, notably a little girl instead of a damsel in distress, which actually makes this more interesting than the other Craig 007 films.My brother said he'd wait till it goes to TV, and he was right. Not that it was bad. Just that the big screen didn't really matter for this. You get just as much, probably more, on a small screen, and it could be that is what this director was going for, since everything about the scenery and sound fit better for TV than a big screen.There was some pretty good scenery, but the cinematography was poor. Even the rocky cliffs looked drab. And there were too many ""high rise"" and ""street"" and ""bar"" and ""office"" and ""home"" and ""motor vehicle"" shots, the six most boring and least cinematographic sceneries possible.And the actors were horrible. Not so much in acting as in communicating. Not one could enunciate half his or her words. This needs to be seen on TV with subtitles, because there is no way to possibly understand more than a third of the lines being spoken.Yes, that's true. But you do catch the gist of it.It was the best of the Craig movies at 7/10, which is nothing to brag about, but at least it wasn't as depressing and full of ""hate the audience"" as Casino Royale, the movie made for the ""haters"" who love to torture their friends and families.What really saved this movie was the little girl. I don't recall a 007 film where the ""damsel in distress"" is instead a child. I'm sure he's saved children, but this time the child takes center stage, and it saves the movie from its terrible camera work and terrible cinematography.One thing this new director does well is tone down the usual Hitler worship of Purvis and Wade, who are toned down on their desire of killing as many dark haired women as possible. They still do it, but it's toned down. Purvis and Wade are not even close to being subtle about their Neo Nazi ideology. But that's what is published and produced by the mostly Nazi producers in Hollywood.There are some things to like. One weird thing is the woman who has second billing on imdb has about a ten minute stretch of nice action in the film, and then goes on her way. She's a Brazilian spy who becomes the eye candy of the film, and gives us a great leg show.The other women are mostly ""nice looking"". Bond's love interest, in fact, has a girl next door look, or looks like your cousin. It gives the sentiment that Bond isn't superficial, but down to Earth in family life.The new 007 girl is very good, and should make a good future 007 IMO, but it all depends on the script and the scenery.This one had a decent enough script, I guess, except who knows since you can't hear 2/3 of the lines.Sometimes, the actors and actresses speak them too fast. There's no excuse for that. Was the director rushing them through lines? No one can possibly interpret lines that fast.The action scenes are filmed too fast as well.What saves the film is the little girl. Saving the little girl makes it a breath of fresh air. But does he save her? Does he fail? You know better than that. 007 haven't gone that far to please the haters.",No Time to Die

Taking place five years after the events of Spectre, we find Craig has quit the Secret Service, broken off things w/Lea Seydoux (due to a belief she had betrayed him) but as the running time dictates, we know Craig will suit up one more time (accompanied humorously by Lashana Lynch who becomes the new 007 much to Craig's chagrin) to fight off a new foe, played by Oscar winner Rami Malek, who has his own axe to grind against Blofeld's (once again played by Christoph Waltz) horde (they killed his family years ago) & manages to decimate their ranks. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation/Sin Nombre), who I believe may be the first Yank to direct a Bond entry (remember when Pierce Brosnan wanted Quentin Tarantino to direct one & the Bond producers said no) w/his usual expert eye on composition & framing w/an ending which is wholly satisfying to Craig's arc throughout his reign (I wouldn't want to be in the planning room for where Bond goes next).

50,valleyjohn,The Best Bond Film Ever,10,2 October 2021,"Over the last two years I have watched every Bond film . Some for the first time but most were rewatches.Having now seen all 25 , I have come to some conclusions that not everyone will agree with .These are my thoughts.Connery as Bond and his films were overrated. I almost found them creepy and not in a good way . The worst Bond was George Lazenby yet On Her Majesty's Secret service is a great story.Roger Moore was a great Bond and his films were the most fun of any .Timothy Dalton didn't have the personality to pull of the role but his films weren't bad . The opposite is the case for Pierce Brosnan . He had the looks and the sophistication but the films were lousy . Then we come on to Daniel Craig . Without doubt in my mind , the best James Bond we have ever seen and he also features in the best 007 film ever made in Skyfall.That is until now...James Bond has left active service. His peace is short-lived when Felix Leiter, an old friend from the CIA, turns up asking for help, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.What a magnificent ending to the Daniel Craig era . This is a fantastic movie . Forget about it being a Bond film , it's the best film I've seen in 2021.It's nearly three hours long but it doesn't feel like it. The blend of action and dialogue is just about right and director , Cary Joji Fukunaga has produced the ultimate 007 film .It's hard to go into what happens because there really are some massive shocks in store but needless to say , this feels different to anything that has come before .The female characters are not just there to be sexual fodder for James , they are there to work alongside him in equal measure .All three Bond Girls ( can we even call
Them that anymore?) are great .Ana De Armas , Lea Seydoux and especially Lashana Lynch who brilliantly plays the other 00 .The story is nice and easy to follow and the ending will stay with me for a very long time .There are nods to On Her Majesty's Secret Service all the way through the film and when you see it , you will see why .Absolutely Fantastic.",No Time to Die

Léa Seydoux, Lashana Lynch, Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes and Jeffrey Wright are all great. Rami Malek is really good and Ana de Armas is also great in her small part.Cary Joji Fukunaga's direction is fantastic, it's beautifully filmed, extremely stylish and visually slick with amazing action scenes.

52,rgkarim,No Time To Waste Leaving Anything Unexplained: Fun Film Of The Bond Repertoire,8,8 October 2021,"LIKES:Great Opening:
Bond movies often start with action that is primarily meant to get you wrapped into the movie with big bangs. However, this Bond takes things differently and helps add to the story and continuation from the last film. The opening starts laying down the framework quite well, alongside some foreshadowing, and adds the personal character quality Bond films sometimes lack. Throw in the artistic Bond songs that Craig's legacy is accompanied by and it's a promising start to the film.Emotional/Character Driven:
Craig's movies have held a lot more personal connections with his Bond than others I have seen (though I have many to still watch), and this film was certainly a lot more charged on character development. The alliances, friendships, and rivalries go rather deep in the film and seeing them tested added more layers past the usual sleeping/shooting/spying elements that Bond is famous for displaying. Though a little overdramatic at times, this extension of character was nice to have in this movie and helped up some of the stakes in the movie, always a nice way to get engaged.The Costumes/Setting:
Bond is the international man of mystery and that often means exotic locations, interesting settings, and glorious costumes to bring the poise that Bond holds. No Time To Die continues the trend of immersing you in the spy business by taking us across the globe and getting a very small taste of the culture and beauty. Some of these settings are breathtaking venues, outside in the natural splendor of the countryside and towns. Others, are your typical strongholds for the Bond villain, the battlegrounds for spy vs. Terrorist to match wits and bravado. They all felt very Bond to me, and once populated with the extras, only further helped immerse us into the high class world of Bond. The dresses and tuxes were stunning as ever when they emerged, and seeing some of the cool spyware to decorate Bond's action suit were always fun to relive in seeing what the creative minds crafted this time.The Action:
This Bond is not the most action packed of the Craig films, but when the action does come up, it is quite satisfying at times. There are at least two battles from this movie that stick in my mind, both getting the blood pumping with the choreography designed. One is an awesome display of Bond's skills vs. The lackeys of the bad guy and the impressive gun toting the license to kill brings with it. My favorite one though, is the second battle of the film, which held a lot of spectacle, plenty of character involvement, and even some comedy twisted into the mix. Bond does not elevate the action too far past the limits of the spy game and keeps it familiar with the physics of the world, which should please many. It's spaced out decently as well to keep things interesting as well, with little interruption in the plot or character development, which is an extra victory for me.The Acting:
The strongest aspect of the movie for me, the acting is fantastically smooth as the shifting into gears Bond seems to have with driving his cars. Craig's portrayal of the spy is amazing as always, with the look, attitude, and bravado needed to take on the world. In this film, the emotional side of him comes out a little more, and much like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, he does a nice job of bringing those emotions out without treading too far into one dimensional portrayal. His performance was believable, he seemed to blend well with all the characters and had a natural chemistry with each person he interacted with. As for Ana De Armas, the knockout look of a Bond girl was amazing on her, and the dress she wore complimented her beauty in a natural way. Yet, the woman has got some incredible moves and the attitude of an agent, with great action sequences that show promise for her in future roles. But her comedy style works very well int his movie, edging into the role very calmly and amplifying a role I wanted to see more of, but thoroughly enjoyed the time I got with her. As for Malek, the man continues to flex his acting muscles and hit the villain role decently well. Malek's approach worked for this Bond villain, an uncomfortable edge that was one part horrifying and one party mastermind to push the events of the movie along. His monologues are executed with theater like quality, and he seems to be living the words that he is testing Bond's mind with and I loved the nonverbal acting he used to support it. Lea Seydoux hit the lead Bond girl role super well, a combination of brains, character moments, and beauty that really painted a wonderful character to share the story with. Everyone else did a great job, but I need to move on to the rest of the reviews.DISLIKES:
A Little More Action:
I won't lie, I would have liked a few more action scenes like what I got in the second fight, with coordination and intensity that had me on the edge of my seat. Sadly, some of the other bouts are short lived fights on wheels that have some impressive stunts, but get a little carbon copy for my tastes for necessary action. Even the last part of the movie needed some extra flair for me, primarily in using other characters in the mission then just Bond alone.More use of Paloma and The Other Agent:
One of the biggest things I wanted was for use of the other characters past talking roles, or at least involving them in more scenes throughout the movie. The thing about No Time To Die, is that several characters felt underutilized for me and had so much to offer. Ana De Armas is one of those characters, whose talents and mystery could have really helped the rest of the movie in pacing, comedy, and maybe a few different aids to assist with finding clues to the mystery. Lashana Lynch as Naomi, was also needed more for me, especially when I got to see the rivalry between James and her. She's got a set of moves of her own as well, and I can't lie and say I would have liked to see her get her hands dirtier as well and show off the gadgets and guns that the agency gave her.A Lot Of Stories Crammed Into One:
As I said earlier, the current Bond's story is a lot thicker than the other tales I've seen in my Bond viewings. I've enjoyed the deeper tale, mystery and connections to him and each chapter has managed to add a fitting piece of the puzzle to help elaborate more to the history of England's finest. However, in this film, a lot of those elements were getting put back in, attempting to answer the lingering questions and push the character development for the agent. I'd say they did a nice job on some of the plot elements, but others felt a little forced in, side paths that offered some clues to the overall mission that made them needed, but not up to the same skills as other elements were. A novelization of this movie might better explore those concepts, but from a strict movie standard, the multitude of ideas feels a little too much to address all avenues to the full extent they needed. I can't say more without spoilers, so I'm moving on to my biggest dislike of the movie... the villains.The Villains:
Rami Malek is so good in his performance and delivered big time on the role of the egotistical villain who was lost in his own views of the world. However, he's also the villain whose direction was not my favorite compared to some of the others we've seen in this branch. Unlike the mysterious man behind the mask approach I thought we were going to get, Safin's role is primarily monologues and that awkward way of phrasing that gets under your skin. Yet unlike villains like Jaws, Goldfinger, or even Mr. White, he does not offer more than that and it makes for a somewhat boring villain give again the potential he held from the beginning. My preference of Bond villains, are those that hold those factors that stand out, or are a true threat to not be crossed lightly or you pay the consequences. Sure there are minions as well, but even these guys feel a bit wasted, simplistic, and forgettable in the long line of Bond henchmen. Fortunately, the story elements merge well with this style of villain to assist with the lackluster antagonists, but given the earlier part of the franchise, I'd expected more for Malek's caliber of acting to raise up.The VERDICT:
Of the five bond films in this actor's repertoire, No Time To Die is probably the middle of the films for this reviewer. It's a good movie for me, filled with some form fitting action, fantastic look and Bond feels, and characters that have a lot more layers than previous incarnations I have seen. Acting wise it is solid and drama wise, it works super well with touching on the story element of her majesty's most lethal weapon. However, this installment still does not quite hit all the boxes of Bond quality that others have, primarily due to how much is trying to be integrated into this final film. Small things like the predictability of the story or limited gadgets/Bond mode guns are a tad limiting, but it primarily has to do with the story and character usage for me in this film. My favorite characters with blended comedy, action, and acting are sort of sidelined, and the villains are not the most impressive compared to the champions of the MI-6 legacy. In addition, the story both works and is a bit busier than I had hoped, almost needing more time to adequately finish those moments they touched on. Still given special effects, pacing, and story, this reviewer encourages a theater watch for No Time To Die and certainly adding to this to the library later down the road.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Thriller: 7.5 - 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",No Time to Die
53,rannynm,"Danger, Romance, Sadness, Humor And A Lot Of Action And Violence, But Most Importantly, It Shocks The Audience By Revealing A Secret",10,9 October 2021,"No Time to Die certainly kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire two hours and forty three minutes. This movie has a combination of danger, romance, sadness, humor and a lot of action and violence, but most importantly, it shocks the audience by revealing a secret hidden from James Bond.No Time to Die is about agent 007, James Bond (Daniel Craig) who, after a peaceful five years of retirement, comes back to complete a mission, rescuing a Russian scientist who created a powerful weapon out of DNA. During Bond's mission rescuing this scientist, he finds out his number 007 has been assigned to another agent, a woman. He also finds out his wife's secrets and he meets Safin (Rami Malek), a villain who uses the Russian scientist to create dangerous technology. My favorite part is when the female 007, Nomi (Lashana Lynch) tries to compete with Bond on the rescue mission.This film has a lot of dangerous action. The majority of the scenes include explosives that will make the audience jump out of their seats. The stunts are amazing. The wardrobe is very classy and elegant. The female roles are very important in this movie. Bond's wife is Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) who, at a young age had to fire a gun in order to protect herself. Paloma (Ana de Armas) is a Cuban agent who helped Bond with his mission. Nomi is very proud of her number 007 and does not want to give it back to Bond. Watching these women in action is amusing as well.The moral of this film is to trust the ones you love. James Bond didn't trust his wife and he lost five years of his life without her that he can never recover ever again. Be forewarned that this movie has a lot of gory scenes and violence, but it does have a PG-13 rating.I give No Time To Die 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 and 18, plus adults.

54,Kingslaay,Shocking,6,9 October 2021,"I am huge Bond fan so eagerly awaited the release of No Time to Die. The film starts off strong, the second half got a bit bloated and could have been shorter. I like how it wasn't the traditional Spectre vs MI6 but really a new villain who emerged because he was caught in the crossfire many years ago, nicely done. However my main issue here lies in the ending. As Sir Sean Connery once quipped in Goldfinger it was shocking, absolutely shocking.Daniel Craig has been a great Bond and we all knew he didn't want to do another film. We get it. But I feel an unspoken rule was broken when Bond was killed off. A number of people point out that this was a fitting end to Craig's era and it wrapped his films which had continuity. I would correct them by saying Bond in film has almost 60 years of continuity. Bond could have been killed a million times but he wasn't because it is essentially a legacy that is passed on to new generations. Craig is not bigger than Bond, no actor was. It is a great mantle that is passed on. Also Craig had an exceptional film in Skyfall but his other films were luke warm, as received by critics. So why is there a big push to wrap up his run? A bold director could have have reinvented the character again with a new actor. It's been done before.Some have pointed to the evolution of the character, again tied to Craig's films... He went from ruthless to giving his life away. I do appreciate adding complexity and changing things up but the question then is are we even watching a Bond film anymore? Bond has been alluring because of its escapism, intrigue and class for many years. I'm sure the actors and fans can list many elements that make it great. But this feels strange. I think the Director got confused about which series he was making. I am disappointed in Barbara Broccoli as well, I thought she respected the legacy of the franchise. I wonder what Cubby Broccoli would have thought.",No Time to Die
55,vengeance20,It's A Tough One,7,30 September 2021,"Well... I've just came back from seeing this long awaited Bond Film which should've been released 2 Years Ago, 1 Year Ago if you count the April 2020 release. But yeah, I finally got to see the 25th Bond Film & was both excited but skeptical due to the surrounding... should we say modern elements... which have been plaguing films since the last decade...The film follows Bond, who is forced out of retirement to deal with a villain who is armed with deadly new technology. He also, this time around, has more to lose.I found the film to be good mostly, but with a few things that annoyed me.1. Pacing & RuntimeThe films pacing & runtime were off, I knew prior to watching that the film would be long, but that didn't change the fact I would still object to it & find it a pain given I hate films with poor pacing & an overly long runtime. However, I did think there may be a slight chance that I wouldn't notice the runtime being long due to there being a great deal of action to distract me, but that wasn't the case.There were several scenes which could've been shorten down or left out as they didn't add to the story, felt out of place or just plain dumb & held the film up to the point where you just wanted the film to get to the point & move on. At 2 hours & 37 minutes it's way too long.2. The EndingNo spoilers, but the ending was a downer for me. I mean while action packed, as was the rest of the film, it simply didn't make sense & was a complete slap in the face to Bond Fans & Film Goers alike. It was a disappointment to say the least.The rest of the film however, was pretty good.1. ActionThe action was great Bond was great. The sequences featuring the deaths of villains were good & surprisingly gruesome (not SAW gruesome, but gruesome). The explosions were good as with the fight scenes2. CharactersThe characters were good, main & side characters. Surprisingly, the temporary replacement for Bond (in the film of course) was good too & didn't outwit or smother Bond as much as I thought she would. She was also a lot nicer than what the trailers portrayed. The villain was alright, but nothing special, he didn't exactly do anything for me, however though he did have a sense of creepiness about him which was a plus.3. Eye CandyWhile it's not common, there's plenty of it for us guys watching especially with the side character near the start of the film, she was hot.Overall, it's tough one. I had a feeling it wouldn't be as good as the previous Bonds (especially the Daniel Craig ones), & in a way, didn't expect, in terms of the modern treatments & how I would dislike it. I was right to dislike the pacing & runtime, but surprisingly found the film to be better than what I expected, but the ending I think is the biggest let down I think which goes against what Bond is & what he stands for.7/10.",No Time to Die

62,blott2319-1,A fitting farewell to this era of James Bond,9,18 October 2021,"As a lifelong James Bond fan it has been a struggle for me to fully accept the films in the Daniel Craig era as true 007 films. The big problem is that these movies break from the traditions of the franchise and seek to create a continuing saga that connects from one film to the next rather than allowing each movie to stand on their own. No Time to Die doubles down on this same idea, and even adds a heaping helping of nostalgic references to the past. I don't know if it has reached a point of Stockholm Syndrome, or it is just the solid film-making that went into this movie, but for some reason I loved it. There are still plenty of places where I found myself questioning the logic of this ongoing timeline, because there didn't used to be a question of ""what is canon?"" in the past, and now I am left to wonder why a picture of Bernard Lee adorns one of the walls of MI-6. Yet these little touches didn't frustrate me enough to sour the film-watching experience.I quite enjoyed the world-hopping adventure in No Time to Die. They did a great job of using all the beautiful locations, and creating a unique look and feel each time the characters were in a new region of the world. Along the way there are also a wonderful series of actors who impact the story, some that were established in prior movies, but let's discuss the ones that were brand new. Rami Malek was strange and off-putting in exactly the way you want a Bond villain to be. David Dencik was a quirky sidekick to the villainous plan, and I found him quite fun. Billy Magnussen had an enjoyable (but brief) role as the douchey new CIA agent working with Felix Leiter. But forget about any of them, because Ana de Armas is so marvelous that her brief appearance almost went beyond scene-stealing to movie-stealing. The only downside to her performance was that it highlighted how underwhelming Lashana Lynch was as Nomi. I wanted to love the alternate 007, but simply did not.The story of No Time to Die is a fitting conclusion for the Daniel Craig era. While this is the least that James Bond has ever acted like the character seen in the first 20 movies in the franchise, it is the culmination of how Daniel Craig has depicted the ultimate secret agent. This is one of the few times I have become emotional while watching a Bond film, and I appreciate any time I'm invested in a story arc enough to form that kind of connection. It's strange because what makes this version of Bond so uncommon is that he is relatable. Typically this is a hero that has been someone the fans admire (or dream of being,) but this movie grounds him enough that we can actually sympathize with his experiences, and I can appreciate that style of story-telling. While I completely understand how other die-hard fans of James Bond will struggle with a number of elements in this film, I was able to appreciate the new depth this gives to a character I love.The film-making in No Time to Die is excellent. I found that Cary Joji Fukunaga managed to find a balance between thrilling action sequences, and slower-paced drama. It all flowed quite nicely as well, so it never felt like they were shoving in a gunfight just to keep the audience from getting bored. I was so engrossed in the story that the long runtime never bothered me, although I wonder if I might notice some lags on rewatch. In true Bond-film tradition, the villain's plan in this movie is convoluted and ridiculous, but it plays quite well particularly in a world still dealing with a pandemic. There were plenty of fun moments that made me feel like cheering, and a decent amount of humor to break the tension when necessary. No Time to Die is currently my second-favorite Bond film from the 21st century. While I could easily come up with a multitude of nitpicks that keep it from being truly great, it did justice to this version of the character, and offered a proper goodbye for Daniel Craig.",No Time to Die

Bond here is as physically sound (i.e., unbelievable) as ever. For all his advanced gadgetry, his various escapes and exertions show him more of a Wiley Coyote than a warrior. They start with him surviving a direct hit from a bomb - and grow from there. There is much running and jumping and little standing still. And if no man is an island, it will take the obliteration of one to get him.Bond's enemy here is himself a cartoon figure, even in name: Lyutsifer Safin. A double-barrelled allusion himself, he's a warped/misspelled Lucifer Satan. With spellcheck neutralized, what hope Civilization? He makes the resurrected Lecter-like enemy Blofeld seem saintly.Bond enjoys a formal resurrection himself when the currently-designated 007 offers to restore his number. If Bond's wake turns woke with the possibility this black woman might take over the genre, she proves way less effective than the beautiful young white Paloma. Superman may have sired a gay superson but the Bond family business is likelier to pass to a white gal.And guess to whom? As the film opens on the burning of memories, it ends on the start of a story. Madeleine is telling her stoic infant daughter: ""Once upon a time there was a man. His name was Bond. James Bond."" This kid has survived a catastrophe even worse than the one her mother did. She bore up -personfully - herself. When Paloma outshines the 007-temp she may be clearing the way for James Bond's longtime lover's daughter. As Mom admits, the gal has James's eyes. Yathink....?",No Time to Die
64,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A fitting end to Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond.,9,30 October 2021,"Daniel Craig is my James Bond. I was too young for the Pierce Brosnan version of the secret agent, so when a re-do of Casino Royale (2006) came out, I was impressed that this decades-old franchise could take some cues from recent successful action films like The Bourne Identity (2002). Having seen a smattering of other Bond films over the years, the five-movie quintet that ended with No Time to Die (2021) felt bittersweet. Even if there were constant rumors that Daniel Craig was done with the role after Spectre (2015), I'm glad he stuck the landing with this movie.Now, I'm fairly biased when it comes to Bond films. I think Skyfall (2012) is the peak of the franchise. Not only did it cover Bond's backstory, but it also pulled a huge twist right at the end to connect it to every previous Bond film, which had me exclaiming in the theater. With this in mind, I appreciate how the five Daniel Craig Bond films have kept a sense of continuity between themselves and weren't just one-offs with ""Deus ex Machina"" results. What's great about this approach is how perfectly No Time to Die wraps up all the loose ends.I can also appreciate how No Time to Die subverted the standard tropes of Bond films. This ties directly to how all actions in this sub-series of the Bond franchise have consequences. I don't want to get into too many details so as to not spoil anything, but this movie showed that adapting to modern sensibilities would not be the end of the world. After all, a character like James Bond isn't the role model he once was in the misogynistic 1960s.A fitting end to Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond, I give No Time to Die 4.5 stars out of 5.",No Time to Die
65,dtucker86,We Have All The Time In The World,10,8 October 2021,"When I bought my ticket to see this film the owner of the theatre ""warned"" me that ""This is unlike any other James Bond film that you have ever seen!"" and he was certainly correct. I left the theatre after the two hour and forty five minutes of Daniel Craig's swan song as 007 in a state of near shock. ""I can't believe how it ended!"" I thought to myself. I believe that this really is the end of an almost sixty year franchise the longest in movie history. It really all began in 1953 in Jamaica when a former Naval officer and newspaper publisher named Ian Fleming wrote his first novel at the age of 47 because he was nervous about his upcoming wedding (just think of all we would have missed if he had stayed a bachelor!). Fleming debated about what to name his fictional hero and decided on James Bond because it was the author of a bird watching book! President John F. Kennedy was credited with helping to ignite ""Bond mania"" in the United States when he mentioned he enjoyed Fleming's novels (in fact From Russia With Love was the last movie he watched at the White House before going to Dallas). I don't know where to begin to describe how this is so different from a typical Bond film. First of all, Daniel Craig has aged so badly in the six years since Spectre. You can see the lines of weariness upon his ravaged face. In most of the Bond movies (especially the ones with Roger Moore) our favorite spy runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. However in this one Craig gives a tour de force performance giving the greatest acting job of any who have played Bond. This is the first 007 film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service over fifty years ago where Bond expresses true love for a woman. He shows grief, rage and love especially at the end when he says a special goodbye to. Madeleine before being blown to bits. Yes Bond is dead and there is a touching scene where M, Moneypenny, Tanner and Q drink a solemn toast to their fallen comrade's memory. For the record, I want to mention the quote that M uses about Bond, it is from the great author Jack London. It goes ""The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time."" There have been talks about who will take Craig's place as Bond, but there is no doubt that this franchise will never be the same this is truly the end of an era. Rest in peace James Bond.",No Time to Die
66,petra_ste,"No Mister Bond, I expect you to end",6,13 October 2021,"No Time To Die is visceral, well-crafted... but also overlong and self-indulgent. Craig is solid as usual (and gets more witty lines this time around) but the real star is director Fukunaga: this is one of the best-looking Bond movies ever in terms of atmosphere, shot composition, color palette, and so on.Gorgeous, adorable Ana de Armas continues her journey to super-stardom, here in the (sadly) tiny role of Bond girl Paloma, whose scenes have a sense of fun most of the film is lacking.In fact, I wish Bond had dumped weepy drama queen Madeleine for Paloma. No disrespect to Seydoux, who is fine, but her character exemplifies my pet peeve about Craig's Bond era: every element needs to be overly emotional, with a tragic backstory and a crucial impact on Bond. It seems Craig's Bond can't go to the bathroom without meeting the love of his life or making a life-changing decision. Just give me Connery shooting a bad guy with a pen gun and a cheesy one-liner.And YES, I've read the Fleming novels and I know the first, quip-delivering movie Bond was not an accurate representation either, but this is too far on the other end of the spectrum. It seems Craig's Bond can't have an ""ordinary"" mission and a casual relationship, everything has to come with three spoonfuls of drama. I'm almost thankful this era is over, so that I never have to see Bond soulfully ruminating over Vesper Lynd ever again. James, dude, we all have a crush on Eva Green, but enough is enough.My biggest problem with No Time To Die? It's bloated. My heart sank when, two hours into the movie, I realized we were still in the second act (which has to be the longest and slowest of any Bond film) and there were still 45 minutes to go. No Bond movie should have a running length nearly equal to The Thin Red Line.6/10.",No Time to Die

Bond is living a relaxed life in Jamaica, after having left active service. However, his old CIA ally Felix Leiter(Jeffrey Wright) asks for Bond's help on a new mission to save the world from a malevolent plot.No Time to Die is a mind-blowing film. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga has effortlessly taken over directing duties from previous director Sam Mendes. The ending is a little bit of a letdown but, overall it's a great swan song to Daniel Craig's James Bond era. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The 3D is effective only in a couple of scenes and overall unnecessary. The signature dry humor and puns that are staples of the Bond franchise, are there in plenty. The gorgeous locale are another highlight of the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is spectacular as James Bond. Craig is one of my all-time favourite Bonds and I'll certainly miss him. Rami Malek's performance as Lyutsifer Safin makes him the best Bond villain, in the entire franchise, in my opinion. Kudos to Malek's chilling and unforgettable portrayal. Lea Seydoux is outstanding as Madeline Swann. Lashana Lynch is amazing as Nomi. Naomie Harris is great as Moneypenny. Ben Whishaw is awesome as Q. Christoph Waltz is great as Blofeld. Ana de Armas is phenomenal as Paloma. Just wish she was given more screen time. Jeffrey Wright is excellent as Felix Leiter. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as M. The supporting cast is fantastic.

70,bob-the-movie-man,Premium Bond with Craig bowing out in emotional style.,10,10 October 2021,"Positives:
The script has all the trappings of Bond: exotic locations; great stunts; thrilling action sequences; and more gadgets on show than in recent times. Yet it's a real character piece too, delving far more into Bond's emotions. The story running through it with Madeleine is both deep and emotional: something we haven't seen since the Bond and Tracy romance in OHMSS. (And with Craig's acting, he manages to pull this off far better than George Lazenby ever could!).I found the finale to be magnificent, bold and surprising. We're back to the megalomaniac owning an island lair, à la Dr No. It even has its own submarine pen (a nod to Austin Power's ""Goldmember"" perhaps!?). For me, the production design harks back to the superbly over-the-top Ken Adams creations of the Connery years. There are no sharks with frickin' laser beams... but there could have been. (The set is a rather obvious redressing of the 007 stage at Pinewood, created of course for the tanker scenes in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". It even re-uses of the gantry level control room.)Craig is magnificent in his swan-song performance. There's a scene, during the extended pre-credits sequence, where he's sat in his bullet-ridden Aston just glowering for an extended period. I thought this was Craig's acting at its best. I thought this again in a dramatic showdown scene with Rami Malek. Malek is not given a huge amount to do in the film, But what he does he does wonderfully, particularly in that electrifying scene with Craig.The film has a great deal more female empowerment than any previous Bond, with the tell-tale signs (although this might be a sexist presumption) of Phoebe Waller-Bridge on the script. Newcomer Lashana Lynch acquits herself well as the first female 00-agent, getting not just kick-ass action sequences but also her fair share of quips. But stealing the show is Ana de Armas (reunited with Craig of course from ""Knives Out""). Her scenes in Cuba are brief but memorable, delivering a delicious mixture of action and comedy that makes you think ""cast HER as the next Bond""!The music by Hans Zimmer! It's a glorious soundtrack that pays deference not only to the action style of recent composers, like David Arnold and Thomas Newman, but particularly to the classic scores of John Barry. It actually incorporates not one but two classic themes from ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", directly into the film. I'm even starting to warm to the Billie Eilish theme song, although I think it's too similar in style to the Sam Smith offering from ""Spectre"".The cinematography from Linus Sandgren (who did ""La La Land"") is gorgeous: in turns colourful and vibrant for the Italian and Cuban scenes and cool and blue for the tense Norwegian action sequences.Negatives:
My main criticism is not of the film, but of the trailer(s). There are so many of the money shots from the film (particularly from the Matera-based action of the pre-title sequence) included in the trailers that I had an ""OK, move on, seen this"" attitude. Why did they have to spoil the movie so much? IT'S A NEW BOND... OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT. All you EVER needed for this is a 20-second teaser trailer. Just put white ""Bond is Back"" text on a black background and the Craig tunnel shot to the camera. Job done. It really infuriates me. B arbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson, PLEASE take note!At 163 minutes it's the longest Bond ever and a bit of a bladder tester. But, having said that, there are no more than a few minutes here and there that I would want to trim. To do more you'd need to cut out whole episodes, and leaving Ana de Armas on the cutting room floor would have been criminal. As the illustrious Mrs Movie Man commented, ""I wish they'd bring in the half time Intermission card like they used to do in the old days"". I agree. Everyone would have been a whole lot more comfortable and less fidgety.Summary Thoughts on ""No Time to Die"": Reading the comments on IMDB for the movie, I'm perplexed at the diatribe coming from supposed 'Bond fans' on this one. One-star review after one-star review (despite, I note, the overall film getting an overall 7.8/10 at the time of writing). In this regard, I class myself as very much a Bond fan. (My first film at the cinema was the release of ""Live and Let Die"" in 1973, but I then binge-watched all the other Bond films at the cinema: they used to do repeated double-features in those days). And I thought this was a fabulous Bond film. Full of drama, action, humour and deep-seated emotion. Couldn't be better for me, and certainly on a par with ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" for me as my favourite Craig outings.As the end of the end credits said - ""James Bond Will Return"". Who will they cast as the next Bond? And where will they take the story from here?

72,tonypeacock-1,We Have All The Time To Get Bond Wrong!,6,30 September 2021,"As a Bond aficionado since 1992 I was so disappointed with this film.I have waited six years since the last James Bond film (Spectre (2015)) which in itself was a bit of a let down but was out of the film makers hands in some respects.This film has high production values don't get me wrong but it does get Bond wrong in a few ways that left me quite angry from watching a film for the first time since 2001: A Space Odyssey!Gone are the days of a feel good 126 minute Bond with great action sequences, girls etc. Now we have an overly long film weighing in at 163 minutes. Even the curtain raiser, the pre-credits sequence is overly long. I miss the four minutes or so complete with a breathtaking stunt sequence.Daniel Craig as Bond makes his fifth and final appearance in the role. Whilst his performance is good I cannot resist the thought that he has been let down by a succession of poor scripts that tend to be overly complicated in terms of timelines, family ties and lack of humour.Why can't the filmmakers produce a standalone story every two years that doesn't follow on with storyline strands like a television soap-opera.Hans Zimmer provides the music and he does an admirable job evoking memories of John Barry from On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) the pinnacle of the series thus far?The Daniel Craig Bond films are an arc not seperate entities. They break so many traditions of the 'old films. I still can't get my head around that.It's a dud from me.",No Time to Die
73,kjproulx,A Great Final Outing,9,22 October 2021,"The James Bond franchise wasn't something I got into until Casino Royale hit theatres back in 2006. It was after that film that I decided to go back and give the entire franchise a watch. For me, there is an equal number of good and bad Bond films. I've never loved this franchise for that exact reason, but have always appreciated its legacy. Daniel Craig and Sean Connery are definitely my two favourite portrayals of the character, but I do believe that with Casino Royale, Skyfall, and now No Time to Die, Craig was a part of more good Bond films than any other actor. Here's why I believe No Time to Die is a very fitting final film for Daniel Craig.Unlike the rest of the franchise, the Daniel Craig films are all connected to each other, and therefore No Time to Die picks up after the events of Spectre, which have large ramifications here. More than any others, I would say Casino Royale and Spectre are the most referenced throughout the course of this movie. Now retired and wishing to retire, isolated, James Bond is brought back into the field one last time when the organization known as Spectre is brought back into the forefront. Now headed by mastermind Safin (Rami Malek), his mission is to hunt him down to end this organization. With the addition of other subplots and dealing with the fact that the 007 moniker is now in use by someone else, it makes it difficult for Bond to have an easy way out.The character of Safin is only in the film for a handful of scenes, but Rami Malek made them quite memorable for me. I was actually okay with the fact that the main villain had so little screen time because I didn't see that as the main point of the film. Léa Seydoux as Madeleine makes her return here as well and her storyline with Bond is really what made this film work for me as much as it did. This is the most different James Bond film in a very long time, in that it doesn't focus heavily on the villain storyline, but more of an aged Bond who just wants out of the game. Even though the notion of retirement has been in other Bond films, this one actually ran with it and I enjoyed that quite a lot.My only complaint with this film is that there is quite a lot of fan service and there are times where it may be too much for certain viewers. I loved almost every moment of it though, even if there are one or two moments that really had me rolling my eyes. Other than a few moments that feel slightly forced in comparison with the rest of the movie, they ended up being very minor issues to me. All in all, this Bond film tries to cover all the bases that a classic James Bond film would have and I believe that it immensely worked well.In the end, No Time to Die isn't going to be remembered for being the greatest James Bond film of all time or anything like that, but certain things that happen throughout the course of this film will absolutely be talked about for years to come. Daniel Craig is giving it his all here once again and returning characters also have more than a moment or two to shine. With some stellar Cinematography by Linus Sandgren and some very solid direction by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the look and feel of this film feels grand, even for this franchise. I have nothing but praise considering how much I enjoyed myself with this one, but I will say that a much more satisfying experience will come if you have seen the previous four Bond films. Now pleaying in theatres, absolutely check this one out.",No Time to Die

One of the visuals was the guns making the double helix shape, and the trails of the gunshot become the bonds between the nitrogenous bases.

76,timdalton007,"The End Of An Era, Commander Bond",9,10 October 2021,"In a different world, you would have been reading a version of this review nearly two years ago. That was when, after all, the 25th James Bond film from Eon Productions had its original release date. Finally, after a change of directors, writers, and composers and a release date moved multiple times due to the Covid-19 pandemic, that film, No Time to Die, has at long last reached cinemas. Billed as Daniel Craig's final outing in the role, has it proved to be a fitting send-off for his era as the world's most famous secret agent?Well, as promised, this is very much the tail end of the story that began with Craig's introduction in the role back in 2006's Casino Royale. Outside of the sixties Bond films, and of course, the novels from Ian Fleming that serve as the franchise's source, doing an ongoing narrative or building to something isn't something Bond has often done. The Craig era has essentially been an experiment, birthed in the time of both Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and the early MCU, that's produced uneven results as films like Quantum of Solace and, to an extent, Spectre has shown. No Time to Die finds itself on the right side of the equation, finding solid in-story reasons to continue the narrative threads it picks up and to bring characters such as Jeffrey Wright's Felix Leiter that we've not seen in some time. The influence of Bond's creator is apparent as well, with the film channeling (as did Skyfall before it) the later Fleming novels, with one book previously adapted essentially in name only having its last act receive a 21st-century update for the film's conclusion. Something which is to the credit of director Cary Joji Fukunaga and the writers (including Bond veterans Neal Purvis and Robert Wade with Phoebe Waller-Bridge).It also works because of its leading man. Perhaps second only to Timothy Dalton's underrated late eighties Bond, Craig's characterization has gotten the closest to Fleming's wounded man of a secret agent, something which No Time to Die brings out. The Bond of this film is one who not only once more confronting elements of his past through Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) and Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) but facing a new threat, as well. All of the things that made Craig so watchable, the man of action mixed with the at times hardly submerged human side, are on full display here, culminating in the film's final act. It's a send-off that brings out his best as a performer.The casting, on the whole, is solid, both with new and returning cast members. Both Seydoux and Waltz solidify their chemistry with Craig from Spectre, while the film also builds on the relationships with the team at MI6, including the respectful but antagonistic relationship with Ralph Fiennes as M and the brothers in arms comradely with Wright's Leiter. Elsewhere, there are intriguing moments from the much-discussed Lashana Lynch as 00-agent Nomi, who proves a worthy match for Craig's Bond, and Ana de Armas (Craig's co-star from Knives Out) makes an outstanding but brief appearance as Paloma.No Time to Die has a weak spot, though. To be specific, in the form of Rami Malek's villain Safin. There is, without question, an immensely unsettling quality to Malek's performance, from his quiet and often near-whisper delivery of lines to some well-done make-up work. Yet, there's also something off in his performance, which means that unsettling never translates to menace. It perhaps also doesn't help that, in the final act, his motivations are never quite clear, either. The Craig era has had its hit and misses when it comes to villains, and Safin counts as a miss if a near one.No Time to Die also takes the Craig era out on a high, production-wise. Mark Tildesley's production design neatly runs a wide gauntlet, from echoing the real world to the last act bringing Ken Adams sets of the 1960s up to date. Linus Sandgren's cinematography makes the film a visual feast, especially in IMAX, from Italian sunshine to the neon lights of Jamaica and Cuba to the muted high-tech glow of Safin's lair. Fukunaga's direction, along with Tom Cross and Elliot Graham as editors, keeps the film moving, making its 163-minute running time go by without hardly noticing. The icing on the cake might be the score from Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro, which brings back a classic Bond sound missing since David Arnold vacated the composer's chair, as well as quoting some classic Bond scores with appropriate, not to mention weaving in Billie Eilish's hauntingly melancholic title song.In the end, No Time to Die is to Craig's Bond what Avengers: Endgame was to the first decade of the MCU: a celebration and climax, all rolled into one. And it's a successful end of an era, thanks to some solid choices made by Fukunaga and the writers, not to mention how well made it is as a film. And after nearly two years of waiting, it's nice to know it's been worth the wait to finally see the end of an era.",No Time to Die

80,aboalhyjaa,There is time to die,9,25 October 2021,"There are zero doubts that Daniel Craig made a whole different James Bond that we all seen before, a human with feelings and not just an assassin who loves women.Directing of the movie was great, cinematography and soundtracks are super good.There was a bit of comedy, but not much and that gave the movie a distinctive appearance.The ending was the best thing about the movie, very strong and touching and gave me goosebumps.",No Time to Die
81,RussHog,"Thank you, Daniel Craig!",10,11 October 2021,"Daniel Craig is EXCELLENT as James Bond in this film. Excellent. He holds the whole film together when other elements fall short. There are so any subtle things he does throughout the course of this film that show he had mastery of the character - from the classic cliches to the newer more dramatic cinematic character arcs. The action scenes are amazing, the run time is epic, and the conclusion may leave some disappointed but I felt it was a worthy finale to his run on the iconic character.",No Time to Die
82,Alexander_Blanchett,Nice swan song for Daniel Craig,8,2 October 2021,"It was a good Swan Song for Daniel Craig's James Bond. One of the best Bonds we have ever encountered on screen. In my opinion the best since Sean Connery. So it was also kind of emotional.It also perfectly rounds about the story that started with Casino Royale. I liked that this generation of James Bond actually presented us movies that were interconnected with each other rather than just stand alone films. It all makes sense now.The acting was good enough. Daniel Craig had some really good moments. I really liked Lea Seydoux and the way they developed her role. In Spectre you got the impression she is just another fading Bond girl but they gave her role really a meaning and Seydoux did the best out of it. Unfortunately Ana de Armas was one of those fading Bond girls that quickly appear and disappear again with a blink of eye. Too bad as she was wasted. Her character was fun and kind of original and the way the press made it out I thought she is going to be a major one.Not too sure what to think about Rami Malik's villain. He was kind of stereotype and not too special. His performance was good enough but he does not rank among the best villains, even the modern series, had.Lashana Lynch will surprise you. Nice to see Jeffrey Wright back in this one as well as Christoph Waltz.The action was over the top as usual but here the difference is that Cary Joyi Fukunaga did not focus on simply the action but really put focus on the story and especially characters which was a nice change.Not sure what to think about the ending, but other than that a really good entry in the history of James Bond.",No Time to Die
83,cardsrock,The boldest Bond ever,8,10 October 2021,"After an excruciating 6 year wait between films, Daniel Craig's farewell outing as 007 is finally here. While it isn't quite the magnificent sendoff it hopes to be, it is still a highly entertaining and often moving Bond film.As a massive fan of the franchise, I find myself contemplating some of the decision-making in the film. The ending would not have been my choice personally, but I do applaud the boldness. For this character to stay relevant in a changing world, it must evolve and adapt to the times. The new agent 007 is an good example of striking a right balance between trying something new and staying true to the franchise. Giving Bond emotions is not something new, no matter how many whiny losers on the Internet tell you it is, but the depth to which they explore them in this film is surprising. I'm not sure I want it in every film going forward, but it is something new and interesting to delve into.The action is fantastic and the cinematography continues to be a major highlight of modern Bond films. My favorite sequence of the film has to be the mission with Ana de Armas. She is fabulous in the role and has scintillating chemistry with Craig. This whole part of the film is wonderful and feels like classic Bond fun. The chemistry between Bond and Madeleine is much improved from Spectre and I loved all the subtle references to previous films as well. There was also something incredibly thrilling about seeing James Bond fight with Hans Zimmer's iconic percussion blaring in the background.My issues with the film would be its length, addressing a lot of threads from the previous Bond films that didn't necessarily need to be, and the underdevelopment of Safin. How is a movie 2 hours and 43 minutes, yet I still don't really get what the villain's goal was?This is probably the best final film for any actor in the series as No Time to Die is a thrilling, emotional ride and well worth seeing in theaters.",No Time to Die
84,cliftonofun,Spectre 2: longer and better,7,12 October 2021,"The Daniel Craig Bond movies have stood out for many reasons, from telling a sequential story to making the protagonist an actual human being. As a result, this final chapter carried some real weight. I cared how this version of Bond would end, even when cars were exploding or silly one liners were being uttered. That said, there are limitations too. For example,the last Bond (Spectre) wasn't that great...and this movie's really committed to building on it. Also, I can only care so much when the action devolves into total silliness. And it does. This is not Skyfall - best Bond EVER according to basically everybody, including me - but it is still better than its predecessor and a fitting end to this version of 007. The first half was far better than the second half, but I still enjoyed finally getting to see this movie on a big screen.",No Time to Die
85,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,30 October 2021,"The stage curtains open ...If this is truly the final 007/Bond epic adventure (as we know him), it couldn't have been much better - it was a good one. It had been over a year since I've been able to watch a movie at the theater. ""No Time To Die"" was my first time back. I'm so glad I picked this one to return to the silver screen with. It delivered everything and more from what I would expect in a James Bond film.Daniel Craig delivers another strong performance as James Bond, now retired and enjoying the good life in his own little Jamaican domicile. Felix Leiter shows up along with the new 007 to ask him for his help in locating a scientist who holds the secret to a deadly new biological weapon that could potentially wipe out the human race. Bond accepts and is taken back to his past when he was married, uncovering a hidden truth that even he could not have seen coming. Armed with this information, he is faced with his biggest threat leading him to an inevitable end.I loved this final outing from Daniel Craig. The metamorphosis of Bond is completed in this movie. Everyone played their role perfectly. Rami Malek made an effective, worthy foe. I have always liked Ana de Armas and she was a delight to watch in this one as well. The action sequences were dripping with that ""Bond feel"". The cinematography was 2nd to none, the use of colors striking to the eyes, and the final conflict measures up.I highly recommend this movie at a nearly perfect 9 stars out of 10. It was everything and more from what I hoped it would be. As I was walking out of the theater that night, I found myself choking up. I felt like I was saying goodbye, to not only Daniel Craig, but to James Bond himself.",No Time to Die
86,statuskuo,The Divisive Melancholic Bond,8,9 October 2021,"I recall being blown away by the introduction of Daniel Craig as 007. The ""blunt instrument"" of so many hand to hand/gun play adventures that ends with what can only be the only way James Bond could be ended.Now to many who have lambasted this film...COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. This is the culmination of the interior stories of Bond that is never discussed. That he ends many lives who were the children of others or spouses of others or friends or family. This, in itself, should make you question what that does to a man. IF you are a classic Bond purist, this will not sit well. And again, understand your opinion.In this installment, we are dealing with a man whose own life cannot end conveniently. In fact the title tells you that. Suppose the title ""Never A Good Time To Die"" was too awkward. But that is the case. It makes the viewer understand that a spy/assassin is never going to get his happiness. Do we have to be reminded of that? No. In fact, it's a dreary reminder that Bond is in the real world. So if your Bond requires large crazy set pieces with cartoon like villains...it will grate on you that it does ask these questions.This is somewhat of a mirror of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" where a man sets off to thwart a plot of world annihilation whose happiness is yanked from his clutches. He can't have happiness and it won't end well. Most Double-O's don't get that luxury of dying quietly in bed with family surrounding him. Because the villains he faces are too fantastical to deal with. He, himself, needs to be as insane. So the only danger is if you introduce the simple life. And you probably should ask yourself how that would've functioned had he survived this tale and lived his life quietly mowing the lawn watching his doe-eyed wife play with his kid. Dullsville. So the makers of this flick committed what appears to be the ultimate sin.To me, it ended as it should. It opens the world up that isn't locked into the tropes of older Bonds (that STILL exists if you want to revisit and should. Trust me, I watch Roger Moore cheekily bounce through a very long tenure).To many, this will be a sickening thud of reality. Which wasn't asked nor was it spoken about. Bond, as a character, has committed so many crimes, destroyed so many assets and comes out fairly unscathed. This damages him emotionally on all levels and was worth the time, if you feel it always needed to address his demons. If not, skip this entry.I did think Ana De Armas would've been a better choice to take the mantle of the super spy. She can handle herself with weaponry and physical fights in a cocktail dress. And seems to be able to slip in and out of situations better than the 007 they chose. The spy world is cold empty and harsh. And, again, this film is about what happens when you, as a spy, do start to have ties to normalcy. And most often the outcome will be tragic.",No Time to Die
87,davidgee,Was it worth waiting for?,7,7 October 2021,"NO TIME TO DIE is very much a sequel to SPECTRE but it also comes with echoes of several other Bonds, including the Lazenby one and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, which had the creepiest Blofeld (Donald Pleasence). After all the movies in which 007 has been pitted against Blofeld, the new supervillain Safin (Rami Malek with some Phantom of the Opera scars) rather makes him redundant here.I hate to say this, but like Connery and Moore, Daniel Craig has ended up showing his age and his weariness with the franchise, although he still cuts the mustard in both the fights and love scenes. Ralph Fiennes looks a bit bored as M. Ben Wishaw gets good screen time as Q, but Miss Moneypenny (Noamie Harris) has been short-changed by the scriptwriters.At two and three-quarter hours, this is the longest Bond - too long by at least those 45 minutes. The plot is a bit of a mish-mash, and there are some daft CGI gadgets (not quite as daft as the invisible car, but close enough). And the 'superhero' 007 is somewhat out of kilter with the romantically vulnerable Bond, which has been - and still is - the best element of Daniel Craig's stewardship of the role.The hallmark of Craig's movies has been the combination of spectacular set pieces and elegiac climaxes, and this one very much delivers both of those elements. What next, and who next? I guess we must once more wait and see. NO TIME TO DIE was worth waiting for.",No Time to Die

89,sbweightman,"Classic Bond for a modern era which is stylish and entertaining, but not spectacular.",8,9 October 2021,"A classic Bond movie through and through except for the big reveal and ending which although fitting for a more modern era, doesn't fit in with the whole genre. The presentation is stylish with a topical plot for world domination, the villain was great if underused, the girls beautiful, the locations exotic and used well, and the action sequences and fight scenes were exciting and engaging, although none really stood out as spectacular. The cast were varied with good acting and the high amount of references to the other Bond movies was a nice touch. I didn't like how everything was portrayed as being final and by being so traditional in its formula and presentation, it did feel a bit dated overall. The theme song was also unmemorable.",No Time to Die
90,danielmanson,It's a good watch. Could have been better though,7,14 October 2021,"Well the title says it all for me on this one. I overall did really enjoy watching this movie. It had good action scenes, fun car chases and a good enough plot to keep you interested. However there was just a couple of annoyances for me that just stopped this being a great James Bond movie.So for me I'm a huge Casino Royale fan and No Time To Die doesn't even come close to how good that was. Let's look at the others Craig has done. Skyfall and Spectre also better. This is miles better than Quantum of Solace however as that was horrendous. So to sum up that paragraph, it's low down on my list.So why? I mentioned the plot before. Yes it keeps you interested, but that's literally it. There's no wow factor, no small twist or anything substantial that makes you sit on the edge of your seat dying for more.The female 007 in this really got on my nerves. Such a poorly written character. She tries to be very smug and it comes off as just annoying and I simply couldn't get past it. Staying on the characters, I would have loved more from some of them. Christoph Waltz and Rami Malek's characters in particular, would have loved to have seen them in more depth, instead you're left with very little on both.I thought also that Daniel Craig's acting wasn't the best in this either. Seemed a little forced out.The small attempts at humour just fell on deaf ears. There wasn't much granted, but there was a couple of moments where it was tried and it was so forced it was just off putting.Overall though I did think it was a pretty good watch, you won't be bored and it was definitely fun in parts, but it could have been so much better than what we got.Hats off to Ana de Armas by the way, really did well and that whole scenario she was in was great and really fun to watch. It's a weak 7/10 from me today. Oh, make sure you watch Spectre before this if you haven't. It's connected.",No Time to Die
91,lareval,"The Name is Bold, James Bold: A great action extravaganza, a terrific escapism and a poignant ending for Daniel Craig's iconic and unique tenure.",10,30 September 2021,"Just finished watching this movie that I've been anxiously waiting for nearly two years and out of respect to the moviegoing experience I'll keep this review spoiler-free ( #NoTimeForSpoilers / #KeepTheSecrets ). Let me start by saying this: even with all the hype of the world this Bond movie surpasses it all by breaking most of the rules anyone could imagine. I remember watching 'Casino Royale' with my -now sadly estrangled- childhood friends back in 2006, right before leaving my childhood home, and exiting the cinema in pleasent shock wishing to see the next film ASAP. That movie hooked people that even were never fans of Bond and got addicted to Craig's fantastic and revolutionary run. Now, we have reached the end of the journey and luckily I'm in that kind of satisfying shock. This is a daring, fearless swan song done right!The Daniel Craig Era has been mostly gifted with truly phenomenal scripts and characters ('Casino Royale', 'Skyfall') all wrapped by a masterful and very intimate performance by Craig as a revolutionary, game-changer Bond. He has never repeated himself: every performance has something different, a nice touch. He is a different kind of Bond here, more than welcome in my opinion. He is even lucky enough to has his own five-picture saga inside a bigger-than-life franchise that can be consider on their own. No one else can say that. If 'Spectre' was somewhat kind of a let down -even if I have feelings for it-, 'No Time To Die' is the answer to all the complaints about the previous film and manages to give Craig the stunning farewell that we were promised. In order to avoid spoilers I will briefly explain my thoughts in parts:*A masterful and suspenseful prologue that driftes away from all the safe Bond topics by delivering an instant shock. They risk from the very start with something never done before and I was hooked right away. Later, when the action and the suspense hit hard, they really do.*Daniel Craig fires on all cylinders as Bond. He showcases a range of feelings and emotions: from happiness to feeling he's at the end of his rope (when he's kind of paralyzed inside the car with Madeleine shouting at him while bullets fly or the idea of accepting he's past his prime and he isn't a young athlete anymore), from anger to cold-blooded professionality. This is probably the first Bond movie ever in which I don't really know Bond is going to get out alive at the end nor if he is his own self-destructive enemy himself. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, seems to have the time of his life. He seems actually happy, confident and invested in the role this time around. He wanted to try new things and all his stuff is awesome and has that energy missed from 'Spectre'. He is the best and most complete (and truly human) James Bond ever and I am missing him already. I can't imagine anyone else as Bond.*Madeleine's role is vastly improved this time around, there's very serious chemistry between Seydoux and Craig.*Billie Eilish's song is perfect, tied with 'Skyfall' and 'You Know My Name'. It explores the deeper, touching themes of the movie and the visuals of the credits are fantastic.*Hans Zimmer's score is easily the most epic of all the recent Bonds, containing callbacks to classic Bond outings (very much John Barry's) that will delight everyone. Truly awesome and worthy of loudest sound system in cinema. For your ears only.*The direction and photography are top notch.*The action scenes are thrilling (some of them are shot like a suspenseful horror movie like the first part of the prologue), violent (the blood in the fist fights is welcome back at last, when Safin's plot is tested in a party it is terrifying and effective) and put together with gourgeous style. They have done all the things left to do and what they could do this time.*After a great first act, the movie never drags. Even with the arcs to be told and the delayed return to MI6, it is a home run. This is probably the most consistent Craig Bond movie in terms of pacing, tied with 'CR'. And that's an important achievement knowing this is the longest Bond.*Leiter's comeback brings full circle to his relationship with Bond since 'CR'.*Safin is a wonderfully creepy, actually surprising baddie. While the script and his runtime left him not so many things to do, he has a powerful reason behind his goal and twisted my expectations in more ways than one. Even if I wish he was around much more in the movie, Malek delivers being quietly intimidating and calmly sinister. Even more so every time he makes a demonstration of his skills.*Ana De Armas as Paloma: Brief but unforgettable. What a woman, ""¡Coño!""! If anyone would try spin offs from the franchise, Paloma definitely deserves hers.*MI6 team is great as ever and the addition of Noomi is a good one (all the hate that she recieved probably will be converted in admiration, perhaps mirroring in some way Craig's initial backlash as Bond). Her role doesn't thwart Bond importance in the movie.*It is so satisfying to witness a proper, classic Bond villain's lair this time around, as well as a true save-the-world plot (without sacrificing the personal touch). No spoilers, but the plot really has something to say about the present time in some way.*Blofeld's appearance is very important, well done and actually way better resolved than his lackluster closing moments in 'Spectre'. So thrilling and breathtaking!*The story mixes the deepest personal emotions with the globe-throtting planetary and succeeds Big Time.*The script has clever and surprising twists and turns hidden along the way. The revelations will shock and awe. This is the first Bond movie that ends up being that surprising, that risky and that bold.*The entire third act and the ending are inmensely exciting and extremely emotional. I couldn't help but to shed some tears. Probably the boldest, most moving finale of Craig's era (beating 'Skyfall') and of the entire franchise as well. The team involved promised a hard hitting finale and this is everything we could wish for. Not for everyone, though.To sum it up: this is my first watch and I can't wait to see this movie again. Bond movies trend to grow in fondness in time, and while some movies descent in rankings, I think this film is our generation's 'Majesty's' and while it will shock and probably divide people right away, it's going to grow and grow with more watches and more time. It really deserves so. This is the best final Bond movie of any actor in the franchise, a genuinely epic adventure and one of the biggest and best Bond movies ever produced. I am so happy to say this and so happy for Daniel Craig to retire this way. He is leaving an actual legacy, five wonderful films that took place during 15 years (making his tenure the longest of any Bond) and showing a reliable investment and a swaggering confidence that makes him my favourite Bond ever. His reckless acts at the beginning of 'CR' ended up being mature behaviour at the end of 'NTTD' and his arc is now fully developed and complete. The Next Bond is going to need a bombastic shot of luck because the level is incredibly high now and so well deserved.A thrilling, poignant, surprising, emotional, riveting, funny, painful and unforgettable send off. Even all its twists and shocks make sense with all the previous Craig's outings rather than look like cheap tricks. It is finally time to rejoice, to prepare to be wowed and to say goodbye to a glorious Bond era with a heavy heart and clapping in tears because it is all earned. Get ready for discussions and debates but I predict they will be healthy. Go to the largest and loudest cinema, don't let anyone spoil this one for you!Goodbye, James Bond. Thank you for everything, Daniel Craig. Damn, I am already missing him so badly.",No Time to Die
92,ethanbresnett,Massively over-hyped due to the fact it's Craig's last instalment,8,21 October 2021,"I've given this film a generous 8 stars (in reality a 7.5 which I've rounded up) as I was left underwhelmed when the credits began to role and was hoping for a little more.Rami Malek gave a middling performance as a forgettable villain.The best action sequences of the film were all in the first 15 minutes (and were all rather unforgivably shown in the trailer).In terms of the action throughout, it was generic and pretty uninspired. I can think of a dozen action films that have been released in the last couple of years alone that surpass the sequences served up in No Time to Die.The plot was pretty weak in truth. Quite straightforward and nothing that hasn't been done in a dozen Bond films before.What I think really let this film down was the script. The Craig era Bond films have always taken themselves more seriously than the likes of Moore's films, which has worked very well. However they tried to inject some of the Roger Moore-esque winking at the camera cheeky one liners which just didn't fit with the tone of the film. Lines such as ""Do you know what time it is? Time to die"" wouldn't feel out of place in a Fast & Furious movie... I'd expect better from Bond.It's not all doom and gloom though, and the film does (only just) earn itself 8 stars.Ana de Armas was electric and her moments on screen were a real highlight.We got some Felix Leiter action which is always a plus.Everything before the opening credits sequence was top tier Bond, including the song brilliantly performed by Billie Eilish.Also with it being Craig's last outing as Bond there was a certain sentimental value to the whole thing. I think at least one of my eight stars is due to purely to this emotive element.Like any Bond film this is a fun ride and is pretty entertaining. It has plenty of weaknesses and a few flashes of brilliance, leading to an overall solid film.",No Time to Die

I love Mathilde she was just ADORABLE!!! I do think as far as villain's go the could have done much better. The way Mr. Rami walked was just fake looking. All the villain's have been memorable and always made one feel a bit uneasy but this time it was not the case. I scored this one high because it has been a while since I have seen a bond movie but this felt more like a 6 to me. It was good and action packed but nothing new or special that I have not seen before.

Except for the end and the beginning, the film lacks the necessary speed and tension. Yes, it is partly more like a drama than a classic blockbuster. The typical James Bond aspects that the figure has built up over decades are almost completely missing here. And the equipment, such as planes and typical instruments, look like they have been stolen from a bad science fiction film. You can watch the film, but you don't have to. Certainly disappointing for James Bond fans.",No Time to Die
97,markgorman,Outstanding finale by the best Bond ever.,9,1 October 2021,"The short answer is yes, it was worth the wait. We saw it on opening day with a small audience (midday in Livingston doesn't bring the hordes out).Daniel Craig's last outing as Bond, for me, only cements his reputation as the greatest. OK, he's an ageing model but he has most of the right bits in most of the right places and, of course, he has an array of beauties to riff off. Not least Ana De Armas as Paloma who puts in a dazzling 10 minute cameo in an old bar in Cuba.The storyline is remarkably complex, not just in a saving the world sort of way but in how the various back stories (and history) collide.I'm not gonna share any spoilers here, and boy are there two biggies in particular, but let's talk later when everyone has seen this cracking movie.You certainly get your money's worth because the run time is well over two hours and the body count must be in the 100's.There are, of course, plot holes that are ridiculous, but, hey, it's Bond so get over it.But it all adds up to a hugely enjoyable romp, some serious drama, first rate direction from Cary Joji Fukanaga and a decent contribution to the largely excellent script by Phoebe Waller-Bridges.You get Norway, Cuba, London, Japan and Italy for your money with the centrepiece being the early scenes in the stunning village of Matera where my wife and I breathtakingly holidayed three years ago. Seriously, it's one of the most beautiful places we've ever been. And it's a star of this movie.A superb Bond from start to finish. Highly recommended. And I can't wait to discuss those plot spoilers when you get round to it. Bravo to the production team for keeping them secret.",No Time to Die
98,steiner-sam,The beginning and ending boost the rating; the rest is standard fare,7,20 October 2021,"It's set in the present day and deals with Bond's efforts to combat a villain using stolen biotechnology to systematically assassinate chosen targets. It's more of a sequel to ""Spectre,"" the 24th film, than most Bond movies.The movie begins with a flashback by Dr. Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) to the murder of her mother when Madeleine when a child. It then moves to James Bond and Madeleine having an idyllic tryst in Italy until Spectre agents attempt to assassinate Bond. He accuses Madeleine of complicity in the plot, and they separate.Five years later, Spectre captures a scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik), from a level 4 biocontainment lab working for MI6 on a bioweapon that allows assassination targetted to a particular individual's DNA. Bond has retired to Jamaica by this time, and a new 007 has been named in his place--Nomi (Lashana Lynch). CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) asks Bond for help in tracking down Obruchev in Cuba, where a massive Spectre party is planned for its imprisoned leader Ernst Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Things take a dramatic turn when a new villain, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), enters the fray and launches a new story arc related to the bioweapon.The movie unfolds with Bond and Swann forced to work together, and we are introduced to Swann's daughter, Mathilde (Lisa-Dorah Sonnet), who may or may not be Bond's daughter. By the end of over 2 1/2 hours, many loose ends have been tied up after Bond's usual dramatic chase scenes, Marvel-type technology, and incredible physical feats.I will say ""No Time to Die"" has a more realistic ending than most Bond films. In addition, the opening flashback of the young Madeleine Swann is the most creative and interesting part of the movie. But, other than those two things -- the beginning and the ending -- this is a film where characters from countless other Bond movies could have been plugged in, and no one would notice. Certainly, Daniel Craig brought more depth to the Bond character than earlier players like Roger Moore.",No Time to Die

Locations are good, action against faceless enemies is okay, dialogue is forgettable, and a villain that is lacking in presence and a defined objective. Certainly not the movie I had in mind for the closure of an era, and much less for Daniel's last entry. It's similar to Quantum of Solace.. as to how a lot of things happen, but not much weight is felt.That dude-bro jordan vogt-roberts will probably have a hard time adapting the Metal Gear Solid plot to a movie, now that James Bond has basically taken the plot of the PlayStation release with FOXDIE and a Shadow Moses-like island infiltration.",No Time to Die
102,harrykivi,There should be no time to watch anything like this.,5,4 October 2021,"I have been a Bond fan since I was ten years old. My first James Bond movie was probably ""Goldeneye"", which I love to this day and consider it as my favorite film of the franchise. Daniel Craig era has never been one that I love. ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" were both fantastic, but ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Spectre"" not very good at all.To put it mildly, ""No Time to Die"" was my most anticipated movie of this year. It marks the final apperance of Daniel Craig as Bond and is the longest James Bond movie up to date. I saw this movie yesterday and heard it was controversial for the fans. After seeing ""No Time to Die"", this is certainly going to be a very divisive film.Talking about myself: I really wanted to love this film, and at times I did. There are parts of ""No Time to Die"", which I think are wonderful, but there are also parts of it, which could have been executed far better.Let's start with the good aspects first, shall we?. The production values of this movie are fantastic. The cinematography is gorgeous and Billie Ellish's theme fits the story, while having haunting lyrics and music. The acting is pretty good all around. Daniel Craig is the most chatty he has ever been as Bond, but he's still very likable in the role. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are great as usual. Lea Seydoux is so much better here than she was in ""Spectre"". Jeffrey Wright and Christoph Waltz are fun for what there are in. Rami Malek is creepy enough as Safin, but he is definitely not the best villain of the franchise. Ana De Armas though gives an amazing performance. She felt such a breath of fresh air in this movie, while kicking ass for only 10 minutes..... The first hour of ""No Time to Die"" is compelling enough. The action scenes in Italy and Cuba, though the chase in the woods and the climax on Saffin's island are solid too, especially stand out.. There are moments, where the humor does land and throwbacks to other Bond films like ""For Your Eyes Only"", where James Bond pushes a car on the henchman, were clever. The story definitely leaves an emotional impact on the audience with the choice of music and themes of family-turns out Bond and Madeline have a daughter Mathilde, which is not a bad idea, just convinient for the story :)But let's get into my negatives, because this movie was disappointing for me. There are parts, like I said, which are fantastic, and that's what makes a couple choices of the story so frustrating for me.. The movie is agreed unbalanced and feels too long at times. There were times, where I thought the narrative got a bit too melodramatic with the relationship problems between Swan and Bond. The deaths of Felix, but especially Blofeld's death feel crammed into the story having no impact on anyone, just like the character of Nomi, who is underdeveloped at best (even though the actress is very good).. The humor is not always spot on and does get a bit cringe-worthy at times. One can tell that they were trying to make great ending to Daniel Craig's Bond by giving him the most dialogue and one-liners, but Craig's James Bond feels out of character for a good portion of the film.. The biggest issue for me was indeed the last third of the film. First, the villain's plan to destroy the world feels forced and out of nowhere. I can understand why he killed all agents of Spectre, but brutally murdering an Europe full of people made no sense to me.Second problem regards the fact that Bond dies in this movie. There are several issues with this ending. 1) Even though it fits the movie, I think it was Craig himself, who said that this movie was about family, this movie could have ended with Daniel Craig's 007, after being poisoned and escaping the island watching his family from a safe distance or like Calvin Dyson said having Q to develop an antidote for Bond. James Bond faking his own death to protect his loved ones makes more sense to me than his death. 2) This ending does not feel earned. Yes, it's a shock, but one that felt extremly rushed. I agree with Calvin Dyson that there is no need for urgency to shoot those missiles, yes the ships are coming, but that was not a very clever way to create urgency at all. This ending in my humble opinion just misses the point that it's trying to make about Bond and his family. I respect Craig and the writing team for making that bold decision, but the ending felt (after thinking about it) that it wasn't Bond, who was done with everything, it was Daniel, who just wanted to insure the audience that this was his last Bond film. The ending also raises questions of how are they going to continue the Bond franchise. Are they going to do a reboot of a reboot? That would be quite silly in my mind.Overall, there should be no time to watch anything like this, because it left a very depressive feeling, which a James Bond film shouldn't leave. ""No Time to Die"" could have been a smart, fun Bond movie, but instead it was okay at best.5/10

103,fciocca,"The part before the intro is good, the rest is a disaster.",3,5 October 2021,"After waiting for two years, finally the newest James Bond is released in theatres, and it is a mess of a film. The first 20 minutes are good, the action is adrenalinic, there are good stunts, and the tension builds up. After the Billie Eilish song, the movie crumbles completely.The story is too convoluted and they went full science fiction, introducing a highly unbelievable mass murder weapon that does not make any sense. There are way too many characters. Why did they introduce a second 007 that does not add anything to the story? She doesn't contribute in any way to the main objective accomplishment, and the movie wouldn't be any different without her. She is basically an empty shell that is used as a filler. For sure not up to the legacy that this number has. If this is the successor of James Bond, MI6 is already doomed. Paloma, played by Ana De Armas, is a newly trained and definitely too anxious agent for the job. She appears for like 15 minutes where she kicks asses. Visually appealing scene but then, we do not get to see her anymore, so what was even the point? Q was always the genius of the group, plenty of crazy inventions up to his sleeves. In this movie they decided to give him more screen time, which is a wonderful idea, but unfortunately the actor did not manage to give any kind of depth to the character. The evil side is not better. Safir is so cliché and predictable. He cannot transmit any sense of menace. He seems more a spoiled kid that wants to destroy the world for egoistic reasons, a trope seen too many times. Rami Malek is such a talented actor, but in this case he was just disappointing. I want to believe that part of the fault is on the script, which in general was weak and poorly written. Ash, the right hand of Lyutsifer, is just another stupid character that was too easy to beat. Honestly James here played on easy mode, because bad guys are all extremely dumb.The very first action sequence at the beginning is amazing. I saw a lot of dedication and stunts were very well coordinated. Extremely entertaining and compelling. Then, the movie became some kind of John Wick spinoff, full of explosions and shootouts. James Bond is a spy, he is supposed to investigate, infiltrate subtly in the criminal organization and dismantle it from the inside. But because in previous movies he basically blew his identity up, and everyone in and outside Spectre knows who he is, what is even the point of going stealthy? So let's blow up entire places and shoot mindlessly. Bond is just a one man army now.The movie is almost three hours long and it is so watered down by useless dialogues that overexpose the plot. There are too many romantic scenes between the couple Bond-Madeleine. At some point, I was wondering if I was watching a spy story, or a rom com. Of course, like most mainstream movies nowadays, there is a lot of forced comedy that is not even funny. I mean, there are a few decent jokes, but nothing worth noticing. ""No Time to Die"" is definitely a huge downgrade to the whole franchise. Either creators stop doing the series, or they reboot it, by taking inspiration from the older movies.",No Time to Die
104,Med-Jasta,The time to die is before watching this movie,1,12 October 2021,"I'm going to rant about this movie. The best this movie gets is okay. And that's after a half an hour when the story finally starts. And even then it's old and gives us nothing really new. The idea of a Bond family is good. But like everything in this movie, they screw up their good ideas. Bond shooting Safin in cold blood was great and satisfying after he should have done that in Spectre to Blofeld. Even though the island was going to blow up, but still cool to see it. And when he rolled the car over on the CIA guy.The opening? Then the other opening? So long. I actually thought it was a dream scene for a while. And Safin is clearly the same age as Madeleine. And the mask? These scenes were painfully long. For the most part the movie doesn't drag like the first half an hour. Except for the Russian guys intro? What? Having Bond retired was dumb. Having him get rid of Madeleine was dumb. And were we supposed to think that wasn't his daughter for one second?Safin. The worst bad guy. I have no idea what his deal was. And his bio/nano technology was so stupid. It wasn't explained very well and it didn't feel very threatening. Like at the end when he hits Bond's face was visually so stupid. He was so annoying and not threatening.The other 007 wasn't funny like she was supposed to be. And that whole back and forth was dumb. And her setting up her own one liner aka the title? What was that all about? The actress was fine. It was too self aware as a Bond movie and having little references to itself. Like when he shoots at the tunnel to reflect the opening. Or when he awkwardly has to say Bond, James Bond at MI6. There were others but I can't remember them all.Blofeld's cyborg eye thing was how he was talking to the outside world? They didn't check that? And this technology exist?Bond's death? Like he had to die for that reason? He couldn't touch his girlfriend who he hadn't seen in 5 years or the daughter he just found out about so he didn't want to live anymore? He took himself out of their life when he could have had a normal relationship with them? This was not worthy of killing Bond. He didn't want to see if they could find a cure or whatever? That was so stupid. It's way easier to kill off somebody then to make them get through the bad stuff. You have to get creative. Killing them off is easy. Notice how they did it to three main characters? Not that it added anything, it's just dramatic.And they relied way too much on bad CG for the action. I have no problem with CG. I only have a problem with bad CG. And this was very noticable. Distractingly. And another thing I normally don't notice but did a lot in this was when the good guys get shot at by a machine gun from two feet away and every bullet misses them. It happened a lot in this.Cary Joji Fukunaga needs to get his head out of his ass. He thinks he's way better than he actually is. If he wasn't so pretentious he would have realized that every frame he shot wasn't precious and could be cut. And he had all this extra time to tighten up his movie but he thought he got it perfect.This really reminded me of Dark Knight Rises. It takes place years after the last one. The main character comes out of retirement, then gets ""blown up,"" and there's a Russian who is the only one who knows how to use this technology.Ana de Armas was the best part. Only in it for a bit unfortunately. I wasn't sure if she'd be able to handle the action because she's so cute and dainty. But she does! She's good with the guns and the hand to hand fights. She has a killer kick!Farewell to Daniel Craig. He did very well, just like all the Bond's. He'll always stand out because he was in the Bond reboot. Remember when people hated him because he was blonde? Well get ready because whoever gets the job next is going to get the same amount of crap until the movie comes out and then he'll be the best one ever. But Craig and this storyline deserved a much better ending.I really fear for the future of this fantastic franchise. I hope they don't listen to the internet because it's not real and they don't know what they want. I don't know if they were setting up the ""new"" 007 to take over, the daughter, I have no idea. I guess we learned one thing from the Bond reboot: it's not a good idea. The Craig movies have the most bad ones for a single actor. Some of them are some of the best too. But ultimately giving Bond a 5 movie arc didn't pay off. Or they just did a bad job. He's not an arc character. He's a series character. He can learn things along the way.I don't want a Spider-Man situation where we get reintroduced every few years to the beginning of the character. I really hope they just do what Dr. No did and Bond's been doing it for a while. Maybe this series will be like The Dark Knight series where these ones just exist unto their own. They seemed to take their cues from that series anyway so it only makes sense.But like always, I can't wait to see what happens next.",No Time to Die

Otherwise I give up hate to say as Brit but mi6 etc was way wayyyyy better and never did I think I would post that yesterday. And the actress who also did 007 not good. Should have gave ana her role.

I have been watching all the other bond movies in preparation for this one and was definitely cause I've been the hype which unfortunately this movie didn't live up to.

109,flicklover,One of the better Bond films in years until.....,7,10 October 2021,"No Time To Die is one of the most hyped Bond films ever. Of course one of the big reasons is that it's release was delayed multiple times. Also, it is well known that this would be Daniel Craig's last Bond outing. So the anticipation for this film was pretty big. My favorite Craig Bond films are Casino Royale and Skyfall. I had really high expectations and the film met alot of them. The action is really fast paced and well paced. Also, with the Daniel Craig era the formula was tweaked a little to make James Bond more relatable and ""real"". I don't have any issue with that but this film goes overboard in some ways. Rami Malek is good as the arch villain but is not featured as much as I think he should have been. I was thoroughly enjoying this film until a decision that is made that so so insulting to any Bond fan that it really reduced my opinion of the film considerably.But overall, it's a solid effort.Grade: B-",No Time to Die
110,jakethesnake-42007,Good end to Daniel Craig run as bond,7,8 October 2021,I've really enjoyed Daniel Craig's run as bond even tho some of the films may be uneven it was a raw take on the character. The acting was really good. There's action tho I found this film to be a little to long abs times where it dragged. The Villain I was disappointed in I found there was not enough screen time. It's not Craig's best bond film but it's not his worst one.,No Time to Die
111,deepfrieddodo,"Good Film, Bad 'Bond' Film",7,3 October 2021,"If nothing else, No Time To Die stirs many mixed feelings, as it is simultaneously easy to love and hate the film.Start with what is good: the action is great, Daniel Craig continues to be a top Bond (although taken in a different direction), the plot is for the most part easy to follow (despite scenes of mumbling about key things), the cast is great and brings many characters together, and overall it is really interesting throughout, and mostly enjoyable, for a neutral.However, I can completely understand why die-hard Bond fans despise the latest installment. A character that has been around for 60 years is killed off, so that the Hollywood studios can continue the saga with a more diverse lead - and the reasoning they use to get around it is weak, 'Bond will never be a woman', 007 on the other hand...Having representation is important, but just create a new character, a new saga, instead of piggybacking off the back of one of the most famous series in cinema history. All Hollywood does now are remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels, Bond was one of the few things that could be justifiably continuous. The codename of '007' isn't what draws an audience, its Bond as a character within the (frequently daft) action storylines. Nomi, who can only be assumed as the replacement and new 007, is dull, uncharismatic, and although not bad in the grand scheme of things, doesn't instill excitement. Having Bond become a father and fall in love with the girl he knew a matter of moments really doesn't fit either, although probably would have worked in a non-Bond film.Beyond breaking a franchise, there is a lot left to be desired in the film too. Rami Malek is well cast, but his character was almost non-existent. A thin backstory which inspires no terror and doesn't particularly leave a mark on the story, with no further development other than the cliche of giving the bad guy some sort of disfigurement. His supporting cast of baddies don't do anything either, what is the point of Ash? Why is Blofeld so wasted? (It is also not explicit that this film comes after every other Bond film in the timeline, Blofeld's death wasn't just a waste of a character and a little anti-climactic, it was downright confusing). Paloma, who could have been a great addition, disappeared after one scene too, why?Overall though, if this was just a standalone action film, it'd mostly be great. It's interesting, looks good, nice soundtrack, well-choreographed and some sort of emotional arc for the lead. A Bond film though? No, one to make aficionados tear their hair out.",No Time to Die
112,movieman6-413-929510,Daniel Craig ends his Bond career in a dignified way,8,1 October 2021,"No Time to Die is the 25th Bond film directed and written in part by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the director of Beasts of No Nation and Jane Eyre.In the film, James Bond (Daniel Craig) has left his life as a secret agent and tries to live a quiet life in Jamaica. His peace is disturbed by his old friend Felix Leither (Jeffrey Wright) from the CIA, who asks him to help him find a kidnapped scientist. Bond decides to help Felix and learns about a dangerous new technology. When he learns that the mysterious Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) is also trying to get hold of this technology, endangering the world, James must reactivate his old MI6 connections in order to stop Safin.Despite the long and many times that this film has been postponed, director Cary Joji Fukunaga manages to convey the film in a beautiful and appropriate way. He gets the chance to film this James Bond film for the first time with an IMAX camera, which makes the image quality of this film different and better compared to the previous Bond films. The action scenes come across as if you as a viewer are present in the scenes and could be touched by something yourself. In this film they also choose not to edit the action scenes too much unnecessarily, so that you as a viewer do not lose your concentration and you stay with what is happening in the film.This is also the James Bond film with the longest running time to date, but luckily you hardly feel the long running time while watching the film. This is due to the good pace and the exciting and entertaining way in which the story of the film is told. Some scenes of additional characters can sometimes come across as a bit long-winded or unnecessary. With the story they also respond well to current events with references and know how to put this Bond film in a modern jacket. Some of these moments can take some getting used to for diehard Bond films, but fortunately they don't come across as disturbing. The film also appropriately brings back some elements from previous Daniel Craig Bond films. The film cast also delivers good and appropriate acting in the film. This is Daniel Craig's last time as James Bond and manages to end his Bond career in a fitting way. In the film, he also comes across as an older version of Bond, who goes through life more cranky and with sarcastic humor when he is called back for help. Along with the rest of the cast who play the MI6 characters, he comes across as kind of a family trying to save the world together. Other characters from the previous Daniel Craig Bond films also manage to come back in this film in a good way, although some are only brought back for a short time.Rami Malek comes across as the villain of the film, but unfortunately doesn't get much time in the film to really build up his character. After working with Ana de Armas in the movie Knives Out, Daniel Craig persuaded her to star in this movie as well. In this film she comes across as the Bond girl in an appropriate way, but unfortunately she does not have a major role. Lashana Lynch also appropriately comes across as a helping MI6 agent without overshadowing Daniel Craig. Together, the two manage to create fun moments in the film. Léa Seydoux also returns in this film with a larger and more important role, but does not always manage to put this down credibly, so that some moments do not come across as strong.",No Time to Die
113,bazookamouth-221-898097,Good but not great,7,1 October 2021,Its a good movie just not great and I would say out of the five movies Daniel Craig as Bond made this would be the fourth best for me. Dislikes first. Rami Malek (Safin). I didnt like his villain. Miscast. To weak Nomi 007 (Lashana Lynch) didn't like her. Lack of personality and charisma. I dont like Ralph Fiennes (M) receding hairline which the camera fixated on. The plot. It lost me. I dont know what the hell Rami Malek was doing. The theme song at the beginning by Billie Eilish was complete crap. Next time get some who is coherent. Likes...Daniel Craig is just unreal for a man of his age. They will miss him now he has retired. One of the best ever Bonds. The ending. Just isn't right for a Bond movie. Ana Armas (Paloma) who was fantastic in her role but criminally under used.

114,srdjan_veljkovic,Even James Bond doesn't think it's a James Bond movie,3,10 November 2021,"It's too long. It's not interesting enough. It has no style. It's not fun or funny. Bond girls are not hot enough. Bond has a kid and dies at the end.At times, it's more like Mission Impossible. At other times, it's more like Fast and Furious. It's always less like Bond.A Bond movie has a story. It's silly, but that's kind of the point. There's action, but, it's just to make things more interesting. Bond seduces all the hot women effortlessly. Except maybe one, which should be the least hot one. All the good ones that he seduces die, except maybe the one he ends up with.Here, there's no story, really. It's just pauses between action sequences. Put in a bold guy saying ""Family"" all the time and it might have passed as another F&F installment.What little story there is seems like a draft for the next Mission Impossible.There are three hot women. Bond is in love with one and has no effect on the other two. Ana de Armas even laughs him of, even though he doesn't even try to seduce her, only to charm her. And she's not even that hot to begin with, I don't care how silly her coctail dress is. None of them die.The new 007 is a woman who's built more like a shot putter than a secret agent.But, even forgetting that it's not a Bond movie, it's not a good movie anyhow. There are several meaningless sequences of Bond driving around that last far more than the death of Felix, Bond's dearest friend - a brother, as he puts it himself. The main villain is smart enough to wipe out entire Spectre, the most powerful private organization in the world, yet can't handle two 007s and a blonde psychiatrist, who don't have a plan really, unless you call ""come in and shoot everybody"" a plan.And yeah. The CIA idiot agent, a Trump appointee, is actually a Russian double agent. Really? Still with the collusion?Towards the end, you're thinking ""what's the point of all of this""? The only thing that keeps you going is that you feel Bond will die and you never saw that. When that does happen, it's underwhelming to say the least.To be fair, it's not all bad. Daniel Craig seems to finally be getting the point of Bond and is having some fun. Given a few more movies, he might had even gotten it right. Too bad it's too late. He has most fun with Ana de Armas, which is why this is the essentially only fun part of the movie, even though de Armas is not very good and not nearly as fun or hot as intended. Apart from that, there are two jokes that actually work.It also looks pretty good and there are some beautiful sequences of Italian coastline.It ain't the worst in the series, but, it's among the worst few and it's the least Bond, even less than Lazenby's In Her Majesty's Service.",No Time to Die

118,darkreignn,"The best Bond film since ""Casino Royale""",8,12 October 2021,"""No Time to Die"" is an enigma. On its own, to someone who isn't invested in the James Bond character or hasn't seen all of the previous Daniel Craig 007 movies may enjoy this film for its high-octane action sequences, beautiful men and women (I'm an equal opportunity eye candy appreciator), and gorgeous scenery. However, they may feel bogged down by its noticeably long screen time, and find themselves confused by the almost constant callbacks to previous characters and plot threads that have been introduced in the other Craig movies. Truly, to get the most out of ""No Time to Die"" you have to sit and watch all of the Daniel Craig 007 films, even the lesser ones.Truthfully, ""No Time to Die"" is the best of the Craig 007 films right behind ""Casino Royale,"" but there's no denying that it wouldn't be this enjoyable and emotionally resonant without the films that came before it. From the excellent ""Casino Royale"" all the way to the mediocre ""Spectre,"" each and every James Bond movie in the Daniel Craig era plays a part in making ""No Time to Die"" as good as it is. Because of the emotional investment in the story that the other movies built up, I found myself consistently enthralled by this movie - from the sheer spectacle to the smaller, more emotional moments present here, ""No Time do Die"" feels like a love letter to diehard fans of Craig and the James Bond character, and ties the 007 story that was introduced in ""Casino Royale"" together quite nicely, complete with an ending that left me very satisfied.So, what's there to like in this movie? To be quite frank, virtually everything, with the thing sticking out the most in my mind being the fantastic score by Hans Zimmer. I mean, good God, his score amplified the emotion, enhanced the intensity of the action sequences, and added depth to the drama. Luckily, even without the score, ""No Time to Die"" offers action, emotion, and drama in spades. Not since ""Casino Royale"" has a 007 movie featured this amount of exquisite drama and exciting violence. The opening sequence itself was almost unbearably intense, and was followed by what is arguably the best action sequence in the entire film. And in fact, the first hour or so of this movie will inject so much adrenaline into your nervous system that you'll likely be gripping your seat - and all of it is fueled by the remarkable undercurrent of character and emotion that has been built upon since Craig's first appearance as 007.And Craig himself is extremely good as James Bond, and it's clear that he's giving it his all, and this movie was widely reported to be his final appearance as the character. And so, it's fitting that ""No Time to Die"" not only pulls out all the stops but takes its time in connecting the threads the other movies in this series introduced. Craig and Léa Seydoux have unmistakeable chemistry, made all the more believable by how good both of their performances are. Léa is especially great as Madeleine, stealing the show by her performance (and beauty) every time she is on screen. However, the true show stealer that is undoubtedly worth the price of admission to see in action is Ana de Armas. She is stunning not only in her physical appearance but also in what she brings to her character, Paloma. She's sweet and charming with a certain sense of comedic relief about her, but she also holds her own alongside Bond during action sequences, making her one of the best, most memorable Bond girls ever.If there was anything I had to fault this movie in, it would be in its pacing and villain. For one, the movie does seem to lose a bit of steam after the first hour - after such a strong start, the movie devolves into many a scene of exposition. It's never explicitly boring, but you will definitely find yourself patiently waiting for the next moment of excitement to begin. Secondly, Rami Malek as Safin was a slightly underwhelming Bond baddie, and that may be on purpose. Without mentioning spoilers, I do see where they were coming from and why they made the choices they did with him; that said, he was by no means as interesting as ""Casino Royale's"" Chiffre or ""Skyfall's"" Silva. However, he wasn't all bad, and his role in the movie does make sense and pay off in a thematically satisfying way.While not as excellent as ""Casino Royale,"" ""No Time to Die"" stands strong as the second best of the Craig era Bond films. Benefiting from the story and characters the previous movies introduced, this is a strong send off that memorializes Craig as one of the best Bond's to ever grace the screen. I can't promise that you'll enjoy this movie as much as ""Casino Royale"" or ""Skyfall,"" but I can promise that it will deliver a conclusion that is as satisfying as it is entertaining.",No Time to Die
119,chubarova,Great,9,3 November 2021,"It's awesome movie. Firstly, the scenario is great, ot has unpredictable plot twists. Also I like that the scenario shows different places of our world. I like that film shows us the another side of James Bond (as human who can have emotions). Secondly, the cast is outstanding, Daniel Graig has the best performance as 007. Anna de Armas is amazing in her supporting role. Thirdly, the action itself and fighting are awesome. And last but not least, the main song by Billy Ailish is perfectly fitted to this film.Merci, Commander Bond!",No Time to Die
120,tccandler,Breathtaking set-pieces and tangible emotional impact!,9,9 October 2021,"Daniel Craig has had his time as Bond, but he bows out with a spectacular entry in the classic franchise. ""No Time to Die"" hits all of the iconic beats, delivering some breathtaking set-pieces, tangible emotional impact, and one of the best farewells in recent cinematic history. Ana De Armas stakes a claim as the next James Bond, with a dynamic and sexy role. Lea Seydoux brings heart to the movie. If, perhaps, there is one small quibble with the film -- it is that Rami Malek's villain is stale, clichéd and lacking in memorable charisma. Nevertheless, Craig's Bond is the best of the bunch... and I will miss his version immeasurably.",No Time to Die

Unfortunately I didn't like ""Spectre"" much, and really thought of this as ""Spectre"" part 2.There's some half decent action and a sprinkling of good gags. But I just didn't like the story. It feels like the writers wrote themselves into a corner with the last movie, and had to force their way out of it with this one. Not to mention the added pressure of making this a finale of sorts.Everytime I thought it was going to start getting good in its very long running time. It just started to drag. Until it got to the part everyone's complaining about. It's questionable ending.Craig has been a decent Bond. But who knows where the series will go after this. The ending of this really writes them into another corner.",No Time to Die
122,jamesjustice-92,It is the beauty that killed the beast,5,8 October 2021,"As soon as I left the theater after watching the 25th Bond movie I thought of that analogy. James was always unkillable and unstoppable chap with a license to kill but never has he come as close to being a superhuman as in ""No time to die"" - here he doesn't even dodge from the bullets but rather dismisses them as annoying flies buzzing around his head.In this outing James has yet again to face the enemies from the past, to come to terms with it, acknowledge it or at least that's what he tries to do. The creators of this ""fine"" motion picture have finally completely forgotten what it's like to be James Bond - the closest they got was still some 50 years ago in ""At her majesty's secret service"" when George Lazenby nailed it with his first try. And when Daniel Craig took over the role it took a turn for darker Bond, and I thought, yay, they will explore that Bond side that I liked so much but instead I received Bond so wooden it was almost unbearable to watch each of his movies and in this one the final nail to the coffin of once great character was hit.The action sequences here are unbelievably boring for an action flick and while watching you restlessly grasp for every quieter moment you get, and you'll get plenty with its overbloated runtime of 160 minutes. It was nice to hear changes in Hans Zimmer's music score who stayed true to the core of older movies instead of his usual clattering noises and made this one a good final journey through and through.Overall I'm glad the Daniel Craig era has come to the end and I don't know what future the franchise has in mind (probably more reboots again) but despite its lazy screenplay and false pretences of a motivation for the main hero the ending was somewhat unexpected, although super cheesy, but has put a worthy final touch to the long running saga.",No Time to Die
123,TheCorniestLemur,I'm...conflicted.,6,21 October 2021,"Hmmmmm.That was most of my thought process immediately after watching this: hmmmmm.If you've seen it, you'll know why my thoughts were a bit of a jumble, because there's quite a bit that this film does well, and quite a bit that it doesn't do so well, and the ending is...hmmmmm.To start with what it does well though: performances. Across the board, everyone was giving their all. Daniel Craig (I don't need to say anything else at this point), Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, they're all great once again. The new additions, Lashana Lynch, Ana de Armas, and of course my boi Rami Malek, also kick ass...although some more than others, admittedly.Action scenes: also pretty good. Nowhere near as boring as Spectre's, much better edited and structured than Quantum Of Solace's, but somewhere in the same region as Casino Royale and Skyfall, which is pretty damn good.The story...um, I'll get to that.It's directed and shot fine, much like the other films in this Bond era, is pretty well paced for being nearly 3 hours long, and I feel like it balances humour and more serious scenes well. And I really love Billie Eilish's theme for this film.So...that story, eh?While I appreciate the sheer weight of their bollocks to end this the way they did, I'm just...unsure about whether or not it has as much impact as they think it does.Bond does something unbelievably dumb right at the beginning, and it's only so that the rest of the film can happen, excrutiatingly obviously so.While I like Lea Seydoux's performance, I'm sorry, but I still don't see all that much chemistry between her and Bond. It's certainly better than it was in Spectre, but that's really not saying much.Rami Malek is really great as a Bond villain, but either I missed something or he never tells anyone what exactly his plan is. He dribbles out a boring villain speech about how he ""just wants to make the world a better place"" through killing a lot of people, and how he and Bond aren't so different, really (no I am not kidding), so in addition to not being in the film much, he ends up feeling like he's just there to be a villain.Lashana Lynch does some pretty badass things and has some funny dialogue with Bond, but other than that, doesn't really do all that much. I think you could make a pretty decent spin off about her, but in this film she feels like she's just there to be a sidekick.This film is also a goddamn tragic waste of Ana de Armas' talent. She's amazing in Blade Runner 2049, she's amazing in Knives Out, and she's amazing here...for about ten minutes, after which she's never seen again. I would have much preferred if her and Lashana Lynch had swapped roles, honestly, not because Lashana was bad, but because Ana de Armas' character is clearly inexperienced with spy work, whereas Lashana is a constant badass for the whole film. I feel like it could have been an interesting and funny dynamic to have Bond on an adventure with a rookie instead of just another expert in their field.There's a few minor plot conveniences, and one plot development involving a...small character, let's say, that I absolutely despised because they don't do anything, and because it's the most unbelievably cliche and laziest way at tugging at an audience's heartstrings and making a character ""relatable"".So at the end of the day, this fits pretty neatly into my ranking of Craig's tenure as Bond as the third best. Pretty handy how all of them have had a different score from me, isn't it?Anyway...that's the Bond films done...Dune tomorrow, hell yes I am excited.",No Time to Die

I never liked Craig, and I have had a hard time watching the last Bond movies, in fact the two before this one I never saw. The only reason I went to see this was because I hard good things from some and a lot of political things from others, so I thought a bottle of vodka and this to laugh to should be a fine evening.Sadly it was neither, but in a way it also was both of those things. This is political, but not as much as some claim, neither is this a very good movie but it is also definitely not a bad one. Whatever it is this movie is definitely not a Bond movie, more a melodramatic romantic drama with a lot of tragic characters thrown in under the brand of Bond. This is a very long movie that switch style in script and tone more times than any movie in living memory. It works enough times to be coherent, but it fails enough times to be jarring and weird.If you are looking to see a suave Bond with gadgets, beautiful women, exotic locations, lovely cars, sarcastic humour, and a great spy thriller with memorable characters, then this is not it. Not even close.If you on the other hand is looking to see a generic action flick that leans towards drama and romantic teary goodbyes, then yes this might be for you.Worst with the movie is how long and boring it is. Best about the movie - and the only time the emotional teary melodramatic romantic nonsens work - is the ending of the movie which is also leaving us with a few very relevant questions.Have they ruined the brand of Bond and is this the end of the character? Yes, in more ways than one. And that is very sad and I suppose if you care about that you might also give this movie a 1/10. Personally though I am reviewing this movie and this is not horrible. Actually I even enjoyed watching this movie. If it had been slightly shorter, the script was tighter and we could have seen at least a few more Bond-ish moments I might even argue this was a great movie. Too boring though, and too many script errors and the politics do annoy (but less than you might think) so in the end of the day I give this a 5/10. Strong 5 though, almost a 6.

128,skip-98756,Outstanding and Heartwrenching...Epic Closure.,10,10 November 2021,"Spoilers ahead! For me, Daniel Craig has been the best actor to have yet done the Bond series..He is the 1st one who brought a gritty, hardedged, cold intensity to this role that was sorely lacking in his predecessors attempts..He brought a physicality as well by doing most of his own stunt work, brutal hand to hand combat scenes and often done in a one take fashion...It will be hard to see anyone else take on this role but all things that begin, have in that seed the inevitable end that must come...Of Craigs run in the series, this has to be one of,if not THE best of the bunch...Casino Royale was the other outstanding one...for me...
Here we see a weathered, older more mature and for the 1st time, a more emotional Bond showing much more vulnerability and Humanity than any previously...He has always shied from deep interaction and yet Needed it...In this film, that part of him comes to fruition with a woman he loves,trusts, and has a child with...the ending is heartwrenching to watch...Malick was superb as a villain so cruel as to not want to leave this world without taking any chance of happiness away from Bond in the process and effectively ruining His life...The inclusion of Another 007 and a woman at that, was initially off-putting...like Really? Yet it was well written into the story, well played and tastefully done...it did not harm the storyline at all and the actress did a fine job...however, there is only one 007 and it remains to be seen how future Bond storylines will play out...This one was Epic and a tremendously satisfying farewell to arguably, the best one to date.",No Time to Die

131,Lewis_Heather787,A good conclusion to this era,7,3 October 2021,"I have to admit that I am not a James Bond fan whatsoever. Even to the point that I have only seen the films with Daniel Craig as Bond, I know I have a lot of other films to watch. However with this being the final film with Craig in the lead, I knew that I had to see how this era was going to end.My overall feelings are...........it was good but a bit too predictable in places. 70% out of 100 for me!The best aspect of the film for me was obviously Daniel Craig as Bond, what else was he going to deliver but yet again another stellar performance. I can't say for myself if he is the best Bond, I need to watch more of the older films, however in my mind it will be very hard to beat. Other actors that were also very good include, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Ana De Armas, Naomie Harris and Jeffery Wright. All did very well in their either returning or new roles in this film.However Rami Malek......*sigh*.......idk where to start. Maybe I'm biased, I have never liked him in anything he has been in recently. His villian, is pathetic and not threatening in anyway shape or form to me. Christoph Waltz is in the film for barely anytime at all, yet he was more imposing a presence !!! Its one of the biggest let downs of the film, Malek was 100% not suited for the role in my eyes.The direction from Cary Joji Fukunaga was very good. I remembered his name from when he directed the first season of True Detective. A very gorgeous film to look at from start to finish and some very clever camera work too especially in the action scenes. Overall solid work !!Sadly tho for me again the story of this film, is a little hit and miss. Some aspects are very interesting to follow, the relationship between Bond and Madeline, Bond and the new 007, Plus Bond coming out of retirement....... However majority of the story threads surrounding ""the world ending"" are just so plain, over used and boring. In fairness the film itself does acknowledge that in an exchange between M and Bond, early in the film.As I initially said it is a good film overall and a good experience in the cinema. Is it too long? No, not for me but maybe for other people. Is it the best Bond film ever? No, but did it need to be? Is it a fitting conclusion to this era? Yes !!!! For me an improvement from ""Spectre"" which has more issues than this film...................Also the ending to this film isn't shocking, just a bit surprising how it was achieved. Thank you Daniel Craig and good luck to whoever is gonna follow this up because its gonna be challenging !!",No Time to Die

I thought the story was very engaging and it always makes for a more interesting story when their is a personal reason attached. There was a lot of twist and turns I didn't see coming and I certainly was left guessing who really was on Bond's side. Rami Malek doesn't have a lot of screen time but I thought he was a very formidable villain. Always one step ahead. I think the ending could have been done a bit better with him as it didn't make a lot of sense to me why he came back. I also liked the little rivalry that Lashana Lynch's 007 has with Bond. It was fun trying to see who was the better spy. Ana de Armas has a very small part in the film but I quite liked her character. I would totally watch a spin-off with her character. Just a lot of fun. The others were good too but I think those are the main standouts (besides Daniel Craig as Bond himself). I know people out there don't like the ending, but I actually liked it a lot. I thought it was quite poignant. I thought it was a good send off for Daniel Craig. It will be interesting to see where they go next from here.",No Time to Die
134,AdrenalinDragon,On His Daniel Craig's Secret Service,7,30 September 2021,"Marking the end of an era, No Time to Die is the type of Bond film that is going to split people. Some will love the bold choices and decisions it makes, while others will detest and say it ruins what they loved about Bond. I fall more on the positive side, although for the most part I'd say it was an easy and entertaining watch compared to something like Spectre, despite some flaws in the execution and familiar Bond tropes we've all seen.Daniel Craig is really giving it all here with his performance. He knows it's his final outing as Bond and he is what makes the emotional beats work. He gets a few funny lines here too. The supporting cast from previous Bond films get to do more here, and it's shot pretty well in terms of action and never feels dull. The score by Hans Zimmer is pretty good too. Only thing I'm not sure is if the logic behind the story makes sense, but a lot of Bond stuff falls under that and sometimes you just gotta not get too nitpicky with it.Honestly, no Bond film is perfect, and it's usually the writing/plotting that drags it down. The first half feels very different to what we get in the second, and Rami Malek is not given enough screentime to really shine as a memorable Bond villain. He seems to be inspired by Dr. No, but most of the film feels like No Time to Die ends up tying pretty much every loose end and referencing all previous Bond movies in some way. Blofeld is back too and his scenes work better here than what he was doing in Spectre for the most part.The big plus that pushes this up a notch from most Bond movies for me is the ending. If you can get an emotional response/reaction out of the entire audience, then I think that's a pretty big deal that deserves some credit and praise. It's going to piss off some people, but I completely understand why they went with it and it and I suppose they wanted to leave Craig's tenure as Bond with a bang. Where things will go from here on out I don't know, but we'll see in the future.In the end, I suspect No Time to Die will be considered either the best or worst of James Bond. The film has been referred to as ""The Last Jedi of Bond movies"" and it's probably not too far off from the truth. Comparing it to Craig's other films, it falls right in the middle sandwiched between his very best and very worst for me. There's definitely an On Her Majesty's Secret Service feel to it, and I suspect the response will be polarising. In the end, I'm glad Craig ended on a good note (well I think he did anyways).7/10.",No Time to Die

136,sirwillisiv,A very fine swan song for Craig's 007...,7,12 October 2021,"Daniel Craig goes out with an adequate bang in No Time to Die, his last James Bond film. It's quite a long sit - clocking in at 2 hours and 43 minutes - but frequent helpings of fast-paced (often over-the-top) action, some welcome humor and a fairly charismatic supporting cast help maintain a consistent, edgy pace. I definitely noticed the runtime but it was by no means a slog like Spectre. It only needed to do a little bit to be so much more accessible and gripping. Just upping the fun factor worked wonders. Familiar faces return for a final outing and new ones enter the mix that I enjoyed to some degree but I personally wish were more involved. For example, Bond briefly partners up with a quirky but competent CIA agent played by Ana de Armas. This actress is far past minor character status and can serve as an engaging lead (please watch Knives Out). I was kind of let down that they only dropped her in for roughly 20 minutes. I know that's a James Bond staple to have momentary female companions one after another but she was legitimately interesting and enjoyable to watch; kicking major booty in a variety of ways and even managing to score a couple of laughs. Despite her minimal screen time, I thought she was the best Bond girl of the Craig series and I think she could carry a spin-off quite nicely (but I digress).The villain was hit-and-miss. He's got the bare essentials for a Bond antagonist - like the chilling manner of speech and the facial deformity - though he didn't get under my skin as much as I hoped. A few scenes involving him put a knot in my stomach but for the most part he was pretty underwhelming. Rami Malek was ideal casting - he definitely looks the role - but the performance didn't leave a strong enough impression. Also, like Armas' character, he's just not on screen a lot. I feel like the idea was to make him this wormy, omnipresent figure that's watching every move of Bond's and is always one step ahead, which I would be all for if the character was written to be more menacing. Overall, No Time to Die has something for Bond fans and average moviegoers just seeking an action-packed thriller. It did very well holding my attention throughout despite it's bloated runtime. When the story had to slow down it was straight to the point and never dragged. Long movies are fine but they've got to be at their game across the board and this one delivers plentiful suspense. A very fine swan song for Daniel Craig's take on 007.",No Time to Die

Couldn't James Bond simply retire and live happily ever after, with his nice family? If he did, I think I'd gladly rewatch this film, several times. Real life, outside movies, sucks enough as it is, the producers and script writers should have allowed us this bit of escapist happy ending.

Sean Connery and company were great playboys, but not believable killers.

143,hunter-friesen,A Farewell to Bond,7,10 October 2021,"Since his first cinematic appearance in 1962, James Bond has done a lot of things. He's been reincarnated five times, traveled around the globe (including space), and saved the world more times than it deserves. But the one thing that James Bond has never done is venture inward. For one of the first times in the franchise, the emotional beats are what pump the blood within the film's heart. The theme of finality rings loudly, as ""No Time to Die"" marks the twenty-fifth entry in the long-running series, as well as the fifth and final part of the Daniel Craig era.In a move that has become routine by now, Bond has left active service. This time it wasn't because of being presumed dead (even though that is true here), but because of his love of Madeleine Swann, a daughter of SPECTRE. Their attempt at a normal life goes about as expected, with bad guys ruining their Italian honeymoon. This, along with a deadly theft of a weaponized virus in the heart of London, brings James back into the fold for one last mission. Not one for nostalgia, MI6 moved on from Bond and promoted a new 007 named Nomi, who embodies the new school of espionage. Along with M, Q, Moneypenny, and Tanner, it's time once again for the forces of good to vanquish evil.The Craig era marked the MCU-ification (a term that shouldn't be taken as derogatory) of the Bond franchise, as it turned against the standalone nature of the previous entries and started to treat subsequent films as true sequels. The events of ""Casino Royale"" fed directly into ""Quantum of Solace."" And when that movie failed, ""Skyfall"" acted as a soft reboot, later filtering into ""Spectre."" ""No Time to Die"" pulls double duties by playing as a direct sequel to ""Spectre,"" but also the final bow on the whole modern Bond era.Despite the interconnectedness, long-time writers Neil Purvis and Robert Wade don't want to be restricted by franchise ties. There has never been a need to see a previous movie to comprehend the next one, with only tried and true franchise elements such as Ernst Stavro Blofeld and SPECTRE providing an integral throughline.The duo always seems to be stuck in the past with their scripts, mining the same bits, such as shaken not stirred martinis, Aston Martin cars, and megalomaniac villains hellbent on world domination. The blame for the forgettable plot - borderline incoherent at times - should rest on their shoulders.Lacking the personal connection of Christoph Walz's Blofeld and Javier Bardem's Raoul Silva, Rami Malek's Lyutsifer Safin is a second-rate Bond villain. The casting choice itself is a no-brainer, as Malek has a heavy natural supply of VE (Villain Energy). Safin seems to be a character lifted from a Shakespearean play, as he often poetically monologues into the middle-distance. There's unintentional ironic humor to Safin's plan of decimating the world's population through a virus, as it requires much more effort than what COVID-19 has been able to do.It's co-writer/director Cary Joji Fukunaga (first American Bond director) and ""Fleabag"" scribe Phoebe Waller-Bridge that want to take the franchise in a newer direction. There's an element of fun introduced that has been missing from the Craig films. Doing well to supply that is Ana de Armas, who does too well with too little screen time in a ""Knives Out"" reunion. There's also the pairing of Bond with Nomi, played terrifically by Lashana Lynch, and who is much more than the alleged SJW-takeover that some want you to believe.With their record-breaking budgets, the Bond films have always had nice toys to play with. They just needed the right person to harness their potential. Fukunaga breaks the stoic shackles set by ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre"" director Sam Mendes, returning Craig back to the kinetic destruction wonderfully employed in ""Casino Royale."" There's a particular long-take stairwell scene, similar to the one Fukunaga used in ""True Detective,"" that perfectly illustrates Bond's otherworldly combat skills. And there's the shoutout in Cuba, which plays more like a dance as Bond and Nomi attempt to retrieve a precious item.It's a testament to Craig that he's been able to keep up with the physical requirements of the role, especially with the battle scars he's accumulated over the years. But he also reaches new heights emotionally, with his Bond being the most vulnerable, both literally and metaphorically. He shares more than an animalistic sexual relationship with his Bond girls. There's something palpable under the surface, keeping you invested beyond just the set pieces.With a lot of time (163 minutes in fact) to end, ""No Time to Die"" says goodbye to the actor who ushered in a new era for James Bond. Thankfully, it does it with a sly wink and a nod to what could be in store for this long-weathered franchise.",No Time to Die
144,arabnikita,Not the real Bond,5,8 October 2021,"No Time to Die (2021)After all the delays, we finally get to see Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond and it surely feels like a farewell. He still looks in shape and skillfully performs the stunts but the fatigue can be seen on his face and it also transcends the film itself whether you take the dramatic narrative or the overall grim atmosphere. There are some cool gadgets and action sequences but it doesn't feel like it should. The thing that's missing, is the overall sexiness, elegance and thrill as the events are happening without passion and while it all looks on point, it doesn't create the ""Wow"" feeling that a James Bond movie should.In this part, a retired Bond is pulled into his last mission which carries a lot more weight than any of his previous ventures. Unfortunately, the whole ""Bond on a mission"" aspect is replaced in favor of a melodramatic plot that often feels like a drag using jokes to prevent you from getting bored. It's not a fun spy thriller anymore and that can be seen in the excessive talking and numb characters. It is a crime to have an actor like Rami Malek as a villain and simply waste him due to poor writing.A lot of people were excited about Ana De Armas being in the film. Well she is there, she is exceptional, she actually has chemistry with Craig but she is limited to 6 minutes!?!? Madeline, on the other hand resembles a rock and has absolutely zero chemistry with Bond and I could not buy into a single scene with them together. This movie also introduces a new 007 who sadly feels like a bland filler character acting full of herself and looking like Wesley Snipes the entire time. As a Russian, I spent a lot of time laughing at the ridiculousness of the narrative but it didn't impact the experience.What's mind boggling to me is how they let a director unskilled in the genre to helm a pivotal Bond movie? The guy literally put all the action in the trailer leaving nothing as a surprise. In some way, he did more damage to the franchise and it's legacy by making a convoluted drama instead of a heart pumping thrill ride like Casino Royale or Skyfall. Big thanks to Craig who left it all on the set as 007 time and time again.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",No Time to Die
145,FKDZ,Bond.,7,1 November 2021,"First off, the directing is phenomenal, in addition to the cinematography, the films looks fantastic. Action scenes are smooth and not filed with cuts. Visuals are great. And it has some creative tweaks here and there but it does play it fairly safe. Expected for a bond movie though.Music is fine, personally it didn't stick with me. Sound design was good, but personally I found guns to have less ''oomph'' than I wanted or expected.Dialog is good, though the first half of the movie is fairly bland it loosens up a little after that. Though in general there really isn't much dialog here.Now about length, did it have to be almost 3 hours, no way. And with those 3 hours, they in my opinion didn't have the right focus on making this a epic finale to Craig's bond career. The story is lengthy and likes to stick in somewhat mundane areas. In all honesty I came with out of it with just snippets, but mostly forget the majority. That said, the movie didn't feel long, oddly enough.Action scenes, I'm somewhat disappointed how this film seems to played it a bit more PG than other bonds I remember. Lots of cannon fodder of men in black suits falling over. There was lack of any hand to hand combat, something from like Casino Royale or Skyfall. In general it just lacked the extremities. A major critique though is how any gun combat feels overly scripted or choreographed, it never feels like good guys get surprised or have to recollect themselves or take aim. They just ''know'' where the bad guys are with some kind of wall hack. I gave me John Wick vibes, but without the brutality that those movies have which makes it a lot less satisfying here.Story, my major gripe with this movie is its focus on the past, and not the present. It felt like it wanted to wrap up many loose ends quickly and kind of unsatisfyingly. And then the last half of the movie decided to have a bad guy. Now Malek gives a great performance with what he's got, but it must've been incredibly weak writing. And imo he does not deserve (as a character) to have been a deciding factor in the finale. There's just too little for it to allow him to. The end was done well though, but again, needed more time.Also, I get the sentiment of Fleming's Bond being diluted to the point of unrecognition. And that the next installment will have to prove it's direction.Overall though, I didn't go in with an all to high of a bar, and it was enjoyable. Just don't go looking too deep.",No Time to Die
146,Come-and-Review,No time to conclude,8,1 October 2021,"Immediately after viewing, the conclusion of the Daniel Craig Bond saga, much as was its beginning, feels bitter but fitting, not to mention very entertaining, but nonetheless not without flaws. It is with some delay that comes the realisation that it's a great Bond film, and although imperfect, a rightful conclusion to one interconnected saga.A return to a very traditional scheme was chosen for the third act. Several of the more common tropes of James Bond films reappear, including Cold War-like fears, secret island bases, etc. As a result, the finale becomes predictable, filled with clichés. It would have been paradoxically more daring to choose a different direction, a definitive ending but in a less permanent way.Another underwhelming element is the villain. Too simple a backstory is provided, too nebulous are his motives. It seems that the production intended to shape a villain with an aura of mystery that ultimately does not appeal enough, not in the way Blofeld or Silva did, or that Lyutsifer Safin's character intended to mimic the more classic Bond villains. Sadly he relies on Macguffins rather than an elaborate plan to defeat or attempt to defeat the protagonist.If the last thirty minutes do not bring anything new to the table, the first two hours make for the most entertaining Bond since Skyfall. The best film to draw a comparison with is Mission Impossible: Fallout, which similarly does not invent new espionage tropes, but reuses successfully the common modes of espionage cinema without feeling unoriginal. Linus Sandgren's excellent cinematography provides an extra feast for the eyes.Overall, No Time to Die deserves its place among the better films of the Daniel Craig Bond saga: Casino Royale and Skyfall. Once digested the bitter outcome, and accepted the flaws, it makes for a solid Bond entry. Perhaps not the most original conclusion, but a modern classic Bond film that attempts to conclude a series that has never before had an actual storyline.(extracts from the full review on my blog, comeandreview)",No Time to Die
147,csm-78119,A decent entry in the Bond series,7,3 October 2021,"The film is about 20 minutes too long but let's not be churlish. Daniel Craig gives another excellent performance in the lead role - he really has brought a fresh breath of life to the character- and there is great support too, particularly from Lashana Lynch and Lea Seydoux. Ana de Armas adds appreciably to the fun as well! Finally, like all good films and books it also has the other two essential ingredients - great opening and a poetic ending.",No Time to Die
148,Scaramouche2004,The Eon team have lost their way.,1,3 October 2021,"Bond films have always been made to a specific formula. Here it is.A suave but ruthless British secret service agent, sent on the trail of some megalomaniacal arch villain intent on world domination usually found in a secret elaborate lair situated in some exotic location.He must have a Walther PPK tucked under his Saville Row dinner jacket as he plays Baccaret at an upmarket casino over a few vodka martini's (shaken NOT stirred of course)We want exciting high speed chases..we don't really give a toss whether it's a car chase, a speed boat chase, a motorcycle chase or a ski chase..just get 'em in and make 'em fast.We want impressive gadgets for him to play with along the way and the more buttons, switches and surprise weapons they can pack into his latest car the better.We want our Bond to be provided with a bevvy of hot beautiful women to shag (at least two a day) We want opening credit sequences with these soon to bedded beauties bouncing all over the screen in silhouette form. We want our Bond to be sticking his licenced to thrill weapon into anything with boobs and we want him to callously get up and blow them off with an off colour remark or two before they've even had chance to catch their breath!One last thing (and we cannot stress this one enough) we want James Bond to be alive at the end of it, ready to do his bit for Queen and country all over again in the next instalment.THATS ALL WE WANT. So why the hell are they not giving it us?No Time to Die changes so much of the tried and tested formula. Let's face it, they've been chipping away at it for so long now (primarily to please the woke, PC, SJW lunatics) that they had practically whittled it down to nothing before this turkey even went into production.GET THIS EON! We do not want a soppy and insipid love sick Bond. We do not want soap operas, melodramas, emotional tear jerkers or a message picture. We don't want domestic complications and we definitely don't want major cannon alterations whereby a long established arch villain is revealed to be Bonds long lost brother (I mean come on!!! Who the hell signed off on that cowpat of an idea?) We just want an exciting, action packed, edge of your seat spy caper, with big explosions, kick as$ fist fights, tongue in cheek humour, larger than life baddies and some good old fashioned male chauvinism thrown in for good measure. CAN YOU DO THAT?It's clear from the ending of NTTD that the only way forward for the character of Bond now is a full reboot. Make it a good one and go back to the source material and the original movies to find your bearings again. Whatever you do, don't gimmick up the franchise by pandering to the woke PC diversity whingers.As it stands today. Cubby Broccoli, Harry Saltzman, Sean Connery and Roger Moore must all be turning in their graves due to the creation of this pile of a--gravy!",No Time to Die
149,daniellawson-14-787057,A strong closing of the lid on the Craig era,8,5 October 2021,"POSITIVES:1) The action scenes in this film are superb. They're dramatic, brutal, hard-hitting, intense, beautifully filmed (that one take scene on the stairs - wow) and the score works brilliantly to accompany them
2) The opening 45 minutes to an hour are sheer perfection for me. I loved the horror-style opening scene. I loved visiting Vesper's grave and the emotional ""I miss you"" line. I loved the action scene that followed. I loved the opening titles. I loved Bond's reunion with Felix (they felt like such old friends) and I loved the Spectre party and the scenes with Paloma
3) I felt the film took an interesting direction in almost making M out to be a villain at one point. There is a great confrontation scene when Bond first returns to London and M shouting at Bond in this scene was very intense
4) Felix and Blofeld were both given a lot more screen time than I was expecting and a lot more high quality scenes than I was expecting. I thought they would both appear in one scene each and that it would just be a short scene to give exposition. I was glad to be mistaken as I think both of these characters are great and the actors portraying them do a magnificent job
5) In the end, for better or for worse, the film does manage to wrap up everything that needed to be wrapped up to finish off the Craig eraNEGATIVES:1) The tone felt very mixed and conflicting for me. On the one hand, it is very serious and horror-infused at times, as well as being a dramatic love story at times, but then on the other hand the plot revolves around Nano-Bots which is just silly and a lot of the dialogue is frankly cringeworthy
2) I felt it was a bit lazy to resolve the character arcs of Bond, Felix and Blofeld by just killing all 3 of them
3) Rami Malek felt very wasted as Safin. He only really gets anything to do once the final act comes around. I did enjoy him in this final act, but he just felt like a very absent villain. His motivation also seemed to be lacking, I've seen the film twice now and I understand he wants revenge on Spectre and I understand that he loves Madeleine - but why does he want to kill millions of people?4) The last film, 'Spectre', was all about demonstrating how far reaching and deadly Spectre are as an organisation; however in this film they are all killed off quickly and easily, which makes the last film seem pointless.",No Time to Die
150,gcsman,"The Bond formula still lives, though it's reaching for another level",8,16 October 2021,"Going into the theater I wasn't totally enthusiastic about seeing it (I like the Bond series but am not a devotee). But there are enough differences in this one to make me feel that they were consciously trying for more depth than the standard, though admittedly very successful, ""James Bond"" formula. It's got all the usual stuff: numerous action-packed scenes with cars, planes, hand-to-hand combat. At least one scene where the Big Villain seemingly has Bond at his mercy. Gorgeous women including both fellow agents and love interests. The fate of the world in Bond's hand, and things blowing up real good. Since this is Daniel Craig's sendoff as Our Hero, there are lots of fun little ""hommage"" bits to previous Bond tropes like his Aston-Martin; turning and firing down a tunnel just like the opening credits; and a snarky line or two after offing a villain.But there's also enough screen time for plenty of dialog and character interaction. A MAJOR plus in No Time to Die is that Daniel Craig actually gets to act! He isn't just the scripted one-dimensional action figure we kind of expect to see. The dialog may not be totally high-level compared with his previous outings, but Craig invests it with nuance and maturity that we haven't seen before.And of course the cast and production values are great as expected. We expect to see M and Q and Moneypenny and Felix Leiter along the way, and yes there they are, even playing more active roles than usual (and as you will notice when you see it, M is problematic: he's been playing outside his proper sandbox - another indication that this Bond film is trying for a bit more than its usual boundaries). New faces Ana de Armas and Lashana Lynch are fine, though they didn't get quite enough screen time.Rami Malek as the new bad guy though is a loss. He's a one-dimensional wacko whispering monologues in an incomprehensible and indeterminate accent. When did mumbling and staring eyes become a 'style'? In these films, the main villain above all should be articulate and distinct. Christoph Waltz, in his one extended scene, puts him to shame by comparison.Some details of the convoluted plot, such as it is, don't make sense but of course you can just go along scene by scene enjoying it -- fair enough. But you might walk out of the theater as I did, wondering what the heck they are going to do next.",No Time to Die
151,PotassiumMan,A grand finale for Daniel Craig as 007,10,25 October 2021,"The fifth and final Bond movie with Daniel Craig gives a conclusion to the storyline which started in 2006 with ""Casino Royale"". The adventures of 007 became a very new experience, and ""No Time to Die"" brings this series to an extraordinary ending. This Bond installment is a massive step up from ""Spectre"", the desultory entry that almost nobody remembers. Unlike that film, this one concludes in memorable and haunting fashion.The retired James Bond is drawn back into service and challenged by riddles involving a particularly cruel genetic weapon which need to be solved. The tangled web in which not only his former and once-again supervisor M is involved leads Bond to various places around the globe. He is also facing unexpected spies of a new era, like Paloma (portrayed by a wonderfully innocent and powerful Ana de Armas) or the new 007 Nomi (portrayed by a strong and badass Lashana Lynch). Christoph Waltz with his incredible strong presence on the screen, returns once more as Blofeld, the captured leader of Spectre. He has a much stronger appearance than the main villain of ""No Time to Die"" Safin, portrayed by Rami Malek. In Malek's case the mask leaves a much stronger impression than the villain himself. Madeleine Swann (a sympathetic Lea Seydoux) is Bond's love interest and a psychologist who finds herself intertwined in Safin's sinister plans.There are enough layers and intriguing plot devices to delve into, that you will barely notice the running time of this superior Bond chapter. It gives Daniel Craig a final installment worthy of his gravitas and 007 prowess. Enthusiastically recommended to Bond devotees and newcomers alike.",No Time to Die
152,Ibuk,Slightly better than the IMDB reviews will lead you to believe,6,4 October 2021,"I must admit I was initially a bit sceptical about Bond's latest offering. The delayed release only further increased my fears that this movie is doomed to fail.After finally seeing it I must admit I was a tad bit relieved.This movie is in by no means great but it is not terrible either.There is lots of action, as per expected with Bond (obviously to compensate for lack of a strong plot).Craig does well as do the the rest of the recurring actors.It does however have some shortcomings.Jeffrey Wright, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Lea Seydoux all do well in their recurring roles.Lashana Lynch is sufficient, however Ana De Armas is terrible in her role and has very little to do.Waltz is wasted here I thought, if you bring Blofeld back at least have the decency to make him the lead villain!.Instead of Blofeld we have Safin, who is devoid of any character traits or mannerisms a Bond villain should have. The villain was dull beyond belief.Personally Malek was the wrong choice for the role as a leading Bond villain, he didn't have the charisma to pull this off.Craig has said in the press that this will be his last Bond movie, in my opinion Craig is leaving at the right time before he becomes embarrassing in the role (like Moore in A View to a Kill).In that respect, it is a fitting exit for Craig as Bond with some nicely done emotional moments.Overall, this is not the best Bond movie but I would rank it at No 19 on my rankings of James Bond movies ranked best to worst just above Tomorrow never dies.",No Time to Die
153,bastille-852-731547,Craig's swan song mostly satisfies,7,9 October 2021,"""The name's Bond, James Bond."" This simple phrase has defined not only one of the most important film franchises of modern cinema, but an icon of the spy fiction genre himself. I've always loved Bond films, and was looking forward to see how they would send off Daniel Craig after five (including this one) films over a time span of 15 years. Some more casual viewers might question whether ""No Time to Die,"" which was delayed 18 months due to the pandemic, is worth such a long wait after all. While it's far from perfect, my answer is generally yes, for fans at least.This film picks up soon after the disappointing ""Spectre"" ended. After a brief prologue scene, a scene more characteristic of typical Bond opening scenes, and the opening credits, we find 007 on retirement in Jamaica. He's called back out of retirement by a CIA friend who is asking him to help rescue a kidnapped scientist. I won't say anything else about the plot, but suffice it to say there are twists and turns aplenty to make even seasoned viewers both shaken and stirred. Craig is excellent as Bond, portraying more range and nuance in his performance than in his previous Bond films. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag: Lea Seydoux's acting as Madeline Swann is a bit uneven, while Lashana Lynch does a generally strong job playing a new agent. Ana de Armas and Ralph Fiennes are both great, but have minimal screen time (a late-in-the-first-act action set piece in Cuba with both Bond and de Armas' character is a pure delight.) Even though Rami Malek is a very strong actor, I found both his performance as--and the character himself of--the villainous Safin to be underwhelming. His character is very underutilized in the movie, and both his personality and motives are bland and predictable. The action scenes aren't always consistently great--but when they work, they work extremely well. It's also plenty entertaining to see all the trademarks that make an 007 movie what it is on the big screen for the first time in five years.The main flaw of ""No Time to Die,"" however, is its length and somewhat uneven tone. The film simply fails to justify its 163-minute runtime, and sizable chunks of the second and the beginning of the third acts could have been edited down without taking too much away from the story. The plot structure, pacing, and tone can all be somewhat disjointed, as each of these elements are balancing a multitude of factors (action scenes vs. Plot and character, the darker and more gritty tone of Craig-era bond vs. Escapist thrills, Bond's ""hero's journey"" vs. Development of supporting characters, etc.)Still, ""No Time to Die"" is undoubtedly an entertaining watch for those of us who are 007 fans. Despite its narrative challenges, it still generally succeeds in bringing the Craig era to a thrilling and cohesive conclusion. Recommended. 7/10.",No Time to Die

You can't do that. It has never happened before, for a good reason. James Bond is never supposed to actually die. We as an audience like seeing him in dangerous situations, but, he always was able to turn things around and ultimately win. That is why we loved him. By definitively killing the character here, it will never be the same again when they now try and bring him back.This was the worst creative decision that they could have ever made, it is like making a fun Christmas movie and then giving Santa terminal cancer at the end. It might shock the audience, but, that does not mean that it is good story telling.Here is what I predict.

158,cdjh-81125,Daniel Craig's Swan Song,8,26 October 2021,"No Time To Die was one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I love this franchise so much and in particular the Daniel Craig era which has had a massive impact on me as a film lover with it really helping me to shape my early opinions of cinema as a whole and I essentially had to be consoled by all my friends and family when this film was initially delayed. So with all the extra waiting time I did have concerns whether or not this film could live up to my expectations. Thankfully, while I do not think it is the finest Bond film, I think this is a very solid entry to the franchise and an extremely satisfying end to the arc of Daniel Craig's films.More than any other Bond film, No Time To Die feels particularly character based with almost every main cast member playing an important role. I was extremely surprised with the portrayal of Bond in this film, so much so that I think I needed a second viewing to ultimately decide how I felt about it. It was just a more vulnerable and emotive portrayal of the character than I was expecting but I've ultimately found myself really liking it. Realising the finality of this film and how character based it is it made sense for the filmmakers to really reach Bond's inner psyche and Daniel Craig was outstanding as always. Madeleine was one of the better parts of Spectre and I actually liked her better in this film, they gave her a good character arc and the connection between her and Bond was much more believable. I loved seeing Felix Leiter back in this film after such a long absence and his chemistry with Bond was on point and I think Jeffrey Wright has proven himself as the best incarnation of the character. Ralph Fiennes was once again great as M, I loved Ben Whishaws version of Q and that was no different in this film, Naomie Harris is once again great as Moneypenny but she doesn't really get a whole lot to do in the film. I also thought newcomers Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas were fantastic with them adding a lot to the film and ended up being 2 of my favourite parts overall.I also think the technical presentation here is phenomenal. I would love to see Cary Fukunaga direct more blockbusters cause he did fantastic work here. Long shots and restrained editing made for exhilarating action sequences that had me white knuckled. It also great to see action scenes places in a variety of environments that kept them feeling fresh and exciting, for an almost 3 hour film that is certainly saying something. I also thought the cinematography here was fantastic, again making use of the variety of locations to make them all feel distinct. I thought Hans Zimmers score was solid but I wouldn't say it stood out to me as much as David Arnold of Thomas Newman's work on the past Craig films but it was definitely always effective for me. I also adored Billie Eilish's theme song but I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by the opening credits. They just felt very jumbled and all over the place but in all fairness having listened to the song for over a year and a half did set me up for unreasonably high expectations for what they could be.I really though this film did a good job at closing out the Craig era in a definitive way. The finality of it hits very early on and it continues to build and build to an extremely satisfying finale that gave me chills while emotionally moving me at the same time. The tying together of the other films done in Spectre was done fairly poorly but since it was already established I believe it allowed this movie to roll with it from the start and fit it into the story more smoothly. Any issues with it I blame more on Spectre than No Time To Die.Despite the fact that I did really enjoy this film overall, it's not perfect, I did have some issues with the story this film chose to focus on. While I think it did allow for good character moment and ultimately a fulfilling end I just didn't find the primary plot that interesting. It required a large amount of exposition to set up the threat that Bond was facing and having seen it twice now I still haven't been able to fully wrap my head around all the details of it. Because of all the plot threads this film is trying to balance I think the runtime suffers as a result as I did start to feel the longevity during my second viewing. Granted a shorter runtime may have made the film feel for choppy but I still don't think the film was justified in being as long as it was. I also felt the tone wasn't always consistent with the use of humour feeling more jarring than any Bond film I can think of.However, by far the biggest disappointment for me was the antagonists. Rami Malek gives a great performance as Safin and I felt the menace in his character every time he was in screen. I just felt that he was massively underdeveloped. There are attempts at his backstory but they are sparing and vague so I didn't ultimately understand what his motivations were for what he was doing. They also made the same mistake they did in Spectre with setting up a villain with a great introduction just to forget about him for a large chunk of the runtime and have him show up again to close to the end. It was great to see Waltz back in this film however it would have been nice to see a bit more of him after how badly he was underused in Spectre. The henchmen were fine, if forgettable, additions and I ultimately found David Dencik's character it be too cartoony for his own good.While it's not without it's underwhelming aspects, I overall really enjoyed No Time To Die. I wish Rami Malek was better utilised and the primary story was more interesting but the well rounded characters and technical presentation mostly make up for the faults in the script. As an ending I though the film delivered on all fronts and while I'll be sad to no longer see Craig in the role he's more than proven himself to be the best Bond ever put to screen. I do not envy the actor that succeeds him.8.5/10 - A- (Fantastic)",No Time to Die

162,chevolek,A mess of a Farewell (I won´t watch any more 007 movies),5,7 October 2021,"I enjoyed all of Craig´s previous Bond movies but this one sadly fails on so many levels I don´t even know where to begin:1- The theme song by the weird singer Billie Eilish was extremely weak and boring compared to all themes of previous 24 Bond movies. They chose her to target newer generations to follow the next 007 films (unfortunately, it looks like there won´t be any more James Bond in the next films).2- Now there is a new 007 and it´s now an african-british woman (played by british actress Lashana Lynch). Ian Fleming´s novels were written with a white male as a 007 and the 007 number is not suposed to be given to another agent.3- Q is represented as a homosexual. I guess this was also targeted to gay people as recent movies (including children´s movies) are now doing the same thing. None of the previous 007 movies talked about sexual orientation.4- James Bond (Daniel Craig) dies (or should I say, commits suicide). He could have survived (the downside was, he would never be close to his love interest (played by french actress Léa Seydoux) and Bond´s 6 year-old daughter, therefore, he chose to kill himself which is none sense.This is the first 007 movie where James Bond dies.Craig didn´t want to continue as Bond since the wrapping of Skyfall and many people loved him as he was embraced as the best Bond so I guess the producers decided to kill him so people could let him go and also the producers were planning to create a new female 007 which seems to be the plan.5- The movie lacks of a real villain like previous Bond films. Rami Malek´s character was weak compared to previous Bond villains.I really was disappointed with the way the are changing one of the best and longest franchises in movie history and I didn´t like the way they got rid of Craig, he deserved a better movie.I do not think I will watch another 007 film after this.",No Time to Die

165,patrickfilbeck,"Don't do forced homage, please. Do a Bond movie.",5,6 October 2021,"First of all, in far too many moments this film is too far removed from a Bond film. The action scenes are too exaggerated and more like a bad homage to the Die Hard series, the shootouts get rampant. The style and elegance of the classic Bond idea are missing. Likewise, the Bond Girls, a real Q-moment and a consistent script are missing. The attempted circular argument to bring the beginning and end of the film together fails. But here are a few more obvious mistakes:The martini, alcohol and ""Bond. James Bond"" moments seem more cobbled in, than naturally flowed into the script.The organization Specter and Blomfeld are degraded.The motivation of the (well-played) enemy is questionable and ultimately shallow.The motivation of MI-6 at the end of the film is simply not told, otherwise the holes in the plot would become obvious.Felix's fate is set too early in the film and loses its effect with the playing time.Bond-optimism is missing.The movie is predictable far too often. This is especially true of the end of this last Daniel Craig Bond.James Bond would never give up.And then the politics forced on this movie:The female 007 as a replacement for a retired James Bond is not the problem. The problem is that a Mary-Sue was created here again, who can just do everything again. These characters are definitely not doing women any favors. Her toughness is far too often mocking, and there is also the fact that her character development is completely absent. Why she has an antipathy towards Bond at the beginning can still be understood (even if it is badly written and clichéd), but her development into a friend and / or admirer of Bond falls by the wayside.References to racism are perfectly fine if they are done right. Otherwise they are a disservice to criticism of racism. Why is the Russian scientist dragged through the film alive and with a comment that is simply pulled out of the air, he is killed with a brisk phrase on his lips? Poor storyteller performance.Why do you make a Bond film when you know what the essence of the character is, but you actually wanted to make something SJW-esque?Questions after questions, but now to the last: Why then another 5 stars?The actors' performances are mostly good.The evil headquarters are cool.The cinematography is convincing.The music works as a Bond soundtrack.Individual scenes work, such as the great beginning.",No Time to Die

167,rmirchandani,No Time To Die proves that Daniel Craig is the ultimate James Bond,10,11 October 2021,"The 2021 film James Bond: No Time To Die starring Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Léa Seydoux, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch, is Daniel Craig's final outing as the iconic character. It served as a fitting and emotional send-off to Daniel Craig's James Bond. It did everything that it was supposed to. It shocked me, amazed me, made me emotional, made me feel good, and put a huge grin on my face. The film is filled with great action sequences and moved at a fast pace. It did not feel like a 2 hour and 43-minute movie. No Time To Die is one of the most rewatchable James Bond movies and sticks in your mind long after the credits.Ana de Armas's character was hyped up so much, yet only had a minor part in the movie. I was slightly disappointed by how much screen time she got. However, she still gave a memorable and show stopping performance.I loved the opening intro of the film. It reminded me of Sean Connery's Goldfinger. No Time To Die edges out Goldfinger by a large margin. Sean Connery does not bring the same energy to the iconic character as Daniel Craig. I'm slightly biased because I grew up watching the Daniel Craig James Bond movies. Daniel Craig's iteration of the titular character will always have a special place in my heart.Rami Malek's portrayal of the Bond villain Safin was nothing more than exceptional. Whenever Rami Malek was onscreen the mood of the scene becomes eerie and suspenseful. Safin proved to be a menacing and intimidating Bond villain even with his limited screen time. It worked in his favour because it made the character mysterious and even more creepy.No Time To Die is a fast paced, exhilarating and beautifully shot blockbuster with a terrific score by the young artist Billie Ellish. I was afraid that the soundtrack would be too sombre and melancholic, but after watching the film my views changed. I have already purchased the soundtrack on iTunes to listen to it on repeat.To conclude, No Time To Die is an immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience which captured the sheer essence of a James Bond movie. It delivered on all levels. Daniel Craig's fifth and final outing as James Bond is thrilling, riveting, emotional, funny, action packed and poignant. No Time To Die is tied with 2012's Skyfall and became not just my favourite film of 2021, but one of my all-time favourite films.*Daniel Craig's comedic timing was on point in this film. His iteration of James Bond will always be remembered as the most human and developed.*I did not expect James Bond to die at the end. The final minutes of the film was poignant and a tribute to Daniel Craig's James Bond.*The title perfectly sums up the film's history with its release date. It is ironic, a tautology and a double entendre. Throughout the film, the characters often reference the film's title.*Although it might have not been intentional, but l loved the 'homages' to 2018's ""A Quiet Place"" and 1986's ""Top Gun.""Final verdict: 10/10Daniel Craig's James Bond films ranked:
1. Skyfall (2012)

168,schroederagustavo,Good Farewell,6,3 October 2021,"No Time to Die has some pretty good action scenes and good performances all around. Rami Malek is good in the villain's role, although his character is not as interesting as I would have liked. It's similar to what happens to Christoph Waltz in the last movie. The movie was a little too long, for my taste, I think they could have cut some scenes out. Also, I found the plot to be a little confusing, at times I didn't know why the characters were doing certain things. I get that it's a spy movie and the plot can be complicated, but complicated is not the same as confusing. This was confusing. However, I like the more mature Bond that we see here and I really like the way the movie ended. I don't think it's one of the best Craig Bond films, but it's definitely worth a watch.",No Time to Die
169,theredsky,No Time To Die Review,8,26 October 2021,"An immensely satisfying conclusion to Daniel Craig's James Bond. It isn't a perfect movie by any means but its highs hit so high that they are impossible to ignore. All of the performances here are great. Craig gives his best performance as Bond. He feels more vulnerable than his other films. His range of emotion here is great and much better than the other films. Lea Seydoux is a major improvement from the previous film Spectre. Her character there was weak but here, she is so much more fleshed out and that's the same for Christoph Waltz even though he has very limited screen time. Ana De Armas is a scene stealer here. I absolutely loved her character and performance and I would love to see more of her in the future. Rami Malek gives one of the best Bond villain performances but the issue with him is that his character is criminally underutilized. He isn't in the film a lot and I really wish he was because he was that good. The action set pieces here are fantastic. Each set piece works to up the previous one and it works with the final action set piece being a one man army scene and I loved it. The cinematography, direction, and music are all fantastic. Hans Zimmer produces one of the best Bond scores ever while Cary Joji Fukunaga's Direction gives the film a sense of finale and scale. The emotion in this film is off the charts. I'm not lying when I see the end of the film almost made me cry. The film knows how to tug at the audiences heartstrings and it really tugs hard here. If you love James Bond then this film is essential viewing. Please check it out when you can.",No Time to Die

176,vonnoosh,Its easy to blame COVID for this.....,3,10 October 2021,"Entertainment industry took as much a hit as anything else from the virus but that time could have went to writing a better script or tightening the movie in editing. The script reminds me of a comedy skit from the 90s on MST3k where they sought to make a super secret agent attuned to 90s sensibilities. He says respect my boundaries when threatened, refuses a sexual encounter saying he is in a committed relationship with someone special and accuses the villain of being codependent after he reveals his scheme to control emotions. The mock script was called ""The Spy Who Hugged Me"". 25 years later, we have come full circle and are now living the jokes from the past as though they are genuinely good ideas now. Um, they're not....The 2 hours and 40 minutes just made me think Daniel Craig made one Bond film too many. I admit I never really liked him in the role and always felt Daniel Craig looks like a weird combination of Vladimir Putin and Roman Polanski but now he looks like a very tired and disinterested James Bond. Two things the character could never afford to be if he wants to survive.Disappointed they didn't push harder to make a change before this movie. The franchise is now in desperate need to freshen its image instead of building off of Spectre which is now 6 long years old and not much better than this. It will be difficult to follow with a worse movie than this one but I am sure they will try.",No Time to Die

Rami Malek isn't anything exceptional in this but he was tailor made for this role.The 163 minute runtime is perfectly edited in such a way that all characters' screentime is completely used well even the ones with minor roles like Ana De Armas and Christoph Waltz play a huge part in this film.

178,mitchell5954,An Ideal Finale For Daniel Craig's Bond,9,15 October 2021,"No Time to Die is the latest James Bond movie, as well as the last in the Daniel Craig canon. This film has been a long time coming. It was delayed over and over due to the pandemic, but I finally got to see it in the theatre. This is actually my first theatrical experience in over a year and a half, and it felt good to finally get back to the theatre to see a good blockbuster. While I haven't seen all the movies, I am a fan of James Bond, particularly the Craig movies. Craig's Bond is what introduced and got me into the franchise as a whole. Unlike other Bonds, there isn't an entry in Craig's line I outright dislike. I have liked every entry, though some more than others. Regardless, I admit I was not super excited for this film. This is mainly because I felt it wasn't needed. I have my issues with Spectre, but I felt it made for a solid conclusion to Craig's Bond. Not that this film wasn't. I felt this film did an ideal job convincing me that this film warranted being the final chapter. This film actually made me like Spectre a bit more because of its existence. In short, I do recommend this film to any Bond fan, particularly one that has grown-up with Craig's Bond like I have.Since this is the final chapter, I might as well give my brief thoughts on the other Craig Bond movies, starting with Casino Royale. This film is one most people consider the best in Craig line, as well as one of the best Bond movies period. While I do like the film overall, I have to say it's probably one of my least favorite Craig Bond movies. It looks great, is well shot, and has one of the most tension-filled scenes n Bond history with the casino poker game. The Bond girl Vesper was also good, though I did not entirely buy the love story between her and Bond. I have the same problem with it I have with many Bond movies in that it tends to run a bit too long and gets bogged down with unnecessary subplots. I felt the first hour could have been trimmed down and it would have improved the pacing. There are two action set pieces that, while well shot and choreographed, went on too long, to the point where I was exhausted before even the halfway point. The main villain Le Chiffre was also a bit weak; my least favorite Craig Bond villain. Overall, still good but a bit overhyped.Subsequently, I felt its sequel Quantum of Solace to be one of the most underrated Bond movies. That mostly has to do with its length. It's one of the shortest Bond movies at less than two hours. As such, the pacing is very fast. It hits the ground running and never stops. A lot of people have problems with the action scenes and the villain. I liked most of the action set pieces and the villain Mr. Green, while not great, I felt was serviceable. The film still looks great and Daniel Craig gives a great performance like always. It also has my favorite Bond girl of the Craig films who actually has an arc that parallels Bond's.Skyfall, in my opinion, is amazing and my favorite Bond movie of all time. It my all-time favorite spy movie as well. It's the first Bond movie I saw in the theater and is what made me a fan of James Bond and spy movies on the whole. What makes it so good is not just the plot, themes, or Craig giving his best performance, but the villain. Mr. Silva is my favorite Bond, as well as one my favorite villains in movies. Havier Bardem kills it. It's just as long Casino Royale, but you don't fell it. Every scene feels necessary, and very tightly paced. It dials down the action and lets the characters and story breathe a little, which is definitely a service, but the action is still good. It has the single best climax in Bond history.Spectre was a film I was highly disappointed in when I first saw it. This was because it was the follow-up to Skyfall and made by the same director. As a film on its own it's a solid fun Bond movie. It looks amazing. The opening scene at the Day of The Dead Parade was great. The scene of the Spectre meeting in Rome oozes atmosphere and I love it. The action was well executed. However, like Casino Royale, I could feel its length in places. I felt the climax went on too long. More accurately, the film has two climaxes, and it felt a bit overstuffed. Plus, the villain has problems. Christoph Waltz's performance did a lot to heighten the material and make an otherwise lame villain fun to watch on screen. But his motivation is just ridiculous. Its clear they were trying to emulate Silva again, and it did not work this time around.Now finally how does No time to Die rank with the other movies? I'd say this is among my favorite Bond movies, both in Craig's line and in overall. Skyfall is still my favorite, but I'd put this in second place. As final film in a film series it did its job well. This is the longest Craig film, and perhaps the longest Bond movie ever, but like Skyfall I felt it did a good job as justifying its length than Casino Royale or Spectre. It still looks great and has some great action. Though also like Skyfall the action is toned back here and focuses more on plot and characters, which is the right choice for a sendoff film. But the action is still good, with arguably the best climax after Skyfall.The main villain here Safin is probably my favorite villain after Silva. He's not in the film a ton, but when he is he just radiates menace while being very subdued in his performance. I also like the new 007 character they introduce. I didn't think I would, but I did enjoy her character. I just wished she had a bit more to do in the film.As for the opening, I thought it was okay. I liked the visuals, but the song was rather meh. It might grow on me, but right I'd say it's my least favorite opening of the Craig Bond movies. What I do like is that this is the most gadget heavy movie in the Craig line. That and the climax location made this film feel a lot like a traditional over-the-top Bond movie in modern day. This is very interesting because the Craig line started out as a grittier and more grounded version of Bond, but with every new entry they slowly worked their way back to the more traditional Bond tropes. Many might be turned off by this, but I surprisingly thought they handled the transition quite tactfully.Overall, if You're a James Bond fan see this and see it in the theater if you can. If there's and movies you need to see in theaters this year it's this and Dune.",No Time to Die

The cinematography is jaw droppingly beautiful, really making you want to visit these locations and apart from Rami every character feels well fleshed out and doesn't outstay there welcome. The ending, at least to me, felt quite unexpected and Daniel Craig delivers a nice send off to his version of the character but in the end if you don't like Bond films this weren't be for you, if you do thought this is a fun time if not dramatically different from what has come before.",No Time to Die

Some of those scenes alone would have gotten a 10/10. The opening scene in particular was strong. And more broadly, I liked the style of filming throughout.2. The casting & acting was spot on. As always, Daniel Craig did a great job. Re supporting cast, notably I liked Lashana and the Bond girls (both Lea and Ana). I also liked Rami - although I never felt fully immersed in his character; I just kept thinking that it's Rami acting (I can't pinpoint exactly what the issue was, but he wasn't a scary villian).3. It doesn't feel like a typical Bond movie, but to me, it's not a negative point. Because characters can develop over time & the character has aged 15 years from 1st movie to last.*The Bad*1. I think the storyline was too convoluted. They were perhaps overambitious with the storyline; trying to combine multiple objectives for Bond's character & tie up loose ends. Whereas I always find the best movies are the ones with 1 clear aim which runs throughout & a clear 3 part structure (i.e. Beginning, middle, end).2. For some reason it also felt like there was *a lot* of dialogue (and I'm the type who's typically really into movie dialogue).3. Too long. I generally think that producers should try to stay around the 2 hours mark.Overall I enjoyed it.

He is not my fave Bond, that is Connery. It was great that there finally was something to watch at the movies after months of waiting. If you like Skyfall/Spectre you will like this movie also.Though that ending? The lack of any good looking females in it. No good gadgets either. Not really a bond film more of the skyfall style bond. I guess that is it for the series. It is a shame it blew out on a low note.Casino Royale>Quantum Of Solace.>Spectre>No Time To Die>Skyfall.",No Time to Die
185,YabbaDabbaDabba,Conclusion: At Least I Didn't Have Trouble Finding A Seat,3,11 October 2021,"James Bond hits a new high in lows! First, I never liked Craig as James Bond so I am clearly biased. He has no sophistication, and should have stuck to ""working class"" roles, which suit him. Now for his last Bond movie (thank goodness).1. Too, too long and also too, too long.2. James Bond was missing, including the script, action, personality, direction and production for a 007 movie. Plus a lot of wasted talent from actors (spellcheck changed it from talent to toilet, which somehow seems appropriate). I will just stay clear of the politics oozing from the pot like a bad batch of oatmeal (with my sincere apologies to the oatmeal).3. Craig is just too pedestrian to play James Bond. I needed to reemphasize that he didn't (and could not) become sophisticated as he goes off the Bond cliff.4. This hound bays at the moon from start to finish. I believe the 007 franchise is officially dead and hopefully buried.5. The Hollywood styled clowns went overboard in their double quest of go woke and end up broke.6. This was no James Bond movie. Help, help, I want my money back for two tickets.I grew up with 007. I stayed at a movie location on Paradise Island. I love Aston Martins, and own a tuxedo. I've read every book more than once (only Fleming's books twice) and watch the movies over and over as they show up on TV. And just for the record, Sean Connery is the only real James Bond, but the others did okay. Well, except upper lower class Craig, who looked out of place in a tux and just never could pull it off as James Bond. A short thug, maybe, but James Bond, negatory.I wish I had waited to see it free next week on the cartoon channel. That is, if they even want this stinker.",No Time to Die

187,TreeFiddy53,Really liked it!,8,10 October 2021,"Daniel Craig's (DC) movies have had ups and downs, and No Time To Die (NTTD) was SOOO much more ""UP"" than I expected it to be; a really good finale for DC! If you like to watch a GOOD movie, you'll really like it. It's a showcase of everything DC has brought to the character.DC did a great job! The supporting cast was good. I wish the trailer didn't have as many action scenes but that was great. People didn't like the villain as much and feel that the movie was long at 2h 43m - I didn't necessarily mind the villain, (Raoul Silva > Le Chiffre > Safin > Oberhauser > Dominic Greene) and I would have watched another 30 mins of NTTD, if they had more.I still think visually Skyfall was so much better. As a story, I wouldn't be surprised if you liked NTTD more; there are elements from some of the previous movies (+ emotional stuff...?)
If you are a HUGE Bond fan, you'll either be happy that there was a little bit all the traditional Bond stuff and then a lot more that you won't expect; OR, you're gonna say ""I WaNt A bONd mOvIe bE *THIS* wAY, and it's NOT. So it's TRASH!"" in which case, get a life. I don't understand your obsession with what a ""typical Bond Girl"" should be. *smh*

188,Harry_Gleeson,Casino Royale by far Craig's best Bond,7,1 October 2021,"It's safe to say that Daniel Craig has done a pretty good job playing cinemas most iconic spy and in his final outing as 007 he yet again produces another solid film.It is by no means a perfect film but this culmination lasting 15 years provides thrilling action sequences (synonymous with Bond) a consistent narrative and an ending that I'm sure will satisfy hardcore and easy going fans alike.No Time to Die definitely has one of the best action sequences, not just in Craig's tenure, but in terms of the franchise as a whole. I'll keep it quiet as to what it is but the film really pulls out all the stops with its action. Brilliant.I thought the script did become slightly too witty for Bond at times which could've been used better in different situations. Also Rami Malek's villain (Safin) didn't quite do it for me in relation to other antagonists the franchise has had before. Quite cliche.But No Time to Die is yet again a very good Bond film that is fitting departure for arguably the best Bond there's been. Casino Royale still holds up as Craig's best for me, but this is a blast from start to finish and I certainly recommend a trip to see it.",No Time to Die
189,gabethedinosaur,The final James Bond saga has made a final comeback,10,12 October 2021,Daniel Craig will be remembered as the best James Bond in cinema history . When I saw Skyfall 9 years ago I was absolutely amazed of seeing James Bond facing so many enemies and many ladies trying to convince him of taking the final end game . And I Believe James Bond has finally ended his game by facing a new villain more power than the other ones he's faced in the previous sagas.,No Time to Die
190,chris_rowe-881-168820,Agenda ruined what could've been great,7,11 October 2021,"I like Craig as Bond, I think he has the look, the cool factor and just everything needed to be the man. I personally thought it was a ridiculous decision to kill him off and after the credits put James Bond will return!, how will he? Before it was just new actors, but the character was never killed, will they be diving into prequels for the more popular films, was this the last Bond set in the present or future? So many questions.The film started brilliantly, before the title sequence with one of the worst theme songs I've heard, it became less action and more story driven which was fine, the locations were beautiful, the characters were a mixed bag and the villain was marmite, I enjoyed his performance but found his reasonings shallow and forced, it felt more like they wanted to do one story for Madeline and then force it to link the characters, it felt unnatural.There's this awful feeling of political agenda running through this film, I can't think of a bond film where it hasn't felt he's the main point of the film like this one did. Then comes to the one thing I hated most, I am an advocate for equality but 20/21 has made me question when I see people in roles that I'd never think twice about before, it makes me sad, was Nomi cast because of PC reasons or because she was the best female for the job? I personally felt she had very little presence on screen, no authority and delivered a really average performance, if she's the next focal point then the series will collapse. The 6 people I went with all said the same, it's a horrible thought to have that quotas exist or point scoring by pandering exists, when equality should just be a thing that's standard. I absolutely believe women can be badasses, that they can lead action films and if it's done right they are phenomenal. If forced or done for any other reason it's transparent and the film suffers.I hated the gunplay, it's a common annoyance that people are so bad with guns especially in scenes where he's literally standing still close enough that they still miss is annoying, I get it makes him look cool but it's just unrealistic and stupid that none of these guys can use a gun. I found the moments felt more forced and less organically cool like older bond films.I enjoyed the Madeline and Matilde characters, thought they were both superb and she was adorable, I don't fully understand the need to kill him off over doing a happy ending other than to go in a different direction. It's kinda do or die as if they get it wrong then the whole multi decade legendary franchise goes up in smoke!The film isn't 007 the position held by a man called bond, it's James Bond who is a 007, not every film or franchise that's male led has to change, it's ridiculous to even have to think that we need a female lead, surely there's enough creativity to create new franchises with female led heroes? I just hate that tradition is made to feel sexist or wrong for always being male. I for one will boycott a female led bond out of principal, because it isn't being done for the right reasons.I can't see the next step other than the series now focusing on 007 rather than a main character name, which is really sad.I enjoyed the movie but hate coming out of the cinema having political and agenda driven debates because of things being forced into entertainment to placate rightfully angry people but using the wrong methods to correct poor past behaviour .Shame that Craig's last outing didn't generate excitement for the future just worry and confusion.",No Time to Die
191,El-Ak,What an epic movie and final!! And what one hell of a ride we had the privilege to witness!,9,1 October 2021,"I can say it with full mouse that this is the best Bond film (for me) in the whole saga. Whatever you hoped for you will find it in this movie. The realistic one-shot action that make you feel every punch, creative stunts that were more than epic, an epic cinematography along with lightning that made the scenes artistic as possible, a breathtaking score and who's better than Hanz Zimmer to write the score for Craig's last ride as Bond, a horror and full of surprises beginning that I consider one of the best movie beginnings and finally one hell of a conclusion to this saga.The Performance of Craig was the one that we deserved an epic solid one that delivered every emotion and feeling that Bond felt. Also the great effort he did in the stunts was very obvious on the screen and I feel like he spent every drop of blood and sweat to make these scenes as great as possible. Also Léa's performance was pretty good, overrated at moments but still great. I can't also emphasize on how great Ralph Fiennes is as it's his profession to give us a solid performance at every movie he makes. And finally you got a whole action sequence for Bond's Aston Martin DB5 which was the finest appearance for the car at the whole franchise.Hanz Zimmer my god what a score you created for this movie. No one could have helped deliver this movie in terms of the score better than you.His score was almost synchronizing with every move of the scenes that at points you will fell it's attached to the scene as one unseparated thing.The Cinematography was wonderful where every scene was like a piece of art even the ending shot along with the beautiful color grading for every scene. You will see sharp scenes, colorful scenes and dark scenes that gives your eye the feeling of that you have seen much as it's runtime is near 3hrs.All these elements are combined together with enthusiasm for two actors, Rami Malek (the antagonist) and Ana De Armas (as Paloma).Ana De Armas was great. I mean I feel kinda fooled for using her for the advertisement of the film while she was more like a guest in the movie about 20 minutes or less but she delivered her part perfectly and she was so funny.As for Rami Malek, It was only the beginning of the movie that he was great at while the rest of the film he didn't even appear much and when he appeared he wasn't doing anything but talking making you feel that anyone could have done thia role. I mean what kind of an antagonist is this that doesn't appear much on the screen and lacks depth especially at his second to last scene that made the whole segment before it meaningless?! I will let you figure it out yourself.The intro of the movie was soo late that I felt the feeling I had after this awesome action packed beginning was fading but still was so artistic and quite impressive actually. Bond was also a bit invincible at points which was kinda unbelievable but still great .Also the finale of the movie you can't have help but have a mixed feelings about it because despite being so much epic that you could have never imagined a more epic finale, you also feel like it was like this because Craig is retiring from the role which makes me a bit upset but still can't resist or imagine a more suitable ending.I had the privilege to witness this movie at the movie theatre yesterday and I was willing to watch two movies, however after watching it for nearly 3hrs, I felt satisfied and not in need to watch a second one. It was on of the best cinematic experiences for me as someone who goes to movie theatres regularly. I would have give it a 10/10 but a solid 9.5/10 isn't much difference. I beg you not to miss this one.",No Time to Die

194,ha77y73ad97,No time to think on what's just happened,8,12 October 2021,"For me this really was a fitting ending to a story that started back in 2006. From the opening moments of Bond being given the 00 status to conclude in the way this did cements this character development and arc, not just as, the best within the franchise but in wider films of this genre. No other traditional franchise that releases a movie every 3 to 4 years can keep the interest and level of development up. No matter of the direction of the writing or directing this still has the depth of an overarching story.The 1st act of this film is quite possibly one action roller-coaster of emotions leading straight from where Spectre left off! Providing back story to a character that not much is known about. A opening scene straight out of a horror film, thanks Mr Fukunaga for that! Then to the present day where I think this chase can only be beaten by the opening of Quantum of Solace with that battered DBS. This just had a fresh feel, not to say that after 2 films from Sam Mendes tenure werent an absolute marvel to behold. This had another layer of grit on top of an already gritter version that the campy 90s. The return of Felix is also just great after Jeffery Wrights triumph in Westworld, What If and soon to be the Batman I would not be sad to see a spin off of the character. The whole Cuba mission is great, from the bumbling Ana de Armas' Paloma but can certainly deliver a punch when needed. Just wanted to see more of her! One of the biggest shocks comes at the end of this act and will hit our protagonist hard knowing that he'll lose everything by the end of this.As a lot of people have said the 2nd act slow down and this is a dramatic change compared to the first but that is not to say this is bad. You end up hanging on ever word from anyone. Is this the truth, whos acting in self interest or the nations interest. The peak of the conversations come when the return of Blofeld, with many of the villain's of the series these will never be able to over power Bond but tear away at his soul, mind and body over the course of these movies and this conversations certainly brings all of that pain to a head! Lashana Lynch over plays the character in the second act almost becoming a caricature of woke society but i'm not letting this detract from the rest of the cast being awesome, Ralph Fiennes keeps his card close to his chest in not really ever trusting bond over the course of the last 3 movies. Naomie Harris being a star of Skyfall, probably under used in Spectre but a small but impactful role for sure! What more can be said about Ben Whishaw's Q just awesome, gadgets that are purpose built and a true friend in Bonds time of need. Rory Kinnear's Tanner again a staple since Quantum!We are then only truly introduced to our villain of the movie in the 3rd act and this is definitely the weaker parts of the movie, Rami Malek is totally under unutilized. He has the presence in the opening scene of a completely broken not just in body but in mind as well. Verging on Jigsaw from the Punisher but by the end it just doesnt hit home. Yes he's able to break bond the worse that any of the others have been able to taking away everything that he holds dear.Certainly the direction this was taken was great from Cary Joji Fukunaga the suspenseful horror elements coming through strong, very similar to James Wan taking on Aquaman! Stunning cinematography to contrast to the silence throughout the movie. Action packed scenes, not as clean cut as the pervious entries but hit hard throughout.Overall this is a fitting tribute to Bond and Daniel Craig, this really was a swan song for him and you can see this in his performance in trying to keep his world from falling apart let along the rest of the world. I hope that the next Bond makes as much as an impact across the film industry as this has done for 15 years of Daniel Craig!",No Time to Die
195,michelle_kummer,Noooo bond why,5,10 November 2021,"Ian Fleming will be turning in his grave if he saw what's happened to his franchise. I see a lot of people blaming Daniel Craig, it's not his fault the script is written for him and he doesn't look too old he looks great. So I'm 2 hours in to the movie and unimpressed it didn't engage me at all.The first scenes in Italy and then Jamaica were true Bond style. But Bond is always a womaniser and the Bond women are always breathtakingly beautiful and die. I was looking forward to seeing more of Anna De Maras she's stunning and easily a Bond girl but now he's married and Madeleine is beautiful too but there's no chemistry.Rami was a waste as a villain. Felix died wtf!Then there's a female African American 007 my goodness you don't give a woman 007 that belongs to a male she should have been given another number. She's also a bit too filled to be a spy. Anna kicks butt in her short scenes.Beautiful locations as always.If this new Bond is a woman especially this boring one I don't think there will be more than another film, franchise over!I can't believe they killed off Bond you never do that!

196,Benslie,Not one the best Bond movies but definitely not the worst,7,10 October 2021,"This movie suffers from two things which are the pacing of the movie and the story which intertwines together. The story of this movie just didn't seem focused and struggled to get focused till the very end. There was so much going on that it was hard to follow and nothing was properly explained which left the audience confused at how the story was progressing and exactly what was going on. The story feels like the writers all go together in a room and threw darts at a dartboard with different story ideas on it and wherever it landed is what they put in the movie. So due to this confusing storyline, the pacing of this movie felt very much stop and go. At times I wanted the story to pick up the pace and move on while others the movie was moving at an ideal story pace which never lasted long. I feel like they were given the run time first and then had to make a movie around it. Even the action scenes to me just felt very drawn out and boring. I will say though is that the cast did bring their all to this movie. This is Daniel Craig's last outing as Bond and he brought so much emotion to this movie that keeps the audience watching till the very end. Lea Seydoux, who plays Madeleine, honestly was the real scene-stealer though. Now, the main villain Lyutsifer Safin, played by Rami Malek, is not going to be a memorable Bond villain but Rami Malek did a great job playing him. And finally, of course, Hans Zimmer's score is incredible and I wasn't a big fan of the song. In the end, No Time to Die isn't the greatest Bond movie but still has some redeeming qualities that keep it from being a weaker one.",No Time to Die

So far we have only seen him as someone who just gets the job done. Since this was Craig's final outing as Bond, it makes sense to show him to be having a family.Performance wise, Daniel Craig and Rami Malek delivered the best performances. Others also did their parts very well.The pacing of the movie was very good. The action sequences were very well choreographed and believable. Since this movie is directed by an American, I was a little skeptical but to my surprise it turned out to be great.Overall it is a highly enjoyable action film and a good end to Daniel Craig's stint as James Bond. I will definitely miss watching him as Bond. I just hope the 007 title goes to someone capable. It would be a huge disappointment if it went to Lashana Lynch's

I did think they significantly underutilized some great actors/characters including Ana De Amas, Jeffrey Wright, Naomi Harris, amd the most underutilized of all was Rami Malek. He could have been an amazing villain, but the story diminished his character. The ending was a bit disappointing, but probably the more ""realistic "" approach to take.

201,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"An entertaining sendoff to Daniel Craig, but it's too long, distracted and meandering",7,14 October 2021,"No Time to Die, Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond, is an ambitious reflective final act that juggles between updating James Bond for the 2020's and wrapping up the Daniel Craig James Bond 5-film arc.It is a technically impressive film. With Linus Sandgren's naturalistic photography, fantastic stunt work and Hans Zimmer's somber score, writer-director Cary Joyi Fukunaga does a handsome job achieving these goals, albeit in individual parts.At its 162-minute runtime, Fukunaga shaking up the Bond formula sacrifices time devoted towards explaining character motivations and story logic. The script relies on fridge logic and glosses over story details and takes so much time that the audience prematurely goes, ""That makes no sense"" before the credits, or tires out from sensory overload.The Bond girls are treated respectfully and there's diversity and representation with the best of intentions, but executed in an inconsistent manner that takes the audience out of the story.There's an instance of a little girl firing a gun. The child actress is photographed pulling the trigger in a heroically powerful way, as if she had been frequenting gun ranges and developed muscle memory with the handgun. Story wise, that character has never fired a gun in her life. Why can't the little girl look weak if the character is weak in the story?Ana de Armas' Paloma is a paradox. The character claims to be a 3-week trainee but then unleashes impressive fighting skills in a memorable action scene. But was Paloma joking about the 3 weeks? It didn't seem like it. It is shrugged off as a cute joke, but it is contradicting and renders her character unbelievable.As for LaShana Lynch being the new 007, the Nomi part feels like it was written as a response to the critical voices on the Internet. Nomi does and says everything the Internet wants; a strong female figure to stand up to Bond as his equal. I appreciate what her part represents and it rightfully sets a new precedent of where the franchise should go in the future reboot, especially with its female characters.However, the film is so preoccupied justifying itself politically that it gets distracted from telling its own core story.At its heart, No Time to Die is about James Bond coming to terms with his past, his internal conflict with being a killer and his failed romance with Vesper Lynd. No Time to Die's opening does a great job of setting up this theme and skillfully brings the audience back into where the previous four films have left off.After all, the five Craig Bond films were not originally planned as one story and were all individually influenced by popular film trends, from Christopher Nolan's Batman films, the Bourne series, from anti-Bond to classic Bond. Fukunaga skillfully combines the shifting tones and maintains the illusion that it was one overarching story all along.No Time to Die works strongest when it is exploring said themes which it gets increasingly distracted from after its midpoint. I was shaken out of a daze when Christoph Waltz's Blofeld showed up in scene-stealing fashion and compellingly reiterated the themes once again. The story felt like it was working towards its thesis for a moment. Afterwards, the narrative disappointingly meanders from it again.The worst of it is I don't understand what Rami Malek's villain Safin was trying to accomplish. He arrives so late in the film that his evil plan was confusingly unclear. All Malek's scenery-chewing unfortunately is wasted. And frankly, I was so exhausted by then, I did not feel the dramatic impact of the ending.Daniel Craig is the best James Bond and was able to show the character's suaveness, coldness and vulnerability. No Time to Die's heart is in the right place and works as a proper send off to Daniel Craig, but it never rises above the sum of its parts. It was entertaining but falls short of being great.",No Time to Die

The bad guys were very good and plot twists. Now spoiler alert: James only slept with one woman? That's a first, but maybe that's the new generation influence. The 007 lady was good too and I loved the woman in Cuba, she played such a good part and a little bad ass herself.Flaw or need clarification. The glass eyed bad guy worked for Blofeld correct? But at the end he worked for the new.bad guy played by Remi. Then explain why the scientist had to hide the fact of switching the DNA to kill all of Spectre?

It's a typical bond movie with a typical Bond villain and plot, but something about this one just felt better. Great fight scenes, great cinematography, great acting, it just ended up being a very solid film.

204,jsucie,"So long Craig, Daniel Craig.",8,25 October 2021,"This movie is mainly about letting Daniel Craig finish off the Bond franchise with some finality. In many ways it doesn't feel like a Bond movie, maybe Bond-lite.It was weird watching the send off knowing partly, Daniel didn't really want to do this movie but also that it was his final outing as James Bond. It's crazy to think it's been 15yrs of Daniel Craig playing this character. This movie suffers from what many Bond movies and other franchises do; uninspiring villains that the audience doesn't really care about or will even remember. There was nothing wrong with Rami Malek's performance as the main villain but also nothing that remotely screamed ""Amazing"".Overall this movie smacks right in the middle of the five Daniel Craig led James Bond. IMO the list would be:
1. Skyfall
2. Casino Royale
3. No Time To Die
4. Quantum of Solace
5. Spectre.Honestly I would have preferred if Skyfall had been written more as the finale for Bond; the story would have been more congruent if it had.",No Time to Die

How that happens you have to go see and find out.But to me it was obvious that Craig struggled this time round and can you blame him for his age.I just think for his final run they missed a trick and could have sent him off in such better style that he deserved.After all this time waiting (which may be why I was disappointed a little) I just wanted more from Craig's last outing as 007.There were some great moments and it deserves the big screen viewing.

Bond took them all on and always emerged victorious and lived to tell the tale. However, there seems to be one enemy that Bond cannot defeat - WOKENESS.Wokeness, like the nanobots of this movie's plot, is a virus that manages to kill off everything it touches and in No Time to Die, Bond becomes a victim. Yes folks, BOND DIES, and why not? After all, we can't have these straight white males running about acting like they own the place can we?Barbara Broccoli said that before he died, the late lamented Albert R 'Cubby' Beoccoli told her and step brother Michael G Wilson to 'not let the outside world screw it up and to stick to the formula' when it came to the world's most successful film franchise he helped create. Well, I can't help but feel they've both let him down a smidge.No Time to Die has all but destroyed what was left of the Bond legacy, which lets face it has been in free fall since BB and MGW took hold of the reigns.It does have its strong points Rami Malek is brilliant as is Ana de Armas in their roles, yet both are really underused. There's a couple of great car chases thrown in and it's great that they revived some of John Barry's music in parts and had it not been a James Bond movie, I'd be reviewing a fair to good action thrilller.....But it WAS a James Bond film...supposedly.However, the wokeness took hold pretty quickly and didn't let go until Bond was conveniently disposed of in the film's finale. Take that toxic masculinity!For starters, the 'new' 007, I disliked this character immediately, granted she got better as the film progressed, but there was no reason at all for her to have been 007. It was an agenda statement purely designed to ruffle feathers. Strong Black female taking the place of our long standing hero. Out with the old in with the new. The film makers could have saved themselves a whole ton of grief by giving the character any other designation, 002, 003 whatever, they knew exactly what they were doing and why. Also Q is now out of the closet, something never mentioned or alluded to in any Fleming book or previous movie and something that didn't even have to be mentioned in this movie AT ALL, but again, was only done to ruffle feathers and allow the filmmakers to show the audience how 'progressive and inclusive' they are.Finally, to kill off James Bond AND Felix Leiter in the same movie is an insult to Fleming, Cubby, Harry Saltzman and every other person that ever spent their time and talents bringing this character and franchise to life for nearly 70 years. If that's not messing with the 'formula', then what is?I was gobsmacked at the end of the credits to see the familiar line 'James Bond Will Return' especially given that I had just watched him get reduced to ash in a missile strike. I'm now left wondering how the hell EON are going to get out of this cul de sac that they've NEEDLESSLY created for themselves. Time will tell, but I fear like most, that this franchise is only going to get worse and worse with each subsequent release and now that Amazon has acquired MGM, those fears are exponentially increasing.",No Time to Die
207,clivey6,Craig's Frankenstein Bond draws to its close,4,18 October 2021,"Craig's Frankenstein Bond Reaches Its EndAn early scene in his debut film, Casino Royale, saw Daniel Craig's Bond in a footchase with a younger, more lithe and athletic man suspected of being a bomb maker. Though Craig's Bond was older, shorter and not much of a runner, he nonetheless managed to close in, recalling how Frankenstein's Monster would somehow pursue his victims despite a lack of physical agility and pace. Heavyweight boxer Mohammad Ali used the Parkinson Show to cruelly mock his rival George Foreman, referencing, okay, not Frankenstein but The Mummy: 'You see that fella run and run, he does six miles in one shot - but in the next scene, there's the Mummy, he's still after him...'Facial shots of a heavy-lidded Bond seeming to struggle with his identity in life, or the tender scene with Vesper, sitting down fully clothed in the shower, owed something to the Monster, along with the sense that Craig's Bond was an unwitting creation of factors outside his control. The Monster - a patched up assortment of various bodies - might also be a comment on the new Bond franchise - made up as new but soon heavily reliant on past components from previous films.The 1930s film Frankenstein spawned a sequel - just one problem: the Monster died at the end of the first. To get round this, they had him re-emerge from the ruins of burnt out windmill. Something similar happened with the Jason Bourne films, to which the new Bonds owe a debt. This lapsed spy's memory regain depended on box office returns, and often each new film would undo the happy resolution of the last to ensure more business.Similarly, Craig's Bond series, hitting a home run with his debut Casino Royale, based on the Ian Fleming novel, soon became a hostage to fortune. Its ill-fated follow-up, Quantum of Solace, being a sequel, while the fourth film, named after Spectre, the organisation that had belatedly landed in the producers laps, claimed that this Bond's past adventures and woes all stemmed from his traditional foes. But these two traditional Fleming ideas - newly available to EON - combined to box Craig's Bond films into a corner.So this Bond character came with a lot of baggage that would have to be unpacked at the beginning of each film, not least because the main theme became Bond's inner life, rather than external foes. Craig's five film tenure would come with a story arc that would look rather rickety and ragged, not least because the writers and producers seemed to be making it up as they went along. So No Time To Die begins with Bond still mourning his lost love Vesper from over a decade ago despite the fact he seemed to know her at best for a fortnight only. It emerges this scene comes straight after the finale of Spectre, which perhaps explains why he and Madeleine Swann - the woman he went off into the sunset in his Aston Martin DB5 at the end of Spectre - don't seem to know, like or trust each other very much. That she is clearly so much younger than him is another issue that one could gloss over in the previous film.It's clear that director Corey comes from the same school as Lee Tamahori or Marc Forster. A classy look and some muscular action doesn't distract from the dearth of 'funny bones' - there are some jokes here, but because of the largely humour free vibe, they don't really land. It's all quite heavy going. It allows one to doubt our hero: when he spits, 'How did they know I was here?' following an ambush, one could reply, 'Probably because you go around in a highly distinctive grey Aston Martin DB5 you tool!' We've been here before - the 'serious' Bond film that demands respect and attention - but then all you do is notice the plot holes and daft actions of the lead characters.The admittedly tense and gripping ambush in the lengthy pre-credits later makes no sense in view of what we later learn about Madeleine Swann - but again it seems they writers had boxed themselves into a corner.There's much to confirm that the writers had their work cut out rewriting large swathes of the film following the exit of director Danny Boyle, though how this could not have been foreseen I do not know. This sort of thing has happened before, with the exit of the late Roger Mitchell prior to Quantum of Solace. It's to be suspected both had foreseen just how badly things might go.As script doctor, Phoebe Waller-Bridges brings none of the lightness of touch we saw in Killing Eve. The jokes don't land. As with Connery's rogue outing, there is the persistent sense of something just not right about the film. The tone of various scenes just do not match up. As with Brosnan's last film Die Another Day, I found myself sitting in my seat thinking, what am I watching here actually? It's not fun and I can't believe any of it - so what's the point?Another gripe is that inevitably Craig's new film occupies a different universe to that of his debut. So it was with Dr No and Connery's fifth, You Only Live Twice. This could be overlooked when each movie is pretty much a standalone - less so when a plot line is meant to thread throughout. Some of the plot is astonishingly prescient given the pandemic. But in a packed cinema, with many not wearing face masks, there's an added and unwanted dimension of fear, plus the suspicion the makers are trolling their audience.So it is with allegations of 'wokeness' - here the uneasy sense that the producers don't actually like James Bond. Like a vegan running your local fish and chip shop, there's a sense of being a cross purposes.Past Bonds suggested a businessman on his travels, putting everything on his account, footloose and fancy free. This one suggests a long-married man with debt collectors on his tail on a family day out whose wife would prefer it if he just signed the divorce papers, agreed the alimony and disappeared. Bond seems hemmed in by one virtual family or another - Madeleine, the CIA, MI6, his foster brother, each one more miserable than the last. Virtually no action scene, no matter how impressive, seems to have him end 'the winner'.Indeed, it's made clear in the script that had James Bond never been born, much of the troubles he's fought in all the films simply would not have happened, because he wouldn't have landed up as the cuckoo in the family of would be arch nemesis Blofeld. It's like It's a Wonderful Life in reverse.As reverse escapism, I suppose, it can't be beat. You think your life is bad - he's got it worse!Having squirmed at again seeing Roger Moore's Bond take Soitaire's virginity in Live And Let Die two days before, I can vouchsafe that there is much about the Bond character to disdain. But I don't want that rubbed in my face when watching a Bond movie. For those who see Bond as a guilty pleasure, this film is all guilt and no pleasure. With Barbara Broccoli having taken the reins since GoldenEye, and now with Phoebe Waller-Bridge on board, it does rather seem as if women have done for the character what Blofeld himself never managed to do.Returning to Frankenstein's Monster, there are hints here that our man is a cooked-up product of an environment that he can never truly understand or be part of, though suspicions that MI6 are some kind of Masonic source of world strife are never really followed through. As with Jason Bourne - another agent the new films owe something to - there is a sense that none of it will end well, and that the character is not destined to enjoy his cottage with the rose garden and picket fence. Post-pandemic (up to a point; deaths continue) this is far from the cinematic pick-me-up some of us would have liked.",No Time to Die
208,MovieWarfare,A wonderful final outing and tribute to Craig's Bond,8,15 October 2021,"I have loved Daniel Craig's era of Bond, especially the more gritty and grounded take. I was disappointed by his previous outing, Spectre (2016), but felt like it was a fine conclusion for his Bond. Therefore, I was genuinely surprised when it was announced that Craig would do one more Bond movie. So is this a great final outing for Craig or was it time for it to die?Firstly, this is a way more satisfying conclusion than Spectre (2016). After watching this, I felt happy at how the story was treated and how James Bond was handled. On that note, I love how emotionally personal this story is for Bond which I haven't felt since his first outing; Casino Royale (2006). It felt like there was an actual reason and personal stakes for Bond to be invested this time instead of it just being a mission. I also liked that the threat this time is bigger than any threat Bond faced before. It felt like it was a potential world scale disaster which is fitting for the final Craig movie. Some issues I had with Spectre (2016) was that the group itself didn't feel menacing and that Bond's relationship with Madeleine Swann was weak. No Time to Die (2021) does a good job rectifying these issues as Spectre feels more like a proper villainous group, while the relationship between Bond and Swann is an emotional core in this filmAdditionally, the action scenes in this film are great. Some memorable ones include a stunning action sequence near the beginning, an awesome shoot out in Cuba and a terrific one-take sequence near the end. It was clear that a lot of effort was put into these action sequences and that there was an effort to try and differentiate them from previous movies. There are also a variety of different beautiful locations in this which leads to some great cinematography. Furthermore, the returning actors are doing the best acting we have seen from them so far and the new ones are all great additions. Craig gives the most emotional and charismatic performance as Bond ever. Craig's performance as Bond is usually stone-cold like an agent would be, with some exceptions in certain scenes. Here we see him have some great banter and jokes that you wouldn't usually see from him but it surprisingly works. Yet despite that, we also get to see Bond at his most emotionally vulnerable state which is delivered wonderfully by Craig's performance.His conflict with new 007, Nomi played by Lashana Lynch, is also enjoyable to watch with both constantly making jabs at each other. I am glad Nomi isn't just a ""female bond/007"" and has a distinct personality from Bond with a more no-nonsense and serious nature to her. I also enjoyed Ana de Armas as the new Bond girl, Paloma, who represents the classic gorgeous badass we have seen from previous Bond movies. She has such a fun bubbly personality and great chemistry with Bond. Plus her action scenes were great too which makes it such a shame that she is barely in this movie. If No Time to Die (2021) did one thing then it was making me want to see more of Nomi and Paloma. Rami Malek plays the villain Safin and he gives a very creepy and unsettling performance. Whenever he was on-screen he was able to pull his own.Unfortunately, the villain Safin isn't in the movie much with Spectre being more of a villain for the first half. It's a shame as Rami is great but he doesn't have much of a presence until halfway in. Moreover, Safin motives are incredibly vague and silly. He wants to kill millions of people just because he is evil I guess. He also has a weird obsession with Madeleine but it is never fully clear why exactly he wants her apart from some vague ideas like family or like her. There is also 2 villainous henchman. One with a cybernetic eye that is very forgettable if it weren't for the eye and another with a quirky personality but doesn't appear much. They are both not that great sadly and I wish one of them was cut.A central element in this film is a thing called ""Nanobots"" and it is as silly as it sounds. It is a MacGuffin that can do whatever stupid thing the plot needs it to do. It is so ridiculous that I question how this could exist in Craig's grounded Bond universe. The Nanobots and the villains make this feel like the most cartoony of the Craig Bond movies which dampen the final outing a bit. The movie is also a bit too long at 2 hours 40 minutes. The pacing drops around the middle and there is a fair amount of moments where it is just exposition dumps. This film could have benefitted from cutting 10-15 minutes off the runtime. Legendary composer, Hans Zimmer, is the one who did the music score for No Time to Die (2021) which sounds like a match made in heaven. However, his score is so generic, plain and even forgettable as the music score lacks a lot of impacts that you would see in Hans Zimmer score for other movies.Overall, No Time to Die is a wonderful final outing and tribute to Craig's Bond. This is one of the most emotionally satisfying Bond entries ever in the series. It delivers on the emotional storytelling that I wanted and I can see people getting a little teary-eyed at this one. It truly is the end of the great Craig Bond era and it is nice to say that he has more good Bond movies than bad (unlike Pierce Brosnan). There is going to be a lot of pressure on the next Bond actor but whoever it is, I hope they give a unique take as Craig did for his Bond.",No Time to Die

Classic DB5, classic action but by half way through the film just lags... Not many car chases, bad guy is luke warm, but a shame as Rami Malek's 'Safin' is very convincing as a bad guy but just never really gets going or even that threatening.Film runs a little stale and running time way too long...Went in open minded... Left not convinced, but Daniel Craig still remains a brilliant Bond, still carries that mysterious wonder and charisma but just not a great ending to his 4 movie franchise.",No Time to Die
210,richkiel,Feminist filth,1,16 October 2021,007 is now a black woman who has as much testosterone as a man. I guess that's how these insane feminists imagine a future that is 'female' and 'diverse'. Go to hell. Your sick fantasies will never be reality. And people have had enough.,No Time to Die
211,sujanfaster,"007, signing off on a high",8,1 October 2021,"After months of delays and postponements, The Bond is back with a bang. This is definitely one for the cinema experience even though it's quite a lengthy film. But the grandeur totally justifies the theatrical experience.The movie begins with a fast paced action sequence almost reminding you of Skyfall. Exotic location combined with those stunts leave you wanting for more. The opening credits scene following this with Billie Eilish's voice is nothing less than mesmerizing in 3D. I personally felt that the opening action sequence was the best of the lot sets a very high expectation for the rest of the movie. The plot thread from the movie Spectre continues here with James Bond starting off working this time with his American 'friend'. While the MI6 is doing a hunt on its own with it's new 007 and a woman at that. The movie goes on about how James Bond battles the global threat along with his personal relationship which is tied closely to that.No Time to Die is probably a very good testament to Daniel Craig's James Bond character. Unlike other 007s, Craig has always played a very complex character and has had a lot to do beyond the James Bond swagger. Not many have liked this but I have always been a fan and I think he is the best in the recent era. The movie definitely takes him on a very good journey as a character personally and professionally. However with so many other characters and complex backstories this movie goes off the rail at times. Bond's character is well written but the movie plot overall isn't convincing enough. However the movie is still an audio visual treat and delivers a great end to the nuanced character played by Craig. It goes without saying that the movie is shot in some exquisite locations and makes for a great watch in 3D with most of us having not travelled anywhere in a while :(Daniel Craig definitely signs off in style, there are some serious money shots which can get you off your seats. Léa Seydoux as Madelline plays a very key character and is impressive. But I personally feel that she doesn't bring the 'Bond Girl' characteristics to the role. The MI6 crew has an addition with Lashana Lynch as the lady 007 along with the regulars Ralph Fiennes, Ben Wishaw and Naomi Harris. They don't have much to do this time around with Lashana hogging the limelight. The major letdown of the movie is failing to explore the complexity of the negative character Lyutsifer Safin played by Rami Malek. Make no mistake, he is great and has a very threatening presence, but the plot around the major antagonist fails to hold up as the movie focuses more on Bond's personal side.The final Craig's James Bond movie is a great cinematic experience and is one for the generations. It may not be perfect, but it is definitely a fitting end to Craig's 007.",No Time to Die

214,Beachbum2018,Good but not the best bond movie by a long ways!,8,6 October 2021,"Different approach to JB, but must admit it's not what I was expecting.Bond is portrayed as more human on this final outing for DC but that sort of cheats the paradigm, bond movies have been highly successful precisely because they fly in the face of logic, reason and bond being a good guy.Guys wannabe bond, ladies want to be with bond, precisely because he's not always the good guy, but in this movie it's almost like he's a good, solid, mate you'd go out for a beer with, or go out on a safe date with if you're female! Solid, trustworthy, patient, understanding, negotiable...yes, yes, all very admirable, but.... not really bond unfortunately!Aside from that the action is good, but the pace is a bit slow, reflected in its length...a bit too long to be honest, found myself nodding off at points where not much was happening.And the villain is unfortunately a bit boring, felt like I wanted to stop the movie and tell him about a good acne product.... definitely didn't come across as menacing or evil, more misunderstood and boring! Then the global threat in the form of a genetically targeted virus was yawn also a bit boring coming after the Covid pandemic, and just didn't come across as super scary! And finally there was the strange acidic pool with workers in hazmed suits combing the knee deep liquid.... all very confusing!The one mushy part that got the throat tightening a bit was right at the end when it looks like bond met his fate... felt like I'd just lost a good friend forever!The supposed bond offspring daughter with Madeleine was the final straw that broke the credibility barrier, no purpose whatsoever, just melodrama, like mediocre American series that revert to human drama to make up for the lack of real drama and action!Noticeable that many of the the long term characters around in the last 5 movies with DC met their end in this one.... clearing the decks perhaps, only ones left are the MI6 head office bunch!So was it worth waiting for well, yes I suppose it was, but the main thought in mind as I left the theatre was who's going to take over the role next.... this movie was already behind me by then!",No Time to Die
215,Mike_O_Dwyer,Bit Of A Damp Squib TBH,6,1 October 2021,"Had really high hopes for this but it fails to deliver on so many levels.Spectacle:
Not much. There's no wow moments to speak of - Casino Royale, Skyfall and even the much maligned Spectre, had enough visual flair and style to produce at least a few emmorable scenes. This feels dull, but not in that gritty realism way that would have given it some edge. Workmanlike.Stunts:
Outside of what was used in the trailer it's quite ho-hum. There's a nice chase sequence near the beginning, and another a bit later, but the rest is surprisingly lacklustre.Villain:
Instantly forgettable. Made Christoph Waltz's cameo Blofeld look positively charasmatic as a charmless sub-par Hannibal Lecter even with the faffiest and most pointless of silly prisoner entrances ever - if Blofeld's entrance doesn't get meme'd to the point of ridicule I'll be very surprised.Villain's Lair:
A concrete bunker on an island more easily penetrated than the Guns of Navarone. Dull to the point of cheapness, something that fell under the bottom shelf of rent-a-lair.New 007:
Lashana Lynch didn't need to do much except show up, pull a trigger and make a few sneery comments. Handled herself with ease.Bond Woman:
Ana de Armas didn't need to do much except show up, pull a trigger and make a Bond raise an eyebrow. Made it look all too easy, one of the few highlights.Bad guys:
Recruited from rereuns of The A-Team. Nary a one of them could shoot straight or produce anything amounting to a competent threat to Bond. Feel over like lemming at the sound of gunfire. How on earth do you get a job as a henchman? Is there any vetting at all?Jaded Quips:
Too many, and not one of them remotely humourous. Is it irony if you're trying to be knowing and ironic and it still doesn't work? No. It's just naff.Bond Regulars:
Q, M, Moneypenny, Felix, Madeleine show up and do the necessary.Bond Titles Sequence:
Can't remember - something with guns and DNA. Inspid. Bille Eilish's song is decent if perhaps too low key. Much better was hearing the music to 'We have all the time in the world', a nice throwback to OHMSS.Bond:
Craig, perhaps showing his age a bit at this stage, but he has been a terrific Bond over the years.Overall, ranks above Quantum Of Solace and below Spectre. A long way off the heights of Casino Royale and Skyfall.",No Time to Die

Daniel Craig's fifth and final instalment in the Bond franchise and I must say, what a phenomenal movie!? From the moment we step outside the adrenaline is flowing. There was some good suspense, great action, and a twist or two I personally wasn't expecting.While Rami Malek's character was kind of a weak character, Rami did a great job in playing him. I can't say what would've made him a stronger character, but he was definitely intriguing.The cinematography was great, the locations were exotic, and the colour schemes used in certain scenes were amazing. A plus to all of this was one of the best composers in the world scored this film, Hans Zimmer.Lastly, this film perfectly rounds out Daniel Craig's time as Bond. If you don't want to watch all his films as a lead up to this one than the only recommendation would be to watch ""Spectre"" as a refresher. There was also a very strong down to earth human connection that I never truly felt with other Bond films.Honestly, not quite a ten out of ten performance, but it's way up there and worth the theatre experience.I hope you can't a chance to see it and I hope you enjoy the show!",No Time to Die

#notimetodiereviewThis is a fitting tribute to Daniel Craig as he bids adieu to the Bond franchise. A sensitive, delicate & emotional side of 007 is showcased as never before in this film. His pain after losing Vesper Lynd.. being unable to move on .. his turbulent relationship with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) are some of the highlights of the film . And offcourse there is good ol Blofeld and his merry band ""Spectre"" always baying for Bonds blood and targeting the anhilation of the world.The main question is whether the Spectre are the bad guys or is there someone more sinister around.Great action, new gadgets, good old M , Q and Money Penney, Felix make it a must watch in the theatres.I watched it in the 4DX format but you should watch it in the 3D format at least to enjoy the special effects to the fullest.Go for it guys ....

MGM Studios - Directed by: Cary Joji Fukunaga
Based On: Bond Books by Ian FlemingAs the cinematic book-end to Daniel Craig's run of five Bond films, No Time To Die (2021) should have functioned as an epic conclusion with a worthy amount of heart-pumping action, amazing stunts, fast cars, and intriguing gadgets. Alas, they elected to go out with a whimper instead of the literal 'bang' the film ends on. Craig has had his highs and lows, with Casino Royale (2006) and Skyfall (2012) being the stand-out films worthy of the Bond name, and Quantum of Solace (2009) and Spectre (2015) merely existing as mediocre space-fillers.After Bond (Daniel Craig) chooses to leave active service, he finds peace off the coast of Jamaica with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) until his former associate from the CIA, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), shows up asking for help to rescue a kidnapped scientist from the clutches of a treacherous villain (Rami Malek) out to control the world with dangerous new technology. With the help of his MI6 team, which includes M (Ralph Fiennes), Q (Ben Whinshaw), Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), and newcomer Nomi (Lashana Lynch), Bond sets out to stop his devious plot.Taking his turn at directing and co-writing the screenplay, Cary Joji Fukunaga fails to understand the pacing and structure required in a film of this scope and magnitude. Fukunaga is best known for his direction of the first season of HBO's anthology mini-series ""True Detective"", where there is plenty of room to take the time to develop and slow-burn the plot, however in this context, the story is mind-numbingly slow. And in a film that is decidedly low on the action quotient, there is just no room for such a grievous error.Clocking in at just over two hours and forty minutes, easily an hour of the runtime could have been lost. The lackluster story is largely cliché and predictable, with little new to offer save the forced 'romance' between Bond and Madeleine. Through no fault of the actors, there is just zero chemistry between them. While it is certainly a welcome change to see Bond for the most part hang up his womanizing ways, Madeleine is the last person that he would have fallen for. Craig has must more chemistry with Harris, as evident in Skyfall (2012). That entire arc spanned over half the plot, which made the beginning of the film almost unbearable to watch.The writers by and large waste their talent, reducing Rami Malek to a two-dimensional, archetypal villain who really just shows up with a dubious plot and preaches monotone to the main characters. Harris, who proved herself capable in both action and emotional sequences, was left to meander in the background, showing up for a few scenes just so the writers can check her off the appearance list. The entire film is bogged down by contradicting tones and styles, resulting in a very off-putting experience. There's no sense of urgency! Bond films should showcase interesting, complex characters, exotic locations, cutting-edge cars, and modern gadgets-they should excite and amaze. Alas, the entire tone was melodramatic, macabre, and miserable. To that end, there is one decent action sequence, very few stunts, one cool machine (revealed in the trailer), one unremarkable gadget, and the latest Aston barely gets a few minutes of screen-time-and Bond doesn't even get to drive it! I suppose we should just be grateful they didn't wreck her this time...And then there's the ending, which effectively eradicates everything Bond epitomizes. One thing is for certain-it is time for an all-around make-over for the franchise-they lost the plot on this one.FINAL VERDICT: Nothing more than a confusing, melodramatic mess that ends with a whimper and fails to showcase any real action or elicit any emotion. It is upsetting to see Craig's arc end this way, but here's hoping they are better at casting the next iteration of characters than ending this chapter.5.0 = 1,0.5,0.5,0,1,0,0.5,0.5,1 - Rewatch Value: 1.",No Time to Die
228,Colbridge,Fukunaga sets just the right tone to please fans old and new,8,9 October 2021,"The 25th James Bond film is right up there with the best, although in my opinion not THE best, but it does pull off a neat trick in avoiding cliches whilst delivering all the familiar car chases, action set pieces, fights, villains and Bond girls, and together with an original and engaging story it also offers up a few surprises. In fact it refuses to be boxed in to how you think a Bond film should be thanks to solid writing by regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, Killing Eve writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Cary Joji Fukunaga, the first American director assigned to direct a Bond film, whose assured hand guides this highly entertaining entry to near perfection.No Time to Die is Daniel Craig's 5th film as James Bond and in this he gives arguably his best performance. Craig is undoubtedly the highest calibre actor ever to step into the role and with this film you'll see why. He is on screen for most of it's 2hrs 43mins and handles action set pieces along with the more quieter, tender moments with depth and humanity. This is a million miles away from the tongue in cheek suaveness of Roger Moore who glided his way through most of his Bond movies on charm and charisma alone. Here Craig makes Bond real and this is the grittiest, down and dirty Bond film yet.However there are a few weak links here such as the lacklustre title song by Billie Eilish, who is the youngest ever singer to write and perform a Bond theme and no doubt attracts a new young audience to see a Bond movie, and the other is Remi Malek who is rather lightweight as villain Safin, but does give a sufficiently oddball performance as a mad man hell bent on establishing a new world order.This is a fitting end to Daniel Craig's tenure and completes a story arc that began with Casino Royale (2006). I saw this on a large screen in 4DX which is like being on a rollercoaster for the duration of the movie where you feel every bump in the road, every swerve Bond makes in his Aston Martin, every explosion, fight scene and gun shot that adds another dimension to the viewing experience, a bit gimmicky maybe but I enjoyed it.Hans Zimmer's score is excellent as is the inclusion of 'We Have All the Time in the World' from OHMSS (1969), with respect given to the legacy of original composer John Barry. Although the Daniel Craig era saw itself initially as a reboot this set of Bond films still wants to remain linked to it's predecessors with several references made throughout to earlier works such as the Dr No (1962) inspired title sequence and more subtle ones throughout.Although it was delayed by 18 months due to a worldwide pandemic it was certainly worth waiting for. Fukunaga sets just the right tone to please fans old and new and has delivered an entertaining hard edged thriller in respect of the Bond legacy. This is also a definite improvement over the more sluggish Spectre (2015) and despite publicly stating he never wanted to do another Bond movie ever again after the aforementioned Daniel Craig gives it his all in this one and delivers on all counts.",No Time to Die
229,walshj-01468,Really Good Bond Movie,10,2 October 2021,"Watched this today and it is an excellent Bond movie. Even my Wife who isn't the biggest Bond fan thought it was excellent. A great finale for Daniel Craig, top film.",No Time to Die
230,timothyhilditch,"Different Bond, Marvel like.",8,5 October 2021,"Good script, Brings tension back into Bond which I haven't seen since Casino Royale. Lulls a bit in the middle due to lack of action if your looking for it. Of the action it's good but not better than Royale. Great soundtrack the best of the Daniel Craig movies, because of Hans Zimmer. Overall I think it's a lot more like a Marvel movie rather than a James Bond movie, but that works in its favour. Down side is if you want to understand the plot you're gonna have to watch Casino Royale and Spectre.This is a different Bond from Spectre which is good. Spectre is a mess, they took the hollow relationship he made in Spectre and actually built it into something. They also do something similar with the villain from Spectre giving him an over the top vibe. They try again to tie it back to start, to Vespher from Casino Royale, it's done better than Spectre in this regard.",No Time to Die
231,cescfabulous,Spoilers,10,2 October 2021,"SPOILER WARNING
I am writing this quick review at 06:30 on the day after seeing the film, I had to, as I cant sleep, my mind cant forget the emotion
at the end of the film I turned to Steph and said rather loudly ""they have f killed James Bond"" how can any future film match the emotions of that. Daniel Craig has done what no baddie could do in 60 years. But has he also killed the Golden Egg, the whole franchise??How can I ever watch Casino Royale or any Bond film knowing, they killed James Bond. So Daniel u returned to kill James Bond, WHY??? Is this why Danny Boyle done a runner? How can any future film any future actor match that???Bond is 60 next year, so am I, I grew up with Bond, am a massive fan, Craig is my favourite Bond, Casino Royale was my favourite film, but now do I hate Craig? Is NTTD the best or worst film? Did I ever think I would leave the cinema crying as we all were? Never
This is why they wanted it on a Big Screen so much with am audience, on your TV it would not have had that emotion and also most people will go back to the cinema and watch it again to try to handle what Craig has done. This film will make money as people who are not big fans will have 2 see it for themselves to believe what they have been told. And kudos to everyone who worked on that film keeping quiet. Yes there were rumours but it was only in the last few scenes that I actually believed they were going there. And they did the missiles and ""let me tell you a story about Bond James Bond. Time to listen to the soundtrack and I def have to return to Piz Gloria the Bond between NTTD and OHMSS will last forever
As one review said
It will be hard to forget the power of No Time to Die's ending.James Bond is dead,",No Time to Die

Oh no, what's that?, the giant tomb explodes as I am standing inches away from it. I am almost deaf, but other than that I'm fine, no scratch, apparently SPECTRE didn't send their best bomb team, but now I'm being followed, luckily I'm completely fit again juts minutes after a bomb exploded in my face. Oh, it must have been my current girlfriend, that's for sure, oh, I can't trust anyone, I'm so lonely, so melancholic, but first, I have to shoot these followers into pieces and then put my girlfriend, that treacherous be-hatch, on a train. Now I'm going to go fishing, oh no, Felix Leiter from the CIA is there with his intern, they want me to go on a dangerous mission, and so on and so forth, oh I am so lonely, iI think I want to start a family, kill the bad guy and save my daughter's dou-dou (teddybear) and strap it underneath my suspenders while a plethora of grenades rains down on me.These were probably the most horrendous three hours of James Bond in my entire life. It felt like they wanted to film an analogy to the Brexit. Scriptwriters as divided as the British people about what to do with James Bond/ Europe, followed by an awful long process of nonsensical dialogue and ending in a mess that apparently nobody saw coming.Worst James Bond movie in a very long time. Absolute cringefest, if you ask me!",No Time to Die
233,TakeUpReel,What the *bleep* was this?,3,20 October 2021,"If this was any other spy/action/thriller movie, I would have rated this a lot higher. Since this is a James Bond movie....what did I just watch?Things I hated:Looooooooooooooong story. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter.Some information seemed to be lacking (for such a long movie).Little humor in this movie.Some of the lines were hard to understand.The 007 designation is given to someone else.Bond has a child.Bond is killed.At the end, it says ""James Bond will return"". How? Maybe they'll start from scratch and create a completely new type of ""James Bond"" - 007 character. If so, that might work *OR* it could be a horrible mess.If the lady that plays 007 in this movie continues the role of 007 in future movies, I'm out. No offense to the person that played 007, but I just didn't like her character. But that still means - no more James Bond.If the daughter grows up and becomes a 00 secret agent, I could go along with that (as long as the person playing the character isn't annoying). But that still means - no more James Bond.A few plot holes bugged me. If the EMP watch was suppose to knock out nearby electronics, how did James communicate with Q or M after using the device? Conveniently, the electronics worked or didn't work as needed for the plot.I've been watching James Bond movies since the Sean Connery days. The way this movie ended is disappointing. I understand that Daniel Craig is not getting younger and wants to retire from the role. No problem. Why not use the same formula that fans have known for nearly 60 years and bring in a new actor to play the role? Don't kill off the character unless you're going to completely kill off the entire franchise (which I doubt).",No Time to Die
234,MovieJunkie1976,Par for the course..,6,13 October 2021,"So I was excited that the 25 official James Bond movie was coming out in 2020 and looked forward to it coming out , then as if SPECTRE themselves hatched it COVID spoiled my plans. So today I saw the first in theatre film of this decade I have seen. Of course , I had read all the reviews heading into the film. After muting out the ones containing people's politics and the one's complaining about people's politics , I gathered there were some distinct things people disliked.I assumed that after the opening credits , which I should note ( and am wondering out loud if ) Billie Eilish was using the same inflection as Sam Smith , was this her choice or Eon's , anyhow , I assumed the overture of on her majesty secret service was signaling the death of lovers which Swan and Bond were. From that point forward the plot was fairly simplistic, you are supposed to believe that she betrayed bond which made no sense as she did not run and the cadre of bad guys were trying to kill her as much as bond . Bond simply dumps her on the train. Title credits hinted at Dr. No , OHMSS , casino royale and a few others so I was pretty well informed of the plot at this point.All lot of reviews are discussing the death of bond and its infeasibility in the face of the films history. Of course we never actually see him die just like all the other deaths he has had. If finishing the movie with the OHMSS Louis Armstrong classic as the end credits wasn't a dead give away that Bond 25 was nothing more than a giant Collage of Homages to its own cannon shaped into a film , I don't know what to say because it was clear as day to anyone that would claim to know the films.Lighters death. Seems like there is a new Felix every new bond. I would not have been surprised if Q had died. Equally un shocking was bond playing his own version of triple x by moonlighting for the CIA. Nor was it all that amazing that Sean Bean turned in to a loyal companion 00 , and yeah a black woman to boot. The fall of SPECTRE in the film is a nod to the fact that SPECTRE itself fell once before. Primo had less gold teeth but the same backstabbing MO as Mr. Bullion. I won't even address the eye vs. Teeth prostheses egg that Jaws had issue with in this film. Anyone see Bond using that Baretta so deftly. But he did say that he preferred them in Dr. No. Right?I saw this movie for what it was a celebration of the previous 24 fashioned into a storyline. Was it the best bond. No. Was it the worst bond. No.Three Stars ( of 5 )",No Time to Die
235,Valkonian,A fitting finale for Mr. Craig,9,8 October 2021,"As a lifelong Bond fan seeing the the final film for Mr. Craig there were some scenes that were a bit emotional for me, even teary-eyed. I know for some viewers it won't feel that way. It's very hard to produce a film today without flaws, it's very easy to offend everyone. So I did expect to find things in the film that people would have issues with. I found these issues, but they didn't really affect me from enjoying the film. I thought they honored Bond, the franchise and Craig.The actions scenes throughout the movie are VERY good. The camerawork on these scenes were excellent. You should see this movie in IMAX to fully appreciate these actions scenes.Great acting all around, especially from Mr Craig. He still shows his drive to stop evil men, and knows there will always be evil men in this world.Speaking of evil men, the villain is well played. You will despise the villain. He is a scumbag. He uses a baby as collateral. He's a scum and wants to destroy the world because HE desires it. He wants to destroy people close to him because he's selfish. He's evil.The film introduces the new 007, she's female. Whether she will be THE new Bond in upcoming films, I don't know and I don't really care. My ONLY gripe is not that she's female but that her arrogance is way over the top. Even the most arrogant Bond was never this arrogant. Her arrogance is so high as to be almost rude to people. That isn't Bond. Bond is confident but never arrogant.Honestly, that may be my biggest gripe with this film, is the new 007's arrogance. But there is some hope, as midway in the film, her and Bond work together and by working together her arrogance actually subsides a little.The first half of the film is better than the second half but still overall it's an amazing film and bittersweet end to Mr. Craig's Bond films. I will miss him, as I've enjoyed his Bond movies and thank him for bringing back the Bond franchise. Hopefully the next Bond will be able to fill his shoes.Don't miss this movie if you are Bond fan.

237,severindringel,Solid action movie but Craig deserved more,6,11 October 2021,"Daniel Craig returns to the big agent stage for the last time. In No Time to Die he slips into the role of the iconic 007 James Bond for the fifth time and has to fulfil a final mission, although he had actually retired long ago. A dangerous computer virus threatens the existence of the world, set in motion by the avenging Lyutsifer Safin. On the way to his final opponent, Bond encounters some old acquaintances and, among others, the woman he once called his great love.We don't see many new faces in No Time to Die. Because one thing is clear, to understand all the insiders, plotlines and characters, you should at least have seen the 2015 007 film Spectre. Being someone who hadn't seen that film, I didn't know what to make of some aspects of it. But that should not obscure the fact that despite its immense running time of 170 minutes, it is never really boring. On the contrary, it even passes quite quickly and feels reasonably complete in what it is, namely an action film. For a non-Bond connoisseur like me, however, the question is whether the same feeling will arise among enthusiasts. Many probably expected an explosive departure by Craig, peppered with memorable action scenes, a dangerous antagonist and an emotional Bond. They get the latter, because Craig is tailor-made for the role. He is tough as nails, cool, but also sensitive. He brought this sensitivity to life as Bond for the first time in this franchise and can confirm it here. Otherwise, cuts that you don't see in other films in the action genre anyway remain relatively unspectacular. This is not to say that the film is badly staged, because Cary Fukunaga certainly relies on show values that are second to none. Above all, every car chase or shootout sounds eerily real, as if it were happening a few metres in front of you. The acting performances are largely strong, with Craig and Lea Seydoux as his lover Madeleine particularly convincing in vulnerable scenes. Others who are worth watching but take up far too little screen time are Ana de Armas as Paloma and Christoph Waltz as the evil Franz Oberhauser. Their moments stick and inspire, but fall far too short. All the more characters like the ""new"" 007 Nomi (Lashana Lynch) come into focus. What starts with a lot of potential unfortunately becomes more and more generic and uninteresting as the film progresses. The same unfortunately applies to the villain Safin (Rami Malek). Rarely has an antagonist been more underused and so weakly written. His philosophical drivel in the last act just got on my nerves more.The script should never be taken too seriously in Bond films. After all, the dialogue is often unrealistic and clichéd. A film like Skyfall has shown that the opposite is possible. If the lines don't fit, at least the story should be tangible to give Craig a proper send-off. The first two-thirds of the film is a lot of build-up and even if Spectre references are used too often, it also feels properly paced. The final act is then unfortunately a shadow of its former self, far too clichéd and rushed. Good thing the last ten minutes at least gave me goosebumps. Otherwise this would not be a farewell that Craig and the Bond fans deserve. As it is, it's solid, if not exactly enchanting.",No Time to Die

It is said to be the last bond film of Daniel Craig. I dont really liked Daniel Craig as Bond because since his movies started, it went towards a Mission Impossible Clieched movies.Except Skyfall. The director destroyed the movie as much he was able to. Cary Joji is an amature director who shouldnt be given the opportunity to take Bond movie, his past movies like Beast of No Nation , Jan Eyre is more like a documentary.Adding on to that, we are seeing the woke- culture of ""Why cant we"" ? Question raised in every aspects of life.Hence the idea of Female Bond came, first of all its not necessary to find equaling justification of Gender , Age, in every thing in the world.Bond is a man and its beautiful like that,
We have Suparman & Superwomen, Bat man and Bat women, that time the wokeism havent existed then also it filled wherever it needs to be.We cannot cry and take the ""why cant we"" in all entertainment media. Soon we will see a Female tom and Female Gerry, Female Mr Bean, Female Dinosaurs (god knows how to find the gender of it by looking at) , Female Godzilla ?Anyways, out of all these aspects , the Lady who acted as 007 Lashana lynch is totally destroyed the movie with her emotionless face and pathetic acting. It was heartbreaking to see a Bond charector dies in a movie, and more heartbreaking to see a below average actress taking over the role. Atleast they couldve shown some more serious actress to justifiy the Bond.She lacks the elegance, walking style, dialogue delivery of Bond and she just sided in like a very side cast.The story is pretty clieched like all other movies
A villain who wants to destroy the world
A prime laboratory and villains den where he stores all information
A timebomb before climax
Threatening and kidnapping hero's family members
Pathetic joke scene in middle of a serious fightThese destroyed the movieFights, Car chase etc were good.ANyways, if Lashana lynch is the designated Bond in upcoming movies, this is my last bond movie.My favorite Bond Actors given in below List

This movie had everything, it gets you from the off by doing something different from all previous openings by focusing on someone other than Bond.Ana De Armas is great in a short but flashy role and Lea Seydoux gets a meaty role not granted to any actress before her in a Bond movie.Pretty much everyone gets their moment to shine here, M, Q, Moneypenny, Felix, it's a great cast all round, Christoph Waltz is exquisite as the ever menacing Blofeld, even dangerous behind bars.Lastly, Daniel Craig may have done what no other Bond had done before him and that's get an Oscar Nom for playing James Bond, he's that good.

252,mr_sharma,An overlong sequel to Spectre you didn't really need but hey ho,6,10 October 2021,"I went with my 14 year old daughter who had never seen a Bond film (I've seen them all).I gave her a potted history of Bond movies beforehand so she had some idea.To start with there are a few things to note. It's a helluva lot better than Spectre (that sequence at the start though was the only highlight in that godforsaken Penelope pitstop mess of a film). But that isn't saying much considering the s***e pile that Spectre was (can you tell I hated it).Secondly, as you probably know, it's a very long film and not long in a good way. If they had cut an hour from this they would have had a much tighter, more action packed, continuously ticking along film. Instead, there were times I was about to nod off (eh! How? You can't nod off to Bond....we'll apparently you can).Thirdly, I can see why Craig didn't want to do it but hell if they are going to give you that much money, you'ld be daft to turn it down. He knows it, shows it, the film plays on it....but he just looks too old for this. Crikey, I'm the same age as him but yeah.....no. Not ""never say never again"" pension earner old but getting there. Glad he's hung up his boots now though.Fourthly, much has been talked about the female representation in this film. TBH, I don't think there was enough. There is a scene in Cuba which is an excellent piece of action, primarily using a female protagonist (and not the one you would think). The problem, it still doesn't change anything....it's a James Bond film and regardless of the number of nods to this generations viewpoints....by the end we get back to it being all about Bond. Which is fine. The ending is good (if only because of a jaw dropping moment)....but getting there, at times, is a slog.Rami Malik is really hardly used and in the canon of Bond villains is sort of middle to bottom. You just get no chemistry like you did with Dr. No or Goldfinger or indeed the first few Blofelds. Why the mask for example? I'm sure it's explained in there somewhere but either I was nodding off or wasn't clear enough.Ultimately, we have to look at the Mission Impossible series. Film by film M. I just gets better. It is for all intents and purposes a better Bond film that an actual Bond film.M. I is action packed, full of gadgets and humour, great female characters, charismatic leading man and engaging edge of the seat plot.May be the producers thought, that with cinemas opening up in a world emerging from a pandemic, we should give the audience more....as a thank you for spending their hard earned cash.Unfortunately, more in terms of a 2 hour 40 minute runtime is not more in terms of action, intrigue or revelations.Don't get me wrong, it does everything perfectly fine and by the end you are left pondering on it but the length effectively kills the mood.Ah well, better than Spectre but really not in the class of Skyfall.Overall, you'll watch it regardless. Me, personally, I could have happily waited for it to appear on a streaming service in due course.P. S although a few question abound afterwards, my 14 year old enjoyed it.",No Time to Die
253,willz187,Everything you don't want in a spy movie,6,3 October 2021,"Apparently 007 movies mean sentimental backstory, disgusting villains, overly severe violence, and boring action sequences now.

254,Instant_Palmer,Awful - Dreary & Tedious Except for Ana de Armas,4,8 October 2021,"An all-over-the-map mess that lacks the wit, energy and suspense for which the franchise is known. Other than the magnetic Ana de Armas, no one seems engaged in the making of this film. Ana was placed early in the film - I suppose this was to give some hope that this film would deliver (It does not). Craig was influential in bringing Ana to this production - This eye for the right actor for a role will serve him well as he pursues expanding his own projects. Ana's appearance was unfortunately brief and fleeting, and film falls into an abyss from that point forward.Daniel Craig must be relieved his tenure is over as James Bond. But this was not the way I expected to see him go nor say goodbye.A generous 4 is given out of reverence for the 007 franchise, and wishing Craig great success in his future endeavors in film - thank you for the ride with 007!🙏That being said, this Bond film is simply awful - the only Bond film that ranks worse is the 1967 movie-comedy/parody/spoof version of Casino Royal with David Niven as Bond (and Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond), with FIVE Directors brought in to do each skit/segment, which is completely unwatchable and not funny...This film is a 💣 👎👎",No Time to Die

256,Bek204,"""It's just a number""",7,10 October 2021,"Not the end that I expected from Daniel Craig's Bond films. A weak film with a weak script, dialogues, and character developments.One thing that bothered me the most is that the film focused way too much on James Bond and ignored all the other characters. I understand this is Craig's last film as James Bond. But, that doesn't mean that you ignore all other important characters that would change the whole story of the film, especially that they are being played by great actors/actresses. For instance, Safian, played by Rami Malek and he is basically the villain of the film. Comparing to the film's (way too long) runtime that is 2h 43m, Rami Malek (or his character) had such a short screen time which made the villain a very ordinary character and not scary at all. In addition, Ana De Armas' Paloma, that many people agreed on the scene she was in, is one the best parts of the film. Her acting, her character, and her action scenes were all amazing and well done. But, AGAIN her screen time is also very short and even shorter than Rami Malek's Safian. By watching the trailer or seeing the (long) runtime of the film that is 2h 43m, you will think that all these characters and the actors/actresses played by them are going to have enough screen time that would explain to us who they really are or entertain the viewer with their great acting performance.The film had so many unnecessary scenes and dialogues that felt like they were put there just to make the film's runtime longer and ""add"" things randomly since it's Craig's last film as James Bond. I enjoy films that have a long runtime. But, putting scenes that are slow-paced in a way that wouldn't entertain the audience or make them feel like they are watching a slow-paced scene, means that u are just adding random stuff and you don't care about how they end up being. If the film was only 2 hours then it would've been way better.Daniel Craig's acting is great as usual. Especially in this film because It's his last one as Bond. The acting was genuine and real. Also, one thing I noticed that was different in this film is how the character James Bond was written. It felt very different than the previous 4 Craig's Bond films. The character was more dramatic and more genuine.In addition, the cinematography & colors are well done. The movie presented some great shots that are visually stunning. Also, one thing I found special, is how some scenes or shots are connected to the classical James Bond signature gun barrel sequence.The set and custom designs are well done and made in a way to matches perfectly with the atmosphere of the whole film and with each scene's actions and events. For instance, the opening scene's set design and customs of each character were very dark to give the atmosphere and vibe of horror or danger.My rating is 7/10.",No Time to Die
257,nigepitz,This one's got me stumped,6,11 October 2021,"Ok. The good. Daniel was excellent even though he was playing a completely different character from the last 4 movies. The rest of the cast were great too except for Remi Malek who was awful. The plot is stupid, and to kill off ALL of Spectre in 2 minutes after spending the whole of the last movie building them up was annoying. It's not a Bond film but is an enjoyable, stylish action movie.",No Time to Die
258,montgomerysue,One of the best,10,13 October 2021,"At my age (66), I have seen all of the James Bond movies, and this ranks as one of the best. The plot is more intriguing than the Bond films of recent years. The action sequences and cinematography are outstanding. And the script allows Daniel Craig (in his farewell performance as 007) to just shine. If ever an actor was to be nominated for awards for playing Bond, this is the performance. He is assisted by a really fine supporting cast, particularly Rami Malek (subdued creepiness to the max), Lea Seydoux, and a surprisingly delightful Ana deArmas. The director and writers have created a story that stands on its own -
you don't have to have seen any other Bond films to enjoy this movie. By the way, my 29 year old son and I have seen the Bond films together since ""Die Another Day"" and he has streamed the older films.

A good villain gives a great movie sadly the Craig era doesn't have that.... instead they are pushing for more feminists characters like they didn't learn from bad other movies that tried this approach like the last Terminator and ocean's 8, Men in Black.....its still a Good movie that you can enjoy even if it's clearly too long and sometimes boring... just an advice, try to watch all Craig's bonds movie before this one, they are all connected!",No Time to Die
261,simoncmoore,Completely threw us,9,11 October 2021,"The opening scene is a car, motorbike chase, one of the best I've scene. Standard James Bond fare and fantastic cinematography. The story unfurls to reveal a collection of baddies and misfits. But this is no ordinary James Bond story. It completely upended the usual swashbuckling nonsense. The ending left us in tears. No spoilers here, but if you have any passing interest in Bond then this is a necessary film to see, if only for the ending. It is a long film, but the pacing kept us engaged. It also presented a more personal side to Bond and there was a telling moment about his inability to trust others. The dialogue was unusually well rounded, maybe that was Fleabags input? No idea how they take the franchise forward from this, but it will be interesting to see what they do.",No Time to Die

Absolutely wasteful and disrespectful to kill James at the end and ruin the happy ending we've never gotten but always wanted. Can we get an alternate ending please? I loved James and Madeline and I wanted their storyline to continue to exist for a lot of reasons. The tragic hero death does not fit at all and it ruins the film in my opinion. The best parts of the film are James and Madeline and to kill it off for nothing other than a closing is just awful.

For an almost 3 hour movie, you barely even see him.I would say that this is a good conclusion to the Daniel Craig era of James Bond. I'm not sure where they will take it next.",No Time to Die
264,MackMonMay87,Not a Total Waste of Time,6,20 October 2021,"Daniel Craig has been one of the best Bonds in the entire franchise, but like Pierce Brosnan, he's been cursed with having too strong of an opening movie (sharing the awesome Martin Campbell as director) and then never having another installment that rises above that.No Time to Die marks the final film in Daniel Craig's run, and while it's still worth seeing for any Bond fan (particularly if you've enjoyed Craig as Bond, like me), there's too many issues and snags with the story to keep it from being the finale Daniel Craig and this series of Bond films truly deserved.NTTD isn't a total waste of your time: it has amazing cinematography and seems like it's filled with mostly practical stunts and effects, courtesy of director Cary Joji Fukunaga, who does a great job of making set pieces and shots that would be boring in other movies really pop and stand out. Everything in the movie has such a crisp and clean look, complete with some of the most beautiful locations we've seen throughout the series yet.Every action scene is mostly well-shot and competently choreographed, and you get the standard Bond mix of gunfights, a bit of gadgetry, car chases/battles, and other vehicular mayhem that trademarks Bond, and it's all satisfying. A scene in the beginning where Bond uses the classic Aston Martin decked out with weapons from the Connery-era will bring a smile to any longtime Bond fan's face. Another great sequence sees series newcomer Ana deArmas partner with Bond in Cuba and steal the show with a mix of humor, action, and a great performance that leaves you wanting more. I had to wonder why they didn't include her in more of the movie.NTTD falls short in its overall story and main conflict, the villain, and the runtime. In an attempt to make a more emotionally moving Bond film, you have one of the slowest-moving installments with the well-staged action not showing up as much as it should. The movie rushes (despite being slow in other moments) to wrap up a lot of loose ends, killing characters and ending story threads that weren't resolved in the other movies quickly. It feels like the producers reminded the writers to finish these things in the runtime since this was the last Craig installment, and not a natural result of the story.Rami Malek's villain character is introduced in a great opening sequence (before we know it's him), and then doesn't show up for what seems like over an hour later into the movie. He has a personal connection to Madeline and Spectre, but that gets resolved well before the climax, and we don't get much of an explanation why he has something against Bond personally, or why he wants to conquer the world...end the world? Hold it hostage? We don't really know what his goal is or how/why he amassed so many goons, resources, and an entire massive evil operation. Rami Malek is a great actor who does the most with what he has, but his character is very underwritten, and he has to be one of the most underwhelming villains of Craig's run if not the entire Bond franchise (he seems like he was created through a Bond villain checklist generator: physical deformity, dark past, unspecified European accent/s, dressing in clothing from another culture. All that was missing was a fluffy cat or some other strange pet.).Craig's Bond films have overall had more story continuity than the other runs of actors who have played James Bond. To appreciate a lot of the story threads in NTTD, you'll need to have seen especially the previous flick, Spectre, and there's callbacks to events from Skyfall and some of the other installments as well. This is both a good and bad thing throughout Craig's Bond, because while it feels good that there's more consequence and cause and affect for what happens in his run, even after the other 4 movies, the overall story with Spectre and how Blofeld figures into it still seems rushed.No Time to Die is still worth it if you're a Bond fan, but you can spend your time more wisely if you're not really invested in the series.",No Time to Die

270,huntersmithx,"No Time to Die sends Daniel Craig's James Bond off triumphantly, shaken and stirred.",10,8 October 2021,"The people who started a little website called Daniel Craig Not Bond. Com must've had a ball of tears when the little actor from that could captivated the world with his brutally honest portrayal of a freshly pruned agent 007 in Casino Royale. There were the most startling peaks and valleys in getting him to where he is today- a star on the Hollywood walk, and a once-in a lifetime finale to a franchise that never saw true sunsets until now.If there's a hero that the world needs to inspire us through, say it with me now, these challenging times and after the so-called ""worst year ever"", it's everyone's favorite template of all the secret agents. All the more fitting is that No Time to Die didn't make it to cinemas until now due to other unforeseen circumstances, including the bowing out of Academy Award winner Danny Boyle. The 6 year long boulevard of broken dreams makes this film all the more bittersweet and triumphant.No Time to Die brings the tonal cycle of the old guard and Craig's grounded prior efforts together in suiting harmony, even more so than Spectre which noticeably struggled with its balancing act. We see the most possibly grounded versions of gadgets and villain technology in this universe, plus there's a virus of nanobots that eliminate people by touching them- Talk about being prophetic. There's humor, mad scientists, even more defying stunts and another exceptional villain base of operations. The writing team is one to behold, including being next in line of a trend of bringing comedy meisters into serious franchise efforts- here it's Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The humor that likely came from here was organic and never reached Spectre's most unflattering jokes nor the tone-deafness of some of the Marvel movies or It: Chapter Two. Rabid fans who were expecting (and probably wanting) the writers to reverse the franchise into pandering or softer in polarizing times will be proven wrong as they maintain a lot of Bond's integrity and inner hurt while naturally progressing his arc. (And no, Lashana Lynch's Nomi does not become ""the new James Bond"").If Craig's portrayal in Spectre was that of a quiet, Noir man who didn't say much due to grieving after the death of Judi Dench's M, we see Bond even more vocal here. He's at his most classic and witty, but also mature and vulnerable, and as always- at his wit's end. About the vulnerability; he even comes near crying and even does towards the end (though not to the point of balling). Look out for a tension-filled scene between him and Rami Malek's Lyutsifer Safin, as the world and personal matters are at stake. This was completely earned after years of seeing him so restrained yet willing himself to queen and country at any moment, and should be a truly everlasting moment in his canon.Cary Joji Fukunaga of True Detective fame was a shoo-in for the throne of Sam Mendes, and here he earns his cinematic stripes. In conjunction is Linus Sandgren's cinematography- lush colors and harsh blues mixed naturally with grittiness, real locations and sets that can almost remind one of Michael Mann. The brisk direction also makes for a near-three hour runtime that surprisingly doesn't toil.How about that cast- Returning agents Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris's Moneypenny are as swell as ever due to their ability to be believable in the most dire straits and moments of relief. Jeffrey Wright's Felix Leiter and Ralph Fiennes' M also receive closure in the most unexpected ways; this includes a particularly tense exchange between Commander Bond and M. Newcomer Lashana Lynch delivers as Bond's successor (and even his counterpart) Nomi. Two of the biggest creedences that should be awarded, that side of Craig, are Léa Seydoux as Madeleine Swann and Malek's Safin. With her establishment and small arc in Spectre out of the way, she truly brings it home emotionally. Safin, like Christoph Waltz's Blofeld in our prior excursion, has only limited screen time, but when he's on screen he's simultaneously unstoppable, eldritch and understated.No Time to Die finds a midway breach between the more human than human Post-9/11 outings of post Nolan's Batman and the blockbuster excess of old-fashioned 007 and our modern times. It's everything one could hope for in a Bond swan song, much like The Dark Knight Rises did for Batman or Wolverine's Logan. It's cinematic catharsis, plain and simple.RATING: 4 out of 4 stars.",No Time to Die

A virus that only kills certain people at one given moment? Too stupid even for this franchise.Lea Whatever-her-name-is not the great actress. It was unfortunate of the director to give her close ups when she's crying in the end. Rami Whatshisnamne is laughably bad as the unthreatening villain. Lashana Lynch wears really big pants.

274,Liam3011,No Time to Die is a Fitting Farewell For Daniel Craig **SPOILERS**,10,15 October 2021,"So, I just got home from seeing No Time to Die in cinemas and all I have to say is... wow.Now, hear me out. Despite my score, it's not perfect. I'm more or less giving the score it's getting because it was a very fitting way to end a 15 year run of films with Daniel Craig, who is personally my favourite Bond. I will not lie when I say I got choked up at the end, which I will get into and explain why I think it's a perfect ending. I understand why some people are angry, but you cannot deny that the way they ended this was ballsy. And I'm going to sound even more controversial here... it's my favourite Daniel Craig movie. Not too far ahead of the likes of Skyfall and Casino Royale, but personally I liked this one a lot. The action was incredibly satisfying, the score was phenomenal; the plot was gritty (just like the rest of his other movies) and honestly super dark with it's premise and villain. Biochemical weapons... it's quite a scary thought.Now Safin was not my favourite villain of these movies, that's still Silva from Skyfall. And a gripe I do have was that he wasn't in it a lot. You see tiny pieces of him here or there scattered throughout; I do wish there was more of him in this movie. But what you do see of him is phenomenal and Rami Malek deserves all the praise in the world for his performance; he was cold, he was calculated. The new ""007"" was a very intriguing character, who then does subsequently return the title back to James towards the end of the movie. Very fitting considering how this all ends. And speaking of said ending, let me get into that...Now, I had the ending spoiled for me on TikTok. I knew coming into this movie, James Bond was going to die. But, to the people who record the scene with their phones on release day and put the words ""JAMES BOND'S DEATH SCENE IN NO TIME TO DIE"" in big letters on the video: you're utterly, utterly ignorant and selfish. Not everyone can see the movie at the same time as you. Don't be inconsiderate. And for God's sake, stop recording in a damn cinema! Anyhoo...The ending itself, despite all that, still got me all choked up because I saw all the events leading up to it; the bond James had with all the characters in the movie. Yes, in case you don't already know, James Bond dies. That's why it's ballsy. But I feel as though it was the only way for Craig's Bond to go; sacrificing himself for millions who faced biochemical weapons. Had James not stayed behind and called in the airstrike, the world would have been doomed. It was emotional; it was ballsy; it was epic. And I know, a lot of people got angry at this - I get that. It makes sense. I think they knew it was going to be a polarising movie for that reason alone, but I for one loved it.No, James Bond isn't over. My guess is another reboot will be on it's way - and that's okay.",No Time to Die
275,gabriel-80,James Boring,5,30 September 2021,"No Time To Die is a movie of its time. Usually movies of their time are identified years or even decades later. Not this one.The movie stems with every hot topic of later years, forcing it onto characters in what seems like a defensive move to avoid sh1tstorms from the ever growing population of easily offended. It feels clumsy and too eager to stay current where it should have felt subtle and contemporary.Bond movies used to be pure escapism, but we are now faced with a sensible Bond. No longer a secret agent facing larger than life, memorable villains, but a simple action hero running around with a machine gun like Liam Neeson, Bruce Willis or any other action hero. Nothing in the movie separates it from all the other generic action films of recent.The opening 10 minutes are beautiful and evocative, with a great action sequence, and a nostalgic nod to the sweeping scores of John Barry, but from there on it is down hill except for a fun action scene in Cuba - with a very charming assistant.The villian is diffuse, underdeveloped and forgettable, the plot is an unstructured mess and the one liners truly embarrasing. Worst of all, it doesn't feel one bit like a Bond movie.",No Time to Die

The acting from everyone was incredible. Rami Malek's range is fantastic. A great villain. Léa Seydoux Is yet again incredible with her range of emotions within scenes, a brilliant actor who can tell a story with her face & to my personal favourite ever James Bond, Daniel Craig, he delivered his masterpiece in his final Bond film. The final scene between Bond & Madeleine had me choked up. A beautiful goodbye. The scene with them all sitting around having a drink for James was touching. The everlasting impact. RIP Bond.",No Time to Die
277,bbevis-47954,A Decent Ending with a Few Glaring Flaws,5,11 October 2021,"Craig was awesome of course that goes without saying. Also, the three major set pieces including the first car chase, the 2nd chase/shootout through the foggy woods and the 3rd shootout climbing up the staircase at the ""secret lair"" are solid enough to please any action fan. The problem is we only get three decent action sequences throughout a two hour and 45 minute run time with little tension in between. This brings up my first glaring flaw is with the film's pacing and where it decides to spend it's time. If you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about.The second major flaw for me is No Time to Die's villain. What an utter bore Rami Malek was in this role. There was nothing intimidating about his presence and Malek's acting added little to compensate for how poorly written Safrin is. The opening sequence hinted at some promise with his ruthlessness and a plot point that could have been better elaborated throughout the film but that doesn't happen. Instead we're left with many unanswered questions with what transpired between Safrin and Madeleine. Malek said in interviews he wants to be more than your typical bond ""terrorist"" but unfortunately that is all the writers gave him. His motivation to murder millions because of his families death was cliché and boring. Not the worst bond villain but Safrin is a bore and I wish the writing and his motivations were a little ""Tidier"".The 3rd major flaw is the decision to emotional manipulate the audience through the reveal of Bond's daughter. The reveal meant one or two things. Either Bond is going to die or Madeleine is and the worst case scenario was chosen by the writers. There was little substance or chemistry between Bond and his lover and the relationship with his daughter was not developed at all. For me, I never felt this amazing connection Bond had with Madeleine and thus his fate was rather frustrating. Characters acting in love and telling how much they love each other does not work unless there is believable chemistry. The only two ladies Bond had chemistry with died in Craig's best movies. Vesper and M. In my opinion I think his lover should have bit the dust and the ending we should have got would be with Bond and his daughter. Though this is subjective and I would be lying if I didn't get teary eyed when Bond met his demise. As manipulative as the moment was I suppose it worked only because I have loved Craig as Bond for the past 15 years.The rest of the film has little in terms of forward character development to become invested in anyone and the there is barely any suspense. Your butt will feel the runtime because you're not engrossed with what is happening between the decent action sequences poorly paced throughout the movie. Director Cary Juji Fukunaga explained the writers were still adding to the script or essentially finishing writing during filming of No Time to Die and it shows. As for the woke stuff people complain about that doesn't bother me. However, when it's used to add fruitless character development it does. Letting the audience know Q is gay is not character development. Can we not learn anything more about him other than his sexual preference? Ben Whishaw is great as Q so surely he deserves more because we know he can act well.What about Money Penny or M?I didn't hate my time with No Time to Die though unfortunately it's barely better than Spectre or Quantom of Solace and leaves me concerned for the future of Bond.",No Time to Die

The valor of risking one's own life for who and what he loves, the willingness to sacrifice youth and vitality to eradicate injustice, or the incorruptible faith in his comrades, organization, and country? With the length of about 3 hours, No Time To Die presents us the ultimate end of Bond's legend, adding a decent period mark to the series. After watching all five movies, I feel like Daniel Craig's Bond has nothing to do with Ian Fleming's 007, the character's was full of weakness: arrogance, vengeful, emotional. But after almost 20 years as an agent, Bond has experienced so many which becomes his unique personality: loyal, wise, and adoring love and companionship. Wrinkles indicated the old man's inability, and in this movie, it's time to let go. Until the appearance of Safin, the film did a exceptional job completing the mindset of Bond, but the motives of the antagonist is just bewildering (sorry Rami, I know you had a hard time acting this perplexing character).",No Time to Die

The plot is closing, Daniel Craig is great for his ""last dance"", the action and the setting perfect. But it's a bit to long and the goals of the villain are not always 100% clear.

I found No Time To Die (NTTD) such fascinating since the first scene. Frankly, the director couldn't keep the surprises up till end. The climax is too predictable and I wish no more encounter and conversation between villain and Bond, then Bond no sweat skips all arms pointed to him. Please, conventional Bond had long gone.NTTD also had wasted the supposed to be big role for Rami Malek, the oscar winner. Everyone waits for this, and nothing special about him. The story is simple, well decorated on first hour by amazing action scenes, but not ended nicely. This time Craig shows fragile Bond, emotions over his mind, I wish he is as cold as usual. Think of the final dispute between Safin and Bond is longer, difficult, dramatic and tricky. I always hate stories or scenes depicting the hero could hold the shots while everyone else just died instantly by only one bullet.I believe best villains in Craig's Bond era are still Javier Bardem and Madds Mikkelsen.",No Time to Die
282,roondogbb,Brave choices that may pay off.,8,13 October 2021,"This movie is in many ways like the James Bond movies of old with the traditional catch phrases, gadgets and car chases. Yet it differs strongly in that it is not a stand alone film like perhaps the earlier bond movies tended to be, with Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnen for example. Which allows this movie to tap into the narrative potential of previous movies that leads to excellent and unique results for No Time to Die. Before the film was released it was well known that this film would be Daniel's last outting as M16's 007. There had been rumours and in some cases fear that the new James Bond would be a woman, which supposedly goes against the long established vision creates by Ian Fleming in his books. Maybe but without giving spoilers, this film shows that it doesn't matter the age, race or sex of the 007 representative as long as they do a good job doing it. There doesn't seem to be at least a deep social justice campaign for tbe sake of a campaign itself to change the sex of bond. The narrative has to fit and the person has to feel right in that role. This film like all James Bond films from the beginning has many amazing sets from Norway to Cuba to Italy to Chile and more all on the chase for the bad guys and to foil the ever deepening danger. With modern 4k, cinematography here is just beautiful. Norway being my location of choice. With it Forests, Lakes and Fog.... All the characters besides Bond seem very well written and acted. Their personality jumps out of the screen which helps a lot with regards to sympathizing with them. This includes the villans. From start to end the film is excellent and for its long length. It's worth it. 8/10... I wouldn't give it more because narrative understansing can be a little tricky unless you have watched the previous Daniel Craig films. But 100% go see it.",No Time to Die
283,guskeller,"Mostly very good, occasionally muddled",8,8 October 2021,"Mostly very good yet occasionally muddled, Daniel Craig's Bond sendoff encapsulates his run in the series. Tonally, No Time To Die wrestles with the longstanding Bond dilemma: camp versus class. Meanwhile, No Time To Die attempts to tie a handful of storylines together concisely. The movie does a sufficient job balancing all this but, unfortunately, feels slightly bloated and disjointed at times. A more focused script would've helped the experience greatly. Because while there are good story elements here, they are diluted with superfluous characters, scenes, and plot devices.From a filmmaking perspective, No Time To Die is competent. There are neat sound design moments. The opening car chase is well executed. The soundtrack is iconic. There is an extended, continuous shot of action in a stairwell. Plus, the production design and special effects are high quality. However, none of this is outstanding enough to mark No Time To Die as exceptional. Rami Malek elevates his role and the conclusion is impactfully surprising, but besides that, this film lacks specialness. Therefore, No Time To Die lands firmly as good but not quite great.Writing: 7/10

It concerns a retired James Bond, brilliantly played by Daniel Craig with real conviction, who is living and enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica with his beautiful wife Madeline, wonderfully played by Lex Seydoux, but this is short-lived when his old CIA friend Felix Leiter, superbly played by Jeffrey Wright, appears and asks for his help to find a kidnapped scientist, but this covert mission is more treacherous then expected when Bond discovers a complex plot involving a mysterious scarred face sociopathic villain named Lyutsifer Safin, effectively played by Oscar winner Rami Malek in a truly creepy performance, who possesses a super lethal DNA-altering bioweapon that threatens the entire world. Terrific direction by Fukunaga who gives his film stunning action sequences that are truly jaw-dropping, exceptional supporting performances by Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Christoph Waltz as Biofeld, with special kudos to Lashana Lynch as Nomi the new no-nonsense ""007"" female agent and Ana de Armas as the gorgeous and deadly CIA agent Paloma. Breathtaking cinematography by Linus Sandgren, with an evocative score by Hans Zimmer, and a haunting Grammy Award winning title song which was written and beautifully sung by Billie Eilish. I totally enjoyed and was highly entertained by this expertly-crafted epic film which is a perfect swan song to Daniel Craig's sensational 15 year tenure as James Bond throughout 5 films, and his impressive farewell performance delivers on all levels. Highly recommended.",No Time to Die

That's not to say that there aren't as well innovations that keep it up to date. The casting in particular is clever and the script doesn't take itself too seriously (another Bond tradition upheld). Strong coherent direction, great music by Hans Zimmer, some superb set pieces in exotic locations and a plot that even nods towards Nordic thrillers as well as the usual Bond flavours, this also confirms once again what a great Bond Craig has been. There are faults though. Maybe it's a little too long at 160 mins and the villains lacked real impact, plus there perhaps is a bit too much shoot em up OTT action .

For me ""Casino Royale"" is the best Bond movie ever made and I have seen multiple times. The only good part in this entire movie is the 10-15 mins Ana de Armas appears, completely lights up the screen, rest of the actresses are nothing to write about.They force a god awful love story in a franchise which is about a secret agent and his missions. Unfortunately there is zero chemistry between the lead pair unlike the sheer magic between Vesper and Bond in Casino Royale. You cried when he cries for her in Venice but here you can't understand why is Bond indulging in stupidity for this lady. I felt more for Felix.And the lesser said about the token black 007, the better. If you have no intention of building a wholesome character stop adding characters just for the sake of diversity.And the dialogues, cringeworthy sermons running for minutes which make no sense or connection.

292,tcecoleshaw,"The ending ruins the franchise, watch once.",6,30 October 2021,"No Time To Die is far removed from the rest of the franchise and joins a common theme with other aging franchises that resorts to a disposable culture for its protagonists. It's the Star Trek Generations of the Bond list, let alone the End Game of the Avengers franchise. It's disappointing killing off Felix Leiter. It's unforgiveable killing off Bond himself. It served no purpose other than to ensure Craig could not return. No Only Live Twice here I'm afraid. Ok, so it was also because Bond was infected at the end with something that would kill his love interest (and his child!) if he lived and the virus eventually reach them, with no cure. Noted that the film tries to associate itself with OHMSS at times but that didn't impress me even if there were a couple of fun Easter eggs. The premise of genetic coded viruses seems quite relevant but I fear it's been done before in Moonraker, but with a more precise target in mind. There's lots of action; Bond seems to kill almost as many henchmen as John Matrix in Commando and there's good tension. The car stunts and Q gadgets are great too. There wasn't enough of Cyclops the one-eyed henchman for my liking. There wasn't enough of Blofeld either. And sorry to say the replacement 007 isn't likeable nor able to carry off the role - even volunteering to hand her 007 designation back to Bond because its ""just a number"" - I didn't like it. And just maybe she's no Michelle Rodriguez bad girl which the role really requires. It's not a disappointing movie if taken as a standalone film, but I'm of the opinion that it's ended the long-running franchise format that stretches back to Dr No, and it'll go in a new direction far removed from ""classic Bond"" in the future. Perhaps in the grand scheme of things that's OK, but just like with Star Trek Generations, the ending takes away the replayability of watching the film. I bet the writers were really pleased with themselves but it's far removed from the series overall. Oh, and another theme song that is instantly forgettable, usurped by a reprisal of We have all the time in the world by Louis Armstrong. You must watch it once because you need to do it. But it's the one Bond film I'll never rewatch.",No Time to Die

On the contrary, this is the first bond film to treat its titular character like a true human being. It adds a richness to the legacy of the character by making him someone we can latch on to.My only true gripe with the film that keeps it from an even higher rating is that Rami Malek's villain is criminally under-utilised...his motivations are muddled throughout the movie and it can make the plot seem more convoluted than it ends up being.This story is the first one to really dive deeper into the themes of love amidst carnage that the previous films only touched on.

In terms of the film though it seems after all of this ""I am the first black 007"" and ""this is the woke bond move"" we had to incessantly put up with in interviews before the movies release for two years this is the clear message the film makers wanted to convey is that ""racist jokes"" justifies murder.This took me out of the enjoyment of the movie.

296,Tobeshadow,No time to write an original script!,5,23 October 2021,"The story and writing here were probably the weakest of the entire series. For Spectre the writers ripped plotlines from Austin Powers, and this time they copy Metal Gear Solid, Logan and Avengers: Endgame because it's so hip and cool for male heroes to have daughters and die these days. The humour was awkward and totally out of place. I really like Rami Malek but he was totally wasted as the villain and there was absolutely zero motivation for his plan to wipe out millions of people.Having finally re-established Spectre in the series they were unceremoniously wiped out in five minutes and Blofeld got equally swiftly dispatched. M was just made out to be a useless man, because they totally get put in charge of a nation's security, and we were meant to invest in Bond's relationship with Madeleine, despite her being utterly immemorable in the last film. Now she is meant to be basically the most important woman in Bond's entire history though so better start liking her quickly!Wherever the writers do something subversive, the claim is that it's fine because Daniel Craig's films don't take place in the same world as the other Bonds, yet every time they run out of ideas, they steal from the other films. This is done most egregiously with the use of All The Time In The World at the end of the film, utterly relying on fans' love of OHMSS and using it for a half hearted and depressing ending that totally kills the James Bond character. That song belongs to Bond and Tracy in OHMSS, and feels totally earned in that film, but now it's also associated with this film because the writers were too lazy to do something new and had to steal the feeling and emotion from a previous and beloved film. That is just lazy.I'm giving this film a 5 solely for the excellent production design, some good stunts and a few stand out scenes but for me this is the worst Bond film ever made and the first time I've come out of one deflated and depressed. OHMSS is a rightful exception, it earned its ability to make me feel that way. This film does not do that and the decision to ever kill James Bond in a film is just stupid and misguided. If they make more films now that have any reference to previous entries, then this death will make no sense, but if they don't use anything from the old entries then the next film won't really be the 26th Bond film anymore, just another reboot.

Rami Malek's character is a bit dull and the 'new' 007 isn't really given much character. Bond himself is also a bit depressing throughout.Normally I see a Bond in the cinema and think it's great but then my opinion goes down when I see on tv.

The opening montage was signature, a long tortuous episode of action and grit. It was really nice to see homage paid to locales, music and friends of Bond's past, as we took a walk through history of sorts.The speed at which Bond experiences loss and pain is matched by his frenetic efforts to finish one last great mission for his nation and his world. All the fears of an emasculated Bond were way overblown, if anything he epitomized Commander Bond, and got his due respect.This movie is quite emotional and brings the Craig era to a satisfactory close, tying threads going back to Casino Royale.

Nanobots as weapon of mass destruction? It is unreasonable, illogical and kinda spits into everybody who is remotely able to think. Also- two miniguns behind the headlights of a tiny Aston DB5? Where is the ammunition coming from? And wouldn't it be crazy just to shoot everything 360° around the car? And who could even survive this?Then there is the Aston Valkyrie in Q's workshop... really? This car would make any sense as undercover vehicle?And the villains island? It is just too much (with the poisonous garden and all).Second the villain- the story is told a bit convoluted. It is not that it is a bad performance (it is brilliant)- nor that the villain is bleak- but his motivation is not clear.Third- the new 007- she is cool and she is badass- but I feel that her character has been widely underdeveloped. Would be great if she could proof to be a better 007 in future?The good stuff: Daniel Craig is really good. So is the acting of everyone.

But No Time to Die is much better than an average Bond fare. Recognizing that the original, Cold War era character is overdue for retirement, No Time to Die is a proper military funeral for Bond (yes, it's a spoiler, too).What I did not expect was the human side of Bond, someone who cares about his friends and partners, while remaining a tough guy (with visible wear and tear). The script manages to reconcile it with the usual Bond stuff.Rami Malek is a great actor, although his villain is a bit too generic. Still, the opening is much more interesting and tense than yet another ""blowing everyone up"" Bond intro.Funny enough, there are no ""sleep with and forget"" Bond girls, at all. Bond comes off as a gentleman and a professional with the characters of Ana de Armas and Lashana Lynch. The quips and the one-liners are there though, and they fit in well.I don't care what Connery's fans say, but Craig's Bond is the best Bond, and No Time to Die is the perfect ending.

Everything I heard about the production just made it sound worse and worse.. they strip him of his 007 title and then blow him up..?? Are you kidding me?? The #1 rule in Bond films is that he always makes his escape and they broke that rule.Had this been a movie with the same script just not about Bond, it probably would have been a decent enough story but as a Bond fan my entire life, going back to the Sean Connery days, I think I speak for any other true fan by saying this was a huge middle finger to us and the creator.

Elaborate, hollow, convoluted and meaningless action set pieces that test the limits of credulity and give you no reason to care about the result of them, though it's always obvious that no harm can come to Bond. The sincere attempts at emotional feeling are merely embarrassing and the action is slick to the point of translucency.

312,jditch,Very Good - Avoid the FAKE reviews.,8,3 October 2021,"No Time to Die is a very good film. Objectively speaking it probably has the best fights of the entire franchise, some of the best action scenes and I'd argue the best cinematographically tracked scene ever in a Bond. It also features one of the most refreshing and empowering takes on a bond girl we've seen on film.So why do some hate it? Probably because the stakes are high. Growing up with the Brosnan films, I too miss the light hearted 'heto' of Britain. But I accept this is the final film in a series focussed on a more realistic view of Bond. Because I'm an adult I can accept that this isn't my perfect bond, but probably the perfect bond film about this bond. If you enjoyed Skyfall, you'll adore this film.Personally I think the direction this film takes is brave and refreshing in some sense.I think it would be fair to call NTTD a loveletter to bond fans. The cars, the soundtrack, even the stunts callback to other films in the series.I suspect that some of the negative reviews are coming from a certain kind of person, the kind we've seen blast the Last of Us for having women with muscles. In an age where anyone can post their opinions, we're bound to see more and more reviews based purely on self preference rather than objectively based.

The action was very good and well choreographed as well. The dialogue was also very well written and never got too corny.The Bad:
While the characters were well casted they didn't have much chemistry. I don't know if it was because of the pandemic and they didn't spend a lot of time with each other or if that was part of the direction the director wanted them to act towards Daniel Craig's character because he was retired and they hadn't seen him in a while.At times the story did slow down but it was only for a few scenes and those scenes were necessary for Bond's character arc.The villain's ending was anticlimactic imo.The Ugly:

325,sterlinrivera-2000,An Awesome Final Bond Film,9,17 October 2021,"After multiple delays, the wait is finally over, and No Time to Die finally came out. I saw it, and thought it was not only an amazing 25th Bond entry, but also a great way to end James Bond once and for all.In this film, James Bond (Daniel Craig) leaves active service and is enjoying life in Jamaica. His quiet life then gets disturbed when is CIA pal Felix (Jeffery Wright) asks for his help. He must go on a mission to to rescue a kidnapped scientist, Valdo (David Denick). But then, things take an unexpected turn when there happens to be a new villain, Safin (Rami Malek), who is armed with dangerous new technology, and is out to bring conflict to Bond and his love interest, Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) as Safin rescued her once when she was a kid. It is now up to Bond to put an end to Safin'a treacherous plans.No Time to Die was an awesome movie and I can safely say it was definitely worth the wait, and is by far the best film I've seen in 2021. For 2 and a half hours, the film ran in a great pace, it had a well developed story. The acting was great from everyone. Daniel Craig did a tremendous job playing James Bond one last time. Rami Malek was an amazing villan. Léa Seydoux was a great love interest for Bond. And other cast members like Ralph Fieenes as M, Lashana Lynch as Nomi, and definitely Ana de Armas as Paloma were all great in the film. I wish Ana de Armas had a bit more screen time, but she was still awesome and quite beautiful.The action is basically the typical Bond action that's been high scale and top notch since Goldeneye (1995). Really great stunt work and shoot out sequences in the film. Not the best action ever in a Bond film, but still pretty unique.The only minor flaw that I had with the film was the ending, and this is a HUGE spoiler. So please don't read any further;The ending is basically where James Bond sacrifices himself on Safin's nanobot factory at the end of the movie. Safin shoots Bond in the back a couple times, but Bond manages to defeat and kill Safin and climb out of the inside of the factory. He realizes Safin infected him with a vial containing nanobots and is slowly getting poisoned. He calls Swann over the radio saying he's not going to make it and tells her he loved and she tells him that he is the father of her daughter, which he already knew. Bone's crew then launches missiles to the factory unaware Bond was still on it, and Bond ultimately sacrifices himself. The film then ends with Swann driving with her daughter, and tells her about her father, James Bond.The ending wasn't bad but it just really caught me off guard. Bond is a character that I feel you could never die, and it was really unexpected that they chose to kill him off. However, because this was Craig's last outing as Bond and it was the 25th Bond film, they probably felt it was best to close the books on James Bond once and for all. It may be inevitable, but they'll probably make more Bond films, even though I think they shouldn't seeing as how this film brought proper closure to the 50 year long series.At the end of the day, No Time to Die was awesome, was amazing to seeing Daniel Craig one last time as Mr. Bond, and was a depressing yet satisfying way to end my favorite movie series of all time.",No Time to Die

331,rockinkettles-1,Ignore the haters. New Bond is an exciting movie.,8,8 October 2021,It's finally here. The newest Bond movie with the final performance by Daniel Craig as James Bond. This is a very good action packed thriller that starts off with a literal big bang that took me by surprise. There are some spectacular action scenes. Especially at the beginning (a motorcycle stunt wowed me) and later with an exciting car chase into the woods. The villian in this one played by Rami Malak is good but not as good as other villains we've seen in the past. He always talks in an almost whisper. A better villain should have been added to the story. And the theme song by Billie Eillish is just ok. I like it more now than when I first heard it but it still isn't very memorable. I don't like how she sings. She more or less whispers lyrics that is kind of annoying. I think she is ovverrated...Anyway. This movie does wrap up the last appearance by Craig as Bond...James Bond...and all I will say is the ending is emotional. I wiped away tears and was still a bit surprised by the ending even though I had a feeling it would end this way.And I just have to say that other reviews on here by whining trolls just really need to get a life. I am so tired of seeing movies get trashed on here by wanna be childish reviewers who need to stop sucking their thumbs and grow up.

332,Critomaton,Meh... Time to Die!,6,10 October 2021,"OK, wow, this really wrapped up loose ends nicely. Also, it's the most emotionally moved I've been by a James Bond film. The emotional part of On Her Majesty's Secret Service was good but too brief and too close to the end to evoke cathartic tears like No Time To Die did. I was crying all through the credits - partly from the on-screen drama but also partly because I realized that the era of escapist James Bond films I grew up with is over.More Ana de Armas please. More Lea Seydoux please. These pleas are directed at the Universe, not necessarily at James Bond filmmakers.Safin was a dud. So was that goofy Russian scientist. Did I hear correctly, did the scriptwriters really have him go racially genocidal at the very end after playing him for laughs for two hours? Also, were those pools of water in the poison garden nanobots, or poison plants, or what? Really confusing.Way, way, way too much time between way too few action sequences. The opening chase was OK but completely spoiled by the trailers. The Cuba shootout was decent. The SUV chase / forest takedown scenes were some of the best action in James Bond history. Sorry, though, if you're gonna drag this stuff out you need to have way more stunt sequences than that.I am so sick of the use of the Goldfinger-era Aston Martin DB5. It was a huge anachronism in Skyfall (not to mention Goldeneye) and even more out of place here, since it got destroyed in Skyfall. I see they managed to shoehorn in Aston Martins from 3 different eras (even the Dalton-era model looks practically antique now), but they really didn't do much so it's kind of like ""What's the point?"" Homage for homage's sake is just lazy in a movie with this much legacy to carry.OK, we can have a new 007, especially since James Bond is officially dead (unless he's a Voorhees by DNA). That's all I'm gonna say about that...I loved the emotional impact of introducing James' daughter. She looks like their kid too. But it was kind of silly how she got away from her kidnappers.Somehow I always pictured abandoned WWII submarine pens repurposed by the Soviets as having more personality. What a dreary (and boring) locale for the grand finale. James runs up steps, waits for henchmen to pop their heads out, and shoots; lather, rinse, repeat.I guess this movie is better than Spectre, but not by much. I'd put it precisely at the top of the bottom half of James Bond movies. 95% of the best Bond flicks are 40 years old or older so, yeah, I'm OK with this being Craig's swan song. At least he went out with a bang.",No Time to Die

334,jmcd2007,Good first half with an ending that breaks nearly 60 years of tradition,6,17 October 2021,"I was hoping for Daniel Craig's final 007 film to be close to the quality of ""Casino Royale."" Sadly, it was not. The first half was pretty smooth. The action and scenery were great and seeing both Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton's Aston Martins in one film were cool, but everything after the scenes in Cuba went downhill after that.A Craig era Bond ally takes a shocking death early on in the film. Daniel Craig's performance was not bad. Ana de Armas (Paloma) was a standout but was underused. Furthermore, like his time in the previous film, Christoph Waltz (Blofeld) could have also had more screen time as well. As for Rami Malek, he's a fine actor, but his character of Safin was poorly written and there was no explanation as to why he wanted to do the things that he had planned. There was also no explanation behind Madeleine's daughter. Further, several attempts at humor felt flat. Although lengthy, however, the screen time of the film did not bother me.Moving on to Lashana Lynch. No disrespect to her as an actress, but her role of Nomi/007 didn't really make a lot of sense to me at all. She quite frankly seemed out of place. We find out that since Bond's retirement (he is also now tied to the C. I. A.), Nomi has taken his number and is an active agent for MI6. However, she ended up relenquishing the 007 number once James Bond was re-instated and then kind of disappeared off screen not long after the fact. Seemed more to me like a political statement than anything else. No disrespect to women here, but if Barbara Broccoli and company aren't interested in casting a woman as the next 007, then why bother casting her in such a role? What point were they trying to make here?This is also the softest I've ever seen James Bond get in a film. The sensitive moments in the film are very un-Bond like and the ending is a total repudiation of the Ian Fleming novels. Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Barbara Broccoli all need to retire and pass the torch to another group of people that actually respects the novels. Somehow after this film, ""James Bond Will Return.""

The second half I enjoyed much more and felt it pulled together better. I mostly liked the ending. Thought it was quite poignant.

337,berndgeiling,Time To Say Goodbye,8,6 October 2021,"What I always liked about Daniel Craigs characterization of Bond was his ability to enrich and deepen his agent's personality with much more complex, serious and ambivalent emotions.His acting skills were way more intelligent and adult than most of his predecessors (maybe with the exception of Sean Connery), reflecting a much more complex and serious world we're living in nowadays, leaving the caricatures of 007 and the superficial times of irony and playfulness behind.A character who seemed to be much rougher, unpolished on the outside, but with a soft and sensitive inner core, making the character much more believable for my taste.Here he's finally even reaching our #metoo-reality of today, and I really appreciated this turn. The women he deals with are no longer just sex objects without a personality anymore, they're treated with sometimes sarcastic respect, and in this final case even with care and real love, and he's fully aware of the fact that he couldn't even make it without their life saving support.Overlong action opera, beautifully photographed, with a taste of classic Greek Tragedy in the end.There's no way to save your life from the Evil and there comes a time to die for everyone.",No Time to Die

I hadn't heard much about it but I had read the directors comments on the previous Bond films!Enough said about that nonsense.When the film started I thought, what is this, this isn't Bond, then after a few minutes the first action sequence started, Bond at last.On the whole the film is good but it has issues.Bond is no longer 007, no that role is filled by a black female who is seemingly devoid of any likable traits, I don't care what colour she is, but Bond is 007, later in the film she relinquishes the number but why do that in the first place!The plot of the film is decent and its got plenty of the action that we expect from Bond. There are deaths a plenty and that brings me to the biggest issue I had with this film. Bond never dies, yes he goes away and comes back as a different actor often with a slightly different personality etc.If you like Bond we all know this was Craig's last outing in the role but to actually kill him off! WTF, that in my opinion is a huge mistake in fact massive! How can you have James Bond when we've all apparently just watched him die?Unless of course he didn't but that would be slightly ridiculous and it will need some inventive writing to get around.On the whole not a bad film and certainly better than Spectre, it is long but not boring, but it has issues, some of them major. Bond needs to get back to the familiar format that we all love, stop hiring woke director's that have their own agendas, otherwise Bond will not survive.",No Time to Die
339,Serva,"Not the Bond we want, but the one we deserve",5,4 October 2021,"I think the pre-credits scenes and the first quarter or so of the movie until they go to Cuba, is evocative of Craigs best Bond movies, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The more serious Nolan-esque harshness mixed with that little bit of charm. When whats her face takes off her wig the movie nose-dives and never gets back up on its feet again.When watching the film it is very obvious that there was a lot of re-editing and rewriting done. The main plot is about nanorobots ""infecting"" people and killing them, as long they match a certain DNA code. Yet when we get to the villain's island lair, he is growing... ? Something? Someone didn't quite think this one through, nanorobots might be microscopic, but they are machines. Growing them makes about as much sense as growing a computer in your garden. The plot must've started out as Safin using his skills with poisonous plants to grow some sort of deadly virus-like weapon to contaminate the world with, but they thought it was too close to the Covid virus that nobody wants to hear about now. So they had to change it, but had probably already filmed all of the scenes on the plant, possibly early on in the production.The serious tone of the movie's first part is sneakily replaced by a much more goofy Marvel-esque vibe that just leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. In parts it feels more akin to Austin Powers, for example in the scene where all the Spectre agents are killed off. If you took all that time setting up Spectre in the previous film, why just kill them off here like Snoke in The Last Jedi?Bond is emasculated to the point where it feels like a mercy killing when he dies in the end. Where is the Bond character from the previous 24 movies? The cold-blooded womanizer? Who is this bleeding-heart family man? Please, if you do character development, don't do it for no reason whatsoever after the character has stayed the same for decades.The most remarkable thing in the movie must have been seeing SUV's being driven not in the center of a city. I fully understand that these movies cost a small nation's GNP to create and that product placement is a must, but come on. That was just 10-minute commercial within the film.I hope the coming installments in the series can find its way back to the glory days and reinvent them, without resorting to the sort of pandering this film is responsible for.",No Time to Die

But the story at times seems to be rushed and doesn't know which way to go. Rami Malek is not the best villain either, he just doesn't hit it as the evil guy.

344,bienkow78,Time to die,1,9 October 2021,The weak feminists have watered down and emasculated a james bond to the point of idiocy. Bumbling character who gets frightened emotional and startled %75 of the movie being talked down to at every turn. In every movie and the key element to james bonds charm is that he is one step ahead of everyone with smooth clever crafty precision... In this movie he is 2 mabe 3 steps behind with a side of incompetence and a majorly bitter weak vibe. His cast does the heavly lifting and bond is a replica older version that floats through the movie besides the opening action scene. One last thrill before you squirm in your seat and force down this fraudfest by the director. Oh and James bond literaly dies the end.,No Time to Die
345,bienkow78,Worst time to die,1,9 October 2021,WHAT a fraudulent highjacking of your time... Daniel craig coasts through the movie unasured and insecure making mistake after mistake. This was a parody of James Bond playing second and third fiddle to feminists and cowards. So the James Bond formula of a certain masculine charming presence on a mission who is always one or two steps ahead brooding between tension and humor has been disolved into a bumbling idiot who dies and never needed to he just kind of does... on par with ghostbusters feminazi remake in 2016.,No Time to Die
346,schlangz,Congratulations you made the worst Bond of all time,3,31 October 2021,"To avoid any misunderstanding: I love Daniel Craig and Casino Royal was imho one of the best Bond movies. What came after Casino Royal was kind of meh but it was still watchable, but No Time to Die is just so bad that nobody ever will watch this movie a second time.This movie fails on so many levels. I ran one minute late and even the opening sequence was so weird that after 3 minutes I had to ask the guy next to me if I'm really in a 007 movie...Then suddenly all my hopes went up when we get the first action sequence, Craig at its best, the bridge stunt, the vintage Aston Martin, beautiful. Next action scene, bad guys steal the virus and use this badass magnet device to jump down the elavator, that's why we love James Bond movies. Fast forward to another action scene, Ana de Armas is absoutely stunning and I love the chemistry between her and Craig. She almost steals the showBut everything else in this movie? It's just so bad!!the woke black female 007. No charisma, no presence, she is just completely unlikable. I don't care the fact that she is black, she was just bad. They could have switched the actors of 007 and Moneypenny it would have been amazing. And she even dares to woke at Craig, saying it's just a number. Bond is a legend, and every other MALE actor would have showed his respects when meeting him, but of course the woke female 007 doesn't. What an insult to James Bond fans...the villain (Hackerman!!) never really gets introduced, or barely gets screentime. Who is that guy and why should I think about that guy?blofeld dies in the most unspectactular way possiblefelix dies. Again, in the most unspectacular way possiblea gay ""Q"". Awesome. This is exactly what we wanted. Now we know what the ""Q"" stands for, maybe the next movie will give us ""L"" and ""G"" tooA ""cameo"" of a guy that looks like Idris Elba. Or was it the real Idris Elba?the worst opening credits ever. Literally everybody in the cinema pulled out his smartphone during that time.Movie is just too long. After 90 minutes you just want it to be over because it feels more like a drama/love story than a 007 moviethe car chasing scenes. Literally every land rover rolls over after one contactAsh. We see him 2 seconds before his car rolls over. His death may lhave ooked good on paper but it was ridiculous on screenThe one-eyed henchman. Such a wuss, even gets tricked by the BondgirlBond has a kid. Why? Bond is a spy, a womanizer, a badass, no friends, no relatives, no family. Why give him a child? Maybe good for a Craig movie, but not for a 007 movieCraig ditches half a million bullets but then gets shot twice by the bad guy.Bond DIES. WHAT. IN. GODS. NAME. The real bond would have never died. The real bond would have never committed suicide like that. Bond would have never accepted the fact that he can't be healed, he would have spent the rest of his life trying to get rid of the nanobots.Speaking of nanobots. He gets an EMP watch. And you moron screenwriters try to tell us you can't destroy nanobots with an EMP? He literally has the cure on his wrist, but no he just gives up.I'm so disappointed with all that crap, and it's so sad seeing Craig leave the franchies like that. I even feel sad for his daughter's stuffed bunny.1 star for Craig, 1 star for Ana de Armas and 1 star for the bunny.Can't wait to see the woke reboot: 007 Origins. 007 Evolution. 007 ReloadedCan we please have a white female SHAFT instead?",No Time to Die
347,zeki-4,Not what I expected! An epic conclusion!,8,28 September 2021,"In 2006 the first Bond movie with Daniel Craig - the wonderful reboot 'Casino Royale' - was supposed to show us how Bond became who he is. But they didn't stop there. Three Bond movies followed that exploited the character, showing him as vulnerable, dealing with his past, quitting the service several times and having a hard time figuring women or life out: 'Quantum of Solace' (2008) - a fast-paced hard-to-follow shakycam thrillride, 'Skyfall' (2012) with its ludicrous plot and a villain's scheme that made no sense and the heavily graded 'Spectre' (2015) with its clumsy script.Now, in 2021, No Time to Die, the longest Bond movie ever, is finally here after being delayed three times and oh man...this was actually great!No Time to Die is really a real treat. It is beautifully shot (IMAX cameras were used in many scenes) and wonderful to look at. The three big setpieces work fine. But they are much, much too short. The Hans Zimmer score is the best James Bond score, since David Arnold composed 'Casino Royale', meaning bombastic and melodic, with a couple of unexpected nods to earlier Bond movies.No Time to Die is well acted, and I have to say that Ana de Armas steals the show away from all other than Craig. Sadly her part was very small. Great chemistry between her and Bond. I hope to see her back as the half-drunk agent!The pacing is also mostly fine, there's a fair amount of thrilling edge-of-your seat moments and the locations are varied and put to good use as they should be (especially the Italy and Norway scenes). It is also the most emotional and bold Bond movie ever attempted.As a die-hard Bond fan, I have been pretty much disappointed with the last three, and after Terminator and Star Wars going woke I was a bit afraid that the Bond franchise would suffer the same fate. And yes...wokeness is certainly here to some extent, because in these times you can't have a suave unethical gambling self-assure single masculine womanizer roaming the silver screen. So they turned James Bond into a feminist family man who can't figure women or life out. This ""alternative"" take on the James Bond character may put some people off. It's not a huge issue for me though. The glamourous larger-than-life character WILL return one day. And I do miss THAT guy!The massive team behind this last Bond movie should be very proud! Much to my surprise, and against many odds, they actually nailed it!",No Time to Die
348,glenn-whitelaw,Very enjoyable movie. But craig dosent have connery or moores comedic timing,9,9 October 2021,From the first scene if you're a bond fan you recognise. Overall Daniel Craig has done thr character justice and is maybe more like how bond should be. But Connery will always be the best. But a fitting end and how I view how heroes should be done. Tearful.,No Time to Die
349,3_the_monkey,Absolute disbelief,1,9 October 2021,"The sheer arrogance of the writers Fukunaga to think that after directing 1 bond fins that he has the right to kill him off for all future generations of bond fans, to think he will be the last director of bond. I'm even massively disappointed in Daniel Caig whom was my favourite Bond, to be a part in the killing off of the character, it makes me see him in a whole new light, to think he has the right to be the last Bond, to think that himself must think nobody can do better!Bond is a British institution, a torch to be handed down from generator to generation, bigger than the actor playing him and certainly bigger than the director who has been gifted the opportunity of putting an incarnation of Bond on the big screen. Fleming, Connery they all would be turning in their graves at the selfishness of this generation to think that they own the character and that they can kill him off as they see fit.It's disgusting to think that my children and my children's children will never have the opportunity to follow this great British character.Good on Danny Boyle for walking if he truly did it because he disagreed with killing off Bond, at a point in history where we need heroes they've killed off one of the all time British greats.If they wanted to create a New character then make a spin-off film, leave Bond alone, he is timeless and evolves with every generation just like the great British people do....For the writers and directors of this generation to have the arrogance to think they've do e everything that can be done with Bond and to kill him off, for them to think they can do better than every future generation is shocking, if they cannot think of anything more then it's their limited imagination, they don't have the right to restrict future generations of writers and directors.Every generation has had a take on Bond and every generation has been different, that's the joy of Bond, every actor portrayed a different version of the same character and that's what makes Bond, not 007, Bond great! The shaken not stirred, martini drinking Aston Martin driving, super spy who puts queen and country first!",No Time to Die
350,amoore-4,No time to die! The money's too good!!,1,1 October 2021,"Reviewing the demise of Craig's latest Bond is easy: watch the YouTube clip where in an interview he says, to the effect ""Another Bond movie? Over my dead body. Well, maybe... if they pay me an insane amount of money, maybe""He got two things right in this revealing interview: over his dead body and an insane amount of money.When an actor is bored with/ finished being truthful to a beloved character, the actor should step aside or be replaced. And when an actor turns to the camera and says 'I'll do this movie only if the producers pay me tons of money' he should never have the chance to play the role again. His heart is not in it. For just under three hours he's humming Pink Floyd's ""Money"" to himself.This movie is insulting on all levels but most of all to millions of fans who have loved Ian Fleming's novels and the on screen actors who personified James Bond 007.",No Time to Die
351,rafiado,Good but not that special,8,2 October 2021,"I just watched the movie and I love it, i really enjoyed the movie but I never watch James Bond before and when I first watch James Bond, James Bond Was died.When movie was started there's a jump scare that make me shock, I love the cinematography love all in this movie and the cast of course, Ana De Armas was so gorgeous in this film!, make me fell in love with her.The CGI it was so good but idk they use it or not, and I love no time to die song it was super good.

352,amalank,Mindblowing!,9,4 October 2021,"I've been a big James Bond fan since I was 13 years old and for me, the release of a new James Bond movie is like an event. It has been 6 years since the release of the previous movie, Spectre. There have been difficulties getting No Time To Die off the startline. Then there were the numerous delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Now finally, Daniel Craig's swansong in the form of No Time To Die has finally arrived!Personally I absolutely loved it! The story was a great one with great character development and dynamic woven into it. Rami Malek did great as the villain. I know some people thought he was a bit underused which I can see why. The action sequences were fantastic. Hans Zimmer did a great job with the score. I'm really glad they brought him on as I love a lot of his scores and he is a legend in Hollywood. The theme song by Billie Eilish was also great and in combination with yet another fantastic signature credit sequence.Without giving anything away, it does have its twists to the point where they will shock and even polarise Bond fans and moviegoers. I personally thought it really added to the movie although it is going to take me some time to sink in. And at some point, I will need to watch it again.It has the longest runtime for a Bond movie at 2 hours and 43 minutes. But I thought it was paced out really well and I didn't really feel it. I would advise going to the toilet beforehand and giving it your full focus as there is a lot going on.No Time To Die certainly fits in my personal top 5 list of James Bond movies. And for certain, I will get it as part of the Blu Ray boxset when it comes out.",No Time to Die
353,bock_g,"A pretty solid finale for Craig, if not for the series as a whole.",8,8 October 2021,"After five long years of waiting, I finally watched ""No time to Die"" this afternoon. It was very entertaining, the pacing and all felt like a solid fun Bond flick (despite its running time). Lets start with the performances. Daniel Craig is at his funniest and most dramatic as Bond, he talks as much as he moves-the humor I suppose is Pheobe Waller-Bridge's last minute polishes on the script, he really delivers. All the other supporting casts were pretty solid, the female 007 was a lot better than I expected. Ana De Armas as the CIA agent was pretty sexy and fun to watch-I wish she had more screen time. The one actor whom I thought gave the worst perfomance was Rami Malik. His portrayal was pretty dull and half the time I could barely understand what he was saying. The plot was pretty timely given the current Covid pandemic, tying all the loose ends from the previous Craig films was well done. The action was great, the title track was great, all the nods to the previous films (dating back to On Her Majesty's Secret Service) were good.Which brings me to the ending. James Bond, for the first time in the history of the franchise actually dies. I wasn't really surprised, in fact I expected it since there was some clear forshadowing in the pre title sequence, and the fact that James Bond has a daughter. The execution was kind of sloppy, but again Craig did a really good job so I thought it was worth it. Listening to ""We have all the time in the world"" was pretty spine-chilling.The credits roll, ending with ""James Bond will Return"". Personally, I think its really gonna be a huge challenge to top Craig-this film was a good swan song for the actor's tenure if not for the series itself. That being said, if there is gonna be a new Bond I'm excited to see what they come up with. In the meantime, I'm gonna watch this film again theaters.",No Time to Die

The makers' determination to politically correct every aspect of the storyline rob the Bond character of his flaws and shortcomings.There are 2 incredible actors cast as villains - Christoph Waltz and Rami Malek - but over here they are the dullest villains ever in the Bond franchise.The one bright spark is Ana de Armas who brings some energy and smiles in an extremely short appearance as Paloma.There are moments of delightful cinematography and some wonderful locales. It might revive cinema from the lockdown and full compliments to the makers for that.However, with a run time of 2 hours and 43 minutes there's ample time for the audience to die of boredom. A mediocre conclusion to Daniel Craig's version of Bond.Finally my request to the makers, let the next Bond be female, gay, coloured or whatever but give us a story peppered with wit and charm.",No Time to Die
357,Ben_Horror,"No, It Is Surely Time To Die",7,10 November 2021,"There is an opening scene in 1971's 'Diamonds Are Forever': Sean Connery-aka James Bond-walks over to a lounging bikini-clad woman. She thinks he's there for pleasure and poses suggestively. But he's got other things on his mind and one swift movement of his hand later, he's obtaining valuable information from her, all the while choking her out with her own deftly removed bikini top... Call it whatever you want, but that is the essence of Bond. That's what the books were and are: Bond was always something of a selfish and sexist character. But we live in an age of increasingly watered down fiction, where this is now unacceptable, which is why Bond too is now being compromised/adjusted to be politically correct for the masses. What wil be next, a genteel, cross-dressing Macbeth? A gender reversal/lesbian themed remake of Tom Sawyger? Where will it all end? For Bond, it all started with 'Skyfall', where it was hinted that, yes, James Bond does not just like the ladies, anymore, he may have had dalliances with guys too. And it went steadily downhill from there. Suffice to say that in Bond's current iteration, it would not be out of the realm of disbelief to see Craig's Bond gagging for air while getting choked out by his own Borat-style mankini-with this movie's 007 being the one doing the strangling this time, but more on that later.After a great opening sequence (though still not quite as good as the one in 'Skyfall'), the plot kicks into gear: a super virus is stolen from a secret London lab and a scientist goes missing. It's up to Bond to come out of his self-imposed retirement,find the scientist and track down the virus. Along the way he discovers that another (female) agent 'Nomi' has been appointed his iconic 'double O' number. They work separately from each other for a while before finally uniting to bring down the bad guys(Rami Malek and company). There is some good action here: the aforementioned opening sequence, the break in at the lab, the sinking ship, the shootout in Cuba and the chase through the misty, primordial forests in Norway-all that is effectively staged and well done. It's what's in between is where the issues arise...While there's been a lot of controversy made about the relinquishing of the famous number, that's the least of the problem-after all, to quote Nomi (Lashana Lynch) the new proprietor of the 007 tag, it IS only a number, and numbers can be reassigned. The main issue here is what's been done with Bond himself. It appears as if someone just woke up one morning and decided: James Bond has treated women so badly all these years, it's now time for him to PAY. And does one make James Bond pay? Simple: give him a woman whom he truly loves, and (yes, seriously) a daughter. Then, through plot contrivances so overcooked, manipulate it so he can never see them/touch them again. There-take that Mr. Bond, you misogynist woman-user, you!And if that doesn't make matters any worse, the makers decide to do a one-eighty and kill off Bond at the end. Admittedly, in a movie that's full of confusing turns, it's not exactly clear why he must die. At first you assume it's to keep the blast doors from opening on a timer or something to that effect, but as they don't attempt to reopen after he closes them for the second time, why did he have to remain there? Furthermore, there's Safin's (Rami Malek's) scheme to kill/injure(?) Bond's love interest Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) using some kind of... tea(?): if revenge is his thing, why not just shoot her? And when his plan is collapsing near the end, rather than hold on to Bond's daughter as a hostage for insurance to guarantee his escape, he unfathomably lets her go... why?. Later, we see a scientist fall into a swimming pool-size tank of liquid, where protectively clad workers are tending to it, only for the scientist to burn/melt... why? Even Safin's plan to infect Bond midway through the movie with the virus that instead infects everyone else(because they were switched or something) seems very convoluted. Yes, this is a Bond you will not fully understand on first viewing.Craig at least seems reenergized and less bored here than he was in the last three outings (a legacy of knowing his tenure as Bond is finally at an end?). As for the addition of 007 having a daughter, look at it for what it is: it was not added to the story for nothing. To quote the song title of the previous Bond movie 'Spectre', the writing is on the wall. The addition of the daughter is neither an accident or a one-off. As the Bond series has a history of aping whatever is in fashion at that particular moment in time (i.e., Hitchcock, Kung Fu movies, blaxploitation, Star Wars, 80s action movies, Batman, Bourne, etc ), keep an eye out in the future for an accompanying series of movies starring Bond's daughter existing alongside the regular Bond series-aka a 'shared universe' just like what Marvel is doing.So, in light of all that, where exactly does 'No Time To Die' fall? There are two ways of looking at it. As an action movie, it's perfectly acceptable and competent; but as a Bond movie, however, it pretty much fails. While it delivers on a few good action sequences, what remains is a very diluted Bond adventure. Normally, Bond seduces all the 'Bond girls'-sorry: WOMEN-but in this one, he's left humiliated when he tries to seduce a woman whose only purpose is to turn down his advances (why was she so quick to unbutton his shirt then?) and save his hide because, well, you know, Bond is now too old and inept. The message here is clear: you're too obsolete, Mr. Bond; you're yesterday's news. It's time for version 2.0. These are strange times we live in.",No Time to Die

360,kuner-59029,The worst Bond movie yet,2,30 September 2021,"Yes, I'm aware of the existence of View to a Kill and Quantum of Solace. The latest Bond outing makes even those look like Kubrick by comparison.What we have here is an overly long vapid melodrama which boils down to the usual Hollywood ""everyone is related"" trope. The writing is ridiculous, devout of the subtle wit of previous Bond movies, devoid of any hint of sexuality or charm. It's a boring slog, weighed down by bad acting. Why is everyone whispering? This is the 4th Bond movie in a row where the villains just whisper while trying to channel Heath Ledger's Joker head tilts. It's embarrassing. None of the villains enjoy their work anymore, nor do they get any screen time anymore. No more long cat and mouse games between Bond and the villain like in the past.Now it's just ""you're my long lost step brother. But I will kill you, because I am traumatized and angry"". It feels small, petty and stupid.The direction here is surprisingly pedestrian as well. Skyfall at least had excellent direction and photography, but it all feels uninspired here.Léa Seydoux is by far the worst Bond girl so far. She looks like she would rather be anywhere else (can't blame her), and has zero chemistry with Daniel Craig. Then again, when did Craig ever have chemistry with his female co starts? Not since Eva Green, which is probably a testament to her acting ability more than his.The ending is perfect though. And ugly end to an ugly film.

364,pete-murphy97,A Dramatic Sending-off For Craig; A New Era of Bond Awaits,6,30 September 2021,"No Time To Die is a soppy and dramatic send-off finale for Daniel Craig, who's now starred (or shall we say, served) in five instalments of the 007 film series. This film leans heavily on the theme of new beginnings.Tying up his story and harkening back to previous films in Craig's timeline lead the audience into a plotline with almost outsized (and clichéd) importance; albeit you'd struggle to find something of greater comparable magnitude in principle; but I'd wager that it's trying too hard to win the audience's emotional engagement by throwing these overbaked clichés in our faces without a generous helping of the signature tact and guile classic Bond is known for. But then again, Craig's bond has always leaned on the serious side and lacked chemistry with Bond girls. Him riding pillion on a motorbike seems so out of character. The jabs at him being presumptuous about sex are also needless additions to the story and undermine what was a great example of unapologetic masculinity in popular culture.The action sequences are a little too present, which risks grounds for 'plot armour' criticism to take root, as well as putting forth the issue of making the film, at times, indistinguishable from Rambo. More dialogue is needed, in spades in fact. Bond, after all, is a dialogue-led character, a body language driven, larger-than-life masculine persona; not an invincible trigger happy action-man, nor a character that should be upstaged.Rami Malek's depiction of Lyutsifer Safin the evil botanist is an intriguing punt, but he's barely given much screen time and when he is in the picture, he's underwhelming and whimsical. Like in Skyfall, they opted for an enigmatic and subversive character, yet here it's not done nearly as well. His villainous master plan goes into some depth, playing on some serious topical themes of modern science, but he doesn't come across as a villain remotely capable of carrying it out.6.3/10.",No Time to Die

Ana de Armas brings some elegance, but has only a screentime of 10 minutes.The ending is pretty bolt and emotional (thanks Hans) by itself. Still because of the 2 hours before it doesn't strike hard. The movie gets boring during some scenes.The stunts are not that spectacular, aswell as the sets. The villain is boring af. The lack of blood and all this off camera violence annoyed me after some time.Dumbest scene of the movie probably was, when Bond gets his 007 back.

368,antony-69,This is not James Bond,3,24 October 2021,"I thought that QoS would be the only blot on Craig's copybook but this blows it out of the water in every negative way possible.For 60 years, the winning formula has been that Bond can't die, Bond has no ties, Bond is a maverick, Bond is indestructible. Changing those immutable facts simply turns this in to a formulaic action movie about any random spy. JB may as well have been Bourne, not Bond.Bond is a franchise that has never troubled itself with the notion of reboot. When a new actor comes in they take it in a direction that suits them. No need to wipe the slate clean in any dramatic fashion. No need to kill every worthwhile character.In all great Bond films, the only predictable plot point was that Bond would walk away fit and healthy. Here, the whole plot was achingly predictable. From the moment they said that Heracles had been changed to kill entire families it became obvious that Bond must have a family in order to create risk. To try and remind everyone that Blofeld was his brother, and temporarily skirt over the fact that he was adopted, simply pampered to a US audience who film makers never trust to remember basic details or make simple deductions.Still, with all that in mind, the worst is yet to come. Despite Bond having escaped unharmed from hundreds of deadly situations, he manages to get shot several times by possibly the weakest Bond villain of all time. Entirely unbelievable. That same villain is then allowed to infect Bond with deadly nano bots that can kill anyone he touches. Electric nano bots. Powered by electric. That could be killed by an EMP device. Bond is wearing an EMP device. It's a major plot point that his watch is an EMP device. That's one hell of a plot hole. The man known for getting out of tight spots using guile and intelligence, instead gives up on an idyllic future with his daughter to die in a missile strike because no one considered that the nano bots could be killed with an EMP.This film is horrifically stupid and has destroyed the franchise.

370,ociopia,No Time To Analyze - Just Enjoy,8,15 October 2021,"Why am I analyzing this film so much? James Bond films are purely fantasy and all disbelief must be suspended, right? The fact that I saw it yesterday and I'm still thinking about it tells me this film did something most Bond films have not done, it tried to be serious as well as everything else. It gave me a real story which compelled me to think about it. Oops.I love Daniel Craig's bond and even though he isn't nearly as pretty as he was, he's still a hell of a man, able to be James Bond with no problem. And all the fantastic tropes are there - wild car chase scenes, wild running chase scenes, wild motorcycle chase scenes and all are thrilling. The close-in hand-to-hand fights are fabulous too. Craig's physicality arrests. And of course, the locations are stunning. And there are some lovely beauties, the precious Ana de Armas comes to mind.So, the movie opens and we get the Madeleine back-story. Who? I vaguely remembered her from Spectre. But wait! James Bond is in love with her? They are living together? He adores her? Why? I just don't get it. Who is this completely bland, flat, boring and certainly not interesting to look at chick?And unbelievably, the whole movie revolves around her. Ugh. And wait, it gets worse. Who the hell is her father? Is it Blofeld? Maybe? Maybe not? Ok, I guess not. And if Safin rescued her, why doesn't she recognize him? Who raised her, where did she get the money to become a psychiatrist, what the hell is going on? And who is Safin and where did he get the money and brains and talent to have this nano bot thing going, etc. Etc. Etc.And this of course returns me to the first paragraph. This is a fantasy. James Bond films are always filled with huge plot holes and no fill-in. Reviewers delight in saying that this part harkens back to that part in a prior film, blah blah. Okay. But come on. Over maybe 8 years, from Skyfall through Spectre to No Time to Die? Do I need a libretto? Okay, I get it. I can't ask these kinds of questions of a barely more than comic book character. But I am.

Very strong start, very promising, then it dips quite the bit. The villain played by Rami Salek doesn't come across nearly as powerful as one would've thought from the previews.It's almost 3 hrs of movie so of course difficult to keep the action going throughout but the middle section got so weak that I felt like dozing off.Then it picked up again. Also a good thing they got the black woman there as then they can more believably come up with a huge plot that a single man couldn't deal with in a believable way.And then the ending... quite disappointing to be honest.So what rating... for the first time I wouldn't know.I do know I find Skyfall much much better.I also must say that I miss Judi Dench as M in this movie. Very much so! She could've given this the power to lift it out of the more mundane levels. In that sense this movie is almost a tribute to her as it clearly shows how formidable an actress she is. The current M just doesn't have that aura of power nor the captivating character she does.So I'm going with a 7, for me a low rating to give.No matter all of this...

374,Darvener,"After all these years we have got a highly entertaining, witty and emotional Bond movie",8,17 October 2021,"Movie No Time to Die is the latest 007 movie in 2021 with Daniel Craig in the main role as James Bond. This movie has a classic plot - good is fighting against evil but it is fresh and done better than other 007 movies, because in the movies before they did not have any new element it was the same over and over and this Cary Joji Fukunaga changed for this movie. He used some clichés and put it to the plot intelligently and he created a very good and fresh plot for the 007 movie.Director of this movie is Cary Joji Fukunaga who directed Beasts of No Nation, True Detective S1, Jane Eyre, etc. The directing of this movie is brilliant and the best directing that I have ever seen in James Bond movies. Finally one director has learned from the mistakes of directors of the older Bond movies and created movie with realism and logic. For this movie I can't say some mistakes, except the little one that is not that important, from the side of the director because he didn't have any mistake in directing, in the script is one mistake that was very visible. The little one mistake that I have spoken is that when was Safin calling to Madeleine there appeared on the screen logo / icon of his ""organization"" - this is not able to do in this world at this moment, yeah there are many technical conveniences that are not able to create in this world, but some of the technical conveniences belongs to the James Bond movies but this technical convenience is not, so I think that this wasn't necessary but as I said, this is not any big problem, this is just a detail. Intro was very well done because the intro is very interesting and creative.Screenplay for this movie was written by Cary Joji Fukunaga, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. Everyone has good experience with good writing and they put the good writing to this movie, improved the concept of 007 cliché plot and they created this very good and funny movie. This ""episode"" of 007 was a little bit more romantic but that doesn't matter for this movie, because they did it in a good way that it belongs to this episode of 007. But after this praise there is one problem with the screenplay and the problem is that when James Bond was standing on the bridge and people from bike and car were shooting at him and they didn't hit him, not even once when he was standing in one position on the bridge. This was a very visible and unnecessary mistake from writers. For all the old fans of 007 they explained why the woman got the number 007 and how it is possible, this was a very good move from the side of writers. Every move of the characters was logical. Character development here is very good and for the 007 series brilliant, because they developed emotions between characters and viewers. But if we will omit these mistakes, this is a very good movie.Actors and their performances are very good and unforgettable. Every actor fits the role that they accepted and their performances on a high level.Camera was very good and every old fan of the 007 movies will like this movie at least from the camera side, because the director of photography and director picked the old style of shooting and editing James Bond movies and they succeeded, because this is pure nostalgia. They picked the old style of shooting of James Bond but they put to this old style some elements of modern shooting and they succeeded too.No Time to Die is an unforgettable James Bond movie with elements of old scenes shooting. After all these years we have got a highly entertaining, witty and emotional Bond movie. Some scenes were better because of some jokes that were done by some characters and this guaranteed that you would definitely not be bored in the cinema or at your screens at home.79%",No Time to Die

I'm happy to report that as suspected Twitter is full of idiots, because the only part of that statement that's true is the third part. It's a fast paced action film with funny and sensitive moments and if it truly is Daniel Craig's last it's a fitting way to go out. Sure you'd probably guess the ending before it arrives, and I still find it so hard to take Rami Malek as anything other than Freddie Mercury, but it's a great film and feels nothing like it's running time, which is always a good sign.

376,lowefreddy,'No Time To Die' is stunning!,10,3 October 2021,"I shouldn't write reviews the moment I've finished the film, largely because opinions change and vary and develop after mulling things over. But having seen all the reviews that IMDb have deigned to list first (despite this film having received predominantly brilliant reviews!), I feel the need to defend it. For maybe that one reader who finds this on an Internet scroll. :)Let me start by saying - 'No Time To Die' is a beautiful film. It is completely and utterly stunning. It's difficult to sum up what James Bond means to you if you are a massive fan (sorry, some melodramatic stuff coming up) - and I consider myself one. I watched all 24 films very close together during a time of personal crisis. They were instrumental in helping me heal, so I'm quite attached to this series. And I loved 'No Time To Die'.What's all this about it being too politicised? I certainly agree with the apprehensiveness - the TRAILER made it look very politicised. The film itself is completely devoid of any gender identity politics (thank Christ). You know those two women in the trailer who looked really arrogant and nasty, seeking basically to dumb Bond down for being a male chauvinist? Turns out the trailer cut out all the scenes where Bond held his own against them, and it also cut out the scenes where those two women turn out to be two of the COOLEST CHARACTERS IN ALL OF BOND. You will love them both by the end (they're not even in it as much as you'll expect).That's the political side of things out of the way. Now let's get onto the storytelling:'No Time To Die' is bold. Very bold indeed. Plot twists, story developments, and breathtaking finales occur that would never have made it into a typically 'escapist' Bond film. I love the Roger Moore 70s era - doesn't everyone? - but it's fair to say that those films feel almost like episodes in a TV series. They tick along entertaining the masses and that's fine. 'No Time To Die' is not that. It's an emotional rollercoaster! You will come out of it feeling in shock and possibly a little numbed (so don't go on IMDb and give it a terrible review to make yourself feel better). Things happen in 'No Time To Die' that would categorically never happen in a Roger Moore one.AND YET - it is still a Bond film. A Bond film through and through. Gunfights, car chases, gorgeously filmed action sequences, fabulous locations, action-packed final battles, larger-than-life characters, hilarious dialogue (thank you Phoebe Waller-Bridge) - it's all there. Bond is still at the centre-stage. You've gone to see a Bond film and you will get one. It's bold, yes, and very different from the 'norm', but it is still a film about that fantastic character who we all know and love.I will ardently defend this. Please go and see it.",No Time to Die

Similar issues with other films including Alien 3, but I digress.You can safely ignore any review that uses the W word and complains about the so-called mob. I swear, I hear that word WAY more often from them than the actual mob. Who cares if there are some Black actors?All of that said, I agree with many of the other complaints.

381,nalindra-ferdinando,Disastrous end to a great Bond,1,30 September 2021,From the beginning I was worried this movie will mess out one of the best Bond runs ever by an actor since Sean Connery and rightly so it did. The movie tries very hard to turn Bond something he's not and as per my belief he's not suppose to be. The general movie is good and beautiful to look at and the action is good. But bear in mind this is no Casino Royale or Skyfall in terms of action or story. Despite these positives the ending of the movie completely underwhelms and is a disappointment where instead of giving the character a deserving ending messes up the whole 5 Daniel Craig movie era. You always know how tough or difficult the situation is Bond will survive and kick villain ass. He makes impossible possible. We don't come to see Bond movies to see him die. We come to see how he beat all odds and win the day and ride to sunset. It is a major disappointment due to a movie trying hard to bring family melodrama and sentiment too much ending up as a mess. We have had fantastic emotional Bond movies like Casino Royale and Skyfall which we really felt emotional but in all these Bond picked up his life and moved forward to his next mission. Bond was always back. But this time it was the worst decision ever. Will never have confidence to watch a Bond movie ever again. That's all I know.,No Time to Die

385,spinin,A most ironic title,8,2 October 2021,"I will still need some time to digest the final film in the Daniel Craig era, but here are my initial thoughts. The movie is overall a pretty touching, nostalgic, and fitting entry in the Bond cannon and as Craig's finale. It does a nice job tying everything up from the Craig era, and the Bond series in general. I won't spoil every detail, but here is why the title is ironic: everybody dies. Felix Leiter... dead. Blofeld... dead. All of SPECTRE... dead. All the villains... dead. And the biggest one of all, James Bond, dead.There are moments that remind of the early Connery films. There are strong and touching moments where the theme from OHMSS gets reused, as well as the infamous Louis Armstrong song ""We Have All the Time in the World."" The film in general harkens back a lot to OHMSS with the relationship between Medeleine and Bond, except of course this time it is Bond that dies in the end, in a more bittersweet way.There are some pretty exciting and fun action sequences. Craig probably puts in his best and most fun performance of his era. And it is probably fitting that he dies, as he was the most moody Bond with the biggest death wish of all, while the character in general was long overdue with the lifestyle choices he made over the years.There are some pretty strong Bond moments. One of my favorite ones is where Bond finishes off a double agent that killed Felix Leiter by helping push an SUV that's slowly edging down a hill, right onto him. A moment that brings to mind Bond cold-bloodedly kicking a Mercedes with a henchman off a cliff in For Your Eyes Only. His final battle with Safin is also quite brutal and cold-blooded, really in what both of them do to each other.So the movie has a little bit of everything. A lot of moments that call back to classic Bond, with a lot of fresh moments woven in, mainly thanks to the female characters, Madeleine, Nomi, and Paloma. However, as well written as they are, and as great as they are around Bond, they do hijack the film from the main character a bit. It's both fitting and a little disappointing. And much has been made about this woke culture Bond being in conflict with who the character was written to be by Ian Flemming and how he has been portrayed over the years, namely a cold-blooded killer and womanizer. Personally, as a huge longtime fan, I am a little disappointed with the softer and somewhat melodramatic direction, while also being accepting of it.All of the supporting cast is great as well. Fiennes as M and Whishaw as Q are both fantastic. Lynch as Nomi and de Armas as Paloma are also quite fun to watch, without completely taking everything away from Bond. Paloma is the best Bond girl since Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who was unfortunately somewhat burdened with a complex and dramatic story arc. The chemistry between Bond and Paloma is great, and she really could have been the perfect Bond girl if this movie went in a different direction.Léa Seydoux is much more interesting here than in Spectre, but let's face it, she has been dragging Bond and the entire Bond story way down into the sad and melodramatic since she was first introduced. Blofeld too is better in his brief moments than he was in the last film. And it adds to the gravity of the film how much everyone is working together to save the world. And I thought the idea of using nanotechnology to spread a virus that can target the DNA of specific people, was quite cool, even if the whole villain plot is just another one of those where the bad guy wants to destroy the world cause he's an angry maniac.So finally, I do feel that the idea of killing off Bond and giving Madeleine Swan and her daughter (Bond's daughter) this bittersweet ending is a bit of a cop out. It's what a lot of movies, like some of the Marvel Universe ones have been doing. The strong hero dies, and everyone else celebrates it in a bittersweet, sappy ending. It's not reality and it's not right by who James Bond was and is. So with time I may sill reevaluate this movie and how I feel about it. But as a cinematic experience, I feel that it succeeds. And it brings closure to everything in the Craig era, as well as past Bond movies, in a way that the future direction for the series can be pretty much anything. However, I do hope that they will still stick to the tradition of what James Bond is supposed to be and will not muck it up with unoriginal ideas like a female James Bond. As Craig said it himself, Bond is a male, and there are plenty of other great characters that can be written for a woman.",No Time to Die

And while I am not a fan of Daniel Craig's Bond he did portray the character rather well. The new and innovative about those Craig Bond movies is, that they are all connected and every foe is part of a bigger conspiracy. The last movie finally introduced us to the man behind the menace, Ernst Stravo Blofeld. A villain Bond fans have known for many decades. For those who don't remember James captures Blofeld in the end of Spectre and he is imprisoned. So ""No time to Die"" begins with Bond in retirement living in Italy with Madeleine Swan. Bond is haunted by his demons and to let go of the past he visits the grave of Vesper (played by Eva Green in ""Casino Royal). As he pays his respects, the grave explodes and a gunfight and car chase ensues.After escaping Bond flees to Cuba where he meets his old pal Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Leiter tells Bond about a new super weapon and after initial hesitation James agrees to help. This is where the actual story starts.""No time to Die"" has a difficult feat. It has to incorporate the characters we know with a new story and at the same time finish what it build up to into the previous entries to give the viewers a satisfying conclusion to this chapter of the character. Alas, it struggles to achieve most of these points.The movies set-up takes about an hour of the three hour runtime and establishes very little of the story and the villain Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) is one of the worst of the recent years. Malek is a great actor but he doesn't seem to really know hat to do with the role here. Furthermore there are so many actors wasted in the movie. Ana de Armas is brilliant her role but only stays wit his for about ten minutes and Christoph Waltz has the same problem. The whole movie feels a little shambolic at times, trying to tie up loose ends and still establish enough momentum to keep going with the weak plot.For all the things going wrong I can at least say that Craig gives his best performance as Bond yet. It feels a little like old time with some recycled quotes and witty new ones that made the Bond character so compelling.There are very many great locations and the drone shots of Italian and English country sites are beautiful. The score holds up but the thing that will most likely split audience is the movie's ending.I am not going to give anything away but for all the movies flaws the ending completes the story in a majestic fashion.Now, Craig had his ups and downs as Bond and I was nota fan of the weak Bond in Skyfall and him falling love but Craig delivers in this last entry.We don't know who the the next Bond will be but all I can hope for is that we finally get a gentleman again, like it was the case with Pierce Brosnan's Bond.If you are a fan of the franchise and have see the previous Craig movies, you must go and see this one, if not for the story then just to see how this era of Bond ends.",No Time to Die
389,tom-43722,Annoyingly heartbreaking,6,9 October 2021,"Due to the controversy around this movie pushing politics and the director even being quoted as saying ""James Bond was basically a rapist"", I was expecting this to suck. Having also been spoiled about Bond's death beforehand, I was ready for a disrespectful, insulting finale on par with the character reversal and outright assassination of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker respectively in Disney's terrible Star Wars trilogy.What I got was movie that could be annoyingly on the nose with its SJW messaging but simultaneously managed to be a touching swan song to the Daniel Craig era. It was far from perfect and I feel that parts of the buildup to the final act were sloppy - there were times where I could tell where 1 of the 4 screenwriters' work ended and another began so it didn't flow as well as it could have - but in Bond's last moments, we see him as a one man army, mowing down goons left, right and centre and going out in in blaze of glory. Killing off James Bond was always going to be controversial but the way they handled it in no way demeaned him. Craig brought a combination of gravitas and tenderness to Bond's final moments, going out as the badass spy we all know he is and the loving husband and father that he could have been.The film is anything but perfect though. Lashana Lynch's Nomi was a diversity checkbox that needed to be ticked. Despite Lynch's clear passion and valiant attempts to convey some nuance, the script gives her nothing to work with so it's blatantly obvious that the ""strong independent black woman"" is the beginning and end of her character. Even the moment where she asks M, played marvellously by Ralph Fiennes who proves himself a worthy successor to the excellent Judi Dench, to give Bond his 007 code name back felt like the screenwriters saying ""there, he's 007 again, happy now?"" instead of an authentic decision from the character. Bond and Nomi never have a moment of real connection that would make her willing to give him back his title. Furthermore, Halle Berry played a secret agent alongside Pierce Brosnan's Bond 2 decades ago and back then, it felt authentic instead of being obvious pandering.If Ana de Armas' Paloma had taken over the 007 position, I'd accept it and perhaps even be outright pleased about it. In her short screen time, she had more personality and bounced off Bond in a more charming manner than Lynch did in the entire movie. Ana de Armas' performance had some of the corniness you would see older Bond movies, like Paloma's bubbly admission that she wasn't very experienced, but she could still kick ass and was willing to have fun with her brief role, bringing some levity to an otherwise serious movie. I should also note that her humorous moments felt like they were simply a part of Paloma's personality whereas when Bond has a humorous scene, it's clear that Daniel Craig is not entirely comfortable doing it. Granted, de Armas' part in the story was one were you can quite clearly see another screenwriter taking over but she did it so well that I wish she had much more screen time.I cried when Bond perished. Many movies and TV shows have made me cry but I can't remember ever doing so in a James Bond movie, not even when we lost Judi Dench's M in Skyfall. Daniel Craig tends to be rather hit and miss as Bond, doing well in scenes that require pathos and gravitas but lacking the charm and humour of Pierce Brosnan, my personal favourite incarnation of the character. However, you can tell that he was aware that this is his last performance as 007 so he put all of his passion and talent into this project.",No Time to Die

391,tpcatoz-90650,Solid with some rough edges,7,14 October 2021,"This is a solid and enjoyable action movie, but some parts just seem out of place for a James Bond movie. The whole film has a different feel, different from the other Daniel Craig films, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it was kind of depressing in some areas and it feels like some characters were out of place (the mad scientist was clearly made to be a joke and it seemed odd) (Ana de arms was in the film for like 15-20 minutes and it seemed like she needed more time) (The new 007 agent was in the film a bunch, but we barely learn anything about her)I liked the film, but it could have been better. I just feel so bad for James Bond in this film because he's hard a rough life, fights terrorists, lost a loved one and got betrayed and when he finally has a chance to have a decent life, they kill him and not only do they kill him, but he dies knowing he can't ever go near his daughter or love ever again.

This movie isn't it, unfortunately. Most of the cast is stellar, especially Ana De Armas, who could carry a whole movie on her own as the character she deftly plays here. All the returning characters deliver as they should given this iteration of Bond. With which I've always been fine. It's 2021 and this isn't Fleming's time or Bond. Which, again, is fine. Cinematography and directing are both great. There are too just many plot holes, quick fixes, double takes, unexplained / inexplicable wtf's, even when you know going in you'll have to suspend some belief for a Bond movie to work. The main villain is just awful. Both the character as written (his motivation is what again?) and Ramy Malek's monotone, flat delivery that is more indifferent than anything else. I know it's about Bond and his inner struggle but you just can't have such a milquetoast villian for Bond to go up against.",No Time to Die

But with ""No Time To Die"", here's the long and short of it...this film was the worst of all of the Bond films, bar none. It was a needlessly complex ""Bond"" film that made absolutely no sense. On second thought, I really wouldn't categorize this as a Bond film. It hopped, skipped and jumped around so much, with not an ounce of cohesiveness, it literally gave me a headache. I have no idea what critics saw in this homage to utter ridiculousness, but what I saw was an aimless, rambling disaster of a film that never found its footing, and never had me pulled into the storyline because there were literally too many of them, and all of them were left dangling. All that I could think about during this boring lifeless film is.... WTF, make it stop, who in the Hell is that, who is he, who is she, where did they come from, oh no they didn't, what's the backstory on the ""villain"", why am I still sitting here for this hot mess, where's the booze and why did the ""genius""🙄 writers decide to do that BS to Bond (the ending).

400,sushant0406,Great sign off by the BEST Bond till date to the best 007 Era!,8,12 October 2021,"After a delay of nearly 2 years, I finally got the opportunity to watch No Time To Die. And while, I was initially conflicted about it after walking out of the theatre, 72 hrs since it's conclusion, it has grown on me.Daniel Craig, in my opinion is not only the Best James Bond, but has delivered by far the best James Bond series till date. It is so good, that I pity the next actor who'll take up on the role of the British spy.The Craig-era also focussed on the emotional side of Bond and treating these 5 movies as part of a story arc focussing on the growth of the character, James Bond, is what makes it special. And NO TIME TO DIE is an amazing way to sign off.The action sequences, while limited, surely did put me on the edge of my seat. All the female characters, especially Lèa Seydoux and Ana de Armas were brilliant in their respective roles. Lashana Lynch was good in bits.The biggest letdown for me was Rami Malek, who as the main antagonist is amongst the least threatening villains in the Bond series. Also, I was slightly disappointed by the treatment of Christoph Waltz's Blofeld. Ben Winshaw was a delight.AND FINALLY, the man of the hour, Daniel Craig in his final outing as James Bond, was outstanding. He has been brilliant as the Bond, right through the series in all aspects: whether it playing the cool as a cucumber agent or a person trying to grapple with the emotions. The latter is something which separates his take on James BOND and makes him the best James Bond, till date.The direction by Cary Fukunga was average in parts. But, during the pre-intro action sequence, it was amazing.Finally, Hans Zimmer's music and Billy Eilesh's title track, were outstanding. Billy really deserves to win an Academy award for the Best Original Score, making No Time To Die, only the 3rd (consecutive) Bond Movie to win an Oscar.This movie is to be enjoyed on an IMAX screen.And yes, THANK YOU Mr. Daniel Craig. Wishing you all the very best for your future projects.",No Time to Die
401,treborquest,This had to be made to be able to move on,8,3 October 2021,"Daniel Craig had said he didn't want to do another James Bond movie. But eventually with the script they convinced him and I think they did well by that.Okay, there is a more emotional and personal story to this one. But is that a bad thing? To me, this movie that is over 160 minutes long didn't feel long at all. I loved the action, think some of the plots were well thought out, but it also had it's flaws. Some aspects were too thick on the nose (wrist, hand... etc), the humor was sometimes too forced, but sometimes it did work (I loved Paloma, and she was a great Bond Girl (Sorry Ana, but that term is a keeper, as it is one that should be an honor imo) and very bubbly, which was rather new). But the biggest flaw I think is the Americanization of the action shots. The way the ocean is on fire while the ship is sinking... that looked so extremely fake. Bond doesn't need that Hollywood sauce.I think over all, this is a solid Bond movie, and if I had to rank the Craig ones then Casino Royale is my favorite, followed by Skyfall, and this one would come third. Then Spectre and I think people stating that this is the worst bond movie ever keep forgetting Quantem of Solace (even though I think there are even worse Bondmovies than that).So don't overthink it, don't be all 'boohoo' about it not being a typical Bond movie. It was, it just opens a door to a new Bond (First like of the new movie: hey, you've changed a lot..... Yes, plastic surgery has come a long way... didn't Roger Moore do that already?) and they can now go into the direction of more old style Bond, and maybe do a 008 Nomi-spin-off.As long as she will have lots of Bond Blokes (or whatever that should be called).8 for effort.",No Time to Die

There are some lovely touches for Bond fans, especially at the end, which add to the pathos. The photography is stunning, the action relentless and the actors do a fine job. No Time To Die is a clever, thoughful and hugely exciting conclusion to the story thread that began with Casino Royal.

407,inc-133-70013,It's Bond. An old and tired James Bond. But Bond nonetheless.,8,3 October 2021,"Well, if you came at it with expectation of a high-speed thriller, look somewhere else. The movie is mostly melodrama with really nice action bits peppered in, but at nearly 3 hours of runtime, there's simply not enough of them. To be honest, all Craig's Bond movies have been pretty much like this, the action is more of an afterthought. Think on Casino Royale, for example, or whatever.But in case of No Time to Die, the action bits are really, really good, at least before final act. Off-road car chase in foggy Norwegian forest stands out as quite exceptional, for example.Rest of the movie is about love, regrets and two girls. And while it gets typical Bond fan restless, I actually quite enjoyed it. The actors are so good and large that weak script and a bit forced chemistry just won't matter.The old characters are also back, but Daniel Craig simply steals every scene with his presence, so they feel more like a fan service.As for villain and compulsory conspiracy, it feels like script writers stopped caring, and so I did I. It's all about nanobot poison or something, but they might as well call it pure magic, due how nonsensical it all was.There's also hints about new Bond, an exotic femme fatale in this case. I thought the movie is trying to establish her character for future reboots, but it really didn't, she didn't have any character to begin with, and she was quite forced in. I don't think she'll be new, woke Bond, after all, at least not based on what I saw.So, in a nutshell, there's enjoyable drama movie and enjoyable action movie, cut into bits, spread around and bound together with a really weak plot arc. Or in other words, the parts are way better than the sum of them.There's little to compare it to in modern superhero nonsense garbage cinema, so I still do recommend seeing Bond. I mean, what else gets even near? You might not like all of it, but you will surely find something you do.",No Time to Die

Hans Zimmer's debut in a Bond film was amazing, I've always wanted to hear a James Bond score by Hans Zimmer and it was a dream come true.I loved the opening credit sequence accompanied with the title song ""No Time to Die"". Which is greatly performed by Billie Eilish I'm not a fan of hers but credit where credit is due. It's a hauntingly beautiful song.The opening of this film was great, it carried a dark and serious tone that was new to Bond and I was looking forward to seeing that carry throughout the film. Yet disappointingly after the opening title sequence that tone dropped and it became pretty light hearted, with a little to much humor for my taste.Daniel Craig puts in another great performance as James Bond. It's his supporting cast I found weak. Anna De Armas was great in her small role as Paloma yet was underutilized. The new 007 played by Lashana Lynch, I felt she wasn't very strong, and she wasn't important or really had any impact on the film. She's a pretty weak character and I wouldn't care to see her be the next 007 she's not strong enough to carry her own film in my opinion. Rami Malek as Safin was great, yet like in Spectre I felt this was a wasted villain he could've been better but he turned out to be a very traditional Bond villain.My biggest issue with this film is the ending, I did not like the ending at all. It just did not work for me and it didn't give Daniel Craig the send off as Bond that he deserved. This ending also fundamentally changes Bond and I don't like that. Perhaps it's just harder for me to let go of Daniel Craig as Bond, as this is the first Bond I've actively followed.Irregardless of the issues I have with this film it was still enjoyable, and I look forward to the future of the 007 franchise.7/10.",No Time to Die

We see Bond as the loyal friend to Felix and the profound love Bond can have, which we haven't seen since Casino Royale.This movie isn't without it's flaws.

My only and worse criticism is that you don't kill of James Bond that's the whole point of the film and I get what they have tried to do they've tried to move away from it being bond and making to be just 007 so gives them the go ahead to print money and but anyone they want in the shoes of the role ""007"" which I think isn't right it's not 007 with James Bond.

There is zero edge to him; an edge that has been missing since Pierce Brosnan was chastised as a 'relic' in GoldenEye (1995). This film is no different.

420,redcanofevil,Plenty Time to F It Up,6,10 October 2021,"NO TIME TO DIE (2021):I give up basically, I'm never going to look forward to a movie ever in my life. Literally any movie I have my eyes on comes out bad. This was no exception either but this is much worse than being a bad movie. I have no idea what did I even watch and how can it be worse than Spectre? This was supposed to be the big farewell to Daniel Craig who is undoubtedly a very close second to Sean Connery and this is what he got? Its not even a Bond film for crying out loud!Bond films either 1. Embrace the Bond formula or 2. Subvert the Bond formula. NO TIME TO DIE (NTTD) was none of it. It wasn't even a Bond film. And thats the worst insult imaginable to a movie from the James Bond Franchise. I can't even come up with constructive criticism for this, I'm just that drained.Technically speaking there is not much wrong with the film. Its shot beautifully and has an excellent cinematography. The music is good although the Main theme is a bit weak and the title animation was one of the weakest I can remember. Weakest as in it made no sense and had no coherence to it, which in a way matches with the movie now that I think about it. The newer cast were great, both Nomi(Lashana Lynch) and Paloma(Ana De Armas) were fantastic in their role. I was fully expecting to dislike Nomi and her role in this movie but she was actually quite a nice addition. Returning cast like M and Q were also great as usual. The action scenes were fantastic and fight choreography was intense and satisfying. So what didn't work? Everything apart from this.I said it wasn't even a Bond film and a good amount of blame goes to the appalling script and Daniel Craig himself. Phoebe Waller Bridge is so beloved and popular and talented according to everyone but this is what she bought to the table? I haven't seen Fleabag and now I am glad I didn't. What the F is this? How did this get approved and what wattpad writer came up with this mess?And script aside what happened to Daniel Craig? Was that actually Bond? Emotional farewell is all good and fun but what on earth and why on earth you need to change everything Bond is? Don't get me wrong Daniel Craig acted good but he wasn't Bond in many of the scenes. This was basically a generic action guy with a predictable and emotional story. You can change the title of the movie to ""Jason Bourne"" or ""Mission Impossible"" and no one would've noticed.Next is the villain and the nicest thing I can say is that yes he was indeed a Bond Villain. Bond Villain #546 to be precise. Added nothing, was nothing new and in a way totally absent from the story and had VERY little to do. But as forgettable a villain Safin was he did manage to earn an achievement that no Bond Villain has ever accomplished, which I won't spoil. The plot was the usual ""been there done that"" scifi mess, nothing worth thinking about ever. And the best parts of the film Paloma was criminally underused, one of the best if not the best agent pairing with Bond but had barely any screentime sadly. Instead the film only decided to stick with Madeline Swan (Lea Seydoux) and another *spoiler*. It was really infuriating, I see now why Bond girls don't stick for more than one film.The script looked like it was written by 10 different people with 20 different approaches and directed by 3 different directors. It made no sense and absolutely did not mesh well. It was so all over the place, even more so than Spectre which was a tribute film more than anything.Emotions were kinda forced and followed a very predictable route. Its as if you know what the next scene is going to be and the whole movie is just getting ready for the next scene which you know is coming. Also many people might have problems with its ""woke agenda"" I personally had no issue with these. Even Nomi who I was so ready to dislike and have said very mean things in the past. In the end what offended me was Bond himself, Daniel Craig and his EXTREMELY Un-Bondesque approach in the entire film.Such a poor end to what has been one of the Best Bonds in movie history. Its honestly just sad to think how it ended. What a poor sendoff to a man that everyone learned to love. Its fine to have emotional moments, fine to have emotional sendoff to beloved character/actor but don't shoehorn it in like this. I was more emotional in Quantum of Solace than whatever this was. Its not a Bond film, its not a movie with Bond in the lead. And its not even a Bond mission. Bond was the side character in his own movie and that is a MASSIVE NO. That is the worst thing that can happen in a Bond film, I'd take Pierce Brosnan or Roger Moore or Lazenby over this movie. It is simply unacceptable to have a Bond film with Bond as a side character.Farewell Commander Craig, you deserved a better sendoff than this bloated mess. Should've ended with Spectre, honestly would've been a much better end than this. Atleast wouldn't have butchered Bonds legacy and the character itself. I hope it gets better with rewatch because I'm absolutely drained and disappointed watching this.RATING: 6.5/10 (Honestly could've been much lower if it wasn't Craigs farewell, I have a heart too as hard that might be to believe)Casino Royale>Skyfall>Spectre>No Time To Die>Quantum Of Solace.",No Time to Die
421,MrTomCherry,Daniel Craig's Final Repose,9,13 October 2021,"As someone who is just getting into the whole Bond franchise, having watched several movies with several different actors as Bond over the years I have to say this movie was a great closure for the, often hated, but in my opinion one of the best Bonds ever.I don't want to talk about the plot because my reviews are usually without spoilers I will just say this is not only a farewell to Daniel Craig but to the whole Spectre storyline.From an action standpoint this movie is near flawless. Beautifully shot action scenes where you can actually see the fights, the car chases, the gun fights instead of the ""shaky cam"" crap we've been fed with over the last decade. Cinematography is also very gorgeous, especially the scenes in Italy in the beginning and the scenes in the foggy forest.Without a doubt a great ending and farewell to an actor, to a storyline, to an era.In the meantime...waiting for the successor.",No Time to Die
422,cmtaylor-10993,Different yet very Bond,8,4 October 2021,"I get it. This film is bound to polarize many fans and I think I need to revisit it a few more times to fairly judge it's credentials when placed alongside some of the other entries in the Bond franchise.First and foremost this movie is far better than some of the one star reviews lead you to believe and secondly, the Craig era Bond films have continued to push boundaries and have strayed away from the traditional Bond formula and this film is no exception.I've broken down my views below,StrengthsThe pre-title sequence, especially the present day segment is simply fantastic and up there with some of the best pre-title sequences in the franchises history.Daniel Craig actually has a decent car chase. We've waited decades for this.It's a Bond film that features two main villains (sort of). It was great seeing Christopher Waltz back as Blofeld, his portrayal has really grown on me.Jeffrey Wright as Felix Lieter is also back, shame he didn't have more screen time.There a loads of nods to previous entries, including the cars, a fantastic villains lair and a fantastic music score. There's even scientist being played for laughs, a bit like Boris from Goldeneye.Speaking of Goldeneye, there's some fantastic action throughout this film with a shootout at Blofeld's birthday party and during the grand finale. Craig's Bond has probably killed more enemies here than in all his other films combined.It is also refreshing to see humour back in the script. The film can be fairly camp in places, a throwback to Moore and Connery. Craig proves that his bond can provide some laughs, making him more likable.The new 007 is also pleasant surprise and actually provides the setup to many of the jokes. The female agent that also helps Bond during the birthday party shootout is also a fantastic addition.Q is also fantastic in this movie, as are most of the MI6 cast members.Weaknesses
Saffin is a really boring villain. His appearance in the beginning of the movie is really sinister, but we sort of forget about him until the final third of the film, where he mumbles his way through his scenes. I think I'd have preferred more Blofeld.It's a shame that Felix 'departed' so soon. It's the first time we've seen some great chemistry between Bond and Felix since the 80s so it would have been nice if Felix could have been along for the ride some more.Unsure
Having a young child along for the ride completely changed the dynamic of the movie and I'm still not to sure how I feel about it as it's not something a Bond film has ever done. As a father of young children, it did add an extra dimension of tension and emotion but it began feeling like another franchise at this point. The pacing began to drag for me at this point too. I don't mind Bond becoming a father I guess, but it's certainly not something I was expecting.I have to mention the ending. It does make sense in the concept of the overall story arc, especially as Craig's Bond has always been self contained, whereas the other previous Bonds were all effectively on the same timeline. I enjoyed the roller coaster of emotion during the final 'showdown' and thought it was very Fleming how if he did escape the island, he'd be unable to be with his 'family'. That said, Bond is a hero that is good at everything, from driving, gambling, shooting and fighting. He always finds away through. Bond is a survivor. It was bizarre how he gave up so easily, surely if he'd have left the island, he'd have had more 'TIME' to find a cure for removing the nanobots. It was actually quite a downer.Time will ultimately tell how this film holds up in the future. Remember how everyone hated OHMSS. I think this was easily Craig's best performance as Bond and if I cast the poor villain/questionable ending aside, I felt this was a throwback more 'over the top' Bond films I enjoy.Craig's Bond has always done things differently. Should we have expected anything else this time round?",No Time to Die
423,inker-13614,An exciting ride,8,22 October 2021,"I am not an avid James Bond movies fan. But I was very pleasantly surprised with this one. It was fully entertaining from start to finish. Had a lot of action, lot of suspense, some mystery. I always say that for a movie to be good it just simply has to entertain the viewer, so they don´t get bored and start thinking about other things rather than the movie. And, Daniel Craig is quite alright as the main character, he suits well for this part.In conclusion, I really can´t fault this movie in anything, its good, watch it.",No Time to Die

425,mohan59,Satisfying and poignant end to the Daniel Craig era,8,11 October 2021,"For a film that should have been released two years ago, No Time To Die has had plenty of time to become ""alive"" in theaters worldwide. As a Bond vehicle, it delivers on all fronts (well, almost all). It packs a wallop in several departments, most notably in a heavyweight supporting cast, but there are a couple of small moments where it misses a step or two.The plot is very modern and technical, harnessing the age-old concept of cutting-edge medical research being exploited by megalomaniacs for nefarious means. The pre-credits sequence is innovative and goes against conventional wisdom: for once, it features neither Bond nor a traditional battle of secondary, disposable good guy vs secondary, disposable bad guy. Rather interestingly, it sets two cornerstones of the film: vengeance and filial ties. As the plot moves forward, the stakes and players become clearer, but the antagonist's full motivations aren't revealed yet. When Bond decides to come out of retirement and rejoin the battleground, he realizes old foes have remained as lethal as they were, but newer adversaries have changed the game. As personal and professional wounds continue to haunt and mount, Bond and his allies must race against time to save a global catastrophe.The film's strength comes mainly from a stellar cast: established franchise veterans like Ralph Fiennes and Christoph Waltz combined with first-timers like Lashana Lynch and Rami Malek. While paling in comparison with the electric Green-Craig duo, the Seydoux-Craig pair forms the emotional core while the exchanges between Craig's Bond and the supporting characters range from truly delightful to awkward passing of the torch (Lynch's Nomi asking one last favor for Bond was a bit cringey, to be honest). Locations, a perennial hallmark in Bond films, serve the story's purpose with panache, the villain's lair especially sinister and reminiscent of films past. The writing team deserves credit for being contemporary but the pacing in the middle third becomes sluggish and contributes to the running time of nearly 3 hours. Cary Fukunaga's eye for visual detail comes across in numerous, gorgeously shot sequences. The action is frenetic and slickly choreographed and while Billie Eilish's theme may not carry the sweeping grandeur of Adele's Skyfall nor the daring lyrical foreshadowing of Chris Cornell's You Know My Name, it does convey motifs of family ties and fractured pasts.No Time To Die is a well-rounded, appropriate adieu to a definitive Bond interpretation: Daniel Craig proved his doubters spectacularly wrong when Casino Royale was released and fifteen years later, leaves with an indelible mark on a fabled franchise.",No Time to Die
426,kyrross,almost flawless,9,18 October 2021,"There is a lot to say about this Bond. Never before, we saw Bond as humain as he is there. His relation, his friends, his anger, his sadness, we see, maybe for the first time, the man behind the legend... and Craig deliver. Every moment with him on screen is a blast. The actions scene are still gritty, the jokes are on point. The pacing is also really good. For a 2h45 movie, it didnt felt like it and by the end, I exit the theatre speechless. The only down point really is the villain. He is a generic, revenge guy. He is Dr No, a blank, neutral chaotic, sociopath rich guy who didnt get over a traumatic event and take it on the world. We see the hommage, but more development or a better motive should have been explored. This is generic at best. Malek did his best with what he had. I am placing this bond on par with Casino Royale and Skyfall with my favorites James Bond of all time.

430,judgewashington,Daniel Craig finishes James Bond with a thud,1,11 October 2021,"Don't let the title fool you---there's plenty of time to die in this excruciatingly long, dull film, where the minutes fly by like days. Overly complex, yet short on plot and emotion, it's tedious and dark, with only the repeated sounds of gunfire to keep you awake. Daniel Craig, who was magnetic at the beginning of his reign as James Bond, has stayed too long at the fair. The supporting players are uniformly dull and immemorable, too, with Rami Malek leading the pack by trading in his Oscar credential to play a badly acted and laughable villain. Ralf Fiennes, once a heartthrob himself, now looks fatigued and lifeless. Also, for a film of this budget and stature, the photography is flat and colorless and looks as if the film has been processed in molasses. Billie Eilish sings the theme song (if you can call it that) in a soft, whinny, irritating tone----where's Adele belting out the theme to Skyfall when you really need her! Throughout it all, the love theme to On Her Majesty's Secret Service---We Have All the Time in the World---is played in the background, perhaps to remind you that it was a far superior film.Have someone wake you up for the ending, just so that you can say that you finished the film....and perhaps the series.",No Time to Die

Daniel Craig delivers a stronger, darker and more sombre performance for his last outing as Bond.

I think if you liked Casino Royal then you will also like nt2d...The film's only weakness really is Rami Malek who - again - delivers constant and annoying overacting. In those scenes that should be the most dramatic ones of the movie you can't help but wonder if this is Alan Harper from two and a half men who throws bad dialogue at Bond (oh, I've had such a difficult childhood)...he neither can conjure the feeling of being threatening/dangerous nor mad/crazy, he only comes across as a someone who tries to hard. Missed chance.Waltz makes up a little of the lost terrain here in a strong scene before.With a better villain, someone like Brandauer this would have been the best Bond ever I think.Fortunately the rest of the movie delivers solid action with the right amount of emotional drama and bids a worthy farewell to Craig in his last Bond.",No Time to Die

436,humzahladiwala,No Time To Die: A Well Acted Spectacle,8,17 October 2021,"Heavy Spoilers BelowTonight, I saw No Time To Die, the final Bond movie for Daniel Craig, and it seems that it may very well be the last movie with James Bond, if not 007. The movie is very technically good, with a top notch soundtrack, and very nice visuals. The fight choreography was very entertaining, particularly in the first half of the movie. The acting was also powerful, with Daniel Craig making the most of his last movie with a nuanced, gritty performance that very much reflects his time as Bond. Everyone did a good job actually, I'm only singling out Daniel Craig because he had so much time onscreen and truly made the most of it. I appreciated the dialogue, which was packed with references to older Bond movies, and pretty funny at times. However, the problem with this is in the general plot. The movie has one of the most far fetched plots since probably Moonraker, and it seems to be making a conscious effort to be long at times. It has so much style, but in the end, it's just another world domination plan under a lot of subplots and explosions. I think the movie is still entertaining though, and definitely concludes Craig's tenure in satisfying style.",No Time to Die
437,vgamerdc,One word: unique,6,9 October 2021,"Continuity in the James Bond franchise is not a new element, so it makes sense that this is (in an unfortunate way) a sequel to Spectre. Kudos to the writers and producers for going deeper emotionally into the James Bond portrayed by Daniel Craig. However, I did not care for the movie. It's much more character driven, and, again, this makes sense, but I just wasn't loving it. It's not even the political stuff that bothered me either, it was just the story. Rami Malik's character was just this sociopathic archetype I've seen in plenty of other movies. Lea Seydoux's character was the focus of the whole movie, and yet I didn't seem to care for her, nor her on screen relationship with Craig. Ana de Armas was great, but she left not long after she arrived. And holy cow, how about their timing with the whole GLOBAL VIRUS plot element?! Remember, this was written and shot before COVID-19 hit! Had this come out before COVID, there would have been an enormous reaction. Kinda like how The Good Place predicted COVID as well.We're in a pretty rough time right now politically and socially. I'm a college student in California, but grew up in North Carolina. So, yeah, I've experienced both sides of the conversations. I bring this up because I want to acknowledge that James Bond has never ignored the social and political climate, and that anyone who thinks the James Bond ""going woke"" as a reflection of the social and political climate we live in ... Did you not see the previous 24 movies? It's always tackled questions relevant to the day. That's another topic though. My point is I think they did a fine job handling the topic of a female 007, as well as a black 007. Lashana Lynch is great in her role, as are all the women in the movie. None of anything in here comes across as ""men are bad"" or ""rah! Girl power!"" like Captain Marvel and the new Charlie's Angels. It wasn't over the top and thus it worked.However, the realism and modernization of Craig's Bond has resulted in an overlong, uninteresting character focused movie. It's a James Bond movie, but not in the 007 LICENSE TO KILL BOND, JAMES BOND kind of way. It's almost like a fan fiction, but a really grounded one. And this is where I feel conflicted. First, JAMES BOND IS RETIRED. This circumstance right here changes EVERYTHING the story can possibly offer us. Daniel Craig is getting older, and he can't keep doing all these stunts. So rather than following the path of Roger Moore and doing the same thing over and over again, just getting older over time, they evolve his character. Again, this makes sense because of the more grounded realism in the Craig era. And while the writers and producers are making the right choices under this given circumstance, the story is limited from the start and is not going to meet expectations. That's not a bad thing, it's just... a bit unexpected... Even though it's staring us right in the face. Because, again, BOND IS RETIRED.No Time To Die is this unique little mess that is a James Bond movie, while also not being a 007 James Bond movie. I didn't have much fun. I don't want to say Mission Failed, but saying Mission Accomplished doesn't fit because of the bittersweetness of the film. So... Mission Retired?I'm interested in seeing where the franchise goes from here, but am slightly skeptical. I hope this current era of dark realism, as influenced on Hollywood by Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, will come to pass. James Bond as we know him can work with the modern day politically correctness - or rather, just not being a jerk about everything. Bond can still be smooth, have one liners, fool around with a Bond girl in future movies. It's all about delivery. So give it another go, Team Bond, and make sure that when you're mixing your next ideas they're shaken, not stirred.",No Time to Die

There's no time left to fix this arc.I absolutely loved this newest incarnation of Bond for the first 3 films of Daniel Craig's run, but Spectre ended up being a mess (upon re-watch, it's probably the worst of the 5, for me at least), and No Time to Die ends up trying to close the narrative arc more properly.It does, but the film is unable to capture the magic of the first 3 films (or tbh, just that of Casino Royale). The burden's just too heavy to bear to try and redeem the entirety of Spectre.Rami Malek's character is very much a throwaway villain, he seems to only exist as a plot device. Madeline Swann's ""deadly"" secret is a bit of a of a misnomer. It's important, but it feels contrived.There's an inescapable air of finality to it that pervades the second half of the film.

446,richard-davis-987-676615,Honestly... what were they thinking bringing in Waller-Bridge to ruin this?,4,4 October 2021,"I was in two minds as to reveal spoilers in here. Upon reflection, I can't really critique it without them.As many have already suggested, they've turned Bond into a semi-romantic melodrama, where Bond becomes an unknowing father (Mathilde - but not fully revealed until later in the film), his uninspiring partner (Swann) creates about as much sexual chemistry with Bond as my foot does with its shoe, and in the end, Bond is killed (supposedly) in a missile strike on the villain's island lair - and yet everyone is talking about the ""James Bond will return"" message as the end of the credits ""surprise"". What's new there? This sentence always appears.On the one hand, they've sort of gone back to what Bond used to be; A megalomaniac villain with a secret island lair and lots of henchmen, that wants to take over/destroy the world. Bond also gets more gadgets from Q than we've seen in previous Craig films - so in this respect, it's taking a backward step towards a tried and tested Connery/Moore formula.The villain's weapon? DNA programmed, cellular sized nanobots (yes, cellular-sized robots) that target very specific individuals, groups or races that was developed secretly with M's oversight, and now stolen from the British Government and re-worked to become a WMD - Huw Dennis pops up as a scientist FFS during the theft sequence - and whilst I'm sure he loved his cameo, I can't take this comedian seriously popping up in a serious action film like this - making jokes! Come on... let's keep these things on planet Earth shall we? Remotely believable or possible please? Nanobot tech - what were they thinking with this? It's as ludicrous as an invisible Aston. Nanobots/Nanites is all a bit I, Robot or Bloodshot - i.e. Science fiction.The opening sequence is really long. The action is great. The melodrama really isn't.WTAF was going with Billie Eilish and the Bond theme? I can't even begin to remember how it went, or a single lyric. Such a disappointment. I actually think back to Madonna's effort with great fondness now - as whether you liked it or not, at least you can remember it and hum the tune if you wanted to. Bond anthem's are supposed to be just that. Anthem's. This tepid and dull effort is the worst Bond song even commissioned. Perhaps she was too busy releasing videos of herself explicitly doing something she shouldn't to put the effort in? Awful and entirely forgettable. Bring back Chris Cornell - now that was a Bond theme from recent years... bet you can hum it too if you're reading this.Felix Leiter is killed. At the time of the event, it felt like something that worked in the storyline and was the ""shock"" character twist in the film. It probably still does work, but I'm so irritated about how woke the scriptwriting has become overall (you don't see a single bad guy actually get shot in the whole film) - has it all gone a bit ""A-Team"" for BBFC ratings?Lashana is entirely unconvincing for me as a 00. She says the right things, but time is spent with her worrying about Bond's 00 designation after he is reinstated. What genuine 00 with any genuine gravitas would give a monkey's about such petty things? For me, her ability to carry weight as a 00 ended right there. Physically, she could probably have carried it off - but the mindset's just not right to be a superspy.All we need now to kill this franchise off forever is for some sort of Dr Who gender-bending character regeneration exercise to occur to explain how Bond didn't actually die when the RN missile exploded right in front of Bond at the end of the film with a bit of UniSol spun in there for good measure. If Bond is genuinely going to return in a new film as the bloke we all know called James Bond, and I really hope that he does - the only possible explanation for him not dying at the end of NTTD would be if he's blown off the island by the missile explosion, and is found floating in the sea by a passing fishing trawler - which is a little bit Bourne (perhaps through in the Bourne amnesia too?). Can you imagine if they go down some ridiculous clone/robot ""consciousness transplant"", a la Picard to explain away his continued existence after dying? I don't like the potential explanations for Bond *not* dying in the next film - particularly if Waller-Bridge and the rest of the wokerati remains involved in writing the scripts and screenplay.Overall, I'm pretty disappointed, and I just don't want to write anymore about this disappointing instalment. Bond films are not family melodrama's. With Craig rather fawning over Waller-Bridge's script involvement and consequent changes to the script in the Graham Norton Bond special last week, it's definitely time for Craig to finish and move on - which is such a shame, as he's been an excellent Bond. Really excellent. He's clearly quite woke himself now, and I noticed that he was down as a producer of the film in the credits, so Craig is partly to blame for this mess. One of the most revealing things from the Norton special was when Graham asked Lea what she thought about Waller-Bridge. That silence was utterly deafening, and it now makes more far sense to me....As a Bond fan, if you're reading this, you're still going to watch it - of course you are. I'm going to have to watch it again just to revisit my thoughts on it - but Christ. You can't kill Bond. Not even to try to be edgy or controversial. Idiots. Why did Barbara sign off this script crapola and risk the longevity of the greatest franchise in film history?

Unlike previous Craig Bond films (all superior), this one is completely devoid of intelligence or character development.The more interesting elements of the plot (like the DNA virus) are abandoned without exploration. Ravi Malik preens and drools as a poorly drawn villain, and the peerless Christopher Waltz is wasted in a short and completely meaningless scene. The new 007 woman has ZERO character development except for her awkward competitiveness and continuously coincidental ""running into"" James as they each end up in the same place.An early subplot involving a young woman agent with ""3 weeks training"" is very well choreographed and would have been a nice collaboration with Bond, but she vanishes as does every opportunity to make this an interesting movie.The ending, which was epic considering the length of the Bond series and its place in Hollywood history, deserved to be in a FAR better movie than this pathetic attempt earned.",No Time to Die
448,wijajo-72563,A Step Back Towards Die Another Day?,7,1 October 2021,"Barbara Broccoli, the producer at EON, said that she wanted to reboot the franchise after Die another Day to make it less fantastical. Casino Royale achieved that goal beautifully, giving a wholly fresh look to the Bond series that also made it more gritty. However, I feel that No Time To Die takes a step-back towards the fantastical and the focus on bioagents as opposed to conventional weapons and space-based weapons systems gave it more of a Mission Impossible feel.Talking of impossible - Bond's invincibility has perhaps been taken a step too far here. Usually bullets dance around the man. Ridiculous, but possible. He also enjoys locating himself just far away from big explosions to survive. No Time to Die seems to capitalise on this and push us further into the downright silly.Bond retains his charm and the action, stunts, and scenery impress as always. I also enjoyed Remi Malek's villain, even if exploration of his character was piecemeal. However, everyone has a different view of what Bond, as a franchise, should look like. For me, I feel like the action and hyper-futurist elements was a step backwards.",No Time to Die

The movie is far from brilliant, the theme song is poor and the story is completely ridiculous, although I understand it is difficult to develop new concept after so many movies.I miss the simple stories and inspiring Bond adventures from License to Kill, Goldfinger, The Man with the Golden Gun or even Live and Let Die. What is more, No time to die doesn't provide any intimidating and memorable main villain, there are no though henchmen, no tension throughout the movie and no real Bond girl. Ana de Armas has 5-10 minutes of screen time and she is definitely the best. I hope to see her as a leading character in the next Bond movie with a new and fresh actor in the role of 007 (for example, Richard Madden)...The Safin story is not engaging enough and Rami Malek doesn't receive enough screen time too. Instead there is too much of Q, M, Moneypenny and Nomi. I personally believe these characters should receive a maximum of two to three scenes as it was in Casino Royale because they steal much from the development of the villains and their motivation.On the other hand, I give this score of 7 because the movie is quite entertaining and easy to watch. The action sequences are well made and they provide a right mix between quality and quantity. If you don't have high hopes for this film and don't expect a masterpiece, then it's OK and you may spend almost 3 hours enjoying it. Yes, it has many issues with the story and the chemistry between the characters but it's better than Die another day or Quantum of Solace, for example.",No Time to Die

I feel that any misgivings from the writing and direction should be separated from the actors.Which brings me to my point. The problem with this film was not that it lacked ambition, but more so that it didn't know what to do with the bond story. The whole movie didn't really feel like a bond movie. I can forgive some of the politics in the film if it contributes to the film, however it felt out of place and unnecessary. The main flaw with the film is the third act. Sloppy writing, and poor direction ends the Craig bond films on a rather disappointing note. It saddens me to see how far we have came from Casino Royale to this.It also seems this is quite a polarizing film looking at some of the other reviews. While I don't feel like it deserves a 1/10 or a 10/10, it just felt...

485,petersaarloos,An effective but flawed Bond film,5,29 October 2021,"!CONTAINS SPOILERS!I'll say right off the bat: I am not an enormous Bond fan. Films that are heavy on action but low on suspense (meaning, we already know the outcome) don't work for me, unless they are perhaps a nice side dish to an otherwise compelling story.This film had plenty such nonsense scenes, in which an invincible Bond came unscathed out of unlikely situations. But it offered much more.First of all, Léa Seydoux as Madeleine was so effective as an enigmatic lover, that I was hooked in the first act. Second, the film contained enough comedic relief that it did not feel as though it took itself too seriously, as did some of the previous installments. Third, his connections with Felix at the CIA and the rivalry with MI6 and the new 007 were an original take on Bond. Fourth, the question of whether the child was Bond's daughter was intriguing enough. Finally, I enjoyed the mystery that was set up. The party where solely Bond survives, the question how Blofeld got into a party from his quarantine, who is behind this and where is it going?Yet as well as this film set itself up, it had to come crashing down in the final act. I'll run through my biggest gripes.1) The new 007, while an interesting concept, does not get her due. She is introduced mostly as a prop for us to wonder whether James Bond truly is no longer 007, only to reveal that, no, she's willing to call him 007 again. After that, she is just another invincible character. Looking back, I wonder what her role in the story was in the first place.2) The villain, played by Rami Malek, completely missed the mark for me. Perhaps that's subjective. He is certainly creepy enough. But his motives and background are unclear. Yes, his family was killed by Madeleine's father, but he killed her mother in return. Then Spectre. Then Blofeild. Now, he wants to wipe out most of civilization? Why? It is mentioned as a side that he is in love with Madeleine. When? He also looks like he did not age, and blunders through the plot by letting Bond's child go. He feels like a placeholder villain. (It doesn't help how easy it is to infiltrate his base and foil his plans...)I was genuinely moved by the possibility that Bond would not be able to see his family again. I knew there was threat that he might die, because this was his Craig's last film, and as stated I thought Seydoux was effective, as was Lisa-Dorah Sonnet (very impressive performance by her). But his eventual death was marked by (a) a grievance and (b) a goof. I'll admit that I'm torn between defensive cynicism to protect my feelings, here, and sincere criticism: I really was moved by the final scenes, but these remained annoying:a) The tech that targets DNA are nano bots. As an aside, it is mentioned that 'once you touch them, they are in you forever.' That makes no real sense. If it were a synthetic virus, perhaps it could reproduce in your system and remain dormant, not unlike HIV, but unless we are talking about nanobots that can reproduce (an enormous technological leap), this makes no sense. This premise, that you remain infected forever, is mentioned as a passing comment (which got some perplexed responses out of my audience), only to have enormous consequences in the final scenes. This plays out poorly in the script: an already dead Bond can no longer touch his family, because he'd kill them. That's overkill. They could've either made the nanobots more of a threat to Bond, a way for the villain to have him do his bidding, or simply excluded this silly premise, because he's dead anyway.B) My biggest gripe is the moment that he and the already now useless 007 place Madeleine and his newly discovered daughter, of which he is now aware, on a boat together for them to escape. This retired, new father, finally reunited with the love of his life, now goes back in to finish the job completely solo, whereas the supposedly ambitious, young (presumably single), new 007-agent stays with HIS FAMILY to protect them, far out of harms way. James Bond gets infected by the conveniently tragic nanobots and gets blown to smithereens by missiles while the new 007 gets to further her career.This happens in passing and is just ridiculous. The only argument given by Bond, that no one protests, is ""I've got to finish this."" No, you really don't, anyone can finish it at this point, but you are, uniquely, the father of that child. What makes it more infuriating is that the overkill infection by the nanobots wouldn't have been a huge deal to the new 007. She could've actually escaped with her life. (Not to mention, as an aside, that the plot that he needed to open the blast doors is also considered evident by Bond because, obviously, the missiles would ""bounce off that like a trampoline."" I highly doubt the sensitive lab equipment would survive the entire island being blasted, but alright, we needed an argument for him to go back in I suppose.)Again, I was moved by his death and his inability to see his family again, but it doesn't help when the script of a film, that cost hundreds of millions to make, does such a poor job at getting us to that punchline. It also really makes me wonder if it wouldn't have been better just to have him retire happily. I was genuinely at the edge of my seat, knowing that Bond might die, as this was Craig's final film. The could've played with that. The new 007 and Bond go back in, the villain threatens to douse Bond with the nanobots, 007 successfully bites that bullet, Bond gets shot, barely survives, etc.It feels almost as if the final act was written by different people, whose job it was to resolve all the good stuff set up in the first act on that one island. For a film that had almost three hours to do this, I think it failed, and left me feeling moved by the enchanting performance by Léa Seydoux and the idea of a Bond family, but disappointed by the writers who turned that into a mere tear-jerker.",No Time to Die
486,InsightfulCritic,W007KE,1,7 October 2021,Bond went totally woke... and now will go broke.. too bad how they ended this franchise.I hated the ending.SKIP!! Unless you want to keep seeing political correct mindless action.,No Time to Die

Yet again Waltz steels the show as Bloomfeld .The ending left me crying tears of sadness and joy , this is my Bond the one after Connery and Moore that really made me fall in love with him.Just hope they carry on with a male Bond and take it to the next level so another generation can say that's my Bond.",No Time to Die
488,Paul-Corio,Over Indulgent Finale,6,2 October 2021,"If you liked the preceding 4 Daniel Craig films, you will enjoy this. Stylistically it's on point and the action scenes are slick and full of stunts.The plot is a bit too plotty and clumsy, as it is literally geared to set up a specific final scene, rather than flow naturally. Bond is a bit far removed from what you've seen before as this is an emotional love story rather than a fraught and tense spy caper. Malick's villain is without menace and largely forgettable. It's still better than average but not the strongest of Craig's Bond films!",No Time to Die
489,jsataluri,"Unmemorable, but a fitting send off for Daniel Craig",7,10 October 2021,"The 25th Bond film has Daniel Craig in his final outing as Bond coming out of retirement to track down a megalomaniac who stole one of MI-6's biological weapons and plans to destroy the world. Simultaneously, Bond is dealing with his emotional wellbeing and does not trust anyone until somebody from his past returns and provides him a surprise he never expected, leading to the climax which I will not reveal.The Modern Day Bond is a very polarizing figure. Modern audiences will love him, whereas long time Bond lovers will hate him. He is more of a tragic figure here without the fun and games. And it's very hard to truly understand him. We have to realize that Craig's Bond is in its own film universe.The action scenes are great, but doesn't open new ground. The production values are high, but with a Bond film, it's more of the same we have seen in the Craig movies. Secondly, Rami Malek (fresh off his Oscar win in Bohemian Rhaspody) is wasted as the villain. He comes out as one note and his motives are laughable. While watching, I couldn't understand what he was saying. Thirdly, the film's length can be taxing.And yet with this film, we can say Craig has come full circle. He does well in his action scenes and slightly better emotionally. I believe after all he went through in all 5 films, this would be the way he would sign off.There is a great cameo from Ana De Armas as the asskicking Bond girl in the Cuba scenes. Lashana Lynch is pretty decent as Nomi, while Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear are good in their roles. Christoph Waltz also makes a cameo as Blofeld.I would say to viewers and imdb members who have yet to watch the movie, please ignore both extremes (the lovers and the haters) and watch it with a blank slate. I would say you should watch it even if you're not a Bond fan. If you want to see Craig in his final outing as Bond, please remind yourself not to be swayed by extreme reviewers on both sides or the critics. It's up to the viewer to decide whether this film is terrible and ""woke"" or fascinating and a fitting send off.In conclusion, I doubt this film will be a memorable Bond movie (I hope I'm wrong), however I do consider it as a farewell for Daniel Craig.7/10.",No Time to Die

The film gives you what you want and expect from a Bond film, all the while adding some new aspects and broadening the scope of what we know a 007 to be. The ensemble is well cast with a few leaving you wishing they had more screen time. The story is for the most part well thought out and does a good job of wrapping up this current incarnations narrative. Not everyone will like the ending (I won't spoil it) but I thought it was a sensible choice. Full of cliché and one liners alongside some albeit limited solid action sequences, the film offers an exciting ride with some darker and even emotional moments.

497,markjayaweera,"A dark Bond film, Daniel Craig is excellent in his farewell to Bond.",8,22 October 2021,"I am one of those that saw my first Bond film in the cinema in the early 1980s For your Eyes only as a 9 year old. A lot of people have grown up with Bond over the decades. I am one of them. So it was a real surprise and a bit of a shock to see Bond finally Die at the end. It has never happened before in the 25 Bond movies since and I have over the years seen all of them as movie fan. It is quite incredible to see James Bond movie icon who has entertained millions of cinema goers worldwide for nearly 60 years. This incredible, indestructible almost superhuman character of the big screen literally finally Die a mortal death at the end. Its a shock to realize especially for those of us who have clocked up in age and seen his character cheat death countless times finally die with Daniel Craig portrayal of Bond. I suppose it is inevitable given how dark Daniel Craig played Bond away from the cartoon comic book but highly entertaining Bonds of the past decades where the villains are dispatched. There is a happy ending Bond gets the woman and lives to fight another day. If their is one thing you will learn of Craigs portrayal of Bond is that he is a very mortal Bond. Can be hurt in mind and body and he carries the scars to prove it. He is tormented at the moral ambiguity of his work. Even when he is trying to retire from it all in his hideout in the Caribbean. The bad of this world will find him. Leiter coaxes Bond out of retirement for one last chance to save the world. Bond does save the day but at the cost of his life and at the chance of finally spending his days with his second wife and daughter. He chose to end his life rather than escape this time. Because this weapon had infected him and he knew he could not return to any normal life again where he could finally have some peace with his second wife and daughter. It must have been really emotional for some people who grew up on Bond to see him finally take the journey into eternity. I am sad to see the last of Daniel Craig as Bond. He was the most realistic of all the Bond movie actors. He brought out the darkness of the character but also the very human person Bond character was. Thanks Daniel Craig for your excellent portrayal of Bond. I for one will look out for the next movie Daniel Craig acts in. What a fine actor he is. I saw it today after a long time since I visited a Cinema. I give this movie 8 out of 10.",No Time to Die
498,chrisgriffintv,One of the better Bond films.,8,2 October 2021,"Well, to start off the gunbarrel sequence was disappointing. The opening was a decent start to the film. The song is too quiet and slow for a 007 theme. The first car chase with Bond and Madeleine arguing and the bullets failing to go through the car is honestly brilliant. The middle of the film doesn't have too much chatting in between fight scenes. The villain doesn't appear enough but this does add to the mysteriousness of his character. The final third is really high intensity and features the first ever death of James Bond. I don't think this is a good choice as now it pretty much has to be rebooted and at best will be a soft reboot with the rest of the cast remaining and James Bond becoming a code name. The fact that it says ""James Bond will return"" at the end suggests the code name theory for Bond 26. Overall it's one of the better Bond films. Just about earns an 8.",No Time to Die

He is according to me the best Bond of modern times .....
With No Time To Die, he just got the perfect farewell from playing this character ......

The film picks up right after ""Spectre"" and the opening 25 mins or so are quite promising...however the film slowly loses itself over the remaining 2 hours. Bloated and stupid is the only way to describe the plot of this film. The villain enters the picture halfway through the movie and the motivation for his actions seem....pointless and his reasoning for his actions are basically non-existent. The film also goes from serious to almost comically goofy throwing back to some older bond films. The biggest crime however is that this really doesn't feel like James Bond.... The writers did him dirty in this film. Really at the end of the day this film is well made and entertaining as even the worst bond films are, but I would still give this a 5/10 and put it on the list of worst bond films.",No Time to Die

The movie has a lot of the traditional Bond components but the whole is less than the sum of it's parts. The movie takes itself far too seriously & spends too much time on inane action sequences in either the snow or a concrete bunker.

Casino Royale was truly a masterpiece in so many aspects and it has set the standards to a high level for the other movies. So I get that it is hard to reach to those standards and live up to the expectations.But, it feels like Craig's goodbye should not have been filled with immense amount of clichés and unnecessary story lines. The actual ending was really good and emotional, but it is hard to say the same for the movie overall.Bond movies will always be enjoyable for those who does not have any emotional connections to the Bond movies.

It is bloated, self-important, pretentious and lacking the one, key, defining characteristic of James Bond 007: fun.There is literally nothing in the film that is fun. No wonder they panicked and tried to get Phoebe Waller-Bridge to lighten the mood. If she did then the script really must have been dire before she came on board.The film has some action sequences that are mostly gratuitous, rather than the usual Bond fun, and the rest is convoluted, contorted and utterly tedious. At 2h43 it's an hour longer than it should be.The most interesting and fun character, and the most in keeping with the franchise, is that of Paloma (Ana de Armas) who appears for a few minutes. The rest are so unbelievably tedious, including Daniel Craig who entirely lost the flashes of humour he brought to Casino Royale and even Skyfall.I usually enjoy re-watching all the Bond films from time to time.

508,faerlian,Interesting...,7,1 October 2021,"For some measure of my Bond tastes, Skyfall is heavily overrated, but Casino Royale was the best bond since Goldfinger; From Russia With Love.Objectively, this isn't a 10, nor is it a 2. It's decent. It's not amazing, nor is it terrible. Way better than Spectre but that's not saying much. It felt like a film that had differing ideas of what it wanted to be and what direction to take the character of Bond.Overall, the Bond theme that was the most consistent, was a more 'mature', well rounded, and empathetic Bond. It works, and yet it also doesn't. The question I found myself asking is 'why?'. They made Bond a soulless orphan in Skyfall, now they are trying to make him emotional? Also who cares? This is not what Bond is supposed to be about.Dialogue was usually good but there were some Marvel-esque moments which had no place being in a Bond film. Likely Phoebe's work. Her writing style actually fits in the upcoming Indy movie, but here its...well...I'll let you decide.It also isn't woke, thank god. Well, objectively it kind of is, but it's not aggressively so. It's tolerable. They treated Bond with respect and didn't make him a fat overweight bearded drunkard used for comedic relief.One thing they did get right, where the previous two Bond films lacked in, was Bond's good-natured suavity and charm. Admittedly, this is likely Phoebe's doing as well, so you get the good with the bad.There is no blood from gunfire ever. Pandering to the Chinese market because they don't allow blood on the screen isn't a good thing Hollywood. I missed me some John Wick R-rated violence.The ending was unnecessary. Some characters were also unnecessary or simply annoying (again it felt like they were trying to copy Marvel). There's actually a scene towards the beginning of the film, that I swear was copied right out of The Winter Soldier (The Winter Soldier did it better). If you've seen the original trailer, you can figure it out.On the upside, the tech was cool, the music score was one of the better ones, and the cinematography was good. Visually the camera work was very good. If you've seen Bad Boys for Life, the directing style is actually quite similar.Some fight scenes, are illogical. Why do the bad guys always have Stormtrooper aim when aiming at central characters? This is a trend I've been seeing in movies from the past decade that needs to end ASAP. It completely destroys my immersion in any movie.I read a critic review that Raimi went full Jared Leto from Blade Runner 2049. Made me lol since it was accurate. Stop trying to make villians Joker 2.0 guys. It's very very hard to do. To portray true psychopathy you have to actually become psychotic in some way, at least temporarily. Ledger isolated himself for a month for the role.Raimi is also underused and was on screen fairly little, comparative to the 2 hour 46 running length. The third act is either too long or too short.Overall, was it fun and worth seeing, as a Bond fan? Yesn't.",No Time to Die

510,eb-77766,One of the better Bonds,9,13 October 2021,"Watched it last night and had a really nice experience. Given its rating I expected the reviews to be quite good as well so I was a bit stunned about all the negativity in here. However, the negativity is mainly because it's not a ""classic"" Bond movie or portrayal and because of political issues.Guess what? I like it this way. I enjoy the older Bond movies as well but for my taste they can a little bit too cartoonish. This one is darker, more mature, more human. And Daniel Craig shows a more emotional Bond than we're probably used to. Again, I like it way. Already in the excellent opening sequence I felt this would be my cup of tea and it was.Many have pointed out Ana De Armas performance and she was excellent. But I enjoyed all the characters. Nomi, Madeleine, M, Q, Leiter etc. To me, Lea Seydoux is heavily underrated in this movie and she is gorgeous! In her own way. Lashana Lynch was really good as well and ok.. I guess I understand the political issues but just get over it. She did a really good job and I was surprised when she was the new 007 but it worked well.If I have something to complain about it could be the second half.. not just as interesting as the first half but that's a small issue. In general I liked the story and the DNA weapon was a new take.And then finally of course, the finale. And I don't care that much because I am not a hardcore Bond fan but to kill Bond off I instantly felt was an unnecessary mistake.. Ok, Daniel Craig's last movie etc. But it could have ended in so many different ways which would have been better for the fans.

512,Polotovar,The quality card has turned again. At least for me...,8,16 October 2021,"In my opinion, there is one rule that applies to Bond films with Daniel Craig, and that is alternating quality. Casino Royale was great for me, Quantum of Solace was good, Skyfall was great again and Spectre was above average. So I was wondering if it would work this time and if the cards would turn in favour of No Time to Die, and I mean great film again. Here, that little quality rule of mine has been proven true, and the latest Bond with Craig is great again. Right from the start the film sucked me in with a nice location and the subsequent action pumping up the pace followed by a classic musical intro, this time from Billie Eilish and yeah, I liked it. Then some more action and I'm not gonna lie, I was slowly getting sick of the action. The pace really started to pick up and the locations started to rotate and yes, there are a lot of locations and a lot of rotation, which I thought was great in the finale. The film does slow down after a while and after the delicious action that drew me in I was ready to follow some deeper plot. The story was cool in my opinion and it was definitely helped by the villain here played by Rami Malek and for me it was a great choice as I thought he was great, even though he wasn't in the film much in the finale. I'm coming to one last thing and that's the overall length. The film is actually almost 3 hours long, which is really quite a lot, but for me it didn't hurt at all in the finale. The last Bond as Craig, so the last final charge, which didn't even bore me with the length because as I mentioned there are changing locations and there is quite a bit of action which I enjoyed watching. So in the end I enjoyed Daniel Craig's last adventure as Bond to the fullest and for me this is a great film that beautifully and I might add unexpectedly concluded a Bond saga that I can recommend to Bond fans.",No Time to Die

But let's be honest, James Bond is a relic of the Cold War and Britain's colonial hangover - way past it's sell-by-date and only here to propagate a sense of importance that Britain in the real world does not have.

He does it by reinforcing the themes from his own handful of movies with a lot of call backs to previous Bond adaptations like On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It is bold. They do something a Bond movie has never done, that took a lot of guts, but it is done well and makes sense within the plotlines established in Spectre, and even Casino Royale. This is Craig at his best as Bond with incredible depth in portraying the story at hand with new factors and a villain that is very serviceable. Don't overthink where it is going, just enjoy the ride and admire the seemless way they combine old and new. This is a very good film to wrap a series of films that Bond has become, actor by actor, differently. It is important to note that Bond films as a whole do lack continuity from movie to movie with characters who have died once or more than once reappearing in later iterations. Bond has never been a series that follows direct timelines even though themes and storylines can carry over. Remember that fact throughout this movie. It doesn't make it less effective, he is in his own world at his own time and version of the character. The next Bond will also be in his own time and version of the character as was Connery, Moore, Lazenby, Dalton, and Brosnan. Enjoy it for what it is and when it is.",No Time to Die

Of course, this series deals with the life of James Bond a little more, and this has made the film somewhat different. Excellent soundtrack with the same background that separates the soul from the viewer's body takes the film to its peak.

523,shanphil,Mix of Bonds old and new,7,20 October 2021,"No spoilers. It was very good. An odd mix of Bonds past with a lot Craig Bond. Sort of a Roger Moore type over the top plot to take over the world. It had more humor than the usual Craig Bond movie, but also was as action packed, violent, and serious as a Craig Bond movie. Bond has become fairly monogamous in recent movies --and we get into his relationships, thoughts and feelings--which never happened before Craig, I don't think. A big part of the movie is actually a love story. The opening action chase sequence--which we get in all Bond movies, was very good. The villian is good and Rami Malek seems to have fun with it. Over all, as with all Bond movies, the plot is secondary--there are pretty women, amazing locations, and fun action.",No Time to Die
524,b_clerkin,Another Titanic-ed Wreck,2,11 October 2021,"When my partner and I watched ""The Perfect Storm"" - having both read the riveting book upon which it was based - we were aghast at the ending. He muttered that they had ..""Titanic-ed it up and ruined the story."" with the treacly, sentimental dreck which, one supposes, were incorporated to appeal to female movie goers who accompanied their men to see the movie version of a seagoing yarn. We know that Hollywood are idiots for the most part, largely based on decisions like this.They've done it again - this time taking a perfectly good James Bond adventure and inserting elements that have no place in this pantheon and concluding with the most irritating and nauseating ending. I should have realized from the start - the homage to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" that something ominous was coming. This, and other nods to Bondian legend were about as subtle as Odd Job demonstrating his skill as an assassin by sailing his hat across the lawn to decapitate a statue. Considering the jarring elements added, this was a cheap and insulting attempt to placate Bond fans before dropping the hammer.I do like Craig's Bond - though his darker, less insouciant portrayal made the films less fun at times. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Wishaw are worthy replacements for the Ms, Moneypennys and Qs who came before and the two newest ""Bond Girls"" are powerful women who can kick ass and take names backwards and in high heels - all while tossing off one-liners. The casting of Lea Seydoux in Spectre and this film is a puzzle - having the much older Bond madly in love with someone with a teenage baby-face makes no sense and gave scenes a bit of a dirty old man vibe. Yes, Bond has always gone for a wide variety of women, but they never looked like they'd be carded at a bar - even Denise Richards's Dr. Christmas looked well into her twenties - and classically beautiful. Seydoux is pretty and cute but she and Craig lack credibility - and fire - as a couple in True Love. She is one of several jarring aspects that mar the movie.Also, Rami Malek was not a great villain, despite having the most evil plan, he was rather banal - kind of like if Jason Voorhees was an Imperial Storm Trooper with STEM skills and a weird accent that ran the gamut from Moscow to Damascus with lots of stops in between. I am not sure if the idea was to portray him as coldly calculating and suffering so from PTSD that he became an emotionless automaton, but all he did was demonstrate the banality of evil. Of course, I could have been so distracted by whatever was done to his skin that I missed the personality.While the film embraced the usual features of Bond - the gorgeous scenery, heart-pounding chase scenes, beautiful people in beautiful cars and clothes, fun gadgets, etc. - the ending was as non-Bond as you can get.This was ostensibly to allow Ian Fleming's iconic creation to be ""re imagined"" in a way that is more acceptable to the label-loving, checklist ticking nitwits that place ethnic and other considerations well above things like talent, truth and respect for artists. James Bond was written as a male of Scots ancestry, very heterosexual and rather patriotic with a set of real moral values that may or may not appeal to the cabal of perpetually offended pearl clutchers who believe that they are the only arbiters of thought and opinion. Having Walter Oland play Charlie Chan was an affront and offensive and having someone other than a male of European ancestry playing James Bond is just as offensive, not least for the utter disrespect it would show for Fleming's artistic vision - or his ""truth"" as people are so fond of wittering on about. I do not understand why this would be necessary when creating a new and unique powerful, talented, brilliant and sexy spy character who can be played by any talented actor would be welcomed by the viewing public with enthusiasm.Even though this entry has more quips and humor than Craig's previous efforts, it was far less entertaining than even the lamest of prior Bond movies because of the casual brutality that permeated a lot of the scenes. Craig's Bond is unapologetically cruel and vindictive, making him less appealing and reducing the fun quotient which was so important to leaven the over the top destruction and violence in the stories.Which brings me to my biggest beef about this addition to the Bond pantheon - this Bond has kids in real peril. I have NEVER seen one Bond movie where children appear outside of incidental scenes, yet this movie has two children, one adolescent and one a toddler, who are depicted in lengthy sequences involving violence, guns and physical harm. I am aghast that Barbara Broccoli, who had so far been very protective of the integrity of this franchise created by her father, lost the plot to this extent. I know that the Craig oeuvre has been lauded for its darker and more authentic depiction of Fleming's book Bond, but this movie goes so far beyond that to be almost unrecognizable.There are very few films in which it is acceptable to show children in the midst of gun battles or being threatened with harm, let alone death. The narrative that these scenes provide could have been done in dialogue without the grotesque visuals. Children, especially children being shot at, do NOT belong in a Bond movie. Period. Full Stop.

No Time to Die is not as good as those two great 10/10 efforts in the Craig era, but it is close. The film pays homage to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" with its use of the ominous tag line ""We Have All the Time in the World"" to its use of a slower version the great theme to the Lazenby/Bond film to the Louis Armstrong song from that film. Remember when Roger Moore looked way too old for the role of Bond? His latter two films tried to ignore the obvious aging. Craig's finale embraces his obvious older age with aplomb.

I have no idea why most of the reviews I look at are 1 star, because this film is a 9 star, almost 10. The whole movie is filled with surprises, entertaining action, and incredible acting. Being a massive Daniel Craig fan, especially for his Bond films, it was hard to watch the film knowing it's the last time audiences get to see him as 007. It was great to see many characters from Skyfall and Spectre return in No Time To Die. Rami Malek gave us a wonderful, bone chilling performance as the villain. Touching on the action sequences, they were badass and very well done. Everything felt so real and smooth during every sequence.

I will say though that this whole movie should have just been scrapped and then the series rebooted with Ana de Armas as 007. She was phenomenal. All the other actors including Lashana Lynch (the new 007) looked like they didn't want to be there. Ralph Fiennes was so unenthusiastic it was kind of sad. The opening action scene in Italy was one of the only highlights of the movie. Bond movies should go back to being fun and campy.

539,FreddieLee04,Craig's last gives his tenure one final emotional gut-punch.,8,3 October 2021,"So much has changed in the world since the release of Daniel Craig's previous 007 film, Spectre, that nearly all Bond fans had zero idea about what No Time to Die was going to bring us. Heavy-handed social commentary? The introduction of way too many characters simply put there for diversity purposes? The trailers offered us little insight except into how Hans Zimmer had really nailed the score- something to add to the already enormous hype generated by the multiple delays due to COVID.After leaving the theatre from seeing No Time to Die on Friday, I can safely say that Bond has never been this emotionally charged, in all the good ways. From the cold-blooded killer we saw in 2006's Casino Royale, 15 years on, we are given the perfect conclusion to Craig's arc, Bond has moved on from his ruthless past and has become an even more root-able force on our movie screens.Credit to Cary Fukunaga. After the departure of Danny Boyle from Bond 25, a series of unfortunate production issues would lead No Time To Die down a road only comparable to the likes of Apocalypse Now- a truly haunted production was in store. But, to my surprise, director Cary Fukunaga has done something with Bond I doubt any other director could've done so effortlessly, and that is make James Bond seem truly like a real human being. In these pandemic-ridden times, the one thing us movies fans needed was a classic film to drag us back into film escapism we require to help us get through these dark times.James's mission takes him across the globe, as the plot of a 007 film should; from the luxurious beaches of Jamaica to the bustling streets of Cuba and beyond. Accompanied by what might be the finest James Bond cast ever assembled- including, but not limited to- Ana De Armas, Lashana Lynch, Billy Magnussen, Rami Malek, Ralph Fiennes, Jeffrey Wright and Lea Seydoux.And to many older fans' delight, this is the closest we've gotten to a Roger Moore film since Roger Moore. The outlandish henchmen and one-liners took me back to when I used to watch The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die on repeat. But Craig never forgets his roots that he's planted so deeply in the character- maintaining that Dalton-esque brutality and the Connery-like suave appearance.The ending will trouble some, but I bought it. This franchise has finally struck the perfect balance it has been unknowingly searching for since Brosnan departed the role. What a send off.",No Time to Die

541,fscouto_,A fitting conclusion,9,15 October 2021,"I believe Skyfall is the best Daniel Craig Bond movie. Everything comes along perfectly: cinematography, soundtrack, involving sequences, captivating story, an impressive villain and a more human and real James Bond. No Time To Die almost reaches it, standing right above the incredible Casino Royale and followed by Spectre and Quantum Of Solace. No Time To Die earns this place for a few reasons. It explores several different genres with a coherent story and with a balanced pace. It has a deeper emotional value, not just because it represents the end of an era, but also for the plot it decides to follow. And finally, it manages to combine all of these elements with originality, innovation and a high artistic level. It is a movie that, definitely, brings James Bond to our present reality and satisfyingly concludes this incarnation's narrative. The main plot may be a bit classic and the villain, less impressive (despite Rami Malek's best efforts), but it is a movie that brings up the best of the old and the modern.

From the moment it was announced, the sense of elation and anticipation for it were off the hook and, while this picture gives a satisfying termination to a 15 year-old franchise, probably the most emblematic one out there, you certainly feel the theater as if the film is missing a HUGE jigsaw piece in order to be completed.The movie, unfortunately, wanes mostly in its screenplay, which lacks a sense of individuality. The more humorous tones don't help either, having even more than the previous Craig films. Ergo, the performances fall short as well, especially Malek's who, as honest as I can be, has probably the worst villain in a Bond film.... Definetly not his fault, though.Although, on a technical aspect, the film brings out, it doesn't feel like enough.

It is a James Bond film for God's sake, there is no expectation for it to be Shakespeare, Kubrick , Capra etc. It is full of high octane action, wonderfully absurd plot lines, beautiful locations, hokey emotions, unsubtle wit - what did the one star reviewers expect? If you like Bond films generally then you will love this one. If you hate Bond films generally then you will hate this one - and so don't go. If you are a Bond purist saying the new films have lost the magic, and hark back to the Connery days, then take off your rose tinted glasses and watch them again - having re-watched ""From Russia With Love"" the day before I saw ""No Time To Die"", I can assure you as pure entertainment ""No Time To Die"" wins hands down.To add some objective details.Ralf Fienes' M is ambiguously written and I am disappointed that his character hasn't been better developed, that said, I still prefer him to Judi Dench's grumpily lovingly motherly persona.Bond's love interest is too young for an ageing Daniel Craig. And as others have said, Bond never convinces us that he is over Vesper.Ana De Armas' Paloma character is a breath of fresh air, full of wit and action, a shame she wasn't on screen longer - hopefully she will be back one day..?Rami Malik tried his hardest to extract genuine emotion from a ( to be expected) underwritten Bond villain. But he and the writers failed to inject any genuine threat or peril into the character - but no Bond villain ever has.I can't watch the new Moneypenny without remembering that she was originally a new field agent who was confined to a secretarial job, which is absurd and it would have been better if she, not the brand new female agent, had become the ""next generation"" angle.Q continues to bring wit and this time even a bit of emotion.Daniel Craig is probably the best ever Bond but Connery will always be right behind him. But as a pair they are leagues ahead of the others.I am not blinkered to the absurdities. Yes, the hand guns have too many bullets. Yes, the ground troops of the Bond villain are like canon fodder and why on earth would any of them enlist? Yes, some of the exposition dialogue drags in a couple of places. Yes, the final ending is telegraphed and therefore looses a little of the shock factor. But I gladly forgive the film all these trespasses ( and others that I won't refer to as they are spoilers) simply because I smiled throughout, enjoying the spectacle and escapism, which is after all why I go to the cinema, to escape the dreary horrors of the real world, and I certainly don't go to a Bond film to be lectured or educated.Nine stars and an extra one to counteract the naysayers.",No Time to Die
546,Geekofriendly,A vital part of the Bond formula was missing: FUN,4,3 October 2021,"I didn't mind that Bond dies. Heck, I even predicted it. While the way it was handled was a bit too cringey for my taste, what mostly bothers me was that it lacked the impact it deserved.Which is the consequence of the whole movie being so bloody brooding and serious. Completely gone are the lighter tones, the fun, the swagger, the slapstick. Apart from the opening scene in Italy and Bond's Jamaican man-cave, ""No time to die"" simply didn't feel like a Bond movie. Which is highly disappointing for the average hyped Bond fan like myself. And alarming for the future of the franchise.Yes, the Bond formula can get stale and of course needs injections of freshness. But there's part of the formula that should never have gone missing: fun!Imagine ""No time to die"" as a playful, lighter movie. The only time this actually happened was with Paloma. More comedic inserts, less scary action pieces, more sunlight instead of fog and nigh-time, more lush, open-air scenery instead of cramped prisons and London flats, more playfulness between Felix and Bond instead of killing off the only friend the man had. More romance and love between Bond, Madeleine, and Mathilde. ""One final mission, and it will be all right, my love"" type of setting ... They should have made us root for the unexpected family, instead of feeling like the entire movie got hijacked by the presence of a 5-year old.And only then have Safin inject Bond with the poisonous nanobot serum. It would have been heart-wrenching. Not a dry eye in the house type of moment. A legendary new end to an era. Whereas here I basically felt relief for our protagonist. ""Finally, make this movie die already. I want to go home and rewatch a Ted Lasso episode.""I think Daniel Craig mostly got what he wanted from his final outing, but honestly, he shouldn't have been given the role of producer of the last two movies. As amazing as his portrayal of 007 was, these last two movies felt weirdly disconnected from the legacy that we know and love.May they find a fresh new face as the new Bond. A new Roger Moore.

Yes, like many of us, he suffered a severe childhood trauma. How exactly did that translate into mass murder? It never added up for me.Secondly, their director was Cary Joji Fukunaga. Look at his past directing credits. It's heavy on shorts and TV. I'm not seeing much in the way of big budget action blockbusters. I don't blame him. This was a great training opportunity.

The weakness of the film lies in the story line, which is a rehash of a previous story from another Bond film in the distant past, and I wish that something new and unusual had been created, but they decided to keep to the same old formula.

553,Karamakate,It comes with sadness and changes the Bond universe forever,4,4 October 2021,"Honestly, I'm a bit shocked and sad.NTTD is very different from other Bond movies, both in plot, direction and writing. There are several jokes that normally would put a smile on the face but it just feels forced with an overall underwhelming pacing. What annoys me thru out is the rushed editing there several scenes could've been a lot more consistent and aesthetic. For example, Paloma shoots two henchmen in a nicely done choreography in one sequence but is then cut to another angle there she shoots the third man, which just felt off.Nomi's character didn't do anything extraordinary to convince me that she was 007 and Paloma was savagely underused. Man, I fell in love with Ana de Armas.Rami Malek and Christoph Waltz were unrecognizable acting-wise, I've never seen them so stiff and uninspired.It's kind of bald to make Bond a father and may not fit the character but it could've worked for the upcoming movies if Bond made himself a distant father continuing his agent career not risking his daughter's life.However, the ending is incredibly disturbing and makes no sense for the continuity that every Bond movie before NTTD has.We all know that Bond is a person and that every Bond actor has portrayed the same man, for example did Lazenby, Connery, Moore and Dalton mourn Tracy and I've always regarded Casino Royale as an origin story you could watch before the Connery series. You can even jump back and forth between Brosnan and Craig since Dench is M, the Craig series flirts with the old movies a lot so no wonder I thought the continuity could live on. And that the impact Vesper and Tracy made on Bond turned him into the cold man who never thought he ever could get in love again.Bond's death affects the whole Bond universe. No one was prepared for that and I have tried to watch the old movies but it's not the same anymore. I just feel sad and empty knowing that Bond will die and that the Craig series in a way cuts the umbilical cord in a grim way.",No Time to Die
554,TheBabayaga,They did the unthinkable,3,3 October 2021,"The writers did the unthinkable here. Until its last moments, NTTD was indeed, an improvement on Spectre, with high-stakes kinetic action, music by Hans Zimmer and beautiful locations. Ana de Armas was a standout whilst Daniel Craig, as ever, was dependable once more as 007.However, not nearly of that is enough because it all ends with the insane decision to kill off Bond. I can only imagine this was Craig's idea as producer to bring some finality to his version of the legendary super spy but it's very controversial nonetheless. Stupidly brave or bravely stupid? You decide.For me it's the latter. The problem for me is every moment since Casino Royale had led to THAT ending and I don't believe it's the outcome most fans wanted. Bond always finds a convoluted way to escape the inescapable. That's what makes Bond well...Bond! The writers could have borrowed the ending of Extraction with Chris Hemsworth. At least that would have given us a sliver of hope after it's otherwise still shocking ending with Safin having infected Bond with the nano bots).And speaking of villains, Rami Malek and Christoph Waltz deserved better. The writers should be utterly ashamed of themselves for squandering the Oscar winning talents of Waltz not only once but twice, as he gets nothing more than a thankless credited cameo as Blofeld. Malek doesn't fare much better as Safin, a villain with all the depth of a puddle in a heatwave. Seriously, what exactly were his motivations for world domination? I understood his desire for revenge against Spectre but not once do we ever learn how he came to be with an evil lair on a mysterious disputed island.Remarkably this did not feel like a Bond film in the traditional sense either. Overall, this was missing the aura of classiness associated with the franchise. Bond, too, I felt, seemed like a sidekick in his own film. Even if you're okay with that you still have to contend with the soapy melodrama, on-the-nose dialogue and wasted villains. Lea Seydoux and Daniel Craig share even less chemistry in this than they do in Spectre.Bittersweet: Daniel Craig has proved to be an excellent James Bond. Craig is 100% not to blame for any problems with this franchise over the past fifteen years; whoever replaces him has ginormous boots to fill. But this feels like the end of an era which makes No Time to Die all the more a travesty.",No Time to Die

No other reason than they wanted too.The movie is predictable in every way and shape.Also, they killed James Bond at the end of the movie, which I fully expected was going to happened. Why? Because they lack creavity and originality. I don't mind killing Bond, just how and why it was done.Also, it seem that Michael G.

She is also not really pretty and nobody can understand why Bond would fall for her. No competition with Eva Green.And then there is the ending. People will speak about it I guess.

High on skooma, deranged with their snot filled brains trying to cook up a new anti hero to what bond is. The first 30 minutes were quite the ride, but then everything goes downhill after the opening credits.Safin is quite possibly the one villain in the many bond movies that really didn't have any importance. He's basically useless because, thanks to the wonderfully deranged writing, there is zero character development for this villian. There is no sense of urgency that bond dealt with in his earlier missions that could be felt in this film. It was all just..., melodramatic!Rami Malek, you dunce. Your worst role till date.

There may be plenty to look at but there is nothing to see.Long ago it seemed obvious that casting James Bond as a Slavic metrosexual was ironical. The assumption I made then was that the Craig/Bond films were going to be spoofs, and I guess they unintentionally are. But portraying James as a weepy, sensuous ladyboy is silly.The story I grew up with was that James Bond was based on Ian Fleming's career as a Certified British Badass. They just had to tone it down a bit to make it believable.Bond was a womanizing assassin, a man of large appetites and a short attention span. Mawkishly dapper, minimally erudite, moderately witty, only a hairsbreadth away from smarmy. A troglodyte in a tux, if you will. But he was a very lucky fellow, good at bloodshed, Baccarat and bedding women.Knowing that he had suffered greatly helped us understand and accept his death wish. Discerning his lack of interest in life helped us suspend disbelief at his rapid assimilation of data and skills. But it's all gone sour and moldy and rotten.

I read Fleming's books and a few of the other writers who took up the mantle. Connery will always be my favourite screen Bond but I also liked Dalton, who was probably closest to Fleming's vision. When they rebooted the series following a long legal hiatus the Bourne movies were Big and its no surprise that Craig's first outing CASINO ROYALE followed that template, creating a more gritty, bloody and realistic Bond. It was also very faithful to the book and is a fantastic movie, one of the very best of the franchise. Craig silenced his doubters like a bullet from a Walther PPK. What followed became a series of films that had an underlying thread running through them, each building on the other. The climax is NO TIME TO DIE and its a superb Swan song for Craig's Bond. It's brilliantly performed, has a great script, some terrific action sequences but also has heart and pays homage to a lot of the Bond tropes. The action set piece with the Aston Martin DB5 had me grinning like a child. There is also a great use of music. Craig acts his socks off and one thing he has that Connery had was the way he moves, very smooth and confidently. You feel that there is a lot at stake and the ending is pretty jaw dropping.

And even lashana's character was pointless.Lot of loopholes that can't be ignored though, maybe if we don't see the flaws like how the poison was only in that island, not anywhere else, why Rami left James's daughter which was his only blackmail point, why Rami remained in the island and not leave with the resources so that he could build it again, why didn't Madeleine tell James Bond that that's his daughter the other day when she revealed everything.

Anyway, we are introduced to the evil madman kinda late in the story, yet we find out we met him at the beginning, in a disguise, years earlier, as a young evil guy. Huh?In the early Bond films, the writer, Ian Fleming, used a narrative expository device to explain what 007's next assignment was going to be. In this one, since Bond has retired, we do not get that exposition from M to help the audience understand what they are after. Then later, M is vague, so I was confused. So the story took too long to develop. Good action sequences. The 1964 DB-5 Aston Martin is back with it's weaponry. So, that was fun. Overall, not as good as hoped. I noticed a goof.

I wanted to do a 7 but it's just the wiping out of the main character at the end that doesn't sit well with me.The whole point of Bond is that even after the film ends, you are supposed to feel like he is still out there, helping keep us safe.Mr Bond doesn't retire, he doesn't settle down, he doesn't sire children (despite trying... a lot) and - most importantly by far - Bond doesn't give up.Which leaves me to the stupid post-credits message: can't kill-off a character and then tell the audience they will be back. That's just beyond stupid.I absolutely loved Casino Royale, such a good film. It had everything. It felt like the franchise was going to really hit new highs. But gone is the chemistry and the intrigue. Bond isn't turning heads any more when he walks in the room. Bad guys aren't fearful of him, in fact they look more dangerous than he does a lot of the time. Bond gets shot, he looks scared at times and he spends a lot of the film with his guard completely down.Many of the same characters return from the previous film, too - which just seems a bizarre thing to do - and begs the question: why do films have to be strung together so often these days? I want my Bond films to stand apart - not become a dull sludge of trailing plots from previous features.

But he never looked the part either. He's not good looking enough and he doesn't do the humor very well. Half way through he was bloodied and battered. That's not James Bond. Lashana Lynch was flat and uninteresting in every way. Pretty sad when the sequence with Paloma was one of the best parts of the movie. The music was Ok because it reminisced past Bond scores. Malek's character was not compelling or menacing enough. Again he felt flat on the screen. As one stunt director from previous Bonds said, Bond should never be too serious or too violent.

594,jcsallows,The best Bond film I've ever seen,9,10 October 2021,"I'm as surprised as you are. We have so many Bond movies, Mission Impossibles, Bourne movies and so on but this late in the game, yes, this is a very good spy movie. I don't know if it re-invents the genre as much as it refines it into an action movie that's actually entertaining rather than predictable and derivative. This movie shows us how to do it.The acting, the story, the action, it's just all so good. Daniel Craig humanizes Bond in a way we clearly haven't seen in his past performances let alone a Bond movie. Sometimes Bond is ridiculous to the point of cartoonish-ness but this is the best way to send off Daniel's interpretation of the character. Sure, he's good at killing but Daniel's perfomance has a nuance that shows a regular guy underneath all those layers of grit. His character hints several times that he wants to ultimately live a normal life and leave his career as 007 behind him - but he keeps getting pulled back in regardless.Bond's current love interest, Madeleine Swann is also not a side-character in the least. I've never seen such a good use of a love interest in an action film. Madeleine is incredibly central to the plot and may go down in cinema history as the best ""Bond Girl"" in the whole franchise. Nobody thought Bond could ever fall in love but Daniel and team just proved everyone wrong. Their romantic story thread was so powerful that people were weeping in the theater by the end.The movie also tries to put in as many secret agents as possible and I'm here for it. The idea that Bond is single handedly fighting off armies of terrorists is a little old-hat. Seeing the Bond team working together makes more sense than you'd think. It's the same chemistry Tom Cruise has with his team in the Mission Impossible movies. And don't worry, it doesn't feel overbloated; this is still about Bond coming to terms with all the choices he's made throughout past films.I've seen some bad Daniel Craig Bond movies and I know some of you may be hesistant but honestly, you won't be dissapointed. It's better than Skyfall or Casino Royale and I don't say that lightly.",No Time to Die

596,Joaoangelo76,A worthy Swan Song.,8,3 October 2021,"That was quite a journey. I was born in the 2000's, so naturally, Daniel Craig is my generation's James Bond. It was a very emotional experience watching this movie, just sitting there in the theather, sharing the experience with my friends, it was a special day and a bittersweet farewell to my favorite James Bond.The movie is really good. That's the best sum up possible. Everything is very good. No Time to Die has everything a 007 movie usually has. The iconic lines of dialogue, a great opening, a threatening villain, the list goes on... All of that is really well organised by writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga, finally getting the recognition that he deserves.That being sad, the script has a lot to pull of. It's story links all of Daniel Craig's James Bond movies, it continues the plotlines of Spectre, it introduces new characters... it is a lot to deal with. The question is: Does it work? Impressively, yes. With the help of veterans Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, Cary Fukunaga and Phoebe Waller-Bridge were able to give shape to a shapeless story. The characters are overall great, with honorable mention to Ana de Armas, who kills it as Paloma. Her unusual, almost comical personality would be often considered a threat to the tone of a Daniel Craig's James Bond film, but director Cary Fukunaga is able to counter balance the almost silly effect of the character, and give us one of the best sequences of the movie.The script is bloated, but not messy. That means that there is a lot going on in every scene, which makes the film hard to follow sometimes, however those ideas are not just thrown for the sake of continuity, they all have a purpose in each scene, complementing to the overall plot.The acting is superb. Daniel Craig is at it's peak. His acting couldn't be more inspired and emotional to the viewers, you'll not disappoint. Léa Seydoux comes back to reprise her role, doing it flawlessly. Madeleine Swan is a very important piece of the puzzle in this movie. Rami Malek is okay. I expected more from his performance, but I think his character's problems comes from the script, which lacks depth to Safin.Damn you, Daniel Craig. I'll miss you. It's been a great honor to watch your movies, sir. Skyfall was massively important to me when I was a kid, and still is.

This Bond movie was not about anything other than the fascist Woke culture getting rid of Bond once and for all......the villain and plot are just filler.....and too much of that....some of it senseless. No this Bond becomes a doting husband/father figure......and it's all very contrived towards his demise......essentially emasculating the character completely. You'll see that the reviews avg. Vary from 5-7 stars......and that would be the difference between those reviewers who have historical perspective.....and those who don't. Say goodbye to Bond.....hello to Woke!",No Time to Die

Not a fan of Craig as Bond....not the right type, look, and the character has changed from good guy to vodka-guzzling psychopath. This movie is fully intended to get rid of....and emasculate James Bond.....why the reviewing fans are cheering this is beyond me.....must be the cast and crew reviewing! The pathetic villain and plot are only used as filler.....much too long.....for the intention of removing Bond.....and bringing in another 007.....a black woman who feels like a 5th wheel throughout. Those with a brain know this is more of that brainwashing culture of artificial thinking. I'll leave it at that as I believe censorship lives here as well.

599,MoviePeek,A bond to remember,8,18 October 2021,"Like all actors that take on the iconic mantle of James Bond, Daniel Craig's tenure as the super spy has been something of a mixed bag. With genre-defining outings such as the spectacular Casino Royale to the middling and farcical Spectre. No Time to Die is the latest Bond offering and it pleases me to tell you that although it may not be his best outing it is a thrilling and surprising return and a great note to end Craig's era of Bond on.No Time to Die sees the super-spy/supper-shagger/alcoholic James Bond retired from the spy game and living his best life with the love of his life. However, it isn't long before a deformed madman with a vague foreign accent upends Bond's simple way of life and draws him back into the spy game one last time. In true Bond fashion, the mission he is thrust into is filled with beautiful women, explosive chases, and handy gadgets. However, refreshingly No Time to Die utilizes all the elements you'd expect to find in a James Bond adventure in a clever and modern way. Daniel Craig's Bond has strived since its inception to shake off the cheese and outdated cliques of its predecessors, with varying degrees of success but No Time to Die presents a Bond that lives in the present, not the past.Daniel Craig slipped on his first tux and suited up way back in 2006, he's been Bonding around for fifteen years now. He is a man in his early fifties, but that hasn't stopped Craig from throwing himself into the many spectacular and thrilling stunts featured not only in his latest spy adventure but his entire reign as Bond. It is reported that no CGI was used to achieve these amazing stunts, and the results are undoubtedly the best action set pieces in the history of the franchise. But outside of the stunts and action, the film's greatest strength is how it makes Bond a more three-dimensional and complex character. Craig's portrayal of the titular spy has always been at its best when he's vulnerable and his psyche in pieces. This was explored excellently in both Casino Royale and Skyfall, and No Time to Die delves even deeper into the soul of Bond, resulting in a character that feels more real than ever.Outside of Craig the rest of the cast is also great, with new and returning faces all bringing the right balance of gravity and levity when appropriate. But for me, the most welcome surprise in No Time to Time is the introduction of the fresh-faced CIA agent Paloma. Portrayed by Ana De Armas, a quick glance at the film's promotional material could lead anyone to suspect that she is the latest in the long line of beautiful Bond girls, however, the truth is far more unexpected. Although her role may be limited as she only makes a small appearance throughout one portion of the film, she injects every scene she is in with not only the glamour you expect from a Bond girl but also some much-needed humor. Being relatively new and inexperienced she and veteran of the spy game Bond, have a great rapport and play off each other well. It would have been fantastic to see more of her character throughout the film, but her appearance nonetheless was a great surprise.Speaking of humor, James Bond like all great action heroes is no stranger to a witty one-liner or titillating pun immediately after killing a man. This has been present throughout most of the James Bond entries in the franchise and has varied in quality from amusing to cringe-inducing. Craig's Bond has always been an altogether more serious affair than his predecessor, it's a balance the films have struggled to maintain. Bond should be fun and thrilling, not silly and tedious. No Time to Die, for me at least, stuck a satisfying harmony and featured enough humor to prevent the film from becoming pretentious, but never undermined the stakes of the film.But what is any hero without a villain to match them? No Time to Die may go down in history as one of the best Bond movies, but its villain Lyutsifer Safin almost certainly won't. Portrayed by Rami Malek, he speaks softly and unnervingly never blinks. On paper, he ticks all the boxes to make a great villain but in reality, he failed to feel as three-dimensional as our hero. He's got an evil plan that will result in the death of thousands of people, the film attempts to give him motives to make him appear more than just a lunatic, but the truth is inescapable, he just is. A lunatic could have been fun, but No Time to Die wants to have its cake and eat. Unfortunately, this results in a villain that is by no means terrible but is certainly not interesting or all that compelling.In addition to this, his scheme and means of killing people seems a little too convoluted and didn't really fit with the tone of the film, and felt more like something from the Pierce Bronsan era. It was by no means a deal-breaker, but it did pull me out of the movie and make me think ""Really? That's a bit silly"".No Time to Die is a fitting send-off for Daniel Craig and delivers some of the best action and spectacle the franchise has to offer. In addition to this, it offers plenty of unexpected surprises and makes Bond himself a more interesting and complex character. Whatever the franchise does next will hopefully be unexpected and interesting, but for now, we bid farewell to Bond and thank Craig and the many talented artists that brought the iconic character to life like never before for a new generation.",No Time to Die
600,ashishjoy,Glad they delayed the release and was able to watch in the theatre,10,17 October 2021,"As a bond movie fan, this movie couldn't have been any better. Loved the story. The opening action scene is good. The new cast is amazing. Didn't feel that long. A big thank you to the producers who still make movies like these where the action feels so real.",No Time to Die
601,dalks78,"Great first half, then unfortunately it runs out of steam!",7,2 October 2021,"OK this is no way the worst Bond film in the franchise, but it's not anywhere near the best either. If I were to summarise it, I suppose I'd coin an old football phrase and say ""it's a game of two halves"". The first half is action packed and coherent with some excellent dialogue and acting. The prologue and initial mission (kudos to Paloma's scenes by the way), were fantastic and the death of Leiter was very well done. Bond's interactions with the people he hadn't seen in 5 years (M, Moneypenny and Q), were amusing and in places quite tense and the oneupmanship with Nomi (the new 007), was excellent. Unfortunately after a great first half, the movie collapses a bit. The rest of the supporting characters seemed underdeveloped. Madeline (Mr. White's daughter), seemed strangely out of place for some reason. Blofeld is killed off after 5 minutes of screen time. Considering he was eventually identified in SPECTRE as the driving force of all of this Bond's adventures from Casino Royale onwards, it seems lazy and wasteful. Speaking of villains, the big bad's on display here are poor and not noteworthy. Safin and Ash are rarely seen and bar one major scene each being Ash killing Leiter and one a McGuffin for Safin (in the end he infects Bond with a nano-virus so he'll kill the people he loves if he touches them), the major villains don't do that much. All in all I have to admit this was better than I thought. The 1, 2 or 3 star reviews are not fair and considering Hollywood's tendency to edge towards wokeness since 2017 for it's major franchises, this was not one of them. MAJOR SPOILER............................................................. Bond sacrifices himself at the end and is seemingly killed heroically?!?!",No Time to Die
602,illmor-814-204784,Decent ending of Craig Era. Something is missed.,8,30 September 2021,"Craig's Era has been a nice one for the Bond saga. As much as i been waiting for this final installment and as good as it is i feel like something is missing. Don't know if because of too high expectations or too long runtime but the movie didn't feel as entertained as I thought it will be. Is good but don't have the emotion of Casino Royal. Is quite slow compared to that one. Maybe because of the long runtime you also feel there is less action than before and more drama dialogues instead. Said that, the acting is quite good and Craig brings a solid performance and leave the bar high no matter what. The new 00 agent is good but not quite engaging as Ilsa Faust in Mission Impossible for example. Different story is Ana de Armas, so lovely and sexy but quite short time appearance. Action scenes are up to the expectations however there is not too many of them proportionally to runtime speaking . Gadgets are in the usual manner but as with the rest of the movie you feel there is too little of that. Locations are superb and photography is just breathtaking. Callbacks to Bond's history is a very high point. Summarizing, solid execution mostly flawless but lack of emotion ( in the pacing sense of the word ) is it sin. Otherwise this would have a much higher rating. Nonetheless worth the price to see it in theaters.",No Time to Die
603,SithHunter,It's gets a 8 Rating for actually doing that ending.,8,10 November 2021,"But as a whole, it felt like it might be the weakest of the Craig Films. The Villian was barely in the movie, had no purpose and basically ended up with the same revenge plot against Bonds personal life that Blowfeld had.You could tell they wanted to make it feel like a bond movie with all the quips, gadgets and set pieces. But it felt a bit off and it has nothing to do with the new 007, that part was normal for the universe. Agents come and go, but a lot of people are screaming their fragile male egos off about it.I hope with the next actor they give him his own ton for the movies because this style for Craig is now done and dusted.I still can't believe they killed James Bond off for real on screen. Props for that, now reboot and reset all actors for a new Bond (Henry Cavil).",No Time to Die
604,mickgibbo23,Not great,1,10 November 2021,"After a mixed bag of films, Daniel Craigs time as Bond comes to a dull finish. Casino Royale set a high bar that none of the subsequent films could reach. I know people like Skyfall but it falls apart the minute you think about it. Spectre and now this one are Die Another Day level bad. The action is dull, the script bland, the characters are nothing. I quite liked the idea of Lashana Lynch taking over as 007 but her character doesn't have much to do in this film other than be there. Ana De Armas and Geoffrey Wright are also wasted in blink and you'll miss them roles. The ending has no tension and the emotional pay off they go for feels unearned. We dont care about any of these bland characters. Fingers crossed whatever comes next does away with these badly tied together sequels and gets back to stand alone films that are actually fun to watch and that dont drag on for near three hours.",No Time to Die

606,fmilder-533-34251,"A decent movie, and that's a disappointment",7,17 October 2021,"The Good -The pre-credits sequence (the current one; not the flashback) was great, especially the scene at the cemetery, and Bond (finally) deciding to take advantage of the capabilities of the Aston-Martin.Ana De Armas looks terrific, and the ""fun"" she seems to be having as a (very talented) rookie agent is the high point. The Cuba scene is the only one in the entire movie that looks like a traditional Bond movie.Many clever references to Bond and Bond movies, especially ""On her Majesty's Secret Service,"" Bond turning to shoot from the end of a circular tunnel (like the opening credits), Bond having to identify himself to the front desk at MI6.There's no denying that no one does gritty like Daniel Craig. And no matter what you think of the ending, it's hard not to be moved by how he handles the ending.If you go back and watch the preview after seeing the movie, it gives you a quick 90 second reminder of how the movie can rate a 7, despite all its failings, as I describe below.The Not so Good -They make a movie that is 2:43, and they can't give us a bit of a reminder about the romance between Bond and Madeleine? I'm sorry; it was 6 years ago that the two of them rode off together. Pardon me if I'm just supposed to ""know"" that they are madly in love.Killing off so many lead characters. Why bother having Christoph Waltz (Blofeld) at all if you're not going to give him something cool to do?Bond has completely lost his subtlety, replaced by (A) Bond just kills everyone, often with a machine gun, and (B) the bad guys can't hit Bond with any kind of weapon, even from 3 feet away. Hell, they can't catch him when they surround him with cars and bikes. That scene had so much potential - Bond beats off three cars, and you breathe a sigh of relief, only to find that this was the ""tip of the iceberg."" No matter; Bond eludes all the other guys too. This is bit like John Maclain in the later DieHard movies.What did the opening scene with Madeline and her mother have to do with anything? They TOLD us that Spectre had killed Safin's family. So, we had his motivation. What did Madeline as a young girl have to do with the rest of the movie?And speaking of Safin, where did he get his organization from? When he nearly kills Madeline, he seems a lone, disaffected assassin, by the middle of the movie, he's commanding an effort that can overwhelm Spectre, and he has a lair and a full compliment of military. And, finally, having wiped out Spectre, why, exactly, does he still need, and use, the super-weapon?Do Bond's cars have some sort of levitation device? Every time the bad guys' cars cars come near him, he veers in their direction, and they flip into destruction. Do it once, it's cool; do it several times, and we wonder if you ran out of ideas. And, as far as technology goes, how does the watch blow up Primo's eye, but not the gizmo in Bond's ear?What, exactly, was Safin's beef with James Bond such that Safin felt he had to kill Bond? And what did I miss that Bond doesn't die just-about-instantly, like everyone else exposed to the nanobots? Letting Bond die really undermines the movie. Not because that wasn't a moving, close-to-tears ending, but because you don't come to a movie like this to have an ending like that. Moreover, the ending didn't have to have the 9-minute deadline they settled on. They could have made sure that Bond had opened the doors and gotten away (or at least gotten to a point of safety) before blowing up the island. Compare the very similar ending of The Rock (with Nick Cage and Sean Connery).Who was directing all the supporting characters? M was played like it was all he could do to grunt his dialogue. The new 007 seemed to be unsure of whether she was jealous or over-confident or what. (And what was the significance of her asking that Bond get back the 007 designation? Did that affect anything?).The bottom line is that this was a watchable movie, it held my interest, and Daniel Craig can carry a movie like this regardless of everything going on around him. But it's filled with illogic, red herrings, and characters with terribly unclear motivation. And the ending, as moving as it was, seemed contrived to produce the wrong conclusion.",No Time to Die

As a fan to heart of James Bond, and with Daniel Craig having been my favorite Bond and having the best films in the series, this is definitely one of the best bond films. An incredibly entertaining and surprisingly bitter sweet ending to Daniel Craig as James Bond. Bringing everything that I loved about James Bond from the fun characters, great performances, entertaining action sequences, the opening credits sequence and song, the fantastic score from Hans Zimmer, the beautiful cinematography and pacing, and the well written story make this movie work so well. Also worth mentioning, comparing this to all the other James Bond films, this has the best ending and conclusion. I got the sense that this is the last Bond film with Daniel Craig, and everything with Bond's character and his conclusion was pretty perfect and very touching, which shocked the hell out of me and was something I was looking for in a bond film for a long time. Wonderful film, don't know who the next James Bond will be or what those movies will be like, but I'll still be one to this that no one will top Daniel Craig.",No Time to Die

614,EdMatt13,"Didn't have me weeping, but it was pretty good",7,17 October 2021,"I am not a long term bond fan, I have only recently bothered to sit down and properly watch the Daniel Craig movies, but from the moment the black and white intro of Casino Royale begun I was hooked.This film unfortunately has the instant negative tally as it features heavily plot points from the previous movie 'Spectre' which I didn't enjoy nearly as much as Skyfall. However, No Time To Die does manage to shake free of some of my problems with it's predecessor and deliver a movie which I can say I thoroughly enjoyed, but still didn't quite live up to previously set standards.One thing I found myself appreciating more and more in the more recent bond films is Craig's acting- whilst previous performers may have presented the character as a stoic emotionless man, Craig goes the extra mile to show his more humane and doubtful side. The best character of the film award goes to Ana De Armas' Paloma, who was not in the film enough for how well written a character she was. I won't say much about the villain, because there really is nothing to say. He is a very boring villain who could have used another two edits in the scripting room. My favourite character is Q, and whilst I still prefer his appearances in Spectre and Skyfall, No time To Die added another layer to his character which was greatly appreciated.The story is very much like previous films, even to the point of stereotype, but I don't find myself minding much, it's a very fun film taking us across countries and to man y exciting locations. I do wish, however, we got more tributes to past movies in more forms than just the intro (which was quite mid tier) and that we took some time to properly show the positive impact Bond has had and not just his flaws. A (mostly) very fun film plot wise.The ending of the film is what has gotten everybody talking, and whilst (SPOILERS) Bonds death certainly had me getting a little emotional, I couldn't find myself crying at it. Whether I simply wasn't in the right frame of mind or whether the rest of the movie didn't quite constitute a tear out of me I don't know. Unfortunately, I don't get emotional over films very often, so my lack of tears may have been a result of that. Or maybe I simply don't believe that the character is truly dead, maybe the inevitable reboot that looms on the horizon is enough to convince me that he simply will just pop back up again in a bar in some far flung European country or a deep underground Soviet Base. That is the beauty of these characters, however- they are immortal and mean so much to so many people that no matter how many explosions they endure, how many sinking submarines they find themselves on, how many times they bleed out, drown, die, they are never truly dead because we still have the incredible movies they previously appeared in and will continue to appear in.Thank you for these amazing movies, thank you for giving me a franchise to enjoy when I was at a low point, thank you for writing such amazing stories, and thank you for reading :)",No Time to Die

It has everything you can expect from a Bond film - fast cars, bags of action and a Bond girl with a twist. However, despite a strong start to the film, I struggled to make a connection with the 'bad guy', or an ageing Daniel Craig. There was little character development for Rami Malek's role, and only towards the end did we finally dive into the crux of the storyline. It felt as though this bond film ticked all of the usual boxes, but lacked a solid tangible plot. As a seasoned Bond film watcher, even I found it difficult to keep up with what was going on, especially with some scenes which didn't add any value to the plot, other than advertisement for the new Land Rover Defender.Don't get me wrong, the film does what it needs to do to tie up the series, but was it worth the two year wait?

And unlike others I am big on the plot of a film.Quantum of Solace & Spectre were forgettable because the plot lacks importance and a sense of realism.With No Time to Die, you get a return of the ""physical Daniel Craig"" of Casino Royale, alongside a simple to follow plot that still delivers perfectly well to close Daniel Craig's story.A love interest that has great chemistry. A simple villain that one wants to see dead. Gadgets kept to a minimum and actually useful. Hard hitting action sequences.And above all, a Bond that's a real protagonist, and not just a detached killer/agent. You won't get a gimmicky Bond here, you get a Bond that loves, hurts, and fights for stuff that actually personally matters to him.This Bond film does not have the complexity of other Bond films.It doesn't have a million gadgets or ridiculous exotic locales.But what it does solidly was end Daniel Craig's story and give emotional weight to his story.And that is a big achievement. All other Bonds before lacked emotional investment, they were the formulaic Bonds that people expect.

It was everything you would expect from a bond film and was looking promising for the rest of the duration. Then however, the film fell of a cliff...The film became slow and very talkative. Talkative in a way that becomes disinteresting due to the lack of importance in the dialogue. A should-be 30 second dialogue scene would be prolonged to a 5 minute scene. This was a common theme throughout.Making bond into a more human person for this film may have been a good idea but didn't work. The film didn't feel realistic. Daniel Craig is in his element when he is a cold-blooded agent, who shows little emotion and has few words to say. This however was the complete opposite. They over-humanised the character and It didn't feel right.There were some good bits here and there, but for the massive budget, along with the 6 year wait since the last film, it was quite a let down.

I don't know, it simply made no sense. Freddie Mercury has his magic water with light poles in it that if you have a hazmat suit on and a broom you're fine but if you fall in it you burn up like you're an acid, again made no sense. Unless you're a star. I'm pretty sure at an earlier point in the movie there was a couple sweepers and hazmat suits in the above ground pool, yeah later on in the most boring ""Bond versus Villain"" confrontation ever and they're both flopping around in the magic water. It just...it was just bad. I couldn't even tell you what Freddie Mercury's name was in the movie or why he had a baby face mask in the beginning. Why he's saved the girl after shooting at her through the ice and then what did he do with her. Basically a revenge movie about him wanting revenge on her dad that Blofeld was involved with somehow and Bond was just.... I don't know how he fits into the whole thing, I don't think the writers knew either. It was just a sad hot mess. I rank this below Octopussy, Never say never again (The unofficial James Bond movie with Sean Connery and Kim basinger), Woody Allen's Casino Royale and even below that James Bond Junior cartoon. And of course it wouldn't be the 2020s without replacing the old white guy with a black woman because, well, just because that's the thing to do nowadays. And she wasn't even an interesting, likable or really even needed character in the story.Thankfully I got a bunch of good James Bond movies on Blu-ray & DVD.

It felt like the movie had real stakes.And the rest. Wow was this gorgeous to look at. Action was excellent. I didn't feel the runtime. I personally wanted more from the villain. Rami Malek did fine with what he was given but the character needed more fleshing out. I really liked that the first time ever, Bond had a real closure.Overall not as strong as Casino Royale and Skyfall, but miles superior to Quantum and Spectre.

He was pretty boring to watch, but realistic I guess?I believe some would agree that if it were a better put ending and a villian with similar quality it reached through the first half, the movie would leave a completely different trace.In the same time, It is a high budget well thought movie, least i can give is 8.",No Time to Die

Also, the entire second act was very boring; existing just to spout exposition about the same plot points over and over.Bond's relationship with Madeline and his daughter felt underbaked and unearned.

Ladies (& gents) will be happy to know DC spends a respectable amount of time with his shirt off, and oddly enough in suspenders, not at the same time... sorry ladies (& gents).

643,georgetay-98507,No Time To Die: A fitting send off...,8,11 October 2021,"Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond has has been a mixed bag of quality, but personally I've found them all to be enjoyable. But none of the sequels ever reached the point of Casino Royale. I'm pleased to say that No Time To Die is easily the best Bond film since Casino Royale!This film blends the cheesiness of classic Bond with the more grounded, gritty modern take on Bond perfectly. Much better than Spectre did. Some of the humour in here was pretty good and very well timed. I also think this film has the best action sequences of the franchise, where there are some genuine stakes.Daniel Craig turns in an impeccable final performance as Bond. I'd say it's his best as the character. He shows great range and emotion that we haven't seen since Casino Royale. He is also fantastic in the fight scenes. He truly put it all on the line in this final outing.The supporting cast are all great too. Especially Ana de Armas as Paloma who leaves a lasting impression with her little amount of screen time; and Léa Seydoux as Madeline Swann gets much more to do this time around and is fantastic, especially in the more emotional scenes. Also Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter was good to see again.Lashana Lynch as Nomi/007 was good with what she was given. She was awesome in the action scenes but wasn't given too much character work so I didn't care too much about her. I quite enjoyed her rivalry with Bond though.Rami Malek as Lyutsifer Safin was fine as the villain. He had some particularly good scenes at the beginning and towards the end but he did feel a bit lacklustre.The film was amazingly directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (of True Detective fame) does have a fairly distinct and visceral feel to it. The cinematographer also deserves credit for how good the film looks; Linus Sandgren (DP of La La Land) does excellently and composes some beautiful scenes. The pacing does slow a little too much during the second act though. I feel the film could have been trimmed down to the 2h 30m mark and would have flowed a bit better.The opening credits are second only to Casino Royale. I really liked them. They were simple but effective. Billie Eilish's ""No Time To Die"" was a great song that fit the film perfectly. The film had an awesome score by Hans Zimmer too.Overall, I loved No Time To Die! It was the perfect send off to Daniel Craig as James Bond; a character we've gotten to know over 15 years. And over that time we got to see the character develop from an arrogant newbie to a seasoned veteran, sure of himself but still afraid to open up and motivated to do the right thing. Daniel Craig was incredible as 007 and will go down as one of, if not the best James Bond. And No Time To Die was a fitting and worthy send off for the character.",No Time to Die

Have Matilda take the mantle of Bond only to discover she's actually a Russian sleeper agent?This one goes down with You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service (which is alluded to multiple times throughout the film) as a major misstep in the franchise.

651,iansyard,Time For You To Die Mr Bond...For Good.,5,3 October 2021,"I am struggling with my rating on this film and have settled uneasily with 5 out of 10 where that number would likely fall lower of the passing of time the more I think about this uneven film. I'll say the 5 stars is purely aimed at the cinematography, the competent action scenes and the music but it's definitely not one of Hans Zimmer's best film scores by a long shot. That's the good. The middle ground is Daniel Craig's performance which is the usual gritty world weary 00 agent but this time round and with Craig's say so and blessing, it's now hampered with mannerisms and behaviour that's so unlike classic Bond that we've come to expect that it's jarring to the point of distraction. And now the bad - for my own sanity and to keep this review measured and manageable for anyone wishing to read, I'll keep it on the short side. The director, the multiple array of writers including the ultra feminist Phoebe Waller Bridge, the old producer team and owners of decades of Bond films under their belt Barbara Brocolli and Michael G Wilson and Craig himself all pushed for James Bond 007 to be flipped over and inserted into what we now know of the #METOO movement and Bond must be shown to reflect that change. What we get is put simply a character assassination that's been honed and created from past Bond actors going all the way back to the legendary Sean Connery. This version of Bond just doesn't work as Bond. If it was a generic action spy film with Jason Statham then it's fine, but this is James Bond and he's now saddled with life choices unbeknown to him initially and it's meant to just cuck him and reduce him to an ordinary man caught up in global drama he didn't sign up for. The baddies portrayed by the great Christoph Waltz and recent Oscar winner Rami Malek are shockingly poor with nothing to do but give pointless monologues to Bond. The women with this film obviously celebrates with ultra female empowerment are a mixed bag. For me Lea Seydoux who plays Madeline is competent enough with equal moments of damsel in peril to be saved and stand and fight to protect. Ana de Armas as the Cuban super spy ""Paloma"" was pretty much ridiculous going from gawky nervous operative to John Wick within five minutes dispatching multiple baddies with aplomb while Bond struggles just to beat one baddie. Then there's the worst character of the film in the dumpy shape of Lashana Lynch's ""Nomi"" or as the script directs everyone to tell her every 10 minutes she walks on ""Hello 007"", or ""don't you know I'm 007 now"" with alarming regularity. I feel after the run of Craig's Bond films, it was a mistake to keep up this ""Vespa Lynd/Mr White"" narrative since 2006, a very long time ago instead of giving Bond episodic adventures like the old ones used to do, thus making them memorable and highlighted as one can tell a classic scene from Moonraker, another from Goldfinger and one from Goldeneye. These Craig Bond films are very much the same squashed up mess with only Casino Royale being a superb film and Skyfall following suit but for me to a lesser extent. It started so well in 2006 and hit the highest of heights in 2012, then the rot set in badly with confusing complex directions for it's own good and directors signing up then leaving with not believing in the plotting of this Bond narrative. Director Danny Boyle who was originally signed on to film the 25th Bond film, then quit knowing way back then this was the Bond film the producers wanted to make and as a diehard Bond fan Boyle couldn't do it to the iconic character. The film is just too long clearly trying to copy the final film in the series like Avengers Endgame (2019) and Star Wars TROS (2019) both being exceedingly long in runtime. These 163 minutes hurts this film as much as all the other nonsense going on, they should've cut 30 minutes off easy as I can imagine a random cinemagoer not up with the plotting of Craig's Bond narrative will be lost in the dialogue, it's been six years since Spectre and the filmmakers are forcing you to watch that old film just to refresh up for this even poorer film. Not going to happen and as it goes I actually liked Spectre on some levels. But No Time To Die will have many people that like it that's for sure, they just won't be True and old James Bond 007 fans like myself that wanted fun over social commentary and political study.",No Time to Die
652,mylkione,"The 21st Century Bond, Finally",8,11 October 2021,"No Time to Die is the most complete narrative in the franchise, but it is absolutely not for everyone. Though it's not a lecture on post-modernism or various feminisms (yes, there are more than one), gender construction informs the story to a large extent. Finally, the franchise moves into the 21st century. Because franchise movies are fundamentally high-concept, and this one is specifically low-concept, people will not like it. But we've never had a Bond story so completely decided by the characters in the film. This film also sees overt reflections on the role fanbases have in determining the course of the product. A few lines spoken in the film seem transcribed off the twitter vitriol in response to casting a Black woman as 007.Unlike Star Wars, this film entertains social media and cultural concepts, but maintains a good balance between context and creation. We never get direct treatments or allusions on me too, or identity politics, but the characters embody the problems these social movements explicate. Bond isn't a spent sexual force, he simply recognizes not everything is sexual (it isn't). Just as it would be common sense not to use a rotary phone, the character's atavistic (and criminal) treatment of women should be seen as equally useless. So don't look for that Bond, because if you are, maybe you should ask yourself how unhealthy your relationships might be in real life (?).",No Time to Die

She also has zero chemistry with Craig.Another actress who has zero chemistry with Craig is Lea Seydoux, which is a problem as the producers are trying to create an epic romance like those between George Lazenby and Diane Rigg or Timothy Dalton and Maryam d'abo.Rami Malek is wasted as the villain. It probably says a lot about the impact he made that I've already forgotten his characters name.The only character who makes an impression is Paloma played by Ana de Armas.

Are you telling me that after moving mountains to save your daughter and wife, you aren't going to grasp at any plausible possibility to safely stay with them? C'mon!I hope that there's an alternate cut of the film where this scenario or something similar happens.And yes, Ana de Armas is phenomenal! Her background of having only three weeks of combat training is clearly BS though, LOL. I don't know why she says that other than being a bit of a troll.

662,IsThatJoseph21,The 3rd best Daniel Craig movie,7,1 October 2021,"No Time to Die is not as good as Casino Royale and Skyfall, but it's definitely better than Quantum of Solace and Spectre. It's a decent conclusion to a decent run of Bond movies.The best part of the movie for me was easily the Cuba scenes. It felt like a classic Bond adventure with exotic locations, likeable allies, and fun action scenes. Speaking of action, I thought the action here was well-done. Some of the highlights were the Italy attack, the Cuba shootout, the forest battle, and that one-shot staircase fight.I also liked Daniel Craig's performance here. Throughout the series, he did a great job at making me care for James Bond. While I'm talking about Daniel Craig, it's time to address the elephant in the room: the death scene. What did I think about James Bond dying? Honestly, I didn't mind it. I thought it provided a great send-off for Daniel Craig. I just hope the studios don't change their mind and decide to bring him back. That would completely ruin No Time to Die's ending. Just hire a new Bond actor already.Now that I got the positives out of the way, it's time to get into the negatives. My biggest issue with the Daniel Craig movies in general is that the overall storyline felt poorly planned out. I didn't mind that the Daniel Craig movies told a unified story rather than be episodic adventures. However, I feel like they should've had an outline for the series from the start.Another aspect I didn't like were the characters of Madeleine and Safin. With Madeline, I found her boring in Spectre and I still find her boring in No Time to Die. One nitpick I had with her character is that at the end of the movie, she brings her daughter to Italy to talk about her father. Why would she bring her daughter to the place Bond broke up with her? That makes no sense.As for Safin, I thought his backstory was underwhelming. I feel like Safin would've been more interesting if it was revealed that he used to be Madeleine's old lover. I know the Bond girl having a romance with the villain was done before in The World is Not Enough, but I'd rather have that than what we have here.Overall, No Time to Die was a decent conclusion to the Daniel Craig series. While the movie had a great Bond performance and good action, the characters of Madeleine and Safin brought down my enjoyment. I give No Time to Die a 7/10.",No Time to Die
663,bobwelsh-34133,Confusing,5,17 October 2021,I noticed at the beginning that there were 3 writers to this bag of bones. Pity they never had a meeting? More villains that you could throw a stick at and a plot more confusing than a Rubik cube.,No Time to Die
664,Dan_Finn,A film of two halves,7,9 October 2021,"This is by no means a bad film. The problem for me was that the first half was up there with the best of bond movies, the second half while a decent movie was not really what I would consider to be a bond film.The first half had the exotic locations, cool cars, exceptional stunts and action, a low humming of bond music excellently mixed into the scenes. The scene at the spectre ""party"" in particular with the addition of Ana De Armas was stellar bond action with swagger, humour, and pizazz. It lead onto a fine sequence on the boat with the fantastic character of Felix Lighter and at the end of that sequence, I felt the film gave the promise of bond on a mission of vengeance and I was really anticipating the remainder of the film.Unfortunately the film then becomes something else, almost lazy, like written by someone who hadn't watched a bond film before. Malik for example, we know he can act but his character as the main villain had no depth to it, it was poor character development for any film never mind a bond. The film never bothered to explain who he was targeting or why he was actually trying to commit genocide - from what I could gather he had already achieved his goal an hour into the film. The villains lair - acid water, poison garden - we are told they are harvesting for the biological weapon but how does that harvest nanobots (let's just stick some acid water in for no reason)?The finale, oh the finale. Well I'm just baffled to be honest, *Malik* he has the girl hostage and then just lets her go. He wants to let bond go, then he wants to kill bond, he then wants bond to suffer by not being able to go near his loved ones. He's selling the weapon to other ""baddies"" but he's about to wipe out half the world with a virus that is contagious from his missile silo, so why would he be bothering to sell it? Or are there no missiles and he plans on selling it to spread it, in which case why don't they just blow the boats up instead of the base? The action is decent but there's no big over the top action sequence where the audience clap or the John Barry bond theme smacks you in the face, despite having been teased with this for nearly two and half hours - where's the finale you expect when you go to see a bond movie? Then what? Bond for all intents and purposes gives up and martyrs himself in a rather glum, depressing, and out of character end to his run.Another few niggling issues I have:The new 007 character is a black female - does that matter? No absolutely not and why shouldn't there be a black female 00 agent? But what was the point of the character when we already had a much better agent in the film that got far too little screen time, other than to squeeze in a way to tick boxes? Ultimately it did her a disservice because there was no real screen time or character development (why not involve her in the off road car chase scene instead of just turning up to give bond a lift for example). Other characters that were done a disservice - M and Blofeld. Why would you waste Christopher Waltz like that?The kid - yeah she's supposed to be an integral part of the plot but the kid was given too much actual acting time. Bond and kids don't mix.Q's ugly cat - creepy.Bad guys all must have a facial disfigurement - use some imagination guys!Lastly - I love an Aston Martin but how many do you need to see conveniently popping up in one movie?",No Time to Die
665,gaelcerda-35225,"7.7 seems too overrated, this was a huge let down.",3,5 October 2021,"Oh boy, Daniel Craig in his final role as James Bond. I gotta admit I was pumped about this movie, being a fan of the previous James Bond movies with Daniel Craig, I expected this to be a satisfying conclusion. This was a huge let down, after months of anticipation I finally went to a pre screening. The action is amazing don't get me wrong, but Daniel Craig seems to have lost his edge with the franchise. And MGM only keeps the worst of the bond actresses, this new bond actress was terrible, she and Craig have absolutely no good chemistry, they were much better off taking the Bond girl out of the story. The story seems to be somewhat understandable but questionable, some scenes in the movie contain plot holes that don't make sense and to make the movie almost 3 hours is ridiculous. Acting is good, direction is great, action is amazing, but the chemistry and script need some work. Hence why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's a mediocre movie, just not at the ladder of the previous 4 bond films with Craig.",No Time to Die

In fact it tries very hard to hit you over the head with the good old new-devious-superweapon and unnecessary convoluted past friends/foe drama. The latter is exhausting !

And those who gave it 1*, one of the worst films ever? I have never seen a worse movie. These people are at both ends of the ""review moron"" spectrum... where as I myself am in just the upper echelon of the moron scale when comes to reviewers and I have given this 2020's Bond outing (no pun intended) a solid 7*.For those who resist maturing and are still stuck in the 80's and 90's with there ability to accept times have changed? I pity you... and your families. Yes... times have changed and movies along with them... why can't you? Race, colour, sexuality, etc. In the 2020's, should have no relevance in you deciding whether a Bond movie is good or bad. Is the acting solid? Is there enough action? Are the character arcs complete and relevant?We have never witnessed a threat of death to the James Bond character before... we always knew he would escape and disappear into the sunset with his leading lady... we'll this is different. Get over it! It still harks back to the originals with threats to the global population and a chief baddy... and that was always great about these movies ""mano et mano"" worked, don't break that.I personally really liked the ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" references and the way it flipped the story in the ending, was perfect. It's a solid Bond movie that has moved on and I liked that. Bond movies should never be the 10 out of 10's to us because... well they just can't. They are simply here for us as a poignant effort to keep a movie tradition and literary folk hero alive and not to win ""Best Picture"" Oscars.",No Time to Die
671,sebastiannagra,A mediocre finisher.,6,15 October 2021,"65/100This marks the third Bond film I've seen, the other two being Casino Royale (2006), and Spectre, and if there's one thing to say about this franchise, it's that it really does just follow the same formula time and time again.My main gripe with this film was the story. For what is practically the James Bond finale, it felt disappointingly mediocre and unmemorable. Story points didn't only blend together, but also felt relatively uninspired and unchallenging, with there being only two or three memorable scenes throughout the close to three hour runtime. It was just a regular layout of action, then a mild progression of the story, then more action, and so on. The action, stunts, and visuals seemed relatively unstylized, lacking any kind of flair, leaving me unimpressed. It wasn't bad, it was just.... ""eh"".Again, for what is practically the James Bond finale, the villain felt mediocre and unmemorable. There was no deeper backstory nor conflict, the nefarious plot was just Kingsman all over again, and the motivation for his evilness was... what exactly? I still don't really know. I didn't feel intimidated nor impressed by him.The surrounding cast was equally unengaging. Lashana Lynch's character had no depth nor charisma, feeling very much like a hollow replacement option for Daniel Craig. I had no clue who Jeffrey Wright's character, Felix Leighter, was. I had no real interest in anyone outside of Craig himself, and even then, that was solely because he was the ""good guy"".I could go on, but it's the same for every aspect of the film. Relatively flat and mediocre for what it is. It's a fine film, there are some enjoyable moments, and it didn't really do anything bad. I'm just kinda disappointed.",No Time to Die

673,jtq-56435,A Competent Send-Off For The Best Bond,7,19 October 2021,"Look I think its a good movie, but it feels far too long, the best scenes and sets are short and not given enough time imo, and the villain unfortunately is SUPER weak and cliche. Daniel Craig gives a great performance and the subplot with him and his love played by Lea Seydoux is done well.. but what about the other characters? The new ""007"" played by Lashana Lynch is nothing more than a throwaway character for most of the movie despite her being pretty entertaining in the scenes she is in and possibly worthy of having a spin-off series if they aren't going to make her the true new 007 for the next movies, M played by Ralph Fiennes really isn't as involved as he should be in my opinion for a true send off to the hero spy James Bond. I also want to talk about the potential for making the final villain James's equal, because there is a character in this movie that claims to be a ""big fan"" of James and they go absolutely nowhere with that potential reveal and how he could have been a worthy final villain and make the payoff that much better.. but with the direction they went here, I thought it was executed competently as a send-off for James. I want to quickly shout out Ana De Armas as well, she was PHENOMENAL in this movie and I wish she was utilized more than she was. I give it a final score of 7.5 out of 10, it's a fun time at the theater and that's really all you can ask for with movies like this.",No Time to Die

There are some of the classic Bond touches: proper gadgets, a villain with a proper lair and so many lovely little call backs to the previous movies.

683,rossjackson2,No Mr Bond I expect you to live!,6,7 October 2021,I honestly don't know where to start with this review. As a Bond fan I'm just so disappointed with the ending. They've basically ruined what was actually an OK Bond movie with that ending and ripped away one of the key things about the character - Bond always gets out of trouble no matter what. Ok so I know it's just a movie but it's like producers these days don't care that we have invested years in these characters and have grown to love them since our childhood (don't get me started on Luke Skywalker!). James Bond will return - eh how? Are they just going to do another full reset and get rid of all the cast as that's the only way I can think of that they can do it? I don't understand why they couldn't just have had an ambiguous ending with us left not knowing if Bond was alive or dead - didn't need to see the missiles raining down on him!For a film of this length (definitely too long) there's not enough action though the action we do get is excellent. Not enough gadgets either! And Rami Malek's villain is just dull - a shame for such a good actor. I lost track of what his grand scheme was to be honest as I couldn't care less by the point he finally reappeared on screen. Ana de Armas is probably the stand out in the whole film - she lights up the screen and brings some much needed fun to proceedings. Shame she's so underused.I came out of the cinema with that same hollow feeling I had after seeing The Last Jedi. And like that film I won't be in a hurry to watch this Bond again.,No Time to Die

691,Ali_Bayati,Totally recommend it!,9,14 October 2021,"Before writing any reviews about this movie, I need to clarify that I was among one of those people who assumed Daniel Craig was not charismatic enough to cast as 007. However, by now I am definitely convinced that he was the smartest choice.Unlike the previous movie ""Spectre"" which ended up vitiating the stereotype of a murdering agent, I found the ending of ""No time to die"" completely reasonable and logical according to James Bond's strong character. First of all, the theme song could not be worse! I mean, I understand that they need to use so-called popular singers with zero quality but when we look at the earlier James Bond franchises, much better bands and musicians such as a-ha were involved. However, the positive side of the script was the amusing gun-shot scenes which were obviously more than the preceding movies with some humorous dialogues once in a while.The script writers, in my opinion, did such an accurate prediction of how James Bond would react to a certain type of situation that even when the reaction was judgmental and irrational, still the respond would seem logical enough, albeit the absurdity. In other words, the mistakes he made were totally understandable. On the other hand, I could not thoroughly comprehend some of the villain's behaviors and he was less scoundrel than the other memorable antagonists.After watching all five movies of Daniel Craig's James Bond, I am pretty sure that these movies are going to be one of my all-time favorites for years to come, especially ""No time to die"" would be one of those movies which has the capacity to change my mood when I am feeling low. Therefore, if you enjoyed Daniel Craig's James Bond movies so far, the chances are you will definitely be pleased with ""No time to die"" and if not, just go ahead and give it a try, you won't regret it!",No Time to Die

That's one hell of a creative decision. It's the end of Daniel Craig's tenure as Bond, not the whole franchise surely, as I just don't see how it's possible to continue from here.

A story doesn't have to be realistic, but it should have some kind of plot logic for the characters.The only thing that made the film score a bit were the action sequences in Italy, Cuba and the Russian Bunker Island.In conclusion, it remains to be said that Craig as Bond started strong with ""Casino Royal"", but couldn't really tie in with any of the other films. That his last Bond film is so bad, however, is not his main fault, but the many cooks who spoiled the broth.

We've got to take it easy this time, he's in love after all, for real... And apparently has a bad knee to boot. The plot of this film need a retirement as well: A madman with a grudge, and a high-tech virus... It's all very familiar (The Rock, and Mission Impossible come to mind). My wife liked the film, and I suppose she's got some reasons, a female 007? (And other important ladies I won't bring up, to prevent spoilers). All in all, it's average fare we've seen before, and it's been done better. The worst offense, is that instead of going out with a bang, Bond is retired with a whimper, and the whole thing felt like everyone involved was ready to quit.

700,allanjiang,"Lacking the ""feel and spirit"" of James Bond but nevertheless an emotional closure.",7,12 October 2021,"Here's what I mean. No Time to Die is a good ending of the Daniel Craig era, but the film feels more like a general spy film than a James Bond film. Out of Craig's films, I would still place it 2nd or 3rd after Casino Royale of course, and possibly before or after Skyfall. I understand why this film feels this way though, it's to achieve closure for all the characters, not just 007, which means a story focused more around all the characters and not just him. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something needed to close out this set of Bond films.The cinematography was absolutely perfect. Fukunaga has created one of the most beautiful bond films. The shots from this film are to die for. Clean and crisp is how I'd describe it. The pacing of the film however is slow, the first hour was slow, almost nearing boring. Still, somehow, the film leaves you feeling that you didn't sit there for 2 hours and a half.I was really disappointed by Ana de Armas' short appearance in the film, I thought her fight scene was one of the best in the film and was hoping for more. Her character should've had a larger role int he film. The new 007, Nomi, needs some stronger character development, I understand that she isn't James Bond, but a 007 without a story is disappointing. I loved the few jokes that you do get from Craig, but there could be more. It felt like I was waiting and searching for them while I was watching instead of them just being delivered at the perfect time.Great soundtrack throughout the film, Hans Zimmer never disappoints.A strong and emotional ending for this Bond. Daniel Craig has carried this series into the 21st century perfectly. Don't watch this film for the reviews, or the cinematography, Watch it to say goodbye to this 007.",No Time to Die
701,yellowgixxer750,A fitting swansong for a great Bond,9,7 October 2021,"So I'll admit it - I didn't like Daniel Craig as Bond when he was announced. He's too big, too conspicuous, too memorable to be convincing, I thought.Then I saw Casino Royale and realised that I was mistaken - he may not look right but the character he played was *exactly* right.So fast forward to 2021 and No Time to Die. Bit of a rubbish title and the theme was, um, yeah. It really is the last Daniel Craig Bond, and with Spectre (and, crucially, Skyfall) it had very big shoes to fill. Very big indeed.As a man of a certain age I very much appreciated the musical and dialogue nods to OHMSS, which also sets the viewer on a completely wrong track as to the fate of one of the stars . (Trying not to put too many spoilers but I've set the flag anyway).It did take a while to get going, sort of. But only sort of - there was some truly excellent scene setting which added to the film immensely. And, of course, when it did get going...it really did get going.If I were to be completely honest, I suppose the film is a bit PC. But the world moves on. What was seen as acceptable for behaviour for Bond the hero in the 60s or 70s would have been utterly unreasonable by the 90s, even before MeToo. And that's OK - they were films of the time and so are the later ones. I'm not terribly PC but I didn't have a problem with Bond not being an arse/borderline sex pest. Nor do I have a problem with female characters being more than window (un)dressing. But if you're looking for a traditional old-school Bond flick...this isn't it.There is humour. It's a bit more subtle than in earlier films, but it's there. There are beautiful women. There are gadgets. There are car chases, fights and sinister villains. The cinematography is breathtaking. And, and this is where Daniel Craig's Bond differs from most of the other films, there is a complex, nuanced plot. These are all Good Things.The baddy wasn't especially impressive, but then again does he need to be? He was brutally, ruthlessly effective and didn't do histrionics. Like another reviewer, I don't quite understand why he wouldn't complete his perfectly reasonable goal and then vanish back into obscurity - he clearly didn't need the cash. But that's OK I guess. Bond villains can just be a bit unhinged and it's still true to form.It's long. But not too long, and for me it didn't drag.The end is not what I expected. Not at all. I'll leave it at that. Though (Spoiler) again like another reviewer commented, why couldn't he solve his problem with the EMP watch?Overall it was a cracking good film which I enjoyed a lot. Not the best ever but, strangely, probably the most believable. Oh, and no helicopters doing impossible things (which as a helicopter pilot took the edge off Skyfall for me)...",No Time to Die
702,ehughes75,Wish I liked it more,1,10 November 2021,"I really liked the movie until the last 30 minutes or so. Our main ""bad guy"" was dispatched with relative ease and they underestimated, in my opinion, how much we did not want to see The James Bond that we know and love, get blown to pieces.They easily could have had him go into retirement, enjoy his family, and the next actor could have taken over, and actually leave me at the end of this movie feeling good instead of being irritated that I spent money to watch it.",No Time to Die
703,gianlucapiras,Great thrilling action movie with a few weaknesses,10,5 October 2021,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is great overall, but you have to admit a few weaknesses (don't wanna spoil here). But it's everything and more you expect from a 007 movie - great Action, beautiful cinematography, decent acting (fantastic performances by craig, Lea seydoux and Ana de armas especially), a few weaknesses regarding the story but overall it's still entertaining and thrilling over the full lengt of 2 hours and 43 mins. Overall, fukunaga pulled a really great movie of, no as fantastic as the masterful Casino Royale, but for me about the same level as Skyfall... so go and see Daniel Craig's last bond movie in cinema, it's definitely worth to be watched in a cinema, the movie's great.",No Time to Die
704,Terrifying_Tigerfish,Best 'Bond' Film of the Craig Era,9,14 October 2021,"Preface/Summary: if you're looking for this film to top 'Casino Royale,' you'll end up disappointed. However, more so than Casino, this is the epitome of a Bond film: gorgeous women, insane action sequences, wild technology and gadgets, stunning locations, and (the one piece of the pie that Craig added) a Bond with a darkness brewing inside of him. And how about this: to me, the fact that they violently eviscerated (note, this was not a death like Felix's) Bond, truly blew him to bits, was everything that I was hoping for: he had been longing for death since Casino Royale, and he's a brutal killer-at least he went out having achieved what he had sought after since we first met him: compassionate connection. Was the villian as good as LeChiffre? No. Does the plot suffer from the 'Save the World' syndrome? Yes. But, this was a beautiful way to end Daniel Craig's tenure as Bond-this was a film (arguably more so than Craig's first film) that nailed the Bond formula.Villian/weakest part of film: Rami Malek nails this villianous role; there's something about his eyes and/or face (I can't describe it well) that's so strangely captivating. But, the weakest part of the film comes from trying to tie Madeline to Blofeld to Saffin to James. The team tried to make the story personal (via Madelina for James), but it didn't feel right (obviously, the best example of this is Le Chiffre torturing Vesper). But, it still hit some emotional notes well, and if you take the time to think about Saffin and his connection to Spectre, you're more rewarded than what's strictly shown on screen (in all fairness, Saffin could have used at least 1 hr for some background/buildup-but that time's unrealistic). What's frustrating is that the corrupt scientist underpinning the whole operation/poison garden dwelling/Malek's scarred face are all ingredients that could have made this something special. Especially, given that the weapon (Hericles) was made under the British government's supervision (ie the story could have introduced some morally ambiguous decisions for Bond to make). Either way, the ""scenery"" of Malek's character is wonderful, demonic, delusional-in essence, he's a traditional Bond villian.Action: some of the coolest action sets I've seen in awhile; they could have been boring/too over the top, but Fukanaga is a master (the prevalent one-takes in this film are a fantastic, immersive addition)-and this was tremendous action. Highlights are: every action scene :). I'll have to rethink this one and edit; I was particularly blown away by the opener before Eilish's wonderful song.Supporting characters: I was really enamored with the Bond girls in this one. The new 007, Ana de Armas' character, MoneyPenny-most scenes with Madeline were poignant and riveting. Leiter's death was too underwhelming for the significance the character plays, but I think that James' death makes up for their misplay/mishandling of the emotional heft of Felix's death. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw were fantastic. Nonetheless though, this was really Bond's show. He was completely and entirely the focus.Crying factor: I cried when Madeline and James talked for the last time. I did. They nailed this scene. Maybe I was thinking of some of my own memories (or some of my hopes for old flames), but the tension/love between these two was handled well. Separated for 5 years based upon misinformation-separated but constantly thinking about each other (Madeline for obvious reasons-aka her kid). Seeing each other for the first time and having to resolve that massive time lapse. Either way, I thought this romance was touching.Overall, this was everything Spectre wanted to be: a poignant yet over-the-top wild action packed ride worthy of the Bond designation. Great job!",No Time to Die
705,Omegamon-Alter-S,"So Long, James Bond.",10,28 October 2021,"Thomas Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. 007s, or exactly, James Bonds, are legendary for all man who love movies. I have seen 15 series of Bond ('Dr. No', 'From Russia with Love', 'Goldfinger', 'You Only Live Twice', 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', 'Moonraker', 'For Your Eyes Only', 'Octopussy', 'GoldenEye', 'Tomorrow Never Dies', 'Die Another Day', 'Quantum of Solace', 'Skyfall', 'Spectre' and 'No Time to Die'). So I think I am qualified to express some feelings about this historical movie for James Bond.Daniel Craig's Bond was very tangled. For one aspect, he was tough and invincible in some screens. But in some parts, he was weak and real as an ordinary man. The scriptwriters were too careful to write an agent with artistic image for not to let people down but putting authenticity in this character also to shut the critics up. So we could see a hero with some dissociation. Bourne series and Mission Impossible series are responsible for this kind of 'evolution'.But 007 was not just like this, he was a man with fancy cars and beauties for no reason. That's why we liked him for the first moment and that's the reason for all teenagers buying tickets to enter the theaters. They just wanted to have a dream with no logic.So when Daniel Craig died in the ending, I was relieved with and for him and I think most audiences would have this same feeling too.We saw the next 007 in this movie, an African female 007. With no offence, I am just dejected that we might not be able to see Bond girls in the unborn 007 stories in the future. But the saddest point was that we could not see James Bond in 007 again.By the way, Bonds' soundtracks are classic also. My personal preferences are 'No Time To Die', 'Writing's On The Wall', 'Skyfall', 'Die Another Day', 'You Know My Name', 'Goldeneye', 'James Bound Theme', 'Tomorrow Never Dies', 'The World Is Not Enough' and 'Live And Let Die'.",No Time to Die
706,eborrego,What happened?,1,21 October 2021,"What did Phoebe Waller-Bridge do to the James Bond franchise? I grew up loving the fun craziness of James Bond movies - an intrepid hero, femme fatales, super villains, amazing action scenes - while knowing that in the end Bond would find a way to beat the villain and get the girl.

707,paul-3991,Very Well written story for the situation and acting was Great !,10,9 October 2021,"For me this was one of my favorite James Bond story lines. Expertly written, very well acted and a movie I loved.Bottom line and basic for every 007 story.... up until this one: Bond always has to save the world and risk his life to do it.This movie likewise is another example of this ever occurring 007 situation, but it presents this in its best and fullest,
(I feel many previous Bond movies were not as successful at doing this by comparison.)Also Great Villain! (Great acting RM!) People can always find things they would change or improve in a movie. Hindsight is often 20/20...
And in movies, nothing is really a ""10"" because there will always be a better story, better effects, filming and even acting.That is why we always want to see the next movie and experience more!But at this point in time, this is as good as it gets and as close to a 10 as I can expect!

710,josecarmona,What a disappointment...,4,4 October 2021,"So, just got out of the theatre and I can't remember feeling this dissatisfied after watching a film...As an action movie, is below average. All the action sequences are in the trailer. Nothing new to get excited in this 3-hours.Ana de Armas, stunning, but her role was a massive promise in the movie, and is just a sequence, in ""her natal Cuba"" (well, it was so obvious that was filmed in a set...). Some forced humour that doesn't deliver and it was obvious that Craig asked her to join to build a name as an actress. That sequence was a waste of time.Lynch's character was useless. Didn't help at all in any mission. The gag of she being 007 was a massive waste of time and her character was neither funny or useful.The kid, oh my! Why did we needed to add a kid to the sentimentalism?Rami Malek; what a waste of an actor in one of the worst Bond villains of the last 20 years. Uni dimensional, with a very random plan, without an actual motif.Waltz, another waste. They had 2 magnificent actors as villains and were so wasted I couldn't believe my eyes (no pun intended!)The Russian biologist, they should've killed him since the first appearance... why they were trying to keep him alive? And then all of the sudden Nomi kills him. Whaaat? Waste of time. Very terrible attempt for humour.The classic characters: M, Q, Moneypenny... lack of chemistry with Bond. M doing stupid decisions (being a drunk?!) Moneypenny beyond secondary. Q was the least bad; boy do I miss Bond having gadgets!Leiter's death, unnecessary. Just to close the Craig cycle.Ash, since the beginning it was obvious there was something dodgy.And the ending. Why killing Bond? Why?One of the best aspects of Bond films was that it was a light hearted action movie that left you with a good after taste.At the end of the credits it said ""James Bond will return"" as every other Bond movie. It'll be interesting to see how they solve this mess.At least it was ""James Bond will return"" and not ""007"", so hopefully the woke mob won't win this one and we will see Hardy, Elba or Cavill.Hopefully it won't be long to get classic Bond: Good action, gadgets, humour, Aston Martins and good tailoring.",No Time to Die

3- back to this movie, its just too long for a cinema but I really liked it
4- still have no idea what the cunning plan to destroy the world ""Heracles"" was but I did think it had slightly racist undertoneI enjoyed it and loved that I knew the twist before most but I am trying to think today about the movie and sadly a lot is instantly forgettable.Was a little too self-indulgent for me and the alternate 007 seemed too forced but I did like the actress as she was pretty coolBut this is a must see and you will enjoy it for sure.",No Time to Die

I love Craig, I grew to love his Bond. But this felt like a let's wrap the series kind of movie to me. I just don't know where the franchise goes from here except to a new 007 (not that chick please), and make these the further adventures of 007 and not James Bond. But then it's not really the same, is it? Next Generation movies weren't the same as Capt Kirk movies, they were just fundamentally different. So much so they had to go back to the Kirk model for the reboot. MUCH harder to do here esp when they killed off Blo and Felix; that's a whole other thing, killing Felix and James? No. Didn't love that.All in all it was good. It was too long, but it was good. Not great. Rami malek? Not needed at all, wanted more blofeld. What a shame.",No Time to Die

I think Cary Joji Fukunaga's risk paid off.Hats off to Linus Sandgren for the beautiful cinematography, which could easily rival Skyfalls. Hans Zimmer typically delivers a masterful score. One of the downsides to the movie I thought was the very little screen time Ana De Armas' Paloma had...her chemistry with Craig was entertaining at times.The ending seems to have disappointed a lot of Bond fans but I don't think it's as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

The long wait is over but if you are a purist Bond fan then prepare yourself for the ultimate disappointment.. The biggest shame of all is that the movie has a fantastic 25min pre-credit sequence that not only sets up a story with a lot of promise but gives us some incredible action and also performances that set a brilliant tone for a movie that completely forgets this set-up after the opening credits have rolled.Every character in this movie is extremely well performed with 'much to do,' and that was a treat to behold.. but.. after the opening credits, the story makes the inevitable decline down the Purvis and Wade track to deliver something weak and almost uninteresting... As usual the writers have commited mortal sins by throwing in objects and vehicles from Bond's past to patronize the audience once again in a pathetic attempt to affirm to us that we are in fact watching a Bond film.. most notably Daniel Craig entering a scene in Timothy Dalton's Aston Martin for approximately 10 seconds of screen time..and Hans Zimmer throwing in both the main theme and love theme from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service.'Then we have the quick succesion of deaths and eliminations from Felix Lighter to the entire Spectre organisation and then Blofeld himself..all done in the blinking of an eye and the first major warning sign that the 'company' are quickly establishing the horrible foundation for the direction this movie will ultimately take...After some back and fourth bickering between Bond and the temporarily instated 007 'Nomi' over who has office superiority inside MI6 we finally move onto the movie's villain by which time (1hr 45min approx) as audience members we've almost forgotten he exists and struggle to have a vested interest in his cause and plan for world destruction. A very weak villain who's cause is completely uninteresting to the point where we don't even care why his skin is so damaged...something they never bother to give a reason for anyway!!!!And now we're into the final act... Bond and Nomi infiltrate his sub-standard lair, shoot a bunch of guards whilst making their way to the villains quarters where Bond stops for a quick and predictable conflab with Rami Malek whilst Nomi gets the hell out of there before the Royal Navy destroy the whole mountain with cluster bombs, all watched by Bond who takes a few of them directly in the face thus ending 60 yrs of a classic and cinematic icon and leaving his love interest (now a single mother) with his five year old son..It's obvious that the film makers wanted to end Craig's era but in doing so they've destroyed the man..James Bond himself.. we witness James Bond die on screen..that's it..over.. 60yrs finished... and then they have the cheek to write 'James Bond will Return' on the end credits... errrmm how? By magic? Did he have a secret forcefield device that shields him from the full blast of a cluster bomb in the head?...such a mess and such a disappointment for the purist James Bond fans across the planet.... sigh.",No Time to Die

They tried to give him some but just like the premise, it felt forced and highly unlikely to justify such lofty plans for the finale.

What were you thinking?(1) The movie is good only for the first hour max.(2) After that, the movie turns out melodramatic.(3) Acting is not convincing, especially when it comes to the Bond family issues.(4) Plot is not strong; it ""culminates"" to a very cheap death, accompanied with the producers' wish to lift up the franchise.(5) No bonding to Bond! The hero dies and you (a JB core fan for so many years like myself) don't give a damn. That is pretty bad.Well, some friends reminded the awful GameOfThrones ending and that put a smile on my lips.

The film felt like it was made just to prepare us for a future of female Bond movies. And Bond never dies. Yet, they kill him off in this movie. It's all very forced and contrived.

the gutless cat was sent upstairs before Bon's entered the house, the cat was in the kitchen before Bond came, after it went up, the cat was still in the kitchenwhen they sent the girl to bed, the sunset felt fake, no shadow moved, the same horizontal light went through the windows for the entire time, it was lovely for the first scene, but when the same light is at the beginning of the scene until the end you realise it is a lamp in a studiocolor grading missing from many scenes, it could had been filmed with a phone, and not for a big budget filmthe smoke of the missiles when initially launched from the boat looked very cheap and fakeHans Zimmer is a great composer that I admire. I watched him on MasterClass. I feel that bringing him at the end of the Daniel Craig series might be a good choice for the next series but a bad choice for the end of the series. He did great in reviving the old style of music, but sometimes came with Batman-like music, which was not fit for a spy-movie. He had deep emotional music, but well fit for other more drama films. The ending tune was fit and amazing, perhaps the only place it made sense to be a real Hans Zimmer drama.Some things were rushed and not revised.

As a final goodbye to this era of Bond it feels very complete but that also leads to the quality of the movie feeling incomplete. The movie needs to tie up every single loose end from the past movies and because of that the pacing feeling off. It's nearly three hours and it feels longer in my opinion. Also this might just be me but this story feels like it's been told already. I think Casino Royale and Skyfall presented these ideas in a much more compelling way. While I didn't love this film there was enough stuff to keep me engaged. I liked every single actor in here. Ana De Armas is basically just playing herself in a Bond movie and it leeds to some funny moments and easily the best action scene in the film. Everyone else is great too, not at the top of their game but still good. The action is also very solid, however I didn't find it as exciting as the action in Skyfall. It's very well shot with good lighting and framing. The music was on point as always. Overall this is a very technically well made film I just wasn't that emotionally invested in it myself. I understand that Bond fans will love this movie, but I think that this movies quality suffers from the fact that it's the end for this Bond.

746,NS_writings,"Look up, look down, look out! Here comes the most insulting Bond of all!",1,30 September 2021,"As a movie in general, NO TIME TO DIE is a fairly good and entertaining production. A bit of a mess in terms of story, compensated by well-arranged stunts, thrills, a decent soundtrack and a colorful cinematography. Some of the actors, like Ana de Armas and David Dencik steal the show. Others, like Rami Malek, are ridiculously overpraised. I would say Craig's acting is more ""natural"" than in other films, but the main problem in this film ruins the experience.And the main problem of NO TIME TO DIE is... that it is a James Bond movie. And in that regard, any true Bond fan watching it will feel blatantly insulted. Straight from the worst gunbarrel sequence you'll ever see where the dots emanate from the Universal logo, the barrel itself is a generic chromed iris and there is no blood as a tuxedoed Craig fires his gun, unsuccessfully ripping of the pose of Pierce Brosnan in his four Bond movies. As if that wasn't enough, the main titles have more CGI than the tsunami wave of DIE ANOTHER DAY with pedestrian animations of Aston Martin DB5 cars falling into sand, mythological figures and Walther PPKs firing bullets simultaneously across the screen. And I'm just mentioning the somewhat ""banal"" things of the film, because if we go to how the arc initiated in CASINO ROYALE is closed, you'd wish this film had never happened and that Craig really slashed his wrists in November 2015 no matter how much Barbara begged him (""the only actor she can imagine playing Bond"", yes, she said that!) and that the end of his run was SPECTRE.The final minutes constitute a blaspheme insult to Ian Fleming, Albert R Broccoli, Louis Armstrong and John Barry. And to anyone who truly grew up to love James Bond 007. As I said before, name this character played by Daniel Craig something like Clifton Sleigh, Auguste Balls or Jacques Clouseau and I'd at least give this film a 3/5. But as a James Bond film... it crosses the line that much that it makes NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN and the 1954 TV adaptation of CASINO ROYALE two ""official"" Bond films and diminishes this one to the point we can actually compare it to the 1967 version of CASINO ROYALE - literally, two elements of that film are replicated here!That said, I really don't care where they are taking James Bond from now on. This film made me want to put some flowers in Kevin McClory's grave and I really hated the man for years. If you still have some dignity, Barbara, please resign. Resign and sell the rights of the character to someone who truly loves James Bond 007 and make the kind of films your father did. The kind of films that care little about Oscars, diversity, drama, epic tales, and billions of dollars in the box office.Yes, the classic four words are still there at the very end, placed as an afterthought.

How do you change with the times though, keep an audience engaged while allowing a franchise to grow and mature? They could have stuck to the same cliches and troupes they had since the 60s, but they wanted to give a human side to Bond, make him more natural, real. I think the Daniel Craig version is the most authentic Bond, human, real, and I think this movie is a fine conclusion to that. The villain isn't the most evil, because they didn't want to detract from Bonds story, and the plot wasn't very twisty, because, again, they're trying to keep the focus on wrapping up this character.I wish there was more love development, why this woman above all others was worth ""forgetting the past""

The new 007 import acted like she was made of cardboard.

754,Hannah_Bananah,Another Bond era is over.. and not a moment too soon.,6,9 October 2021,"""Do you expect me to talk?"", ""No Mr Bond, I expect you to die"". An iconic line from a movie several decades old. Craig may well be remembered for the line about scratching his nuts. We knew then that Bond lacked the sophistication of previous incarnations. Now No Time to Die has finished the story arc that started with Casino Royale - a movie showing ""Bond, before Bond was Bond"" and subsequent movies in this series that were also Bond before he was Bond. I'd honestly waited for Bond to be Bond again, until Skyfall when it appeared Bond was now past his prime, so I guess he was Bond off screen?Let me digress, with how each Bond actor categorised an era in Bond films. Connery defined the 60s with charm and dry wit, Moore defined the late 70s and early 80s with a refined yet more tongue in cheek Bond (and some of the most romantic Bond songs). Dalton briefly defined the late 80s with a harder Bond, while Brosnan re-energised Bond with Golden Eye, and epitomised the suave 90s action spy until Die Another Day - a miss-step in many people's eyes. They were all slightly different films, encapsulating the style of the time, but we always felt like Bond was Bond, who ever played him. Then along came Craig, Daniel Craig. Breaking the mould as easily as he'd break someone's head into bathroom porcelain. The 2000s rebooted Bond was obviously a reaction to the success of the Bourne trilogy.. err, quad, uhh series of films.Casino Royale was largely well received but many people still criticised the direction that Bond was taking, and the actor who was cast to play him. Arguably Craig can act, although his engagement with the role diminished as his fee rose. Undoubtedly the most financially successful Bond movies with general audiences, even if QoS and SPECTRE didn't sit well with the die hard Bond fans. Less charm, sophistication, and wit, the new Bond era was gritty, emotional, and cynical. A Tux does not maketh the man in the case of Craig's Bond.No time to Die, like the previous films in Craig's run, has good quality action set pieces, visceral fights, high stakes, and Bond saving the day. But is it any better than say Quantum of Solace, or SPECTRE? My initial impression after seeing it in theatres on Thursday was yes but... And it's a big but, we still never get to see the Bond as we knew him in previous eras, and the way Bond has ""degraded"" over this series, I doubt we ever will again. Closing the book on Craig's era as Bond gives the franchise a chance to reinvent itself again, to react again to the competition. Sadly, the franchise has spent more time looking outward at current social trends, and it's competitors like Jason Bourne, Mission Impossible, Atomic Blonde, and the rest. But it's had an identity crisis and forgotten where it came from... one man only armed with a PPK, and his charm and sex appeal against tyrants who want the world to bend to their will. So, watch it, enjoy the quality action, I mean it's decent and maybe the last time we see a Bond movie now Craig is gone. But it does raise the iconic question...Will Bond Return?",No Time to Die

758,MarkSweepstakes,Very disappointing,4,22 October 2021,"I am amazed at the high ratings on here for this movie. Did they even see the same movie as I did? ""No Time to Die"" was very disappointing in almost every regard. From the bland lackluster theme song until the final credits rolled an interminable time later. When our showing ended, no one was smiling or leaving the theater in a good mood. Remember during the Connery and Moore years when you'd leave a 007 movie feeling upbeat and happy?Honestly, my gripes have nothing really to do with the plot (killing everyone off as a form of brand house-cleaning). I'm surprisingly okay with that, though I seem to be in a vast minority. No, what I really could not stand was the cinematography. It was murky, grainy, and far too dark. At one point in the film, James and Madeleine walk into a room and the entire screen goes pitch black. Some guy during our theater showing shouted ""Turn the lights on!!!"" and everyone laughed because we had all been thinking the same thing. Also, the digital camera and CGI effects were distractingly bad. Nothing looked ""really real"". During the Matera, Italy, sequence I could hear whispers of people around me wondering ""Is that real? Is that a real place?"". It was because what should have been a breathtakingly gorgeous actual city looked like CGI due to the way it was filmed. Ditto with the endless cars chases and car flips. They, too, looked like something out of GTA Vice City. It reminded me of ""The Lone Ranger"" (2013) in that the producers made a big deal about how much time, effort and money they spent on all the practical effects and actual stunts, but due to the muted monochromatic digital cinematography, what were actually extraordinarily colorful vistas and intricately beautiful physical sets just looked like fake computer graphics. Same deal here.There were small parts of ""No Time to Die"" that I liked, and a few action scenes were impressive. But on the whole it is an overlong, humorless, PC, confusing mess, which looks and feels murky and gritty, and a villain who I still can't explain what he was doing or why. It was obvious Daniel was phoning in his performance. But I liked Lea, she was a good actress and very pretty. She and James and the little girl had a decent enough chemistry. Ana de Armas was very beautiful but her short stint was basically unnecessary comic relief that served no real purpose. Lashana Lynch was fine, too, in a thankless new role. At the very least she was not as caustic as we all feared. However she basically just strutted around, mouth-breathing, wearing baggy clothes, oozing attitude, looking like the spawn of Bill Duke.Hopefully now that every major character has been killed off in this progressive purge, enough time will pass until the new ""reborn"" James Bond appears that the masculine tongue-in-check sophisticated joy of the earlier Bond's will be rediscovered.

Introducing a family element to Bond I think was quite unnecessary and really provided little additional substance to the plot. I also feel that the villain was one of the weakest I've ever seen in the 26 Bond movies I've seen that makes Christopher Lee's portrayal of Scaramanga in The Man With The Golden Gun look positively competent by comparison. Rami Malek is a good actor and I feel his talent was wasted in this role given how high the expectations were for Daniel Craig's last outing as 007. The plot itself seemed rather confusing although the motives for Safin made some sense in losing his family to Spectre and his revenge on that organization but it just isn't enough to rescue this movie.Last, but not least, the ending here was a huge disappointment and not something I would've expected. How this franchise carries on from that is a mystery to me, especially given how the Daniel Craig era was almost a prequel to the films of his predecessors. Every actor brings something unique to this role, and while I wasn't a big fan of Craig initially, I think he held up well and kept the franchise going strong. However, this film along with Quantum of Solace remain the weak links in his five film tenure and I was hoping for so much more but alas it fell way short for me.

He came in hard with Casino Royale (which I think to this day, remains the jewel in 007's crown) and carried the poor scripts/executions that were Quantum of Solace, Skyfall & Spectre. The fact that Daniel Craig could make these films stand out is testament to his portrayal of James Bond.In the last 15 years, we've frustratingly had some of the BEST EVER scenes in Bond films. But we've had some really poorly finished articles. Whether it be the ridiculous Quantum of Solace (pointless), hash-mash of Skyfall (epic scenes ruined by rock concert helicopters) or the full of promise Spectre (but lacking like the latter Brosnan outings) - Daniel Craig has held our interest. So it is entirely fitting that he is given the best of swan songs.Ram packed with everything that Bond should be, it delves into his flaws, his weakness - like Casino Royale does. It opens up the side we wanted to see for all these years. Yet it somehow retains the authenticity the franchise has kept for all these years. The fact that the last 5 films have interlinked with its characters set in the background has been wonderful. Full of subtle nods and Easter Eggs to the Bond films over the years, it opens up for subtle acceptance and progress. For those of a certain age bracket or prejudice, they will see parts of this film and panic that their heterosexual, white hero will be no more.

It would make sense in context of the film as we get a much more tired James Bond who just wanted to live the simple life, despite the fact he can't. The opening action scene has more story to it than most Daniel Craig-era installments. At first, the villain seemed like creepy-killer type, and I wish they stuck with that instead of switching to the mad scientist. Of course, the ending should have been better since the James Bond died. It seemed like the writers weren't sure how to sound him off properly.",No Time to Die

For that reason alone Craig will always have a place at the top of best Bond of All Time lists. Unfortunately since then, the writers haven't been able to come up with an interesting story for him to perform. Skyfall didn't have a great screenplay but was elevated by strong action set pieces and unique direction by Sam Mendes and for that reason it was a ""pretty good"" Bond film.But the rest unfortunately follow a pattern of having totally boring, dark, dour stories that are meant to be taken very seriously. These movies are not fun to watch and I'd honestly rank them below the cheesiest Roger Moore films as you can at least get some laughs out of those. This is just miserable for the most part with unfunny jokes sprinkled in to try to lighten the tone.

I wanted him to play Bond forever. Talking about the film the movie is so gripping that you won't feel like watching a 3-hour movie.

I was really disappointed by the feeble 'politically correct' characters. If they intend to continue along this line they may as well call it a day now.

It doesn't feel Bond. As an action movie it's okay, yet predictable. And as the Craig Era clousure the end of the story leaves you kind of cold once the credits begin to show.

779,JamesR1973,Swan song for Craig - but poor plot,7,27 October 2021,"Like many have said on here already, this wasn't a Bond film in its own right but a swan song to celebrate and end Daniel Craig's stint. Unfortunately, whilst there are some good action scenes and poignant moments, the film suffers due to its poor plot and what feels like rearranging specific elements to fit the finale.This isn't a bad film and for the first 2/3rd's of it I actually really enjoyed it. The opening sequence was engaging and the story felt like it was progressing nicely. The Cuban scenes with Ana de Armas were well executed and, even if her role was particularly brief, she played it well.But I felt it started to go downhill from the cheap killing of Felix and the introduction of the young daughter later on. I don't have any issue with Bond having ""a family"" per se (even if die hard fans may howl in anguish), but it seemed rushed and felt like an obvious plot device.Once they were on the island base things got odd and didn't make a lot sense. Malek's character was very poor I thought. I'm not saying it's his fault (you can only work with what you're given), but the rationale behind some of his decisions was baffling. Just what was he trying to do? The whole concept of the bioweapon was convoluted and not massively clear. At the end, he takes away Swan's daughter and just lets her go after she bites him. Why would he just do that after all of the long winded explanations in the poison garden and the face to face with Bond? At the very least you've just given up your one bargaining chip. We assume from then on he is about to escape, but then just reappears in the garden to have his final confrontation with Bond which felt lame.I have mixed feelings about the actual end. You'd have to be pretty cold not to at least have some kind of emotional response, but the whole ""blood insurance"" thing that meant Bond could no longer go near Swan or his daughter just felt like it was pulled out of the hat. Of course, the problem now is the future. Is it one with 007 but no James Bond (can that ever work?), or will it just be another reboot?I think Daniel Craig has been an excellent Bond and brought a gritty realism that was needed off the back of the Bourne films. But he definitely look tired in this one. I enjoyed the Q and M interactions and didn't mind the new 007. The score was good, and I enjoyed the elements from ""Her Majesty's Secret Service"".Overall, a good action film - but probably could have been a lot better.",No Time to Die
780,VBeretta,"Craig's farewell is a confusing, scattered mess",6,16 October 2021,"This Bond opens with a bang. Both the initial sequence in Norway and the first big set piece in Italy are everything a Bond movie should be. I looked forward to a solid entry in the series. There was a hint of ""Bond's Greatest Hits"" both in the classic Aston Martin's gadgets and in the score by Hans Zimmer.Then the movie loses its way. It is still a collection of classic Bond moments, but like if written on scraps of paper by different people who, then tried to somehow put them together; and some of them aren't even Bond.Rami Malek's talents are wasted for a very generic bad guy whose plan is never completely clear. Actually, all the actors and the actresses in the movie do their best with the surprisingly little they are given to do. The most lucky was possibly Ana de Armas, with a funny and plucky character - inserted in a movie who was supposed to be full of gravitas and wounded souls. The movie movies from scene to scene, all technically well done, but with the characters themselves who say ""I'll do this, maybe why will be explained later.""And then there are the parts that make no sense. ""M"" authorises the creation of a very irresponsible weapon... why? (actually, all ""M""'s dialogue is just dreadful) War shots are fired amid a very tense international situation: nobody cares. Blofeld is in a maximum security prison but he can communicate with his henchmen... how? He has no gadgets; such a basic plot point is never explained.This is a movie without consequences. We have ""A"" and then we have ""B"" - but ""B"" happens because a writer thought it was cool to have ""B"" happen. There is, simply, no cohesion in the script.As a farewell, ""No Time to Die"" works thanks to the efforts of everybody involved - except the screenwriters. Those initial 20-30 minutes in Italy were wonderful, up there with ""Casino Royale"" and among the Best Bond has to offer. A truly self-contained story. I'll remember Craig by thinking of those.",No Time to Die

As previously mentioned in other reviews it is a good thriller and action movie but definitely not a James Bond movie. When I got home I immediately put on the DVD of Spectre in order to get rid of the taste of this movie. And to make matters worse, the producers fell into the trap of political correctness and added a black female 007. I sincerely hope this is the last effort in the bond franchise.",No Time to Die
782,darryl-johnson,A fitting farewell to Daniel Craig's James Bond,8,10 October 2021,A fitting farewell to Daniel Craig's James BondSeeing that quite a few James Bond fans are older than 50 my advice is to make sure to use the bathroom before watching the film- it is 2 hours 43 minutes long. I thought the movie would drag however after watching it I found the time went by without lagging much.James Bond has retired and thinking of settling down with the love of his life however his old nemisis Spectre still wants him dead. When his friend from the CIA Felix Leiter (Jeffery Wright) offers Bond the chance to spoil Spectre's plans he takes it. MI6 has a new 007 (Lashana Lynch) who has been dispatched to also foil Spectre's plans.Lynch is great as the new 007- her casting has caused much handwringing with traditional Bond movie fans. Not with me- she performs the role well along with Ana de Armas as Bond's Cuba contact. The women in 'No Time to Die' were given ample screen time to shine and for character development.Rami Malek's villionous Safin was played bit too understated... Mr. Malek had stated he did this on purpose however I would have liked more from Safin.All said this is a great ending to the Daniel Craig 5 movie arc involving James Bond and Spectre. There are surprises that I won't reveal and will probably cause many traditional Bond fans to not be happy with them.Not me...I loved the film and look forward to the return of 007.,No Time to Die

It was probably my wife's decency that prohibited her from poking fun at my freshly swollen eyes.It's not that James Bond died, really. Bond is a fictional character. It's the conditions of his demise that bring sadness to a man's mind. A middle-aged man who finally discovers the best reason to live, has 9 minutes of life ahead of him.Despite the long running time, I found the whole film enjoyable and superbly cast. I particularly enjoyed the enlivening sweetener in the shape of Mrs. Ana de Armas, and welcomed the fact that Mr. Waltz's role amounted to a mere cameo (I think Christoph Waltz is a great actor, except as a Bond villain).Of course NTTD is not perfect. At times the dialogs were delivered in such a vapid manner that I wondered whether the acting is good or tragic. In the end, I chose to believe that the filmmakers tried to experiment a little and make the speech sound more ""human"". Another thing I cannot take seriously, in a 2021 movie (or 2020? Or 2019?), is a computerized voice telling the audience that ""the code has been cracked,"", that there is so and so time to detonation etc.The film won't please everyone, as other reviews indicate. It is a divertion from the classic Fleming character. It worked for me and I think Daniel Craig is probably the best Bond, at least if we do not count the defining Bond Sean Connery.",No Time to Die

Not This Bond... and that's where No Time To Die went wrong.Bale as Batman is one of the greatest ever action trilogies, there's a reason it wasn't in five-parts.Craig's Bond became so complex, twisted and damaged that by the fifth installment it was no longer a ""James Bond"" film.Previous Bond films pretty much reset the character at the start of each film. Otherwise, having started aged 40 in the first 1960s installment, we'd by now be dealing with a Geriatric Bond!There's also only so many times one man can get the girl, defeat the super-villa and lose the girl before he and the viewer gets tired, depressed and tired. Resetting the film each time worked.Craig's Bond best installment remains Casino Royale, a film that started fresh not curtailed by ""following"" a storyline. His worst unsurprisingly is the first time the franchise attempted a continuation of a story, the sequel, Quantum of Solace.Craig's Bond should have been retired after Skyfall.No one should leave a Bond film with a tear in their eye, or a knot in their stomach, yet that's where No Time To Die leaves you. Depressed.",No Time to Die
788,kikogod,Surprisingly solid and fun movie!,8,3 October 2021,"I definitely didn't expect to like it so much. Over time, I had lost interest in the series, and after the average previous part, the constant postponement of this film, as well as the trailers that failed to impress me, I didn't even want to watch it. And I'm happy about that, because once again I'm convinced of how different the experience can be when you actually feel the product.Where to start - first of all what surprised me the most - the adequate direction from the dude I've never heard, Carrie Joji Fukunaga 😄 I've only heard that he did True Detective (but don't tell anyone that yet I haven't watched it😳). The dude handles brilliantly both in moments of intense action and in those of drama, silence, and comedy. Yes, the jokes are also great, especially the running joke with the one-eyed baddie :D. Fukunaga shot the action in a great way and it is clear that they watched the development of their biggest opponent ""Mission Impossible"", which, for me, over time became the ""better Bond movie"". Yes, it's hard for anyone to reach the level of Christopher Macquarie's action shooting, but it's definitely thumbs up for the new Bond. There are no excessive shaky cam, everything was clear and with the right editing, the dynamics and adrenaline were great. An interesting solution was to have scenes in which they bet on a slightly more fun and free of credibility side of the action, in contrast to the other much tighter, tense and serious ones. Which is actually one of my few downsides, but for that later.It's time to praise the actors as well. At first, Craig, who absolutely played the world here. Fantastic role ""as if for the last time"" on his part. Soft and funny in some moments, brutal and serious in others. Just great and despite his face of a sleepless drunk, still charismatic. I can't help noticing the super cool and fresh role of my favorite Anna de Armas. Even for a short time, she managed to leave me with a trembling heart 😛 I adore her. Lashana and Leia Seydou impressed me less with their roles, but as for what they are, they did great. The thing with 007 was fun for me and didn't trigger me at all like some people. I will also mention the baddies, such as the wonderful little appearance of the eternally great Christoph Waltz and Rami, who, although failed to swipe me of my feet, deffinitely had a memorable psychopathic look. The music surprised me that they gave it to the giant Zimmer, I didn't expect it. So there are no surprises, great themes, dramatic, majestic, mixing new and familiar compositions. My downside was the end credit song. Didn't suit me at all, especially after the dramatic finale.And to mention the thing I didn't like so much - the lean in the final act to the slightly excessive, not very credible action. At times, the film became a bit like 80's action. People started falling like pears, from different directions, good guys were like Arnold, where they shot everything and hit everything. Grenades were flying, things..., although apparently Fukunaga wanted a slightly more bombastic ending to end on a BANG, this slightly pulled me out of the movie. While such a scene was the segment with Anna de Armas, there the vibe and the script predisposed it to a pleasant break of the atmosphere. While not so much for the ending action scene. Speaking of the script, even itself is not phenomenal. We have typical tropes for such a film - a dangerous virus, a psychopathic villain who is ready to take everything from the main character, etc. Increasingly chewed topics. Also - nanobots? Bruh, please. G. I. Joe called, they wanted their nanobots back... :DBut anyway, these are small gripes in the otherwise so adequate and great action-spy epic called No time to die.

I felt the stakes. I cared about the character, and it felt like a seamless way to recap Daniel Craigs 007 journey while also telling it's own story. There are definitely some nitpicks, but I felt the exhaustion of the character and I also felt the beauty of the good things he has and wants to have as a contrast to that. I was invested in Bond's journey and really felt the conclusion.Basically, I felt a lot in this movie.

792,kookoo36,Everyone writing 1 star reviews is an incel.,7,14 October 2021,"And have probably never even touched a woman.Anyway, how is the movie? I thought it was a great conclusion to the story of Daniel Craig's James Bond. Is it a perfect movie? No, not really. However, I think it is still thrilling and a well-done final chapter to the story of this character.I'm not going to spoil anything here. If you loved Casino Royale and have at least seen 1 or 2 of the films in between, I suggest you go see this movie. There are a lot of story elements in this film which have never been seen in a James Bond picture, but I think all of them worked perfectly and actually made sense.Everyone who is review bombing this film with 1 star or 3 star reviews are being literal man children. ""This isn't the Bond I grew up with! WAAAHHH! The SJW's are out of control!!!!!"" Shut up. Just shut up.There is a tough black woman who plays a prominent supporting character, and I thought she was great and badass in the role. However, her being a tough black woman is somehow ""political"" for these incels? It's nauseating to think about.Additionally, one of the sexualities of a minor character is lightly hinted at with a piece of dialogue, and this is also making these people lose their minds, because I guess that is also ""political SJW nonsense""? Why do you care? That's who this character is. In fact, I think it makes them more interesting, because they are now a more distinguished take on this character due to that little exchange of dialogue.Sorry, back to the review. The action is great throughout. Stunts are great. The cinematography is EXCELLENT, and a huge step up from the awful uninteresting and washed-out look of Spectre. The only thing I didn't really like in this film was the villain. I didn't understand his plan and found him to be underwhelming. On the screen opposite Craig, he's adequate. He served the purpose of the plot, nothing more, nothing less.So, overall, I thought this was a very good movie. We saw the beginning of this character in Casino Royale, and here we see how his story ends. I thought it was a thrilling conclusion to Craig's run as 007. Despite not being perfect, this film took a lot of risks and, in my opinion, all of them paid off.7/10.",No Time to Die

794,angelic_wounds,Craig's brilliant; his send off way less so.,3,15 October 2021,"In the final instalment of Daniel Craig's action packed tenure as James Bond, No Time to Die tries to offer a rare, emotional send off to, perhaps, its best Bond actor since Sean Connery. Unfortunately, the way it attempts to emotionally unlock its protagonist falls into old, cliché tropes that almost make your eyes roll in their absurdity.The pros are few, but worthy of mention. Daniel Craig's (James Bond) continues to give life and breath into a character that has already gone through half a dozen incarnations, and he does so with an ease not previously seen in his former movies. Maybe it's because he'll finally be free of the 007 clutches? His action scenes serve to work on his favour, with delightful camera shots situated on his back, that make you feel as if you control his actions. Ana de Armas (Paloma) is a breath of fresh air in her youthful glee, lethal as she is beautiful and wonderful for the few minutes she plays alongside Craig. All the recurring characters (Whishaw, Harris, Fiennes) pick up where they left off, with Fiennes offering a cold, domineering finality to Craig's impulses. Lynch was good as someone to rattle Craig, but I feel her role was a bit too much on the nose, given the circulating rumours of the next Bond (rumours I sincerely hope are false). Also, the music is, as always, really good.Now, on the cons.Rami Malek (Lyutsifer Safin) is as underused as Christoph Waltz was in Spectre. His character spends more time conversing with Léa Seydoux than Bond himself, and even when he does, his motives remain unclear. His story never fully develops, the explanation for his revenge feeling incomplete and somewhat immature. Killing nearly half the population using a deadly virus for... what? Malek himself, unfortunately, doesn't give the necessary life that his character needs, making him feel monotonous and rather boring.Regarding his ""masterful"" plan, the deadly virus, that as well feels as if it's missing something. It is explained by three different characters, and yet it never feels coherent enough, lost in brow-rising biological explanations that make it a bit too easy to be spread and cost lives. By the way, this is what kills Blofeld. For real.The biggest, and most disappointing, flop of all is Léa Seydoux's (Madeleine) and her relationship with Bond. The residue lack of chemistry that was so evident in Spectre carries over into No Time to Die, but this time feels exponentially more stark because it's the main arc of the story, and the supposed driving force of Bond's decisions in the second half of the movie. Not only that, but Madeleine and Bond have a daughter. Yes, you heard right. Nothing more cliché than putting a child into the mix and using that as a catalyst for your self-sacrificing, paternal reactions. Too bad that Craig had more chemistry with Lisa-Dorah Sonnet (Matilde) than he ever did with Seydoux. Even the way he looks into Vesper Lynd's grave at the beginning holds more, real emotion that any looks he gives to Madeleine.All in all, it is a heartfelt send off to a beloved actor, but, unfortunately, Spectre's fatal flaws never really leave this movie to breathe. Plus, the sentimentality that is used to portray Craig's Bond as different from its predecessors might have worked better if anyone actually CARED about the safety of Madeleine.Having said all that, I give Daniel Craig my sincerest congratulations and wish him the best on his future projects. He gave Bond a life of his own into the 21st century, long after everyone thought him a relic of the past after Die Another Day. And that was, certainly, no easy task.",No Time to Die

As much as Spectre had the 'Big Final Boss (probably)' element to it - which I wasn't too keen on, but, you know, Christoph Waltz - it finished in such a way that Bond could have blissfully continued forever more, as he has done for near-on six decades. But clearly those in charge had other thoughts.I'll start with critique and move onto good bits:Firstly, the characters. Two of the pillars of any Bond movie, the baddie and the girl, aren't even the best ones featured in this film: the lead baddie (Malek) and lead Bond girl (Seydoux) are completely overshadowed by Waltz and de Armas, respectively. The lack of Bond's ability to move on from Vesper's death only damaging the under-par repertoire between Bond and Madeleine further.A testament to the greatness of Casino Royale was that, for perhaps the first time, we genuinely thought playboy Bond had a real love interest, and it ticked all the boxes any good love interest should include - lustful, challenging, heart-wrenching. And this unfortunately creates a comparison level I'm afraid was never achieved again. I do feel for Seydoux, as she's a really great actor, and her character has an interesting backstory, but the romance between Madeleine and Bond just doesn't come close to that of Bond and Vesper, and it just leaves me feeling un-bothered about anything that happens between them.Talking of characters, I know I might get lambasted for this, but I'm yet to see Rami Malek in anything I've enjoyed... I know direction plays a large part, but, for example, he just seemed genuinely awkward around the daughter (Sonnet); like, not character-actor awkward, but Malek himself. If this was purposefully done, then I'll contently eat my hat, but something was certainly off with that whole character. Not intimidating; really, really weak argument for his plans (""people don't know what they want"", so I'm going to kill them?); and I'm almost certain the cyclops side-kick (Benssalah) had more screen time. Also, the fixation on poisonous, exotic plants that ends up baring absolutely no impact on the plot whatsoever? Like, what!? Just edit it out, save us 15 minutes of bum-numbing. Perhaps a symptom of the multiple script re-writes. Finally, and perhaps I'm being dense, but I've no idea how he got the scarring on his face. I'm lead to assume it happened when his family were killed, but didn't they die by ingesting poison? How did that get to him/and not kill him? Anyway, by far and away the weakest enemy of the Craig era. Sorry, Rami.This brings me onto a general bugbear I have with any film and it's a spoon-feeding script. Bond saying ""I miss you"" in front of Vesper's tomb (you don't say...); Q saying ""He'll be here soon"" about his dinner date, seemingly a shoehorned, box-ticking exercise, completely insignificant to the plot (though any critique of this film including the term 'woke' should be immediately dismissed due to simply being incorrect). There are more, especially in the first 1/3rd of the film that I can't recall two days on, but I seem to remember being frustrated at words being said when the face (the actual acting) can do so much without them.Another point on the script: with this being such a 'dark' Bond film, the humour, though a staple of every other film, just seems too forced. I'm all for a good cheesy joke, so the calibre of the joke isn't the issue, more the placement. And a final point - the ""007, just a number"" thing is flogged. To. Death. We get it, Bond retired, they gave the number to someone else. Make a quick joke about it and move on.Good points - and there are plenty: 1) The forest set piece was fantastically done; 2) Hans Zimmer's score and Billie Eilish's theme song are lovely; 3) Fight scene choreography in Cuba; 4) The cinematography; 5) Felix's sub-plot; 6) Christoph bloody Waltz. Unfortunately, for me, though the visual and auditory effects are outstanding, they don't do enough to plug the holes in the plot.Killing Bond just leaves me empty - not least because about 2 minutes after it's happened the credits are rolling. This is James *bleeping* Bond. And a subdued reading of a poem and a tipple are all that he gets? And I have to say, I saw it coming. This version of Bond, with its continuous story would have to have an ending, and if all the bad guys are gone, there's only one thing left to get rid of...Anyway, I'm not necessarily as angry as some other reviewers are here about the death, but I've also no idea what they're supposed to do next. An 'Origins story' perhaps? Or do they double down and go ""all in"" with a black, female 007 agent (of which I would completely approve, by the way).God forbid two eventualities though: 1) We fast-forward 20 years and his daughter becomes the new 007 (truly vomit-inducing), or 2) He somehow survived, which would be beyond farfetched and into Marvel territory.Sadly, this was also the first time in my 29 years that I went to the cinema and wasn't bothered about a single other film trailer. Not one. So, with this being as 'alright' as it is, I left the theatre feeling empty; not something that happens often.All I can say from here in is good luck to whoever's involved with whatever comes next, because ""uphill battle"" doesn't quite cover it.",No Time to Die
797,courtney_london,"Same Action, Same Bond",8,9 October 2021,"No Time to Die is a good instalment, or really a good send-off for Daniel Craig's last time as James Bond. Not my favourite of Craig's Bond flicks, mostly because I love Skyfall so much but this one is everything you expect from a modern day Bond film.Rami Malek as the villain is meh, great actor, just not as vicious as previous villains like Christoph Waltz or even Javier Bardem. Léa Seydoux is great as always. Introduction of Lashana Lynch into the ensemble is good, she plays off Craig's Bond very well. Ana de Armas was only on screen for 5 minutes (a charismatic 5) but I imagine she may continue to be a character in future Bond films? Let's hope! Most Bond films, at least the Daniel Craig version of Bond, seem to have the same pace of film. Nothing new or overly unique about this film.Overall I enjoy all Bond films. However, if you are looking for something new or fresh, you won't find it with No Time to Die.",No Time to Die
798,zillia24,Unexpected Ending,9,9 October 2021,"Ana de Armas was an unexpected part of the movie. She takes the cake as the best character in the show. Lea Seydoux is a beautiful actress. She did an outstanding job in her performance as well. Very impressed by her style and acting ability. The Young Madeleine actress, Coline Defaund, also did a very good job in the film. This may have been a ""James Bond"" film, but it was all about Madeleine. The spoilers come next, so don't read them if you wish. Why did they have to kill Felix? I guess that since James is gone also, he had to go as well. I read some of the other reviews, I do not agree that Jame's death was cheesy. He made the ultimate sacrifice. Not only to his ""family"" but to the world as well. Isn't that what a ""double O"" is supposed to do anyway? Being old enough to have seen most of the other 24 films in movie theaters, glad that this one is not streaming and on the small screen. This is a film that is made for the big screen. Period. Also, Billy Magnussen's character did ""smile to much.""",No Time to Die
799,andypaps101,Familiarity does not breed contempt,8,29 September 2021,"As a Bond fanatic (my specialist subject was Bond films when I appeared on Mastermind - episode 7 2016) I was lucky enough to get invited to the Royal Albert Hall for the World Premiere last night (28th September).It was great to see the actors Daniel Craig (Bond), Rami Malek (Lyutsifer Safin) , Lashana Lynch (Nomi) as well as one of the four credited script writers Phoebe Waller Bridge (Fleabag) on the red carpet.To be clear my review is not influenced by last night's occasion and I'll start by stating that I rank this Bond film fifth out of the twenty-seven Bond films made; in between Casino Royale (2006) and Skyfall (2012). As an aside my favourites are the 1960's classics with Goldfinger unsurpassed.Despite the films spanning six decades and being created by different filmmakers with various actors, Bond films still retain recurring elements that make them ""Bond-esque"". Bond is not much different from any other successful franchise. It works on the formula of giving the audience from the very start a sense of familiarity and No Time to Die delivers starting with Billy Eilish's theme song.This was Daniel Craig's fifth and concluding turn in a highly successful 15-year run. Though not my favourite Bond (who else but Sean Connery) Daniel Craig can take a lot of credit for humanising the role by giving him more complexity and dragging him firmly into a new century.For those familiar with the co-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge one may feel that she had an out-sized input into the film as her excellent knack for the comedic and heartfelt (Fleabag) as well as action and adventure (Killing Eve) seemed to be stamped on this production.The film is more than a worthy contribution to the Bond franchise and hence should eventually fulfil the marker as an index of time to where we were at with our lives, just like Goldfinger did for me in September 1964 at the Odeon Leicester Square.People may be caught out by the length of the runtime (2 hours 45 minutes and at least 20 minutes longer than any other Bond film) but it is fair to say that it flew over me and left a heart-warming shadow behind. Go see it.",No Time to Die

I am so tired of Hollywood feeling some need to reimagine everything with a female lead in place of a male and/or a different race. The new 007 chick could have instead been given her own franchise snd titular character with a whole new MO. It's like the makers of this film were trying to attract a younger audience while deliberately alienating loyal devotees. And ""Bond's"" personality? He was smiling and shouting and acting like a totally different person from the cool, self assured man Craig has portrayed him as for 15 years. It's embarrassing. And a child? And he gives up and dies at the end? If MI6 built the weapon they can surely reverse engineer and create a cure! Why would he just lay down and die? Every wacky concept from left field was shoved into this movie for what? So we could all embrace a black female in the 007 role? Famous athletes numbers are retired- it's stupid to think they'd give his number to someone else. And again, she'd be great as her own character. But it's insulting how this played out. It's a big middle finger to the Bond legacy. So Daniel Craig didn't want to play the role anymore. Big deal. Give it to Idris Elba and move on. Loved the young lady who was Bonds counterpart in Cuba. That was awesome to watch. She needs her own movie! Bottom line, overall disgusted with the whole thing.",No Time to Die
808,parksiet,Perfect finale to Daniel Craig's Bond saga!,9,9 October 2021,"Wow am I ever impressed with this movie! It delivered exactly what I wanted it to! No Time to Die is an intense, emotional, exciting, satisfying, beautiful and just all around excellent film! It could not have been done any better, I thought it was just perfect for what it was. And it was also a perfect conclusion to Daniel Craig's run as Bond, especially in how it so nicely concluded many of the story arcs from the previous 5 films. Easily my favourite part of the movie, and what made me really love it, was the strong emotional value it had. It took Bond, a normally stoic character, and really seemed to flesh him out even more (which the Craig films were already great at doing) and infused a strong emotional core to the film, reminiscent of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". I even loved that they included motifs and even the theme from that film in the soundtrack, it helped thematically connect the two so well! It was so cool to see this film pay a few homages to classic Bond films like the one earlier mentioned and even Dr No, through story, locations, music and even production design! Out of all the Craig films, this one felt the most like a classic Bond film! It wasn't just a complete serious movie, it had some fun, had a lot of quippy one-liners and let Bond have fun with lots of the action. I love the scene where he stops to pour a drink and then continues in the fight! The film made use of some cool gadgets and a somewhat exuberant plotline, which also felt more like the classic Bond films. The villain, Safin, is fairly standard, but Rami Malek's performance is what really makes him stand out. Malek truly commands the screen whenever his character shows up and just projects such a wild and threatening energy. Daniel Craig himself killed it though, he really seemed to be enjoying himself this time around and committed to delivering such a satisfying conclusion to his time as Bond. He handled the emotion well, yet brought all his intensity to the thrilling, intense action scenes. I especially loved the one he shared with Ana de Armas (who left quite the impression in the film despite only appearing for one sequence). The action is some of the best the franchise has seen in awhile, it's so well choreographed and beautifully shot, right from the opening car chase with the excellent DB5 shootout scene, to the stunningly intense Norway escape in the forest, or even the final confrontations on the island. They are very cleverly conceived! It's such a thrilling film, and Cary Joji Fukunaga handles the action perfectly. I throughly enjoyed his direction, found a lot of it to be wonderfully crafted, with such unique, creative and beautiful ways to shoot things! The way he staged so many scenes was brilliant, right from the opening scene where we see Safin for the first time! Or even how he built tension with Bond and Madeleine seeing each other again and then meeting Blofeld was fantastic, felt like I was watching a soon to be iconic scene. I couldn't get over how perfectly crafted this film was, I truly loved Fukunaga's style! His eye for great cinematography is also perfect! He might be my favourite Bond director, or at least tied with Sam Mendes! The movie also elegantly modernized the Bond formula and continued to modernize the character, without ruining him, which I really appreciated! Definitely the highlight is seeing his emotional side, and the way they drew parallels to and reversed ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was really ingenious. Honestly the film is pretty much perfect to me. I love the Shakespearean like tragedy of the ending, it hits so well and brings all the emotions! The film has excellent pacing, it moves quickly and every scene seems to build on the last, I enjoyed every second of the movie! It's the longest Bond film, but I didn't feel the length at all. The sound mix is also very impressive, especially in IMAX, and Hans Zimmer brings such an intense and memorable score to the film, perfectly highlighting the impact of action and emotional scenes. I loved seeing all the MI6 returning characters, from M to Q and Moneypenny, and Blofeld and Felix were also awesome additions to the mix. I'm so happy they brought back Madeleine Swann and the plotline they gave her character was really interesting, I just love the dynamic it brought to the film. Nomi, the new 007 at MI6 is actually a really interesting character and I love the banter she has with Bond (but don't worry by the end 007 is Bond again). This movie to me is perfect, it's exactly what it needed to be, and will forever be an iconic part of James Bond history, as it did something no other film in the franchise has done before. That emotional ending really hit and I won't be forgetting it anytime soon. It's bold, and like the rest of the movie was excellently done. As much as I love Connery, with this film Craig cements himself as my favourite Bond! I love the way they modernized the character and films during his tenure, and this film really was the perfect conclusion! I highly recommend seeing this, it's right up there with the likes of Skyfall and Casino Royale for me! This movie really has it all!",No Time to Die

It makes me think why we can't have great character deaths like this, why did Han Solos death have to be so lack luster. I can only pray now that Lashana Lynch's Nomi movie is treated as a spinoff and not the next Bond, and after that the series is rebooted with Michael Fossbender as Bond in the 60s. It was a bittersweet ending and thats perfect.",No Time to Die

Hans Zimmer went above an beyond again mixing all the signiture Bond sounds into brand new heart-pumping sequences. Ana de Armas makes an appearence as the absolutely charming Paloma - a Cuban agent sent to help Bond in a mission. You will not be able to prevent yourself from smiling for every classy moment Ana is on screen. Cary Joji Fukunaga, a director known for TV more than feature-length films, did an excellent job in No time to Die. The camera moves were all with emotion and purpose allowing the viewer to easily understand what is happening. No cheap quick cuts and shaky cam! Unfortunately the entire production is let down by a story that is a little bloated and contrived. All twists and turns are predictable with absolutely no sense of wonder.

He far outstayed his time as Bond IMO. I watched the Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan Bond movies and o finally got why the Bond movies are such a big deal and why they've made Bond movies for decades.

The plot is convoluted at times It involves a bioweapon which does not make much sense at all and how it got to be developed. James Bond is supposed to prevent this iill defined bioweapon from being released. To make this plot plausible and exciting , you need an idea of how this bioweapon came to be and who invented it. The reality is that you spend time understanding this bioweapon and in the end you are completely loss how this occurred. Secondly the movie is too long and it is very slow in developing this plot. Thirdly the Daniel Craig does a commendable job but the plot does not fit the character of a James Bond. Rami Malek is an interesting character but the reality he plays same type of character in several movies i have seen him in and he remind me of the solider in the series Pacific He plays a typical weird evil man with a scar on his face.

834,Light52,Almost Everything I Wanted It to Be,8,8 October 2021,"This is a great film. The action is fantastic, the story is engaging, and you can tell everyone involved was giving their all. I'm a huge James Bond fan, having read a few novels (working on reading them all) and seeing several of the movies. I was super excited for this movie and I'm so glad that all the waiting has paid off and hasn't left me feeling disappointed. My one gripe is that the villain is totally one-dimensional, but I can get over that as long as I get to see some well-filmed, James Bond action (and I did). A one-take stairwell sequence especially surprised me. This is the best action in any Bond film to date.So, that's the main thing I wanted to say in this review, just that it's good. The other thing is that I'd like to address the people calling the movie out for political correctness. Now, listen, I hate PC in movies. I don't mind gay characters or trans or whatever, so long as it's done to enrich the character and story, not just force a certain political spectrum down my throat. This movie does not have that and the people complaining about it are flat out wrong. Yes, there's a black girl in the movie, but she's not the annoying black chick who one-ups the main character just because ""black power!"" She's actually an entertaining character who works with Bond and backs him up. People complaining that this movie is PC need to get a freaking grip. It's not PC just because a black woman is kicking butt. Why do I have to explain this??",No Time to Die
835,Mesina02,A satisfying conclusion,7,24 October 2021,"No Time To Die is a solid film that has good qualities to it but i'm not quite sure it is on the same level as it's previous entries such as Casino Royale and Skyfall. A problem that I had with it is that it's plot structure seemed unconventional. Everything seemed to be all over the place and that's not necessarily a bad thing, as long as it can be effective and not really ruin the outlook of the film.This film went all out with everything and I can tell that they didn't hold back, they wanted to end this series with a bang and they certainly did. The action was serviceable and didn't feel unwarranted. Daniel Craig once again does a good job at portraying James Bond. Something that I also noticed is that this film probably has the most jokes of the five films. Characters joke around in most of the scenes and it's not a bad thing, it's actually makes the scenes much more satisfying.Overall, a good final film that gives a proper send-off to Daniel Craig's James Bond.",No Time to Die

837,petertheteslafanman,Daniel Craig goes out in a bang!,8,9 October 2021,"I'll start by saying that I really like Daniel Craig as 007, and the Bond movies he was in were, overall, pretty good! This movie was a great one for Craig to end on, and he will be missed.The beginning of the movie was a bit unusual, since it did not start immediately with Bond on a mission. In fact, it didn't feel like a Bond movie at all initially. Instead, the focus was on another central character's past (and the movie ends by focusing on this same characters future) - which I found to be interesting and refreshing.The focus eventually turns to Bond and what we all expect and love: the explosions, gun fights, chases, and specialty vehicles.As with most of the Craig movies, the opening credits were creative and foreshadowing. I wasn't really a fan of the Billie Eilish song (generally, I don't like her music). It got better towards the end, but it was nowhere as good as the Skyfall song.The attack/heist after the opening credits was pretty cool and sets in motion the main villain's evil plan, which I found to be a bit absurd (like in many Bond movies), yet arguably quite relevant.Throughout the movie, we get to see many familiar faces and get introduced to a few new characters. I really liked Ana de Armas' character and hope she will become a regular. I enjoyed the back-and-forth between Bond and the new 007 (who eventually gave back the title), and Craig's signature dry sarcasm made me chuckle a handful of times.The movie contains a pretty big reveal about half-way-ish, which I don't want to spoil, but which, in my opinion, changed the movie and what it's message was.I am not sure where I would rank this movie out of the 5, overall, but I thought the end of the movie was very touching and powerful. I wasn't really expecting it to end the way it did (or, at least, I was hoping it wouldn't end that way), but it wraps up the Craig era well.",No Time to Die

I don't see a Bond movie for realism, I see it for the fun escapism of it all-To see Bond defy the odds, kill fun bad guys, be charming and debonair, the fun and sexy bond girls, stop insane plots. Not to be depressed, to worry about a child getting hurt to leave the theater sad. The creators simply did not get what makes Bond a character that has lasted 70+years in the public's imagination.As an aside, think about the endings of the 5 Craig Bond Films-CR-Bond doesnt kill Le Chiffre (yes that matches the book), QoS-Bond doesnt kill the main baddy he leaves him in the desert where he is killed by others, SKyfall-Silva's plan works and he kills M, Spectre-he doesn't kill Blofeld, no NTtD-Bond dies!Bond is supposed to be the ultimate in an action hero, but throughout the series he ends up being a bystander in many ways in the finales.Again, the creators just don't get it and I am seriously disappointed!",No Time to Die

No Time to Die is breathtaking from start to finish.There's no easy way to end a hero's journey, no easy time to die. But this epilogue for Craig's run is quieter than most. Don't get me wrong. There is the expected and unexpected flashes of action like no other film franchise ever, with loudness in extreme. It is Bond, after all. But No Time to Die is the apotheosis of all the Bond films, from Dr. No until today.Will the casual Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, or The Rock film fan find much here? Probably not. The film isn't slambang action sequences piled exhaustingly on top of each other.Instead, No Time to Die draws straight from Spectre and Skyfall and Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale in a magnum opus tour de force of suffering and redemption. Almost Wagnerian, really.The final image, Bond alone, on the island, remains exquisitely powerful. No cheesy line like ""For Queen and country"" or ""For honour"" -- Craig's tenure is not about sentimentality. It's about sacrifice for the greater good, It is the end of this hero's long journey.Long live James Bond, for it is No Time to Die.",No Time to Die

841,senderik,Easy to digest with a bit of a bitter after taste.,8,4 October 2021,"No Time to Die is one of the easiest Bond movies in a long time. The main reason is that the movie takes all the recognizable tropes of the Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton and Roger More eras, which made Bond such a success but add Daniel Craig's own unique way of portraying Bond. He is a hard man who tries unsuccessfully to hide his softer emotions. Killing of three iconic characters in one movie seems a bit much though, even when one was already supposed to be dead. Super weapon? Check. Evil organization? Check. Super villain? Double check. Gadget filled Aston Martins? Multiple check. Even 007 is a double check. It makes for an unsurprising but fantastic ride that, despite the length of the movie doesn't bore for a minute.

Overall, average. Great opening sequence. Classic and above par Bond. Cut to below par track for the movie (a talented songwriter but not her forte) and a flabby two hours of zeitgeist punctuated by occasional moments of homage to the genre. I think I smiled properly at the scene in the tunnel mimicking the opening sequence, the rest left me cold and wishing I had waiting for home rental. Some will love the direction it takes I am sure. And good for them. I envy them. Daniel Craig seems to have morphed into a more stylish Timothy Dalton. There are plenty of movies with cold, efficient killers. Bond was always a little more than that. The villains used to be amusing characters who held their own. Rami Malek, in the brief time he is on screen, seems bored. And boring.

I hold them to a specific standard and always have. I've always considered a bond piece should be a film rather than a movie, if you get my meaning. I'm happy to say that No Time to Die satisfied my criteria and was worthy to represent the finale to the Craig saga.It made me laugh, and it made me cry. It was surprising and suspenseful. The ending specifically was impressive and i'm reeling by how shocking it was. It felt incredibly poetic. It was epic and full of emotions. It was exciting, and action filled. The pacing was good with perfectly spaced breaks. I was so attached and invested. They did a very good job catching the viewer up to speed, and made it act simultaneously like a standalone and the culmination to a seriesto conclude i'm very happy with this. The villain was powerful, notorious and evil. The actors were great. The casting was done very well and the elegance of the series was upheld. Watchmojo summarizes it with ""it honours the classic era while still maintaining the gritty realism of the modern series."" i completely agree with that. It's ability to draw me in as a standalone film as well as the ultimate of a series was meant i could watch with my whole family was able to enjoy it as I did.

857,alex_pearse,"A patchy, unsatisfying end to Daniel Craig's Tenure",4,3 October 2021,"This film is a disjointed patchwork of the sublime and the ridiculous, so it's difficult to generate a coherent impression of the film as a whole. The production has been a saga of changing directors and writers -manifestations of a world in social and political flux- and it shows.The concerns raised about the overly ""progressive"" tones of the early marketing materials are mostly unfounded (with the glaring exception of the finale itself), but there is still often the sense of Bond as somewhat withered, emasculated protagonist. This is in keeping with a consistent adjustment in tone which contrasts with the bullish, unrepentant character that has been the mainstay of the books and previous films.There are some strong action set pieces, some beautiful cinematography and the opening of the film sets up a dramatic, plausible and coherent narrative that could have provided a compelling backdrop to a worthy final outing for Daniel Craig. The two new female agents are generally worthwhile, believable characters, neither of whom really get enough meaningful screen time. However, the story never seems coherent, or often worthwhile, and our new villain Safin never gains any traction, credibility, or concern until the thoroughly unsatisfying finale. I was occasionally riveted, but more often the story felt stodgy and uncompelling.Ultimately, I left the cinema feeling deflated and slightly annoyed. This is not an exciting, uplifting tale, rather, I got the sense that the script had been written with an intention of spoiling all the good aspects of Bond that have taken 50 or so years to cultivate.For a story arc that started out so promisingly, this is a bitter, spiteful end and I cannot understand why this film was made other than to settle some simmering grievances with the main protagonist and his misogynistic undertones.

867,gbanoon,No Time Die tries to do some innovation and I like it,10,10 October 2021,"Seeing all the negative reviews here, I decided to leave a positive one. I went to the cinema on the release date of the movie and I must say I was thoroughly impressed. This is definitely a better movie than Spectre. It was a whole emotional rollercoaster, from the beginning to the end. There were great action scenes (and my favourite are the scenes in Italy and Cuba), good pacing between the action scenes and some very witty jokes that I really enjoyed.What I don't get is that some people don't get that Daniel Craig isn't trying to be the Bond that existed 30 or 50 years ago. He is totally different. He gives the series much more suspense, a more emotional dark touch and takes things more seriously. He also is not the Terminator, he can still make jokes and I love the interactions between him, M and Q. Also in this movie. The chemistry between him and the new 007-agent is also something unexplored and very sensitive for some people apparently. I like the chemistry between him and Lashana Lynch (who plays the new 007-agent which she respectfully gives back to him near the end of the movie).I ended up in tears at the end when he died. He sacrificed himself for his family. Again something new, unexplored territory. He has a secret daughter that he didn't know about for 5 years. I liked this because at least I did not watch something I've seen more than a hundred times already in the previous Bond movies.To conclude my review: I like that this Bond movie like almost all the other Daniel Craig Bond movies tries to do something new and innovative. That's why I come to the cinema, I like to see things evolve. Not just stay the way they are for like almost 60 years now since the first Bond movie released.",No Time to Die

I had been looking so forward to seeing this for so long.The action scenes were great and the pacing of the film was also spot on for a bond movie and would have gotten it an easy 8/10 from me. However with the ridiculous move to kill off bond and to make this whole surprise daughter of bond, of whom is the reason he just gives up and dies just ruined it for me.I am so very very disappointed and won't be recommending it to anyone.I look forward to the next bond movie, if only so I can pretend this tripe never existed.Very disappointing.",No Time to Die
871,StarGP,Bond is gradually being softened,6,10 October 2021,"Go back and watch the earlier Daniel Craig films and the difference to this film is stark. Bond has been softened and in No Time to Die he's starting to not resemble Bond at all. He lets a female colleague fly a plane whilst he sits in the passenger seat for gods sake.The other characters in the plot feel like they are given too much screen time and relevance. Bond is a loner and ruthless killer. He doesn't go home for genial chats with colleagues and cups of tea.I very much worry about where the franchise is heading after this and given the ending it really wouldn't surprise me if a ""woke"" casting takes place to replace Daniel Craig. If that does happen this will be the last Bond film I ever watch. At least at the cinema, I don't mind watching woke nonsense for free on the telly but I'm not paying the best part of £50 for it to be preached to me in a cinema.",No Time to Die
872,Elisabet Jonsson,Craig comes closest to Fleming's Bond!,10,4 October 2021,"If you've read Fleming's novels you will have noticed how black their outlook is: Bond is a cynic, the world's an evil place, the enemy is omnipotent. But, at the same time he is a romantic. He actually falls in love twice, wants to settle down but both women die.When Daniel Craig's first film as Bond came I saw, for the first time, an interpretation that would have made Fleming proud! The film is dark, pitch dark. Bond is as passionate as he is an efficient, loyal secret agent, but he wants out.In my view, for too many a Bond movie is all about the action, gadgets, sexy women, exclusive settings all around the world etc etc. But that should really not be all. So it is very sad that films that are more true to Fleming's work should be deemed ""un-Bond"" because the witty comments don't arrive as regularly as when Roger Moore played the part. I say: Cudos to the script-writers!The two novels that have Bond falling in love are ""Casino Royale"" and ""On her majesty's secret service"" (OHMSS). Vesper commits suicide (Casino Royale) and the second, his wife Theresa, is killed by Blofeld (OHMSS). The second novel actually starts with Bond visiting Vesper's grave in Royale-les-Eaux in Normandy, where the casino is situated. We learn that he visits her grave every year. In that respect Craig's 1st and 5th films really respect the works of Fleming!So, if you know the novels of Fleming and then all the films made, you know what to expect when a few bars of ""We have all the time in the world"" is heard in the score accompanying Bond and Madeleine in the Aston Martin, on a mountain road somewhere in Italy. That song, sung by Louis Armstrong, was the song for OHMSS. To be even more explicit, Bond says the same thing to Madeleine -- that they have all the time in the world. I steeled myself for the inevitable -- Madeleine would die before the end of the film, and Bond be all alone again.But I was wrong. Instead we are forced to see Bond go willingly to his death. And we understand why.I would say that this is a worthy ending to this Broccoli enterprise. No more films are needed! Craig brought, together with the script-writers, Fleming back into the five films he made; the material from Casino Royale and OMSS were ""recycled"" in an intelligent way, and we really do not need any more films. RIP. Unless we want to follow the career of his daughter..., but that must surely lie 20 years into the future?",No Time to Die

876,viggostenstrom,Broken not Bowed,8,20 October 2021,"Craig's last movie as Double-0, Not his best (Casino Royale still holds that title) but maybe the most important. This movie gets the loose ands toghether and creates an ending deserved by the man who is (in my opinion) the best bond outmatching the nostalgia of Connery and ""swazz"" of Brosnan. The plot is flawed but only so that the movie could work, The whole Vesper's tomb bit was kind of dumb but you can still believe it, the jump the Rami Malek's character went from hating Spectre to creating mass destruction weapons was not explained at all and it was kind of an waste of an good actor.The addition of a new female 007 could have went very wrong if she was an annoying Mary Sue that threw every feminist stereotype up in your face but she ended up being a brilliant sidecharacter and a very good example of how a strong female character is to be written.Ana De Armas character Paloma brought heat and comic relief and it was a short but good part of the film when she was on screen.The returning characters such as M, Q Tanner and Felix were all good and Felix dying similary as Vesper was a nice addition (although very sad).Rami Malek was excellent and brought a more terrifying villian by only using good acting. I can imagine he took some inspiration from Javier Bardem.Lea Seydeux returns to play Madeleine and she was as good as in the previos movie and she also have good chemistry with Craig, the moment she got on the train and placing a hand on her belly you knew what was going to happen but the addition of a child was still good.Daniel Craig, My personal favorite Bond, the only Bond as of yet that has died, while yes the franchise will be rebooted and yes they will totally ignore this ever happening this still hits hard. Eventhough they could have ended the movie with Bond sitting and talkning to his wife and daughter over a zoom call sipping a Vesper martini he dies in the end, a hero, knowing he do not want to live in a world where he can't touch the ones he loves the most.Craig leaves a legacy behind and he has set the bar pretty high and while it may be raised even more by Tom Hardy or whoever takes up the mantle after him he will always be remembered as James Bond, with license to kill.",No Time to Die

It could have used a lot more of Ana De Armas as she's a good actress and made for a good ""Bond Girl"" but was barely in it. The story kept you engaged and it had good action scenes. The acting was all superb. Some of the decision-making was weird, but I can't say for the sake of spoilers, still an enjoyable action movie.",No Time to Die
884,jpcgillam,A fitting end to Craig's Run,7,5 November 2021,"Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond finds the former MI6 agent pulled out of retirement by an old friend, finding himself face-to-face with ghosts from the past as he attempts to track down a bioweapon that could put the world in danger, in Cary Joji Fukunaga's spy thriller co-starring Léa Seydoux, Raimi Malek, Lashana Lynch, Ben Whishaw, Christoph Waltz, Ana de Armas, Naomi Harris and Ralph Fiennes.The film caps of Craig's era as 007 well, tying several loose ends together while having an identity of its own, something Spectre struggled to do. This allows it to feel more separate, although the reoccurring elements from its predecessor can feel a bit forced, especially considering how most of them are discarded fairly early on.I liked the nods to earlier films in the franchise, although the inclusion of We Have All The Time In The World felt more like nostalgia bait than anything, trying to milk some of the power of its use in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which felt a little unnecessary. The journey that Bond goes through has a lot more weight this time, exploring his mind in a way the franchise hasn't really tapped into, and Craig's more raw performance aids this different direction.Though I'm not a huge fan of his run as Bond, I thought he was excellent here, really tapping into a more vulnerable side of the iconic character in a way that makes the film as a whole much more interesting than it could have been. Craig has played Bond from since he was an ambitious new recruit, and here he allows the character to be older, more world-weary and almost burnt out, but with a sense of dedication and tenaciousness that provides a great central conflict.This look at an older Bond hasn't really been done before, as even when Roger Moore was pushing sixty there was no real reference to his age, and so exploring 007 being thrust back into action makes the film stand out more. His performance is especially strong in the more emotional moments, which are quite poignant at times, and work well with the more action-heavy sequences.Seydoux is also really good, and makes the most of her more expanded role to create one of the more layered and developed female characters of the franchise, with Madeline's character arc just as important as Bond's. As usual with the series, the gorgeous locations are like a supporting character of their own, providing a great backdrop the the story and serving to create a real sense of glamour, the Cuba sequences in particular being really well shot.However, the plot itself is isn't the strongest, with the inclusion of a villain with plans on a global scale in a secret lair, which seems generic and cliched compared to some of the more grounded, grittier earlier instalments. The plot sometimes gets a little too convoluted for its own good, lacking an overall cohesiveness despite having lots of entertaining elements.Though there's a welcome sense of humour running throughout the story, a lot of the more obvious comic relief moments didn't really land, especially from the scientist character, who was far too broad considering the general tone, and came off as a caricature more than anything.Malek's main antagonist was unfortunately pretty underwhelming, too bland to really make an impact, especially considering some of the more memorable villains in the franchise. I think the key to a good Bond Villain is when the film goes beyond their central gimmick and explores more of what makes them tick, with Silva from Skyfall being a good example, but here Safin is just given an accent and a scarred face, never feeling like an actual person.Lynch, as a new 00 agent, gives the part energy, but the character is quite one note and flat, never given much of a personalty beyond complaining about Bond and she's never given enough to do, which seems like a waste of a potentially interesting character.As a result, other characters, especially Harris' Moneypenny, are sidelined, and if more time had been dedicated to fleshing out some of the supporting cast the film would overall be stronger. Though she isn't given much screentime, de Armas shines as the CIA agent who helps Bond in Cuba, really adding a lot of personality and charm to her scenes, and it's a shame she isn't in it for longer as she completely steals the show.I enjoyed the film, but it does feel like the edges have been sanded off somewhat, at times feeling like it's going through the motions, which gives some of it the impression of being muted and a little lacklustre in places. It definitely picks up energy as it goes on, though, and contains some superb set pieces that might not quite be on par with the some of the series' most iconic moments.Particularly memorable are the action sequences in Italy near the start, which set everything up well and help to set the tone, and the climactic fight between Bond and the henchman, which are gripping to watch.Despite the story being a little messy, I enjoyed the film; it's probably a second-tier Bond movie, but makes up some undercooked areas with a lot of heart and emotional weight, along with a breezily escapist quality that has made the franchise so enduring. After the fairly forgettable Spectre, it's a return to form that might not quite reach the heights of Skyfall (my favourite of Craig's outings) but has a lot of great elements and uses them well.No Time To Die isn't perfect, and could have done with a leaner, more focused sensibility and a little more grit, but it's nevertheless a bittersweet, engaging and often poignant final outing for Craig that benefits from more of an emphasis on the character dynamics than usual.",No Time to Die

888,apereztenessa-1,Extraordinary closure to the Daniel Craig Bond era,10,14 October 2021,"I believe No Time To Die is one of the best films in the James Bond saga - maybe the best.In reading some reviews -both from viewers and from professional critics-, I have been amazed yet again by how little people actually love cinema. Some for example have criticized the traditional elements of Bond structure and plot that can be found in No Time To Die, as a sign of insufficient creativity. It is misunderstanding that making a James Bond film is making a genre film, very much like when one makes a Cowboy film or a Horror film. The art of genre filmmaking is to work from the core elements of the genre as a base structure to explore themes metaphorically, to deepen the characters, innovate the mise en scene, or work on film elements such as cinematography. The analog would be a classical concert, where a conductor reinterprets a piece to seek perfection or explore new formal territories. Every time a Bond film has tried to deviate from its genre -like Octopussy or I would argue Skyfall- the result has been profoundly uninteresting.Innovating within the Bond framework is what No Time to Die has achieved with unprecedented success. The film starts with the traditional gun barrel sequence -signaling that the filmmakers understand the genre they are in - but the blood curtain is replaced with a top down white snow image. Variations on a genre. The very first scene feels intimate and menacing at once, giving the audience the feeling that ""this is a unique Bond movie"". The plot borrows some traditional Bond elements (evil man wants to destroy the world), but only to allow for innovation at a deeper level. Just like tension in film is often created by what's off-screen, Rami Malek's villain sense of madness is created by what is not seen or not said. And similarly, Bond's character is made deeper through progressive introductions of believable, increasingly deep relationships. In addition, No Time To Die creates some of the most spectacular -yet simple- action scenes seen on screen recently, and combines great action with extraordinary cinematography.No Time To Die is a winner.",No Time to Die

892,steinovereime,"I'm wary of P.C. going ""too far"", but I was actually suprisingly pleased by this!",9,15 October 2021,"Maybe it is more an 8. But as a Bond film (and reading some comments that is being too hard on it for reasons it doesn't deserve) I gladly give it 9 as a solid modern Bond film. Plus Rami Malek was wonderful (tho I wish we saw more of him in the film).James Bond is one of the biggest crown jewel in UK's entertainment culture. Another big jewel is of course the worlds longest running sci-fi show, Doctor Who. In recent years the TV show Doctor Who has gone waaaaaay down in quality due to new showrunners and thereby the handeling of P. C. (political correctness) culture. The problem is found in ""lazy writing"" where an audience then feel like they are being treated like idiots in the way the story directly tells them what and which is bad, and what and which is good. Now it isn't necessarily bad for a story to be direct, but sometimes the industry forsakens depth for the risk of losing it's (rather obvious) message. Ergo; the script has little faith in it's audience, and they feel it.So cause of all this I was very skeptical about this new film, to say the least. All the rumors of there now being a new (black) female to take the part as the next James Bond ect. Ect. Bond is a huge film! And the Bond films, about a man going around drinking, killing and sleeping with Bond-girls he doesn't really care about, was starting to get a bit old and needed to be more adressed then before. But dose it? Do Bond films need to adress it more? Do we need Pride parades? Well, any decent person might not. A decent person is a feminist, is not a racist, and don't care which gender you are or love. Most people are decent. But sadly there are people who are NOT decent who need to see the accept in society. And with great powers (in which a Bond movie has), comes great esponsibility. That is why this Bond film had to do (at least) something.Watching the film I was very positively surprised by the handling and navigating of these things. It did things in a very natural way. It showed us that times have changed even for Bond, and it also showes how we don't have to ""let go"" of everything that was good in the ""old days"", just like Bond. The new times brings people who don't know James Bond, where the number 007 is just a number for a secret agent.

894,rosebudfr,Too bad,5,3 October 2021,"This movie could have been good, perhaps even great, if the filmmakers hadn't tried to pack in two different films and pass them off as one. The first one is about vengeance, the weight of the past and trying to move on and trust your fellow human beings again; it stars an apathetic Bond in a car being riddled with bullets, wondering for a few crucial seconds if he wants to keep fighting. And Craig is damn good at playing this world-weary, disappointed, fragile Bond, whose life is twice saved by other people in the course of the story.The second one is about some silly world-conquering McGuffin that's never even properly explained or justified, chokefull of side characters to almost breaking point, and starring one of the lamest, underdeveloped villains in the history of the franchise (and that's saying a lot). Sadly, that dreadful version of the film takes over during the last act, where nothing really makes much sense, where the antagonist is given some really atrocious lines, and where the guy's lair even furiously recalls the likes of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the type of (super fun but super fluff) Bond film this installment should be a galaxy away from.It doesn't help that this villain's backstory, if you can really call it that, does not actually involve Bond, who feels totally estranged from most of the proceedings. It focuses instead on Madeleine Swann, a rather tedious character with a very weak, tacked on background and narrative function (so, what was her big secret again?? Why again is she allowed to visit Blofeld??) who seem to only exist as character motivation for the big baddie and Bond. The fact that Léa Seydoux and Rami Malek are almost the same age, when it is essential to the story that there should be something like a 15 or 20-year difference, doesn't help legitimize what is supposed to be central to the storyline. In reality it's all a silly gimmick that tries to pass itself off as Drama.There seems to be an attempt at recalling the SKYFALL magic throughout, but the crucial difference is that things felt really personal for Bond back then, putting into play not only his personal past but his very essence. Unlike here, where we're back to the more mundane 'I love this woman and wish I could be a family man' kind of tired trope. It doesn't help either that this installment tries to build on 2015's SPECTER, a film barely remembered by most (why are we supposed to care about this Blofeld dude again??).Hans Zimmer's score, in at least one passage, furiously recalls his work for THE DARK KNIGHT. Perhaps the idea what to make James Bond the new Batman, haunted by his past and trying to find the light again? Well that film had all the crucial elements missing here: a laser-focused narrative with strong character motivation and a memorable adversary that actually acted as a foil for the hero.Ah, well, the action scenes are pretty cool though, and the ending brings us back to the first, so much more interesting film about retribution and changing your life. Too bad we had to endure so much to get there.",No Time to Die

896,lpoggi,Worst Bond Movie Ever... Complete Disappointment,1,5 October 2021,"I can't believe what I've just seen, this is by far the worst Bond movie ever made and one of the worst movies I've seen in so long. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON IT!There are so many problems with this movie that I don't even know where to start, so I'll try to summarize them.1st, a Bond movie is supposed to be about action, about gadgets invented by Q, about a villain that has a great incredible plan and instead we found a romantic history, with bad romance, a movie that tries to be with ""dialog"" only to be incredibly boring, the lines makes no sense, the action scenes are so little and so boring that it seems that where just a last minute addition because someone remembered what is supposed to be Bond.2nd, the essence of James Bond is about it's attitude towards life, toward rules and toward womens, he is not a family man, he wasn't never intended to be a family man, much less with a lady that is 20Y younger than him. If you wanted to create a romantic, fake, boring movie about a romance like this, then do it, but don't call it James bond. It is an insult to the franchise.3rd. The ending. Come on, seriously? That is how you wanted to show the death of James Bond? After defeating a criminal in one of the most boring fight scenes ever, he just decides to sacrifice himself, not even giving time to Q to think about potential solutions?... no emotion, no thrill, no nothing.Do yourself a favor, if you are a fan of Bond movies, don't watch it. If on the other hand you'd like to see a very boring bad-romance fake-action movie, then watch it at home, there is no one single reason to pay for this movie.",No Time to Die

But the writers just do not understand Bond and what makes Bond popular and successful.No Time To Die was dull, slow, cumbersome, the villain was awful, Spectre was supposed to be this sinister monster in every Gov and organisation around the world and yet they all get wiped out at a party in Cuba, it's just another mess after another, shirt cuts, lack of story.As a Bond fan that's me done with this franchise, I've tried to like the Craig films after Casino but they're a poorly written mess with no thought out design for the character and team.Avoid this film at all costs.

They basically made a modern version of Dr No. The movie is too long that's because there is a lot of pointless chatting and too many characters. The action scenes are good but nothing special like you get in old bond movies. It is better than Spectre but not as good as Skyfall. I think Craig could have done one more Bond movie. I feel wierd at the moment because i enjoyed this movie but it hasn't left me wanting to watch it again. I think this movie would have been much better if it was written by people who understand Bond and if it was 30 or 40 minutes shorter. Visually it was good but could have been better. It does have a touch of The Dark Knight and Mission Impossible about it. If you like Craig Bond movies then you will like it but if you love the old classic Connery Bond movies then this movie will leave you feeling frustrated. I didn't expect much from this movie and was ready to hate it but i can't. It was better than i expected in these silly woke political correctness times. I do miss the real bond movies.

This essence of loss will stay with me for sometime and then the optimism will light up my heart and will wait eagerly for the next movie. This time it was different. A part of me was also dead along with the bond. We are used to see bond running amidst of firing bullets and we know none of the bullets will hit him. We are happy with that as we know that we have not come to watch a movie with realism / documentary. I would have tolerated a villain who is not as dangerous as others. I would have also tolerated somewhat boring drama. I would also have tolerated someone else would have became bond. But I cannot fathom how and why on earth Bond is killed in action !!!.

It was such a drag that in the end we almost fell asleep. I just don't understand why the villain wanted to kill everyone. Worst bond villain ever. Daniel Craig deserved a better send off.

915,bojanatinoco,From a Bond fan: This is not really Bond but...,6,2 November 2021,Ok... So I've been a Bond fan since I was a child and have watched every single bond movie there is and some more than once. I'm the biggest fan of the Sean Connery era but also appreciate Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan equally. The movie was very well shot and very well played. However this is the most emotional Bond movie I've ever seen and it left me a little meh at the end. I feel like I wasn't watching a James Bond movie. With that said I do think this is a perfect way to come full circle on Daniel Craig's run and if you look at it that way there's nothing much to complain about. But I do think that the villain storyline was secondary to some other politically correct interjections which honestly shouldn't be the main storyline. I just think they were more prominent then the matter at hand. Some movies need to be strictly masculine and full of action while others should be emotionally charged. Bond is in the first category. To each their own. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for Bond and from a long time fan I hope I won't be disappointed.,No Time to Die

""The end credits said James Bond will return"". Then it hit me as I was driving home.That was the end of this James Bond, white James Bond. The new James Bond will be black. That's why this James Bond died and died the way he did. They could have easily let Craig's Bond ride off into the sunset with his daughter but no, they want there to be no doubt that this rendition of James Bond is gone for good. What better time than now to wipe the slate clean and bring in black Bond, they are already doing a black Superman...why not.I don't know how many people will actually care about this.

Bond is more human than ever and whilst some diehard fans may take negatively to that character arc it helps audiences to connect and really feel his pain. It loses one star due to pacing which I thought could've been done slightly better, otherwise the movie is near perfect. I really hope this does do well in the box office as it is deserving of all the praise its receiving and more. Only thing I dislike is the backstory to Savin's character as his motivations are not really made clear and he is not utilised properly. I feel that if they gave him more to do he would've potentially become the best bond villain to date. All in all definitely recommend seeing in the cinema.",No Time to Die

It's not the tightest script, the epic travel scenes are not visited in this directing, but the guts of the movie does reach pure Bond level after some slow starts. The biggest tragedy of the movie-for me-was the villain. Character development, interest, acting, the age make up-all thumbs down on this one. It was kind of distracting large eyes and age makeup don't make the acting any better. I loved the change in camera motion. Daniel Craig hots his Bond stride in this as a matured version from the Daniel Craig Bond we met over a decade ago.Is it possible to recast Remy and do this all over??

Another Daniel Craig villain who was boring, no real story or reason for being bad.It started so well, and there were some good scenes (like in the forest) but again, I think the Bond series needs to have a serious look at itself and reinvent itself.The female 007 annoyed me with an attitude of 'This is how things are done now"".

The film has great visuals and the score is of course excellent from the opening to the end.Rami Malek's villain however, is a little too one dimensional for a Bond film (who's villains are normally pretty good). Returning actors again shine and not a bad performance among them. Ana de Armas' character was superb in her short appearance and was severely under used.The action wasn't quite as thrilling as usual but they still managed to keep my attention. Car chases were a little too frequent and long and could have possibly been cut down.Now the ending was something else.

934,tamaraj-08324,The lesson from this movie is that sometimes less is more,5,3 October 2021,"I think No Time To Die might have been subject to the inevitable curse placed on every Bond actor's last film in the franchise. Overall, I was very much reminded of the superfluousness and overdone grandiosity of Die Another Day.Whilst the film featured some beautiful references to classic Bond moments, such as the Dr No title sequence, I feel as though the On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Louis Armstrong nods may be bordering on slightly contrived.With an extremely overcomplicated plot, an endless amount of turning points and twists (Bond retiring TWICE in one film), excessive violence and tragedy, there was no time to enjoy. It felt more like an incredibly well-made sci-fi action Marvel-esque 'Mission Impossible' thriller than a sophisticated, suave, timeless Bond film. I think the producers made the same sci-fi mistakes as seen in Die Another Die, hence why these movies are so similar. Yet still, the film desperately veers towards creating pathos, but focuses more on the mechanics of the tragedy rather than the psychological effects and feelings caused by the tragedies.Overall, the movie is certainly not underwhelming, but in a sense it gave audience an excess of what they might have not needed. I also think the producers have given themselves the enormous challenge of somehow continuing the franchise from the tragedy they left it at.",No Time to Die

Cast is perfect, filming and directing are outstanding, even creativity with Bond's gadgets is present surprise.But screenplay and plot? This is outrageous it looks obvious that people tho wrote this never understood Bond, and that people who like this movie have never before seen Bond classic.I saw comment that one star reviews insult and disrespect so many creative people who created this movie, well get this - I think that all these people should be obliged by law to seek help from Psychiatrist.Let's just discuss the most important point: devastantigly negative influence of all ""action"", unnecessary violence, and psychotic villains will have million times greater consequences, than black 007 agent.Bond movie is not a place for political correctness it is complete opposite. To adapt cliche - bond is man every women dreams of and every man wishes to be - but they will never have him nor be like him and even more importantly - they never should.Yes, Bond's behaviour towards women is wrong, yes his enemies are also disturbing, but I see it as embodiment of broken and wrong part of every single one of us.And please, please, for the love of god - don't involve children in this.If you would really rather watch this misery, violence, children involved in some Norwegian horror set, than classical Bond with beautiful Ana d'Armas somewhere in Bahamas, well I would question whether you are human.",No Time to Die
936,loveasklin,Great action but boring villain,7,8 November 2021,"James bond has left active service (again). His peace is short-lived when Felix Leiter comes asking for help. The mission to save a kidnapped scientist turns out to be more treacherous than expected.No Time to Die is a good movie. There are some great action sequences filled with spectacular stunts and choreography. The score, production design, and cinematography are also great.Rami Malek's villain is bland. He does not have a clear motive and we have seen this type of character one too many times before. He wants to kill everyone, but why?Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond and I think that Skyfall (2012) and Casino Royale (2006) are some of the greatest action movies of all time. Craig's bond was a more grounded and realistic take on the British spy, which I enjoyed. He will be missed.As I previously stated, one of my favorite aspects of Craig's bond is their groundedness. This movie is however not very realistic. Bond is looking for a scientist with the codes to a high-tech biological weapon. This weapon is something you would find in a science fiction movie and I don't think it fits with Daniel Craig's Bond.I think No Time to Die is a good action movie, but there are problems. My biggest problem is the villain and the bio-weapon he is using. It's boring, doesn't make any sense, and too easy to kill someone with it. I still recommend you watch this movie if you have seen the previous iterations of James Bond. It does tie the sack together quite and is in my opinion a decent farewell to Daniel Craig as Bond.",No Time to Die

The movie is more dark toned and makes us feel that bond is in a bad position both personally and physically however that doesn't prevent him from doing his cliche action sequences.

943,gjgmwr,"A weak movie, and an even weaker Bond movie",5,23 October 2021,"I might just as well start by expressing my utter disappointment in what might have just become the worst James Bond movie ever produced apart from one condition... that this is the last 007 film ever produced. You simply cannot kill the myth, the legend, the protagonist and keep going with this series. The killing of James Bond simply needs to be the end of the 007 series, you can't replace him without loosing the whole essence of the thing. And don't tell me he'll e reborn from the ashes in the next movie because that is simply pathetic.Now as a movie, it wasn't great. Some good action, a bit of romance, drama and British humour. But it simply missed having some desire throughout its quite lengthy 2:45 hours. The film simply doesn't make you want anything from it. The cinematography and visual effects were fairly good. The scriptwriting was not all,
with predictable lines, dialogue which felt shortcut and other which had no apparent meaning to it.Malik, as good of an actor as he has proven to be, was a pretty weak Bond villain. Ana de Armas pulled it off with her performance, really adding something unique to the movie, but, despite all the marketing and talking about her, the role she played was annoyingly irrelevant and way too short.Daniel Craig was a wonderful James Bond but his performance here was far, far from the others. It looked as if he quit being the himself Bond to be another. Honestly, had this been his first performance as James Bond, and I don't think he'd have pulled it to be on another Bond movie.The whole plot around which the film has based itself doesn't really make any sense, and it's beyond any type of Bond fantasies I have seen.The portrayal of M in this film is very confusing and Q provided the worst set of gadgets in 007's history. Madeleine was clearly in the wrong movie apart from the first sequence of events which make up the first 20 minutes or so... and then she really doesn't belong in the rest of the film. The only part I could make any sense of was Felix's death, although, the way he dies, being partnered up with an undercover villain,
felt quite unadjusted.The ""new 007"" plays such a bad role, I really hope they don't follow up with this idea if they are to make another Bond movie. There simply isn't any profound exploration of this character, she's so vague and limited in the movie,
it's actually shocking.To conclude I have two options here: either the producers of this film have no clue how to produce a Bond movie because they never actually watched one before, or they didn't capture its essence and therefore failed incredibly with this one. Or, they though they had the bright idea to revolutionise the series and just ended up killing the myth.Sadly, this was a disappointment.",No Time to Die

945,E-39267,soft,7,13 October 2021,"I loved the first half hour. After that the script went bad (first 007 wants revenge, later he wants to save his family, what killed the concept), the action was gone and the drama started with some realy boring scenes, which didn't belong in a bond-movie. Ana das Armas made the movie memorable for me. For the rest of the crew, it looked like there was no chemistry. I even doubt even that was one shot with Malek and Craig together. It was all to composed for me. Scenes at the airport and in the airplane where bad. Most of the jokes where meant for the hardcore 007 fans and often not that good. For the rest the movie appeared to be made for the female audience. The end is saved by the music of Hans Zimmer, who did a great job (again). The rest of the finale was of b-movie quality.Besides the performance of Ana das Armas I liked very much was the decor of the Norwegian house, with the 1980's interior. Somebody did there a really great job and the camerawork was also the best in those scenes.",No Time to Die

952,Charland-Reviews,No time to fix this mess?,5,3 October 2021,"This is a very odd film, which feels far too melodramatic and miserable to be a James Bond story. It's more reminiscent of a serialised romantic drama or tragedy than that of a spy thriller. There are contradicting styles in the script that leaves the viewer totally confused as to why certain events or decisions are made and no real depth to any of characters that make the story plausible or, well, worth emotionally investing in.If you think back to one of the classic Bond films you'll remember a much more optimistic, simple and pleasurable experience. Every story was unique and the next adventure was a whole new mission. This suave and somewhat-blithe secret agent was solely invested in protecting national security and saving the world from unhinged megalomaniacs. Along the way there were interesting characters, exotic locations, beautiful women, stylish outfits, new gadgets and the most modern of cars (also fitted with the gadgets).The five Craig-era films have spent 15 years moping about the same event which happened back in the first, without really moving on. His Bond seems more like a 'prima donna' that leaves, sulks and refuses to help more times than a French trade union. I refuse to believe than anyone with his psychological and unstable emotional profile would ever be drafted in as a 00 Agent. What is also forgotten is than Bond is a secret agent, not a frontline commando - aka John Rambo. He should be stealth, intelligence and subterfuge, with only action and violence where necessary.Still, having actually enjoyed Skyfall (which subsequently seems like the odd one out in series) and having waited years since the last (thank you Covid-19), I accepted an invite to a pre-screening.The positives:
The 'alternative' 007 was actually a good character. She was physically imposing enough to be believable as another 00 Agent and is a good actress. Nothing worse than being told that a size-0 model can boot a 'pro-wrestler' sized henchman across the room and forced to accept it.The filmography was impressive. Maybe the large screen helps amplify how good the camera-work quality really is. Some lovely shooting involved.The negatives:
Rami Malek's character made no sense and was effectively 'cardboard'. To have an Oscar-winning actor and effectively make him a dull two-dimensional side character is a total under use of talent.The plot and script writing. One of the things that is known about this film is how the script was rewritten mid/post production, and it shows. It's all over the place. What appears evident is how the first cut must have felt too gloomy in editing, so the producers brought in Waller-Bridge to lighten it up. Unfortunately, adding in random comedy lines or moments does not take away how miserable this film is.The odd logic and lack of people. The reshoots have clearly affected how scenes play out. For example, instead of controlling missions from a control centre (think Goldeneye), Ralph Fiennes (M) was just in his office with Rory Kinnear, seeming almost low budget. The final scene was just six people in an office with a drink - where on Earth is the rest of the intelligence service in this who film? Clearly 'social distancing' themselves from this mess.The romance. The chemistry between Bond and leading love interest is about as reactive as a nobel gas. Flat and painful. So, to have two films of the same thing is beyond the pale.The music. I can't even remember the theme tune, so not even worth my time commenting on. Clearly it was so bad that Hans Zimmer instead decided to base the soundtrack using 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' all the way. Why plagiarise a film from the 60s and use arguably one of the worse films in the franchise? Clearly, Louis Armstrong was not available to decline.Treatment of classic characters. It's clear that the producers want to draw a line under the franchise and start afresh - pandering to the 'woke mob' and hoping that future tokenistic nonsense will prove as successful as the original premise was. Spoiler: It won't and never will.The producers are clearly inept at creating anything that remotely feels as good or as likeable as it once was. This is an institution and it deserves respect, not total destruction. Classic Bond films will continue to be on TV and still fondly remembered for years to come. I don't think this film will ever want to be watched again. That is what speaks the loudest.",No Time to Die
953,chandler_joey,Never trusting user reviews again! Bombarding it with low ratings.,8,11 October 2021,"Common every movie has it's flaws. But to bombard it with low rating reviews is pathetic. The music by Hans Zimmer itself elevates the movie to one of solid Bond movies. Each scene has an intense score and rhythm that just compliments the beautiful cinematography (beautifully captured by IMAX). This is movie is a spectacle through just visuals and music.It's not to say that it has no flaws. Is the villain motivation weak? Yes no one could every come close to Casino Royale in that regard. Is the new 007 unnecessary in the movie? Yes. Could the ending have been better? Yes.But don't let that take you away from the beautiful set pieces the movie has, the action scenes, the payoff that it pays to Daniel Craig character in the whole movie (with the iconic Bond shot present in the movie), the wonderful Ana de Armas who in 15 mins stole the show (such a beautiful performance), the music.Such a shame people externally motivated due to xyz reasons are bombarding good movies these days making it hard for a person like me to understand if it's bad movie or a great movie with 1-2 things wrong that make people lose their mind.

I think Quantum of Solace is a very underrated film but still not as good as its predecessor.Skyfall was decent and had one of the best Bond villains of all time but it still fell slightly short for me and Spectre's middle to ending was very disappointing.So I went into the cinema rather sceptical about this film but I have to say it's rather quite good.From start to finish it was very entertaining, all the characters had depth and were very likeable especially Ana de Armas and Lashana Lynch.Also I loved the subtle nostalgic elements throughout the film commemorating some of the earlier films, so have a look out for them there are quite a few.There's one thing I would give 10 out of 10 and should be nominated for a Oscar and that's the score from Hans Zimmer, it is truly sensational.However, I did find Rami Malek as Safin rather disappointing and Bland but overall it's doesn't effect this film too much.To conclude this wonderful film really allows the Daniel Craig era to sail away beautifully into the sunset.",No Time to Die

(Spoiler but not really it has nothing to do with the real plot) A new 007 is black and female while bond was retired blah blah. They make her so unbearable and obnoxious I have no idea what they were thinking. Her character was so irrelevant from the entire plot it's just mind boggling how stupid producers can be. They clear it up by the end by having them be friendly as you expect would happen but it's such a pointless role that causes nothing but disgust. While they overlook the fact that Moneypenny is black, female, intelligent, and attractive while also being an agent. So I just don't understand the need to this.

963,danielamar007,"Not the best, but still a good crowd pleasure",6,9 October 2021,"6.5/10
The movie isn't as good as ""Skyfall"" or ""Casino Royal"" in terms of quality writing and structure, but overall it's still a very fun movie with a lot of winks at the audience, and it overall felt a bit more light hearted with it's jokes,dialog, spying scenarios (and the ridiculous tech, which wasn't as present in previous Craig installments) but also at times, more emotional love letter to these characters and world, a goodbye, mainly to Daniel Craig and his his version of bond world..
Biggest Cons are :
1. Long run time
2. Not fleshed out enough villian (however, well acted)
3. Too much connection to the previous (and probably one of the weakest installment) movie, with even the main bad guy still present for most of the film, vert confusing for those who are used to see bond as standalone movies.However these are mostly forgiven as the movie is enjoyable enough to not notice how long it is, or just needing a vague memory of what specter is.Biggest Pro for me is the very well directed action scenes, despite having sci-fi level tech, they didn't let it ruin the action with over the top CGI or anything like that, and the last 10 minutes are great suspense and action from one of the best bond portrayals we got.",No Time to Die

The film is perfectly ok as an action movie and had an okayish plot (but very contrived at the end) but lacked the essence of the Bond theme - having two villains seemed confusing, and where was the big take your breath away scenes? (think the tube train crashing through a station, or a complete mansion being blown away, or the entire secret service building being demolished) - I actually thought the missile attack on the island had craftily been changed to fireworks by Q and all was well. Lots of car chases and gun fights just isnt the same.Im worried that contriving to get Bond back and changing the lead might be too big a job to pull off for a future director.

Sam Mendes should have Directed this not a fairly new Director known more for doing dramas. The plot was weak, the cinematography was not as stunning as Skyfall and Specter. I know Mendes didn't want to do it but I think he should have stuck it out for the last film especially if it had to do with a continuation of the Specter storyline. I didn't like the Bond Villan, how do you go from Javier Bardem and Christoph Waltz to Rami Malek, his character came out of no where and didn't have a convincing reason to go after Bond. I also didn't like that they killed James Bond off, in all the Bond movies he never died which is why they continued with the legacy. Are they killing the franchise itself?

971,liumike1981,A British Commando,8,18 October 2021,"007 has become a British Commando through Daniel Craig's portrait. This is because in the last hour of the movie he pretty much does Arnold's job. The villain catches Bond's lover and daughter and takes them to an island where he lives. 007 rides a Jet plane with an African woman to the island, kills every enemy and saves they two. The difference is that in the end Bond dies too with the villain but Arnold's Matrix survives. The story is over in the way to end Craig's era COMPLETELY. It reminds me of Sherlock Holmes's ending scene when he fights with an evil doctor and falls down from the cliff.Overall it's an excellent film. I ranks it at the same level with Skyfall, but still below Casino Royale. Skyfall also has a great villain. And our Mr. Robot does a good job from the opposite side to reflect Bond's heroic behavior. He's as talented as Heath Ledger. 19 years ago around this time of the year I watched Die Another Day, Brosnan's last episode. It ends in a better way, at least Bond doesn't die. Craig's 007 is a cheetah or panther, living a much more serious and cruel life.

That's no easy feat.Bare in mind this is the first time an American director, Cary Joji Fukunaga, had the job, a director who's mostly made TV, Netflix specials and a couple of low budget movies.

It was also the first time I heard Billie Eilish's there song, it's not bad at all. And the opening credit sequence is always something I look forward to, and it's way better than QOS or Spectre.

986,johnnyrcook,Script wrote by a James Bond hater,6,9 October 2021,"Whoever wrote and green lighted this script should be ousted from the movie business. Men love James Bond because he is James Bond, a solo secret agent who can't have love in his life nor children because of his profession and does not die because of his elite skill in his profession. That is the baseline and quintessential element that makes James Bond an iconic movie character. Whoever wrote this script and green lighted the script obviously isn't a true fan of the Bond story. This is a PC movie that squanders Mr. Craig's brilliant performance. A better plot would have been this: Bond is retired, finds out that M has created a weapon to eradicate evil with the side effect of the weapon getting into the wrong hands and could be used as a weapon of mass destruction. Bond tries to reason with M to no avail. Bond then has to stop M from the production of the weapon pitting M against Bond. Furthermore, Bonds wife turns on him and he finds that she is loyal to Spectre and helps Blofeld escape. Blofeld then plots to steal the weapon from MI6. Bond had to combat both MI6 and Spectre for the weapon. The perfect ending would have been Bond having to kill his wife and destroying the weapon facility. This would show M that Bond was correct and Bond would be reinstated as 007 again. Bond rides into the sunset to retire.....for now. Come in Hollywood, stop appeasing the masses and make good movies again. I just created a better plot in 5 minutes than you did with a 100 million dollar budget. Shake my head. Shame on you.",No Time to Die
987,johanshieh,Entertaining movie with decent 1st half and questionable second.,5,2 October 2021,"Daniel Craig is solid, Lea Seydoux is solid. Ana de Armas is a joy to watch. Lashana Lynch is good too. But Rami Malek? I personally don't enjoy his performances.This movie has a lot of questionable choices. 1st, Killing Felix Leiter, 2nd, Killing Bond, 3rd, give him a child; 4, Killing Blofelt right after introducing him in Spectre. They made this movie into a James Bond grande finale, which put the next bond director/actor in a weird spot, should I revive Bond? How?Also, I'd expect Ana de Armas to play a bigger part in this movie. And the pacing of some dialogue between Bond and the new 007 felt wrong.As a Bond fan that watched every Bond film since Dr. No. I'm really disappointed.",No Time to Die
988,raven-11881,No Time to Die - The best James Bond-Movie in my opinion,9,1 October 2021,"Writing this review of James Bond was very difficult for me. I want to talk about many things, but I don't want to spoil under any circumstances. My review is therefore divided into two parts at the first chapter ""actors / dialogues / plot / logic"". The first part is spoiler-free, the second part goes more into the plot and contains massive spoilers. The spoilers, however, I have hidden in the spoiler tag.Actors / Dialogues / Storyline / LogicThe plot picks up more or less directly from the predecessor ""Spectre"". James and Madeleine go on vacation and it comes as it must: No line has been drawn under the past and James is once again on the hit list. I won't tell you any more than that, because everyone should experience the story for themselves. Only this much I want to reveal: The story is very exciting, full of twists and turns and emotional. The whole film radiates emotion, something that neither Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall nor Spectre managed. They were nice for short moments at most, but never really stirring. Here, however, I was rooting for the characters throughout the entire film. The story is also logical and well structured.The story is also logical and well structured. Other reviews talk about the film seeming like set pieces that don't fit together, but I can't understand this criticism. For me, the film follows a clear thread and seems very well as from a cast. Some times the film reminded me of the series ""24"" with Kiefer Southerland, and in an absolutely positive sense.The dialogues are well written and fit very well to the plot and the logic. I never had the feeling that a dialogue was stupid or inappropriate. The humor is very subtle and that's a good thing!Daniel Craig plays very confidently and is in top form. He shows more emotion here than ever before.Léa Seydoux as Madeleine also showed an increase here, because she seems really human and is full of feelings and emotions, which she conveys well and believably.Ana de Armas as Paloma has unfortunately only a short role, but it is really great! I would like to see more of her! Is this part or her role a hint that there might be a spin-off with her as an agent? For me gladly!Rami Malek as the antagonist Lyutsifer Safin is also very convincing, even if he doesn't have much screentime.A quick word about the running time: The 160 minutes didn't seem too long to me. The film takes the necessary time for everything, and that is important and right! Exactly because of this I can develop much stronger emotions and sympathize more with the characters!SPOILER PARTI think it's a pity that Rami Malek's role was not made more. At the beginning you might think that Safin is not all bad and even has some good in him and James only gets between the fronts of Blofeld and Safin, but in the end Safin is obviously only interested in money, because he only wants to sell the virus he stole. And he himself also wants many millions of people to die. As soon as this becomes clear, his motive doesn't really make much sense anymore, because he then seems to be willing to do to other innocent people what happened to him through Blofeld and Spectre. It doesn't quite add up, as it just seems like rage and revenge at first. Here the film really could have been a bit more profound and ""gray"", without clear good and evil.I also think it's great that the typical Q-Bond gimmicks are finally back, whether it's a wristwatch that can trigger an EMP, miniguns and mini-mines on the Aston Martin or a stealth plane that can dive! I missed all that a lot in the first four Craig Bonds.What I also find extremely good is the highly emotional story from beginning to end. Everything James goes through, especially the scenes with him and Madeleine and their young daughter are really emotional and whenever they are in danger, I fear for all three of them! At the beginning as well as later when they meet again. Always come up strong Emotionon and this bring Léa Seydoux and Daniel Craig really great and believable across!The end of the film is extremely emotional and comes violently unexpected. I find it extremely mean and unfair, but that is exactly why the film is unsparing and realistic, because rarely end such conflicts without losses. The film is very consistent in this respect, which I like. Nevertheless, I really had tears in the cinema. Sadly, when the credits rolled, many of the audience were laughing and talking loudly again. What kind of emotionless blocks are they? I, for one, could not have looked anyone in the eye when the credits rolled, because then I would have been caught with tears running down my cheeks.SPOILER ENDCGI animations / action scenes / fight choreographyThe action scenes are really absolutely outstanding and are a lot of fun! Some of it even looks handmade and the CGI effects are absolutely worth seeing! Simply great! In addition, the film also offers a lot of variety in the action scenes.Camera / Scenery / EditingThe camera work and the editing are very well done throughout. There is never any hecticness, I am never overwhelmed and as a viewer you always keep a good overview. There are also some great wide shots and really nice landscape and city shots. All in all a very good camera and editing technique!MusicThe music by Hans Zimmer didn't really catch my ear, because I was mostly too deep in the action and full of emotions, but what I heard sounded good and better than the music of the previous four Craig Bond films.ConclusionI have never made a secret of the fact that I am not the biggest fan of James Bond. Nevertheless, I watched the Craig-Bonds on release and found Casino Royale good, Quantum of Solace only mediocre, Skyfall minimally better but still only okay and Spectre then again almost as good as Casino Royale. I also saw the old 16 films up to and including Tomothy Dalton a long time ago and found them okay but also very dry and stale. The four films with Perce Brosnan I found quite good at that time, but I was only about ten years old. Today I would perhaps see them with different eyes.No Time to Die, however, is for me clearly the best Craig Bond and even the best James Bond film ever, because it is simply extremely successful all around. The action scenes are terrific, Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux play great and very emotional and the story is very exciting, varied, full of twists and turns and above all very emotional all the time. For me, a great conclusion for Daniel Craig!In the end, the trailer promised exactly what the film delivered in the end! My expectations were fully met and even exceeded, because I was a little skeptical, because it is just a James Bond film.9/10 points - Medium rewatch value",No Time to Die
989,johnsage,Too much time to yawn.,5,2 October 2021,"Spoilers!!!I had such high hopes for this film which starts well enough for the first hour or so, but after that the story deteriorated into a self indulgent Logan type bore fest. The main villain is pretty incidental and so is the main plot, in fact i often wondered what was the point to this overlong epilogue? And then it hit me, to give bond an offspring (which hasn't been done before) and to actually see bond lose and die. Yes folks if you're looking for the fun escapist thrills of even Craig's more serious interpretation of the character, then you'll be for the most part bitterly disappointed. Because this time he gets outsmarted and killed, I'm sorry but the point of these films has always been escapism and fun, so basically we now live in a world where Bond cannot even win or survive .

You know, even though he's James Bond, would anyone just grab a rope and swing off a bridge, then ride on a motorcycle and go flying up a stairway just to get back to the hotel?The last outing should have been like Logan with Hugh Jackman. Instead we got Deontay Wilder in his trilogy fight with Tyson Fury. He looked good, but he sucked, and just gave out in the end.And the villain? Oh boy, that actor (I forgot his name) is awful. Did anyone see that movie he did with Denzel where he played a detective. Cringeworthy performance. In this movie he did the same thing. Forgettable.I'm glad two Black women got to converse with each other in a Bond film, albeit for a 1-2 sentences.

993,niamkairehman,Entertaining film with a poorly executed ending,9,2 October 2021,Spoilers!It's a fun and thrilling film to watch however there are some evident issues with the film. This is probably the last James bond film ever and you would expect a 60 year old franchise to end it with a bang but sadly this is not the case. Firstly the villian is disappointing. I would expect the most badass evil villian with a good backstory against bond to end the franchise however bonds final battle is against a creepy man who wants to end the world for a reason not even explained. He's just a generic man who wants to destroy the world. This is not the villian the last bond should face. There should be a a build up for a villian that kills bond (maybe over a couple movies or who has featured in a past bond film)and not a villian with a 5 minute talk and a 5 minute precredit scene.Now the ending.. I think the final bond moment should be as iconic as iron man's send off. Saving the world in a intense crazy unpredictable fashion but instead he just sits on an island and gets blown up which could of easily been avoided. He killed everyone on the island so they could of just waited and got him help and then blown the island up. There have been other bond films with more dramatic endings where he could of died saving the world but sadly this is how bond journey comes to an end. It should be a moment that gives you goosebumps just like how iron man dies and everyone is sad and happy at the same time. This is a legendary franchise with started in 1961 and should end with a ending it deserves. But overall a good movie as a normal bond film however as a end to the James bond legendary saga it is disappointing and they could of created a much better send off.,No Time to Die

Being a big Mr Robot fan, I was disappointed.Given its 2:43 running time, this movie feels disjointed...think Quantum of Solace. And it doesn't really develop any characters.

1002,swapnaneeldan,Just Appreciate Craig.,10,1 October 2021,"""No Time To Die"" is a Bond film worth watching. This film has a lot of perks and some minor quirks but what makes this film a sensation in the industry, is that this film is a perfect farewell to Daniel Craig's James Bond.To begin with, the direction of this film. Cary Joji Fukunaga is an exceptional director, and he has been proving that since 2014 when he was one of the creators of ""True Detective"". This movie has a precise choreographed scenes and some fine direction work with several usages of directorial trademarks of his, having only watched ""True Detective"" before. And the presence of several eminent actors just makes it feel effortless and distinguished.The screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Cary Joji Fukunaga is prodigious. But the fact that Phoebe Waller-Bridge had a substantial effect on this film was apparent. Although, I have to say that the screenplay did not feel as good as ""Skyfall"" or ""Casino"" Royale, but the simple reason for that could be because both of those films Bond and the respective villain have equal importance and equal back-story along with a considerable amount of engrossing narrative. But in this film, we pay a lot of importance to James Bond and his relationship with his lovers and other characters, which is understandable considering this is an end of another Bond era. And the feminist angle, presented by the writers, along with the introduction of the first 007 shows us that we need to make more female characters who have the likeness of Bond but not make James Bond female itself.Now, the cinematography by Linus Sandgen was tremendous. I know that he is already a great cinematographer, ""La La Land"" being a testament to it, but ""No Time To Die"" is by far, in my opinion, his masterpiece. He is the only cinematographer in the Bond films I've watched yet, whose cinematography is somewhere comparable to that of Roger Deakins' Skyfall. It moved me, although, I might be fairly biased towards it, considering this is the first film I've watched in a theatre after three years, that too almost completely empty. It moved me.Now comes the performance. And I have no other option than to finally talk about Daniel Craig's James Bond. And it is so painful for me to talk about it. I haven't watched any other Bond films, so I cannot compare it with those of Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan, but his performance single-handedly is as iconic as the James Bond himself. In recent years, it is common knowledge that James Bond has become more and more human. But Daniel Craig, does not just show us Bond's humanity but the way he got it. Craig makes Bond a character we idealise, not just idolise.Rami Malek and Ana De Armas' performance can be summed up in one line. Extraordinary yet limited. Both of them we great at furnishing the audience with their roles of two very iconic characters but both of them have not nearly got the screentime they deserved.Other actors like Ralph Fiennes, Léa Seydoux or Lashana Lynch were good enough for filling up the scenes but other than Ralph Fiennes' characters from ""Spectre"" not here, I would not like a separate film for any of these characters but the limited time I saw them in this film. A special reference to Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny are the only ones who makes me feel good every time they come on screen. Jeffrey Wright is great but even better in the previous installments.To conclude, ""No Time To Die"" is a film worth watching for anyone who likes films. Some scenes might feel a bit too emotional or empathetic for people who like the older version of James Bond from the 1960s or 70s. Yet, this film is a bull's eye at what it was supposed to be. A perfect homage to Daniel Craig, the legend.James Bond Will Return.",No Time to Die
1003,Boaz777,I had hoped it would be better,7,8 November 2021,"Just so you know where I'm coming from, I've seen all of the Bond films and enjoyed all of the Bond films and all of the Bond actors over the years. One more thing. I don't write many reviews. That being said:Let me start at the very end of this movie. I mean the VERY end where the credits say ""James Bond Will Return"". I sat through all of the credits to see if this one thing was there. Those of you who have seen the film might say to yourselves ""Then why...?"" That being said:For me, the best parts of the film were the action sequences (it is Bond after all), the beautiful scenery (and cinematography) and the beautiful Ana de Armas' portrayal of ""Paloma"". If she weren't already a CIA agent, (and if she was British) she would make a great double-O agent in a stand alone film or series. She had sex appeal, humor and she kicked A$$!And now the downside (for me). I was excited to hear that Rami Malek was going to be the villain. Unfortunately, his character is just not that interesting. I'm not blaming the actor because of my second biggest problem with this film (other than the ""Then why...?"")That second biggest problem is: This is one of those ""throw in everything but the kitchen sink, and then throw in the kitchen sink too"" films!The non-Craig films were self contained, with very little crossover as possible (M, Q, Moneypenny, sometimes Felix). The Craig films have been more interconnected, and that's fine except at the ending of the series, when you feel that you have to wrap EVERYTHING up!Thus Malek's villain gets underdeveloped because of less screen time devoted to him. He comes off as Thanos-lite, because more screen time had to be devoted to that damn kitchen sink!Oh and let me toss in one thing about villains in films, generally speaking. Not only does the bad guy have to be interesting, but so does the main henchman. That being said, Javier Bardem's scene chewing Silva was so awesome in Skyfall, that a better developed henchman would have been a bad choice.Back to this film, the henchman AND the main baddie were both undeveloped, because of the aforementioned sink (which sunk character development all around).Hopefully a side-effect of that was that Lashana Lynch's ""Nomi"" and Lea Seydoux's ""Madeleine"" were really, again, like Malek, in my humble opinion, not very interesting. Even the crossover supporting characters back at MI-6, seemed to be given very little to do, or perhaps they were but by that point who cares. The kitchen sink is too long. I mean the film is.Since they are recasting Bond, I hope that the producers will recast these other roles as well. Not that they've been bad, but let's just make a clean sweep of it all.I'm probably being generous with my 7 out of 10 stars, but I've always been a Bond fan, so I'll let it stand.",No Time to Die

The return to iconic sets did not disappoint. The introduction of new agents did not disappoint. But while I enjoyed the cinematic action spectacle what i missed was the style that Bond would typically exude. The story starts strong but important characters are killed off without care, almost senselessly and arrogantly. Consequences for joining a foreign military forces: none. Supporting cast does not enjoy any character development except the brief remark that Q is likely gay. The villains plan is not really revealed throughout the film and seems like a senseless act of revenge trying to revive events from Skyfall but less meaningful. Bonds final boss fight was anticlimactic and his farewell simplistic. The movie franchise fights with relevancy and tries to shake it's legacy which today may no longer be acceptable. Nothing wrong with that but execution was shallow. M seems to have fallen from an astute leader to a gullible pencil pusher.The movie seems incomplete. Many plot holes.

His performance pretty much holds the film together.*Ana De Armas - Hugely likeable and charming .Her scenes with Bond in Cuba were some of the films best. Unfortunately she isn't seen again after those.*Christoph Waltz - Such a great actor and always turns in a memorable performance. Again a shame there wasn't more of him.*Lashana Lynch - I was pretty sceptical but she was actually pretty decent as ""the new 007"" and there is potential to do more with her character in the future.The Bad*It's really long and probably unnecessarily so . It could easily have lost 15-20 minutes in the middle.*They made Q gay. Completely unnecessary and just felt like a box to tick to meet the diversity quota.*Lea Seydoux - Yes she is very attractive but Madeleine Swan is such a boring flat character and simply doesn't have the sparky chemistry with Craig that Eva Green's Vesper had. I just didn't buy Bond giving up everything for her and the daughter he didn't know he had.*Rami Malek - A superb actor but a very weak villain let down by weak writing. His motivation is unclear as is how he managed to afford a private Dr Evil-esque island with an army of loyal minions ?*The ending - They killed off Bond!! What madness is that? Was it not enough they had to infect him with nanobots so he couldn't go near his family again but then they had to drop a load of missiles on him.

I think it's especially stupid where Bond dies in the end and then 5 min later you put 5 big words on the post credit scene ""James Bond will be back."" Huh? Then why did you kill him? It's just wrong to kill Bond.Second of all, the plot is stupid. Bond movies have always been about the spy and his mission. There is no mission here. The plot is stupid, it makes no sense and as hard as they try to squeeze a few drops of tears from me I just have no emotional engagement in the whole movie. I can't feel any chemistry between Bond and his 'wife', and maybe it's me but the whole James Bond the family man thing ... i just don't buy it.All that said, I still give the movie a solid 7, and that's because if you forget for a second this is a James Bond movie then it is a pretty solid action spy flick.

While the action and screenplay is great as usual, I though that the plot was a bit weak, and the script was a bit too corny during certain dialogues. There were elements of humor grab which felt out of place (the scientist(s), blonde agent, etc.) and felt unnecessary to the overall mood of the film. The most interesting interaction, the relationship between Bond and Madeline seemed condensed (and hastily clipped on) towards the beginning and end of the film, and I feel that the film could have spent more time developing their interactions instead of back-to-back action and usual Bond show-off scenes, which led to the ending delivery falling a bit short. Overall, I enjoyed it for the big screen action cinematography but will probably quickly forget about it. I thought the production value was solid; Craig, Seydoux, and Malek were superb in this film, but felt the inadequate plot and lack of character development left a weak impression as the final close to this series.",No Time to Die

The banter is present as always between the characters, the action is arguably the best it has been this series of movies, and the emotional journey we go on with Bond from beginning to end is a satisfying way to end his character arc.As far as complaints go, while I don't have that much of a problem with the runtime, I will admit some parts drag on longer than others. And Rami Malek does bring a good proformance but his character in this movie seems relatively weak.Other than that I had a really good time, and I am glad to see Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond come to an end in the best way it could've.",No Time to Die

You cant kill the man with the name above the door. Where do you go from here? Is this the end of the franchise? Did they really decide they were all done with Bond and that there won't be another film?Bond always drives off into the sunset, gone for a while but always ready to come back for the next mission.

Eva Green as Vesper gave the whole Bond Series the Emotional touch which was allays present. They had a mission with Daniel Craig and they completed it. Even we had some downfall in the Series if you see the whole, I think its by far the best made bond series.After all this trash we got from other Streaming Platform in this Pandemic I am happy to see, we still can make good movies.Yes, it came to an end, and for the people who think ""a bond never died before"" they forgot that the mission from the beginning with Daniel Craig and Casino Royale was never to be a copy of the old movies. He loved much more, he had much more emotions, and he went through a quite painful way, which we have never seen before in a Bond. And if you see the whole there was no other outcome for this series, as his death. He lost Vesper and now he lost Madeleine in a very harmful way. That was one of the most badass moves a villain can do. He broke Mister Bond. But still he smiled when the rockets are about to hit. I admit they played hard with emotions, trust and lost relationships from the past, but see it as a Series, that has come to an end. Its over. I loved how they connected the Movies together; this gave us a much deeper connection to the actors. If you try to see this movie as a ""Single Movie"" you did not understand what they tried to do.I don't understand the political reviews, if you interpret very very deeply just because you hear the name of another Nation in the Movie, then the politics would only be touched. But this is not a political movie, they did not want to set it up political and is far far in the background. We had Bonds where the politics is much more in front and not even this Bonds where political bondsThis movie is the logical ending for our Bond series. The starting scene is the best starting scene ever made in a bond. This is what we deserved this is what Daniel Craig deserved. We raise our glasses for the last martini.Madeleine - Lea Seydoux
Her cast is so passive and so present at the same time. She is there and you feel her pain she went by even she don't talk about it a lot. The harmony with Bond was just on point, not to much, not to less. I loved her cast in this Movie.Paloma - Ana de Armas
The same here, she had her occurs it matched perfectly and gave the movie a special touch. Well done.Nomi - Lashana Lynch
First I was worried about her role. I was not sure how they implement her without steal the show or see her to much in the Movie. But even here, her occurs was well mixed and never put on.Diversity -
Bond is one of the only Movies where they add Diversity without looking put on. It comes so natural and not too much that it's just there. Well, done here as well.Mister Bond - Daniel Craig
Thank You Daniel for putting every Cell into the Bond Series and the last Movie. That was amazing what a great ending for you!On top of that the music and the camera movement was made much better than in many other big blockbusters.

Main reason why i liked ""No Time to Die"" was the fact that they tried to do something different, finally. My main issue with Bond has always been that it's little bit too predictable and safe. When Bond movie has interesting villains, it's at least fun to watch these movies as solid action movies. I'm sure lots of people, who wanted most basic, mainstream Bond movie with ""No Time to Die"", will be disappointed. But to me, last hour of ""No Time to Die"" was one of the most interesting and refreshing takes on Bond ever. Also, it was very well directed and acting was good.

From my experience, ""idiots"" makes the other two seem redundant. This film really seems to be a massive vanity project for Craig, who admittedly made a fresh turn on Bond for a while. He appears to be bent on running the same ""look, Bond is emotionally vulnerable, has baggage and can age"" thing into the ground. We've covered that territory, Daniel. Let it go. Yes, we know you're an actor and want to explore your characters. But you're still hitting the same themes you did in your first go round and much of that was already covered by Lazenby. Nothing new was brought to the table here. The villain was weak, his motivations vague and jumbled. Honestly, does anyone over a hundred pounds, soaking wet, holding a brick, buy Rami ""Overbite"" Malek as 'menacing"" to anything other than maybe an apple? Let's forget that James once again found the ""love of his life"" (I think that's 3 now) and has a child with her. That self indulgent poop feels like a demand from an actor. Can we focus on the self sacrificial ending that Bond has? They killed James Bond and gave Craig a ""blaze of glory"" coup de gras. Pretty sure that was also a demand from the actor. He has said in interviews he wanted Bond to die. Well, this movie killed James Bond in more ways than one. I'll just look forward to Anthony Horovitz's next Fleming style novel and ignore the films from now on. This film only rated a 3 because Zimmer's score was truly excellent as always.

Sadly not great.",7,10 October 2021,"Bond and Craig fans will want to see it.But film does not achieve greatness due to writing and direction and casting.I would tell director, Fukunaga, to watch films like Casablanca, and learn how directing and camerawork and editing, with cooperation with the actors, raised that film from a 'B' movie to great. Was the power of Ingrid Bergman due only to script and acting? No, camera and editing are crucial. Lea Seydoux, and therefore the audiences and film, are let down by the directors lack of insight, care, or skill. Or watch Casino Royale and Eva Green.Action is very good, but a Bond movie cannot be great on that alone. And the story has many intelligent self-reflections on Bond, the history of Bond movies, Craig's Bond, and our society as it has moved, or not, from 1960's. But the script is not 'tight'. Again, the action moves and has pace, but the film overall and the plot flounder.Rami is a very very good actor, but he is mis-cast and/or mis-directed as super-villain. The super-villian needs to exude power, some charisma, and be memorable, if a bit less than Bond. Rami does not. That. Despite all the Bond and film witticism, weakens the whole need for Bond, or the film.Ana de Armas is a find. The music and opening credits are not Bond worthy despite clever use of Bond camera-shutter/gun-barrel trope, as good as Ellish (or Zimmer) could be.

Would have never imagined in a thousand years that I would get so teary eyed during a Bond movie.5 years after retiring from active service, Bond finds himself in the middle of a potential biological warfare when he agrees to help the CIA rescue a scientist from the hands of mysterious foe.A lot has changed over the years for James Bond. The Daniel Craig storyline has taken the series in a new direction. The movies are now connected (you need to watch all of them to truly enjoy or even follow the plot). Bond's transformation from a cold blooded trigger happy spy to someone, who wants to settle down is a game changer & more apt for the modern world. His transformation is beautiful. Craig's Bond barely speaks a few sentences in his first outing and by the end of NTTD, he is cracking jokes and bonding.Craig's Bond will remain memorable for ages to come. 15 years is a long time and the end of an era. Returning cast members; Ralph Fiennes, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Christoph Waltz & Jeffrey Wright all do a fine job. New cast members Lashana Lynch, Ana de Armas (in a cameo) & Rami Malek are exceptional. Would love to see Lynch & Armas return in future films. Malek's character doesn't really have his priorities straight. His intentions don't make much sense thereby making this Bond villain a tad bit under baked.No Time To Die maybe 163 minutes long but it doesn't feel like it. It keeps you glued with back to back high octane set pieces (the one set in Cuba with Ana de Armas was my favourite). Phoebe Waller-Bridge's presence is felt throughout the movie. There is a lot of subtle humor injected throughout the movie.This Bond movie is unlike no other. The modern world needs a character with whom you can connect & actually care for.

But I digress.One of the most important aspects of any Bond movie is the character of the villain; it's essential that Bond has a worthy adversary. Skyfall had the advantage of the excellent Javier Bardem. Spectre had Christoph Waltz (say no more). NTTD has Rami Malek, who is sadly lacking in both stature and screen presence. He's no Bond villain and it's a mystery why he was chosen for the role.The plot is SO confusing. After 20 minutes I was struggling to keep track. And every Bond movie should open with an exciting Bond action sequence. It was a huge mistake to focus instead on a back story involving the dreary blonde woman that James took up with at the end of Spectre.On the plus side, I liked the opening credits and the title song was OK.

The first 20 mins or so are really solid but after the title sequence the direction felt off. The colours were far too dull, Bond was too human which for me was a problem, and plenty of storyline points were very poor. Plus the villain was utter trash. Ana de Armas does rock in this but she is painfully underused. Give her more screen time! The soundtrack from Zimmer is quite good however.The ending does hit hard emotionally. But I feel it's just papering over the cracks of the film which is also hampered by its filthy run time. You are stuck in treacle on more than one occasion.This reminds of the final Game of Thrones season. It's got enough to keep you entertained but just doesn't feel right and should have been better.

It's an elaborate ambiguous attempt to explain Bonds imminent demise at the hands of an insipid villain with little more panache than rotten cabbage on a sunny day.It panders to multiculturalism, sexual orientation and whatever Guardian readers delight over a skinny latte and couscous salad.We don't need to know Q is gay or indeed, forcing the audience to choke on a black female 007 agent with misplaced attitude in a deliberate sexual power play? It is demeaning for her and patronising to the audience.It's a ridiculous nod to cultural diversity on steroids.That is how you ridicule the audience and steer away from much needed escapist expediency.Bottom line, the Producers need replacing for sanctioning an insulating end to the most iconic celebrated franchise of all time.No more Bond.

1043,TylerWebb19,The Cost of 007,8,2 October 2021,"If you've enjoyed the previous Bond films that star Daniel Craig then you shouldn't have much of an issue with this one.It's a relatively slow paced film perhaps compared to other entries in the series and a tad longer too, yet this doesn't retract from the film or make it boring. The film is enjoyable to watch and the action is good as always. Furthermore, the film has many intense moments throughout the plot which keep you engaged and makes for a thrilling experience.This movie carries a hint of tragedy throughout; you feel and understand the pain Bond bears. This allows for you to feel as if you have a greater awareness of his suffering that he's experienced across these five movies. Despite this, Bond's personality shines bright with the usual witty comments. Craig's performance is as good as it gets with Bond.I was a little disappointed to not see much of the Aston Martins which appeared in this movie. The DBS Superleggera and Valhalla are criminally underused. However, there is still plenty of vehicle action in this movie, just nothing in the really good-looking cars.Speaking of short appearances, Ana de Armas isn't in this movie for long, which is a shame as I regard her as a brilliant actress. Although she only appears briefly, her scenes are incredibly fun to watch. She's funny and, well you know what. Her character delivers some cool action with excellent choreography, so it was good to see her in this movie.Rami Malek's character, Safin, isn't the greatest Bond villain, however this movie is much more about James rather than the villain or the mission at stake. The performance from Malek is good. I also appreciate the make-up used on Malek's face to give him a disfigured appearance, reflective of his character's personality. Safin isn't the most exciting villain, but I don't find this takes anything away from the movie as the villain isn't the central focus of this movie. If anything he's more of a plot device used against James to push him to his limits'No Time to Die' is a fitting and satisfying end to the Craig-Bond era. Ultimately it's a movie not about the Villain, or the new deadly weapon, but a movie solely about James Bond. You may think that's a given, however I want to hammer home that this is a character driven story, more so than the last four, which explores how James' lack of trust is in the end his greatest adversary.

A lot of plot holes with the story, I just don't see the motives for the villain for his actions. Also, hinting Q as being gay was just ridiculous. And I don't mean as him being gay or not, but how they just shoved it in there for no reason, bringing nothing to the story or the character. And same goes for the new 007.

An excuse for a story containing of a string of unconvincing plot devices glued together by senseless action scenes.The actors sleepwalk through the whole thing. Craig? Wasted. Fiennes? Wasted. Waltz? Wasted. Malek? Wasted. It's almost impossible to believe that somebody was able to do so little with such a cast. Action and musical score are by the numbers.The central McGuffin about DNA-encoded nano-assasination is so sci-fi that it makes Moonraker a documentary in comparison. And it certainly does not help that the film can't decide what it want's to be: A bit of spy movie here, a bit of Rambo there, let's add some Saving Private Ryan and of course dont forget to include some real drama. The finale reminds eerily of Rogue Squadron. Too much of everything but too little of anything good.The producers obviously decided to make all Craig movies into one big story arc in which everything and everybody is interconnected. Flemings books actually built on each other and gave the main character some room for development. It would have been interesting so see a reboot, that really followed the original story line.

The film No Time to Die feels like a James Bond film because of the presence of Ana de Armas as Paloma.Paloma is the perfect Bond Girl painting. If only James Bond had his character shown in the films Specter and Ana de Armas as the main Bond Girl, then the value of this film would be 9.5, almost perfect to 10.

He was absolutely brilliant in Mr. Robot but everything he's been in on the big screen has not been good. I never understood him getting the Oscar for best actor as Freddie Mercury.I think what a lot of people are having issues with is the finale. James Bond is not meant to die. He saves the world and jumps into bed with the female lead character. A Bond movie is about escapism and not about loss... something that we currently don't need reminding of when sitting in the cinema while living in a pandemic. We want to be entertained and given hope that everything will turn out just fine.The new 007 character is just an aggro, jealous and arrogant woman who's nothing more than a waste of space that doesn't do anything important for the story.The story... ya... hhhmmmm. It starts off well and gets a bit messy with all the twists and turns making the 163 minutes a tad too long for this story. But.... it's not the worst Bond movie I've experienced.

1057,ktokuno,Worth every moment,9,18 October 2021,"This is one my favorite James Bond films and I've seen all but a handful of them. Sure, it follows the same old script: impossible car chases and narrow escapes; a megalomaniac villain intent on ending the world; and the gadgets, but these are all what make the franchise what it has been for nearly 60 years.What I like about this movie is the drama itself. The story keeps your attention because of the deeper emotional content involved in the relationship between Bond and a woman he clearly loves. Craig is a good actor and makes his love for Madeleine believable. Lea Seydoux as Madeleine is effective in her role, as well. An added dimension that adds extra tension is the jeopardy faced by two little girls who figure prominently in the story.The pseudo-science underlying the method that Safin (the villain, plated chillingly well by Rami Malek), is well developed to make it credible in this age of CRISP and mRNA based vaccines. It might be hard for some people to follow since it gets somewhat technical but, having a degree in biochemistry, I was able to follow the logic and I can tell you that the basic ideas are frightening but pretty much impossible, both from the view of nanotechnology and DNA encoding. I suggest that you just accept it and believe that it is a good threat for the sake of the plot only.Two problems I've always had with these films are: where do these villains get all of the funds and personnel to make their heinous enterprises function? And, how can they obtain all of the resources and the physical locations without being detected. I guess these are the premises we have to accept to swallow our own incredulity and enjoy the film.",No Time to Die

The plot is overly long for its simplicity, is unengaging and it feels like their are several emotional sections trying to make the film deep and meaningful, which miss the mark so badly they just seem boring and empty. The action sequences also manage to have very little sense of jeopardy and risk despite being full of near death experiences.It ticks all the boxes of a Bond film, but for me it was a film that just felt like a box ticking exercise.",No Time to Die

Surely they could have used his EMP watch to kill the nanobots and give us a happy every after FFs. It's not winning any Oscars so no need from my side.On the plus side it looked great.

But everything else is a punch into the face of hardcore Bond fans.Bond used to be this charming, smart, womanizing spy. Now he turned into this melodramatic cheesy and overall boring regular guy. It does not help that Daniel Craig looks way to old far the role too.I do not think that Ian Fleming would have agreed with this film at all.

If you're like me and you've grown up on James Bond movies. Including ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" ""The Living Daylights,"" and the iconic 1967 parody ""Casino Royale,"" this movie might have you more confused than preferred. ""No Time to Die"" is one of the most lacklustre Bond films I have ever seen. What makes a good Bond film, you may ask? Well, anyone who's ever taken a Genre Studies class can agree that the spy genre is reasonably specific. Unfortunately, the latest bond movie has barely any actual spying in it and incredibly cringe disguises. From a screenwriting perspective, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade know how to write a Bond movie, but of course, the way they write women is not up to par in today's day and age. And so, who else should rewrite the women's dialogues than Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the icon herself. And Frankly, those scenes were probably the best out of the whole film. All the power to Daniel Craig. I think he's done a great job as James Bond. I don't think I'd be happy if I were him, and this was my last hurrah.

In my opinion, he is the best Bond and he nailed it again here. He gives Bond a real depth I have never seen before. He is a class act.There are 2 weaknesses in my opinion to this film though, and hence my middling score:1. The bad guy. Rami Make is a quality actor. However, his motives here seem quite vague and (and this is the major problem) he is just not in the film for very long. These points detract from his overall effect to the drama. He is one of the weakest villains in any Bond film in my opinion. And villains are so, so important in these types of film. I feel you have to understand their motives and point of view, no matter how unhinged...that is what made Silva such a strong villain, you genuinely understood his rage. And you have to see a lot of the villain to see the subtleties of their personality. That just did not happen here.2. The film is far, far too long. Take 40 minutes of that boring midsection away and it would be maybe 8 out of 10. There is so much needless plotting and exposition in the middle, it waters the tension and drama right down. In the end, I feel the plot is actually quite simple, but it just takes forever.One thing I thought was done really well, however, was the ending.

1097,jdoliver-52763,Daniel Craig is the best Bond,9,13 October 2021,"He is authentic without being comically over the top. He does use a few one liners in this film that could've been left out, but the great story & action makes up for that. Skyfall is my favorite Bond film, but this is a close second. Go see this movie.",No Time to Die
1098,shanewilliamsonirl,A fitting end for Daniel Craig as Bond.,8,6 November 2021,"This film was very well done. It had a great cast, soundtrack and great action sequences. The negatives are that the villain's motives aren't very clear. He really needed more screen time to develop his character but he has great scenes with Bond and the dialogue between the two is great! Daniel Craig delivers an incredible and emotional performance as James Bond in this film. It was nice to see an emotional side of Bond compared to some of the very first few films. If you've been watching Bond for a long time then you will probably enjoy this film and find it very emotional. Well done Craig. The next Bond has some serious shoes to fill.",No Time to Die
1099,PghSportsNation,Stunning ending that kills the entire Daniel Craig timeline,6,9 October 2021,"I was born in late 1975 and I have been watching Bond movies since I was probably seven or eight years old. I used to watch every movie shown during the 13 Days of 007- every time that promo was run by TBS. My first Bond movie in theater was Timothy Dalton's License to Kill. I have never missed a Bond movie premiere since.In this world of ours, Bond movies allow me to go away for a few hours, enjoying the adventures of 007, whether it be Sir Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, or Daniel Craig. It's a young man's dream to be that suave, confident, and dangerous at the same time. To drive all the fast cars, get the beautiful women, and kill all of the bad guys in style.The formula has worked since 1963.But today's world has witnessed cancel culture and woke-ism destroy everything in it's past. Wanting 5'1, 90 lb women beat men up five times her size, and for men to be feminized and stripped of acting and thinking like a real man would.Bond is rough. He is a man that gets the job done for Queen and Country. He lives on the edge as any spy would being in that business. Bond isn't meant to be a choir boy.I have loved all of the Craig movies, and for the most part, was enjoying this movie, even tho the main villain was bland. Maybe the softest ever in a Bond movie.But to watch nearly 60 years of 007 burned to the ground with the death of Felix Leiter, Blofeld, AND James Bond himself was so incredibly idiotic, it took me nearly 24 later to clear my mind and write a review here.Every time I've left a 007 movie at its premier at the movies I've felt a little like Bond himself on the drive home. Maybe breaking a traffic law or five. I always left filled with adrenaline pumping and excited wondering what the next movie would bring.Last night I walked out emotionless, with an empty feeling in the pit of my stomach.Perhaps the next movie we will find out the 007 defied the odds and wasn't killed by some miracle. I could never imagine what Ian Fleming would have thought witnessing that ending. I think he would be sicker than I felt.If the next Bond is turned into a woman, or is bi, or some other woke incarnation it will be the end of me watching this great franchise.You want to bring wokeness and other garbage to the big screen, create your own character from scratch.Leave James Bond as who he is meant to be.",No Time to Die
1100,bijupillai73-1,Farewell Daniel Craig !,8,10 October 2021,"NO TIME TO DIE (No Spoilers)SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED ! A popular catchphrase used by James Bond for his Martini. Sad to say, Daniel Craig exits, leaving the audiences quite shaken and along with him exits a new found legacy of the macho Bond who actually likes to get down and dirty! 15 years of Daniel Craig as JAMES BOND. This movie has shaken and stirred my emotions! A rollercoaster ride for sure!It was a long wait. Ever since the first trailer of ""NO TIME TO DIE"" dropped in Dec 2019, I was excited for it.After the extremely long delay due to Covid, on September 30th, 2021, Daniel Craig's final outing as the iconic James Bond opens in cinemas here in UAE. I was like a child going to a candy store. The excitement in me knew no bounds as the last time a Bond movie came out was back in 2015 with ""SPECTRE"". Being a collector of all the Bond movies right from the first installment, Sean Connery's Dr. No to Daniel Craig's ""SPECTRE"" and even adding George Lazenby's (his only Bond movie) 'ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE' to the list, you can imagine why I was so hyped.As the lights go out in the cinema hall, the MGM lion roars, the James Bond intro begins with that small white circle popping out from the right end of the screen and Monty Norman's iconic background score, tada....dhaaang...tada....dhaaang....tadatadaada....(it's playing in my mind right now), I kind of wanted to look to my sides to see if the minimal audience present that particular day and time, was as excited as me! I'm sure they were as I did hear everyone giggling or gasping and a few even clapping!As a continuation of the end of the last movie ""SPECTRE"", where Blofeld (a terrific Christoph Waltz) was caught and Bond was seen driving away with Madeleine Swann (Beautiful Léa Seydoux) in his Aston Martin DB5 (so cool!), we see a Bond who seems to have left active service and is living a peaceful life of love and bliss in Jamaica, when he is visited by his old friend from the CIA, Felix Leiter (an always wonderful Jeffrey Wright, whom we first met in Casino Royale). He asks for Bond's help, thus cutting short his peace and serenity. This in turn leads Bond into the mysterious trail of a villain (a magnificent but not the best...Rami Malek) who is about to bring havoc to the world with a dangerous new technology!While watching the movie and realizing that Daniel Craig's (my most favorite Bond of all time) run is coming to an end, I had mixed emotions. I will tell you guys why I feel Craig is the best Bond till date.To me, before Craig's ""CASINO ROYALE"" came out in 2006, Sean Connery was always the numero uno James Bond ever. Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan were all good, no doubt. But Connery had a specific style, a voice to kill for and he was a damn good actor as well. And since it was he who started off with the iconic character in ""DR. NO"" and growing up watching his Bond movies along with Roger Moore's too, I believe almost everyone loved only Connery as Bond. Tmothy Dalton was a fine actor as well and his ""LICENSE TO KILL"" is very underrated to date! Pierce Brosnan was the perfect gentleman. Very elegant and polished, relying mostly on gadgets and tech with a sly look on his face that females were in awe off. In his Bond movies, he never got his hands too dirty! He was already very popular in the American Tv series, ""REMINGTON STEELE"" before signing up for ""GOLDENEYE"". But when it was announced that a new actor is gonna be James Bond after Brosnan's last one, ""DIE ANOTHER DAY"" (which was one of the worst of the lot), people were skeptical and even outright rude. Daniel Craig did not have the looks Connery, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan had. He was even rebuked for his blue eyes! Imagine how crazy people were!!! But boy did they all have to take back their criticisms when ""CASINO ROYALE"" came out. I had already watched Craig in a few movies prior to his Bond outing. The most fav being LAYER CAKE. And a few others like Invasion (remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers), Road to Perdition, Lara Croft : Tomb Raider, Munich etc. He was good but CASINO ROYALE proved that he was born to be JAMES BOND. The immense success of that movie catapulted him to the top. People started loving him. Even the haters had to bite down on their own words.So what made him different from all these guys? Martin Campbell (Director of CASINO ROYALE) brought out a human approach to the character. This was never done before except maybe a bit in Lazenby's Bond movie as well as Dalton's ""LICENSE TO KILL"". Campbell opted for a rustic and raw Bond instead of the over the top cliched ones. Thus watching the intro of CASINO ROYALE, that extended unbelievable action and chase scene, made me instantly like and admire Craig! As I said earlier, his Bond was more realistic, rough, grounded, got down and dirty and was smooth with the ladies as well! That clicked with the audience.The ladies in this movie are all astounding and gave good performances. Léa Seydoux as Madeleine Swann is not just a pretty face and Bond's love interest. She has a back story with a troubled past and when it comes back into her life in the form of the soft spoken yet dreaded Safin (Rami Malek), Bond gets into action. She cares for Bond but she has her reasons for whatever happens. The extremely beautiful Ana de Armas as Paloma, a CIA agent stationed in Cuba, actually killed it. She was thrilling and exceedingly entertaining! Her role was kind of a cameo and I felt she deserved more screen time. She was ravishing, her action scenes showing immense combat skills, wearing a sexy dress is the talk of the town. I read somewhere that she redefines the Bond girl! She brings some humor along with Bond in those scenes. Hopefully she will be utilized much more in the next installment with a new Bond! Now about Lashana Lynch as Nomi, the new 007, yes you read it right! She is the new 007 in this movie as Bond had left the Secret Service after the events of Spectre. She is capable and the ego battle between Nomi and Bond, when he is back for a last mission, about the 00 status brings in the chuckles. This is actually perfect for the movie, making it all the more believable and entertaining. She doesn't overtake Bond in any way but lends the needed support while also having an individuality of her own always. Naomie Harris as Miss Money Penny and Ben Whishaw as Q are back and they get together with Bond like old friends do when he needs them the most. Ralph Fiennes is of course ""M"" and he does his job well. Though Judi Dench is missed a lot. Cristoph Waltz is back as Blofeld and he is as vicious as ever and his performance is always enjoyable. Rami Malek as the villain Safin was quite good. He is a great actor. Mr. Robot and Bohemian Rhapsody (as Freddie mercury) has shown us his capabilities. But somehow here, I felt he wasn't as vicious and cool as most Bond villains. It's not his acting, its probably the way the character has been written. Or its just me and my thoughts! To me it did not match up to Javier Bardem's Silva from SKYFALL or Cristoph Waltz's Blofeld from Spectre or even Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre from CASINO ROYALE. And I'm only talking about Craig's Bond movies here. There are so many memorable villains in the whole franchise.DANIEL CRAIG, as JAMES BOND. What should I say? Let me put it out there again and again that he is the greatest Bond of all time. His portrayal of the character as a super spy, ruthless killing machine, but with a humane side showing love, emotions, that he too desires a peaceful life with the woman he adores is a brilliant addition to the franchise that the writers thought of to bring out in these times. We feel for his loss. His intense love for Vesper (Eva Green) from CASINO ROYALE and that he still misses her makes him to be like any other human being. But once the mission sets in, he is unstoppable.The action sequences and it's cinematography is simply spectacular! Truly an exhilarating cinematic experience and anyone who wants to watch this must do so on a big screen only. A small screen will not do justice to this movie's breathtaking action, chase sequences and more! The bridge sequence in the initial part of the movie is really something! A bike chase sequence that follows shows some exceptional stunts. Another detailed chase sequence including Bond, Swann and lot of vehicles that ends up in a foggy forest is marvelous to say the least. People are being killed left, right and centre but the scene is really amazing! Craig is excellent in these scenes.Music score by Hans Zimmer was beautiful and worked well for the movie. Billie Eilish's opening song was awesome. I had already liked it prior to watching the movie, but when it came on screen with the creative visuals, it was on another level! Haunting! Goosebumps!NO TIME TO DIE was a great farewell to Craig who gave his blood, sweat and even many broken bones to this role of a lifetime. His send off movie was in the capable hands of Cary Joji Fukunaga. And what an ending! A very satisfying finale!So it's goodbye to Daniel Craig. It was an awesome ride while it lasted.Let me end with a quote by Craig from SKYFALL - 'WELL, I LIKE TO DO SOME THINGS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY'.",No Time to Die
1101,thekmew-1,Loses it's way and forgets the original character.,5,2 October 2021,"The film is great up until the Cuba scene. From here it loses it's way. It certainly ticks the Bond Bingo boxes and there are many things to like. However what they do with the character in the end is not very Fleming-esque or in the spirit of all that came before it. James Bond always, always saves the day and wins. The Nanobots were a stupid idea that would be accepted in GI Joe and the fact that there was someone out there all along that was a as rich and deadly as Spectre is just not believable. This is on par with Quantam of Solace but even that may actually beat it due to the ending. Nihilism is rife in Hollywood and another main white male character is assassinated. Was not as Woke as expected and all actors were great. Epecially the high kicking new ally. High Point: The Aston. Low Point: The end and the Villain. If this director was to get a school report from me it would read ' Should have read the source material. Should and could do better.",No Time to Die
1102,ksviknesh,That's it?,3,4 October 2021,"Daniel Craig Bond movies where the most boring ones of all 25 bond films. The team just tried to ensure maximum boredom for the finale. Apart from the few - not all - action sequences,the movie cannot be even classified as a Spy movie. It looked like as if they wanted to create a farewell movie in courtesy to Daniel and they used the bond plot to do it. How bad. Oldies made an oldie drama movie for the oldies to watch. What a waste of time.",No Time to Die
1103,ChiefBogeyman,Say Who is That Man with the Gun Over There,7,14 October 2021,"The recent slew of Bond films have held their own and generally are pretty entertaining. The backgrounds and action takes precedent over the actors who deliver formulaic lines on Q. The production values have increased substantially over the last 10 years and candy appeal is definitely delivered. Trying to make No Time To Die a humanist film succeeds only if you can believe that Bond can fall in love frequently, therefore therapy is definitely in order for James. He still loves Vesper and visits her grave and now again deeply in love with Madelaine...wow, a man who loves younger women who quite honestly don't have much character. I personally have stopped going to Bond films for the acting or ho hum characters, but do go to get a visual palette of richness. This film had some nice sets and locations, the favorite of which was the Denmark - Swedish bridge and chases. Most of the film was TOO dark (big mistake directors make so that the audience takes them seriously) and it also needed subtitles between all the low lips and mumbles it is hard to hear some of the dialogue. That Bond dies is a good thing as Daniel Craig took himself too seriously to like him and also will give the producers room to create a New Bond which Vaughn has already done with the Kingsman series. I would have really enjoyed seeing a Danny Boyle version of James Bond, it if nothing else would have much more interesting. Maybe Americans should not direct Bond films.",No Time to Die
1104,xJULESx,Amazing Bond Movie,10,9 October 2021,"Gonna miss Daniel Craig in upcoming James Bond films, he was amazing as always in No Time To Die,but at least he went out with a bang.

1106,nancyb830,James Bond Lost His Way,4,9 October 2021,"Besides being unnecessarily too long, not having enough Ana de Armas, and wasting Academy Award winner Ramie Malek's talents on an uninspiring villain with too little screen time, James Bond has lost his way. The character is the ultimate survivalist both mentally and physically; he never gives up. He doesn't reference his aches, pains, and age -- he ignores them. In this movie he gives up, when he MORE THAN EVER has every reason to live. Who believes he would give up and choose death over working with Q and MI6 to come up with an antidote for his contamination? MI6 helped create it, so they can help solve it. And historically brilliant Q has been able to solve everything -- but he just gives up in this movie, too, basically saying ""there's nothing that can be done, goodbye."" VERY disappointing. James Bond isn't just a generic agent name, it is an established character regardless of the actor portraying him. Unless they open the next movie with ""Just joking, his death was staged for the enemies"" then this franchise has lost me as a fan. Writers/producers--what on earth were you thinking??",No Time to Die
1107,rulbike,No time to watch!,5,4 October 2021,"I had really high hopes for the film, especially after waiting for a long time for the next Bond film to arrive and this being Craig's last entry. All in all, it was a huge dissapointment with a lot of missed oportunities. It could have been a great film with the cast, cinematography, music and all, unfortunately the bad script and writing is what ultimately doomed this movie.To keep it short i'll start with what i enjoyed about the film:
The opening sequence was really interesting, intense with a lot of action, definitely a good start for the film, although a little bit longer than other entries.The new 007 was a good character, i personally enjoyed her role and thought she was believable as a secret agent and Bond's sidekick, i would like to see her in future movies as a side character or smthn.Ana de Armas's role was also very good, her sequence was really funny, smart, and enjoyable, it was classic Bond film action. Unfortunately, she was barely in the movie at all! She appeared for 10 minutes out of 163 min. (She had less screen time than Terri Hatcher in Tmrw never dies; for a comparison).Now, the areas of opportunity where:
Rami Malek, OMG! Where to begin?! Such a talented actor who has a long range of emotions and roles, yet they give him an undeveloped, carboard, archetype villian role, where his true potential could not be optimally reflected. He is barely in the movie at all! It is not clear how or why, is he rich and powerful, we never know his motives for wanting to destroy the whole world, we also don't understand his obsession with Madeleine. All in all, it was such a wasted opportunity. He was very weak. He was the typicall bad guy who is bad because the plot states that he is the bad guy. There is no sub story, motive, or emotional background, for Safin.The whole plot storyline and basically the villian's ""plan"" was totally unbelievable and idiotic for a Bond film. Seriously, I mean, who do they thought was going to believe such nonsense. Hell, even Moonraker's plot seemed a lot more realistic. I mean: ""Killer nanobots"", that can't be killed, and make you die instantly! Like seriously!? No explanation was given at all, in relation as to how where they built and what's the ""alleged"" science behind it. They are just lethal because they say they are. We are just to believe what they tell us and thats it.Lack of Bond's escence and tropes. There were almost no cool gadgets, action sequences and fights. No cool Aston Martin with invisible coating and what else. NAAY! Just a next to usless watch, which we didnt even get a close up at least to get a glimpse of the mark and model. No latest Aston Martin newest model, although we get some of them. Gone are the scenes where Bond did something awesome and epic; and the background music would cue ""taran-taran tarara.."" you know what i mean. Those scenes are no longer in Bond films who knows why?!.Anyways, it is not entirely bad but its not good either and its also very long. So i would recommend you to sit this one out and wait for it when it is available for rental in Prime or any other streaming platforms.",No Time to Die

1110,fredrikgunerius,Craig carries the sins,6,2 November 2021,"By 2021, all of James Bond's vices, except his bloodthirst, have become touchy subjects, something needing revision in a postmodern sociopolitical light. If there was any blood left to drain out of the 007 series, this definitely ought to do it. But granted, they do it with some intriguing, if not exactly fresh or playful writing. The filmmakers (the usual team plus new director Cary Jojo Fukunaga) are desperate for Bond to come off as a real, modern and sensitive human being - but only in an interpersonal and sociological context. For all other intents and purposes, he is larger than life and very, very sinister - like Liam Neeson in Taken, only without Neeson's wounded-dog-look. He gets the job done, then he gets the job done again, and it sometimes looks and feels as impressive and exhilarating as Bond can and was always meant to feel. But the filmmakers are always quick to bog him down and make us feel guilty for all the pleasures we have enjoyed with him in the past. And poor Daniel Craig, who quite possibly gives his most accomplished performance as James Bond here, is made to carry the sins of 26 previous outings and 6 other Bonds before him, and we all know how that goes, biblically speaking. It's a gimmick from which there is no sane escape. For all its overcooked flaws, at least No Time to Die tries something, to ruffle some feathers and hope for the best. It may not be entertaining, but at least it's not completely irrelevant.",No Time to Die
1111,robert-dickson-262-95220,Worse than I could ever have imagined,1,30 September 2021,"This film is far, far, far too long. They could have comfortably left 45 minutes of this on the cutting room floor. 2 hours and 45 minutes isn't even that long but the pacing of this film is so bad it feels like double that.The ""plot"" is a convoluted and overblown mess. Also for whatever reason they've decided that this film needs to be about 19 different things at once. Why?There are numerous scenes that simply have no place in a Bond movie such as the terribly forced ""I love you so much"" monologues.I'm sat here scratching my head searching for something that I liked about it and honestly I've got nothing.Please ignore the 8/10 rating this film has on here which was obviously paid for by the studio.

But that's about it.If you're a true Bond fan, then you will be very disappointed in this movie. Bond is supposed to be a masculine, girl chasing, witty man that chases gorgeous women and kills the bad guy at the end while blowing up everything Q gives him to be returned
Instead what we have is a gay Q, a female Bond who has become a father and wants to settle down but yet dies in the end..... Like I said, a good action movie with gorgeous filming locations and cinematography, but again, NOT a Bond movie.

1115,mentalpix,They should have wrapped it up with Skyfall,1,1 October 2021,"Craig proved everyone wrong with Casino Royale and sadly proved everyone right with Spectre and puts the nail in the coffin with this mess.The plot, if you can call it that is not just one deadly virus, but a bunch of them set to be unleashed because the baddie is, well, crazy - I guess. His motivation is never really clear and Malik is wasted in a part where he's barely in the film to begin with.I guess they couldnt have predicted the Corona virus epidemic when this was written or filmed but it seems in really bad taste on that angle and they had enough time to totally put this mess in the garbage and make a whole new film.The ending makes it clear that theres really no continuity to ever refer back to any of Craig's Bond tenure and the next film if there ever is ine will need to dump the entire cast in the waste basket and pretend this version never existed.It's kind of a shame because the idea of the black woman 007 was intriguing reusing Bond's old designation to a new agent and though she's pretty one dimensional, it's interesting to see Bond come out of retirement and not bear her ill will and they work as a pretty good team as little time they have together.But that's the only nice thing I can say about the film. Bond and his girlfriend have zero chemistry - you cant believe she's the love of bis life frankly - and the young girl actress is wasted too. You can't believe any if it really.Another secret island lair and and an army of obedient lackies seems sillier that Austin Powers making fun of the worn out trope a quarter century ago.Hell if they'd cast Mike Meyers literally as Dr Evil as the actual brains behind the whole thing it would have at least had some intentional humor!This is the most joyless, unexciting and frankly boring Bond film and that's saying something considering the crap films with Pierce and Dalton. It's really that bad.And they kill off Bond to boot.Why not let him hop back in the submarine plane and make a nifty escape and live happily ever after and no one at MI6 knows he lived? That would have been a cooler way for Craig to exit the franchise.It's a waste of time frankly.Once word of mouth gets out I think this film will tank financially and it deserves to.",No Time to Die
1116,Faraday32,The 'woke' lot finally managed to take Bond down,1,6 October 2021,"This is, in my opinion, the worst James Bond film ever produced. In fact it isn't even a James Bond film - it is just a melodrama with token characters inserted to appease a certain group of people (we all know who) who despise James Bond and everything the series is about.This was all about taking away the masculinity of the series and bringing in 'girl power' on both a character and screenplay level. Bond's wit, humour and charm are all non-existent. Daniel Craig is a shadow of the character he played in previous Bond films.I cannot understand the hype about Ana de Armas in this film. While watching her scenes I thought I was watching a spoof/parody spy film. She forgets her code word because she is nervous. She has only had three weeks training yet manages to make combo kills while wearing high heels. She makes various facial expressions as if she is in a comedy. Really? This is meant to be a spy film - at least act the part of a spy. It honestly felt like she has only had three weeks training as an actress. Even Bond's wit and charm is quickly trampled on by her character as if he was trying to chat her up in bar. I am sure the ""feminists"" loved that bit.SPECTRE - an entire operation that has been with us for decades simply brushed aside. The build up at the party is almost identical to that in the previous film, except this time they are killed off by a former assassin of theirs, which allows Bond to escape. Seriously, an entire criminal institutionThe new 007 - this was 'Me too's' attempt to get one over on Bond fans. No further comment.Felix Leiter - another staple in the series just killed off. He will no doubt be replaced by female in the next film.Q - another win for the 'wokists' as he confirms he is homosexual. Nothing wrong with that but it is completely forced and added purely for DEI purposes.Rami Malek is a great actor, however this role certainly didn't get the best of out him. What could have been an exciting villain is just any average criminal with a chip on his shoulder.Finally, it seems the screenplay writers didn't get the memo that although Bond may get battered and have near-death experiences, he doesn't actually die in the end. What on Earth were they thinking by killing him off?So now that a considerable amount of protagonists are dead (including the main character), I have no idea what the next film is going to look like and how they are going to save the series. A winning formula has been completely changed to keep people who don't even like Bond happy. Now that the woke lot have got their hands on the franchise, the only advice I can offer is to make peace with the fact that SPECTRE (2015) may well be the last genuine James Bond film we ever see.",No Time to Die

Not that Craig's performance was bad, it's just that the movie made almost no sense at all. Plus, it was like a video game - up pops a bad guy, kill them, rinse and repeat. Safin's and Spectre's henchmen must have learned to shoot from the same school that Star Wars Stormtroopers use.All in all, even worse than the Roger Moore films, which were the bottom of the Bond barrel until now, in my opinion.I was going to rate this 3 stars, but I decided the excellent stunts and practical effects were worth an extra point.",No Time to Die

1124,Jake_Mansur,Time to Die (SPOILERS),3,9 October 2021,"When watching a James Bond movie, you have to overlook certain plot holes or absurdities in the writing so that you can fully enjoy the 007 experience. Every Bond film has its flaws, but this movie in particular has glaring issues that completely ruin the plot and the send off for Daniel Craig.On paper this should be a great Bond movie. It has all of the ingredients to be successful with the campy villain, the cool gadgets, and the beautiful girl. But these aspects are added into the plot almost insultingly since most of them serve no purpose to the story and are just there to distract the viewers from the film's problems. The villain has NO motivation for world genocide, as his main reason for his actions was to get revenge on Spectre (which he already does in the first half of the movie). After that it feels like the writers run out of a need for him, so they decide to make him into a megalomaniac just so that Bond has someone for a final showdown. Ana de Armas could be erased completely from the movie and it would not change a thing. Her part could have easily been filled by the ""New"" 007 adding to her character development and building her and Craig's rapport.No one in this movie feels in character. Bond is overemotional, M is a manipulative wreck, and Felix is a dumbed down BFF. The entire script feels like dramatic filler added in to figuratively (and literally) kill James Bond. Every ""send off"" the film has is super cliche and unnecessary. Out of every other transfer of the Mantel of 007, this one feels the most forced and lackluster, as everyone knows they are going to continue making Bond movies. The movie even adds to the insult by adding that Bond will return after the credits.The only thing this movie does is force there to be ANOTHER reboot, which again is unnecessary since every other James Bond before Craig had simply taken over the role leading to a continuation of the series. Now it appears that there are only two paths this can possibly lead. James Bond will become a series of reboots equivalent to the Batman or Spiderman movies, or they are going to attempt to change the formula (which will ultimately ruin the character and franchise).",No Time to Die

She actually felt like a joke throughout which was a little disappointing to be honest. Yes it is long and there are a lot of lame jokes throughout and it doesn't really feel like a Bond film especially once you reach the end.The End...which was terrible and I don't know who thought this was a good ideal to kill off James Bond and to do it in such an uneventful way. You can tell the writers were salivating at the mouth trying to come up with a way for him to die (and make sure the audiences knows he's really dead) by his death scene. Then the film just abruptly ends. There's a toast to Bond from M and crew and the final scene with his woman telling their daughter about him, then credits. It was just such a sorry way to send out who I thought was the best James Bond so far.So who knows what's next. Maybe they'll go full ""woke"" for the next Bond film. His daughter grows up, becomes a 00, changes her name to Jane Bond or something, I don't know. It just felt like this film was just made to try to kill of Bond for shock value or they thought it would be emotional like Tony Stark's death in Endgame but it was neither, it was just blah.",No Time to Die

I was looking forward to this new Bond film - and going back into a movie theatre after 18 months - but I did not expect to see this. Even while I was watching the movie I was thinking that this is really dark for a Bond film and it is not as visually stunning as other recent Bonds (e.g. ""Skyfall"") missing the glamorous locations. It seems the main goal of the mediocre plot was to bring the whole Bond universe to an end, including Felix Leiter, Spectre and Blofeld. I still give Daniel Craig credit for his other Bond movies in particular ""Skyfall"", but this one leaves a stain on Craigs Bond era; better if ""Spectre"" would have been his last one. I think EON will have a hard time turning this one around. What do they want to do now? Start all over with a teenage Bond growing up as an orphan and being recruited by MI6?

It is lacking almost every ingredient needed to create the fantastic James Bond as we know him.The plot is all over the place, even absolutely non-sensical at times. JB ""Bondish"" personality feels completely changed, lacking the flirtatious, womanizing charm, the toughness, and even the style. Whilst Monepenny was an amazing addition to the Bond franchise, feeling natural and strong, the new 007 felt forced and had an awkward/bad chemistry with JB. Additionally, the female characters are all fighting power machines, and can't really be considered Bond Girls. The scene with Paloma was a refreshingly Bond-like interaction with a woman. Nonetheless, Paloma ended up overwhelming a dozen guys in high heels, moving the scene into the ridiculous. The villain was terrifically bad - no proper backstory, no motive, no character development (& a truly disappointing end to the SPECTRE). I don't even want to mention this unforgiving ending.What's truly spectacular about the movie was the cinematography and car/ chase scenes.Overall, it is disappointing. Several times, I felt removed from the world of JB by feeling the ideological undertone driving so many parts of it (whether that's with Bond's changed personality, the new 007, Q or even some fighting scenes).I wish they had kept the original director.

Unfortunately the answer is very long drawn out scenes between too few action set pieces, everything takes too long to get going, and the set pieces too short or underwhelming to keep you interested.The positives, there are a few, the cinematography is breath taking, and has an epic feel, but then Bond was never about being epic; there is a section of the story set in Cuba, that introduces us to Ana de Armas, as a charming breath of a fresh air, the CIA Operative Paloma; and for a brief 10 minutes 'No Time To Die' feels like a Bond film again. The action, quips and Martinis flow in a nostalgic set piece that feels like a familiar friend. If the whole film had been like those 10 minutes, it would be getting 10 out of 10!Unfortunately the positives are in short supply as the film lurches from average, melodramatic, lazy and overdrawn, to a Bond film briefly (the aforementioned Cuba scenes), before the death of major character becomes the catalyst for a further drawn out middle and final act that feels so uninspired, tired and struggling to find it's feet again (echoes of 'Die Another Day'), indeed the villain of the piece portrayed by Rami Malek, has plan against the world that feels like it was taken from a Marvel superhero movie. The story doesn't pull off the threat convincingly and is so convoluted that the audience will struggle to identify with the stakes, or the threat that blights our hero to the end.Of course the stakes this time become more personal for Daniel Craig's Bond, but then this has been the running theme of the entire Craig saga from Casino Royale to this final instalment. It has never felt like Bond saving the world, but failing to save the people around him. Those of us familiar with Bond films of old will get the whole 'sacrificial lamb' plot point that's been a staple of Bond for decades, but Daniel Craig's Bond has been a woefully inept secret agent.There is of course the fact that the producers wanted to do something different with James Bond, as did Daniel Craig, the reboot was a fresh idea even if it did begin with some missing ingredients, but as these have been added it felt more like Bond and the Scooby gang, in a serious of miserable tales about a spy so emotionally compromised he would of no asset to the secret service if based on real life.The film direction really needed to reign it in, and the script is so full of holes despite having four writers behind it, begs the question whether they had seen a Bond film or enjoyed one previously.There's only so far you can go with nostalgic nods to the cinematic past, and Easter Eggs do not make a feature film, No Time To Die is littered with them, so it's odd that the care was there to put them in, but completely lose sight of the actual ingredients that makes a James Bond film. There is no pleasure in awarding a film 3 out of 10, in fact had this not been a Bond film but a clever techno spy thriller, there could have been grounds to give it 6 of of 10, but the fact that it's a film that needs the history of 4 previous instalments to sort of make sense, doesn't help an audience coming into this franchise fresh.

It turned the amazingly built up Craig/ Spectre era of films right on its head, almost making the last few films irrelevant even with their amazing buildup to this one. But as it's own film, the story was pretty rich, took some daring twists and turns and had some great cinematography and acting, especially from Rami Malek. I'd like to rewatch it soon and adjust my thoughts then.It was more of a slow burn with more story and less action than other Bond films. The story could have been made simpler and given the villains some more time to express and reveal themselves, especially earlier on. Same goes with a certain main(ish) character- I left the film feeling that they were a tiny side addition to it when they should've had a bit more spotlight. One particular character, much to my own personal dismay, was also killed off really out of the blue, but I can see some reasons why this was the case. Many action scenes were refined and choreographed a fair bit worse than recent action films like The Raid, John Wick, the first half of Shang Chi and Nobody, but I think the cinematography made up for it (the staircase shot is wicked and the motorbike+ car chase scene from the trailers epic but too short to be super fun). The locations, sets and costumes were excellent though.The first half was awesome, especially before the title cards, but things should've picked up and fallen into place a bit easier and sooner. Billie Eilish's theme is great and set a good tone for the rest of the soundtrack and musical leitmotifs/ themes (Hans Zimmer could've added some more of his flair though, but eh, it was fine and he probably had to keep it consistent to earlier Bond films). The title sequence made sense as the movie progressed but it was a little underwhelming compared to the likes of Casino Royale and Skyfall.If it reminds me of another Bond film, it has to be 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. It pays homage to that film a lot too with hints of the musical and plot themes scattered throughout. I'd like to rewatch it and I'm interested to see where the 007 films go next, which the directors will have a clean slate to work with. A decent send off to one of my favourite Bond actors, Daniel Craig. I also look forward to what he'll do next in the film industry if he keeps at it.Spoilers heavily out of context- Someone's been watching Wallace and Gromit, someone from Mock the Week tries to give someone a cold, Q listens in on very private conversations and a deadly virus threatens the world.

This movie solidifies the new route that Bond is taking, placing him firmly in the 21st century. Many other reviewers are complaining about this, citing 'PC culture' as a valid criticism for the movie. Before claiming that a James Bond movie of all things is 'PC gone mad', remember that innovations in the Bond franchise have never been received well in their time. Remember when everyone despised the casting of Daniel Craig in 2006 just because he was blond? Remember when 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' was considered the worst Bond movie of all time? Since then, both of those opinions have changed. Obviously this movie is still well-received, but perhaps not as well-received as it should be.

1150,Roger-Shallot,Unacceptable,4,7 October 2021,"I watched my first Bond film - it was ""Live and Let Die"" - as a nipper and have loved the series ever since. I've enjoyed every single film to various extents, and have seen them all several times. I won't watch ""No Time to Die"" again. Why? Simple. You can't kill Bond - only Ian Fleming had the right to do that, and he chose not to. At their basic level, the Bond films are escapism - larger than life characters, plots, stunts and gadgets. We could accept that the passage of time would necessitate changing the lead actor now and again, and not think too hard about continuity - it didn't really matter. The Bond films came out every 2 or 3 years, entertained the public royally and wrote themselves into film folklore.Daniel Craig took the role over and despite some early doubts became a great Bond. Casino Royale was jaw-dropping at the time and Skyfall almost as good. Quantum of Solace and Spectre were a little less impressive but still entirely worthy entries.Then up pops ""No Time to Die"". A maudlin Bond, estranged from MI6 abandons his apparently treacherous wife and sets off to tackle another mission, initially with Felix Leiter for company. Not a bad development that - unlike the chemistry between Bond and Vesper - which was intense and believable - there was none between Bond and Madeleine. Neither actor's fault really, but it was a mystery why Bond would fall so deeply for this woman and make the decision at the end that entirely wrecks the film.Bond is soon back in the MI6 fold, don't worry, but now we have another 007. This was a real chance for some sparks to fly but - crucially - Lashana Lynch wasn't a good fit. Her time on screen is underwhelming and by the end she's been shifted into the background. Lynch's shortcomings in this role are exacerbated by Ana de Armas' excellent turn as Paloma - just the sort we needed to be the successor to 007-hood.The plot chugs along and Bond fights his way through a mass of enemies after foiling a slightly underwhelming plot and surprising wooden super villain towards inevitable nick-of-time escape. Except he doesn't escape. He is blown to bits by the barrage of missiles launched by a Royal Navy ship to ensure that the super villain's afterthought of a plan is well and truly foiled.Apparently, infected by biological nanobots programmed to kill his wife (Madeleine) and the daughter he never knew he had, Bond decides to THROW IN THE TOWEL. He stands there watching the missiles descend and is indisputably atomised. Bond is dead, when he might have got away, because he can't stand living without Madeleine (who he'd manage to live without for 5 years) or his daughter (that he'd only just met).Unacceptable. I could have lived with 'Q' finds a remedy and the three of them return to Bond's Jamaican bolthole, with the great man smiling contentedly at his good fortune and happy retirement. I could have lived with a final scene of him watching his wife and daughter from a distance before moving off into the future alone, but alive.I cannot accept Bond dying. My response will be to not purchase the Blu Ray when it it released and not to pay to watch the next Bond film when it is released. They can give the role to Bugs Bunny for all I care - that would be more believable than the ultimate tough-guy survivor throwing his life away for one of his more underwhelming 'girls'.Bond 25? Never happened. The series stops at 24.Grumpy old man? Absolutely!",No Time to Die

I grew up on Pierce Brosnan and casually followed Daniel Craig's era with interest, but never with excitement.It is therefore a bit ironic (or poetic?) that only Daniel Craig's last stint as England's best spy made me truly appreciate his entire tenure. I will not rave here about all the things I liked about the film or why it has left a much more profound Impression than I expected.

The opening sequence (minus the Swan song) is truly great Bond cinema it's every thing that the Daniel Craig era has come to be known for. Fast gritty and tense. Then he has trust issues with Madeline and he walks away. Later in the film he's working for Felix Lighter trying to extract an asset in Cuba, that again is a great action sequence, his CIA contact kicks it into high gear. They extracted him to a boat and he gets betrayed. Bond finds Madeline and her daughter and rescue them from the person who betrayed him on the boat, and does so only to lose them to the movies real villain. Then leading up to his final confrontation with the main villain is truly the last best Bond this movie has to offer.The bad. This isn't a James Bond film it's a Madeline Snow film, it opens on her and closes on her the villain is her villain. While Bond films in the past have told wild stories, this ones a doozy. Seems the villain kills Swans dad because Specter told dad to kill his family. Why, huh, what. Then saves her after they trying killing each other ya you read that right. Then the villain saves James and kills the rest of Specter ALL OF THEM boom done end of movie right, he killed everyone responsible for killing his family right....right. Wrong seems he wants to kill almost everyone else, why, cause we climb Everett because it's there we're there so why not. I'm not kidding, his reasoning is more or less because I can.The ugly. The Swan show? His daughter, that she claims isn't his daughter. Blowfeld and Specter the ghost of girlfriends past The are you double oh (00) kidding me, you've been replaced stick. Which brings me to the villain Swan's villain the ageless wonder who has no motivation beyond the destruction of Specter. Who no one knows anything about except Swan and she doesn't offer much. Then now I start my master plan that NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT I'm going to kidnap the only two people James Bond give a flaming flip about to keep pushing the narrative further. Honestly had he not done this he could have pulled it off without a bump in the road. Leading to the death of Jimmy Bond yes I said Jimmy, like Woody in Casino Royal, cause he is a Jimmy.

1163,antmaleitas,Complete bulls***,4,9 October 2021,"The film in general is okay if it wasn't a bond movie. It actually should be called fast and furious no time to die because of being so exagerated. It was a good film until you realise that global extinction and chemical weapons are the bad guys objective. Not to talk about how they killed off James Bond. In the franchise's storied 58-year history, 007 has never actually died. Bond movies usually end with the successful destruction of a villain's lair, and the camera panning away as the hero beds a Bond girl-on a boat, in space, on a balcony, often with his would-be rescuers looking on. Why ruin it? I am really surprised and confused on why you'd do such a thing. People nowadays are so concerned with what's politically correct (I'm talking about the discussions about James Bond becoming a woman or a black man in the future or whatever) because it was definitely one of the reasons they killed James Bond, and masterpieces have been destroyed either for the sake of money or for the politically correct thing. I'll give you a fee examples: Star Wars- I do not understand why they'd do the sequels as they did. They were complete horses*** and not historically accurate (palpatine died and came back, wtf). Also, oceans eight - why, why, why would you have to do a movie with a female team? The fact that people have a need to do this kind of stuff is something I will never comprehend. It's not about gender, it's not about colour and it's not about anything political. The story was just written like that. You can write a different story or not go and watch the film at all. People should not copy movies and ruin them because of some weird obsession with it being gender neutral or whatever. Get your s*** together. Killing James Bond and giving him offspring is ridiculous. It is an offence to the franchise and a big f you to history and the classics. If they did marvel like that no one would like it either. Casino royal was a really great movie, quantum of solace was alright and so was skyfall (a bit more exagerated though), specter was completely exagerated but at least it had something to do with the character and the past movies. This one however, not only did not have anything to do with James Bond, it had to do with a girl he was in love with, which is ridiculous because let's face it James Bond is a player, not a lover boy, but it also was so ridiculously exagerated. Global extinction? Come people... all in all terrible screenplay, great movie up until the part where the spectre people invade the lab.

He's a work in the shadows, use them and lose them, debonair cad you can't help but love. And then there is this. It has tainted the entire Daniel Craig section of the franchise. BOND CAN'T DIE. He gets out of impossible situations. It's why we love him. Every one else dies and he is left alone, having made sacrifices to save Queen and country (or the world). He couldn't have found a way to survive? Even faked his death and lived out his life in solitude? And they have drawn so many parallels to In Her Majesty's Secret Service but even they had the good sense to kill off the wife. If I'd known that this was what was going to happen they should have left it at Spectre. He walks off with her. Done. HE DOESN'T DIE! Don't even get me started about Felix.Look the camera work, scenery, gadgets and cars are all classic Bond. I don't even care that much about the weakness of the story. I can suspend my logic for good old fashioned entertainment. It's not like a North Korean turned himself into a white British dude by a bone marrow transplant. But YOU CAN'T KILL BOND. So many people are saying this is pandering to some annoying woke sensibility. But is that it? How does that make them happy?! They should be offended that while the women run, the new 007 included, Bond stays to save the day. Why didn't he just go and let the new girl handle it? I mean women can do everything in this new bond universe. They're not just eye candy. Oh except when it gets real. Then they get out. She could have at least stayed to help him. Maybe the fight her own way out, daughter of an assassin, killed before mamma bear could have driven her own boat to safety?!

Casino Royale and Skyfall are so much better than this!The scenes from Norway are great, even though I might be a bit biased here...
And I have always loved Felix! And now you let this babyfaced bad actor kill him off that easy?Rami was good, but not in it long enough so he didn't make a huge impression...
The russian guy reminded be of Borat everytime he talked...
And as I have seen others mention; no chemistry between Bond and Stowe.... not like him and Vesper.I liked Ana, the female CIA agent.

I fully understand franchises have to evolve and change with the times but they're losing all of the Bond feel.No discredit to Daniel Craig, he's a good actor but he's just never felt like Bond to me.My issues with this film in particular;
Great first 20/30 minutes, loved Ana de Armas and should of had a bigger part to play in the movie. Funny and fit well into the movie. Being ridiculously hot is just a bonus.007 mk2, what was the point? You half build two female characters then just don't bother, it should of either been her or Ana de Armas, again it feels like they're filling numbers at this point which is more offensive than casting a single female lead.Again I know the films are evolving and writers want to show emotional struggles, this isn't Bond. Everyone knows James Bond, he doesn't need this much time for his character development, spend more time on supporting characters and villains.I think Remy Malik is a great actor but I can imagine even he was disappointed with this, the lack of character development and at times felt so forced and rushedThe end just seemed odd, why would he be told there was no way to recover.. it's nanobots would your assumption be they can be re programmed or I don't know?

Just to clarify, not just joining the hate bandwagon but having waited for months to see this, there was the expectation of seeing what one likes to see in a bond movie, it's an escape so I must say, loved the locations, the shooting, aston martin, car gadgets, love it. It is not a bad movie at all but I feel betrayed, as a fan who loves bond movies, I feel betrayed. First the plot, is it just me or do these modern day movies have some crazy plot that you struggle to piece together what kind of logic it hangs on. Why on earth is Bond saying, ""Could you please turn around while I put on my tux?"" Is he a geek on the Big Bang theory scared to take off his shirt? I never thought i would say the day when Bond goes from ""Perhaps you are out of practice"" to ""could you please turn around?"" I didn't mind Lashanna Lynch actually, she and Bond were bouncing lines of each other so it wasn't the ""stand down old relic"" movie I thought it would be. It still feels like some backlash made the producers rework some scenes. Ana De Armas was great, lovely to look at, breath of fresh air in the movie. Why didn't she come back and we had fan-boy, because apparently we have agent fan boys now, still in the movie. It was so bloody obvious he was off. Then it's Madeleine this, Madeleine that, so it's so soap opera like. The old characters killed off, Bond killed off, Spectre will be the last film for me as far as Craig is concerned. This feels dragged out, and just luckily these producers cannot get their hands on the cool suave bonds from the 60s onwards. I will get rocks thrown at me for being ""sensitive"" that Bond has been changed. Where does Bond go from here? I have no idea, but going by this, he won't be the bond all the fans knew.

1191,cqf1,Poorly Written Mission Impossible Movie,5,3 October 2021,"What a letdown for the final film with Daniel Craig.I'm so tired of the 'supervirus/biological super weapon' plotline as it's been done so many times in films, TV shows and even games, and is not interesting at all.The writing was very poor, in all aspects. What a waste of a great actor like Rami Malek; barely any screen time and when he was on the screen, the dialogue was the most cliched villain stuff we've seen time and time again. The whole ""your family killed my family so I'll kill your family"" is the most basic overused backstory they could have thought of. Also, it was never explained why even after the Spectre members were killed, he still wanted to kill even more people by continuing to produce Herecles on the island. He achieved his goal (kill Blofeld) but his motivations after that are so unclear.Speaking of a waste of talent; Ana de Armas. So much promotion for her character yet she was barely in it for 10 minutes.The overall plot felt like a mission impossible film, which at first seemed alright due to the action scene at the beginning of the film, but then everything else after that was just guns, guns and more guns.This film seems to be highly overrated just because it's Craig's final film and the ending was bittersweet.",No Time to Die

Bond has these skills and showed them throughout his movies but as his character got older and deeper into the underworld he exists in I think they (the writers and actors) do a good job of showing him revert back to his more basic training of just fighting and shooting. All the close quarters combat scenes on the woods and island were legit enough to portray a salty hitman who's been in enough fights to know it's only over when someone is dead. Safin hitting bond with the nano blood that would isolate him from his girl and daughter was a perfect send off. Bond was never meant to have a family or life like that so it ended perfectly for his character. Lastly, this may just be for combat vets that find a relation but when bond refers to Felix as his brother... you feel the movie change to a more serious level.",No Time to Die

The plot is very interesting and it is nice to get some backstory about Madeline Swanns character, however the first half is dragged out and largely pointless to the second half of the film. Dialogue is very bland littered with dodgy jokes and no 'stand out' action scene. Bringing Felix Leighter back only to be killed of is largely pointless. Milking the Vesper Story is stupid. The 'climax' at the end is largely disappointing and WHY KILL JAMES BOND? It is going to be really interesting to see the future of this franchise considering you have just killed off the main character. Seems like a pathetic excuse just to add a female James Bond for political purposes. Remember when this franchise was good and had a nice simple plot- James Bond is given a mission, he completes mission and meets some chick along the way. Simple. Nope the producers feel the need for 2 and a half hour films to add pointless characters and give them their own arc and backstory. More work with less payoff. Really goes to show that having a $200 million budget can only disguise a ruined franchise to a limited extent. This is an improvement from Spectre in the sense that the characters actually do something and it is nice to see Q getting some screen time finally. It seems like the new MI6 cast are finally being used after being introduced in Skyfall and falling flat on their face in Spectre. Definitely see this film but this isn't what the producers made it out to be it is just a sad attempt at reinventing James Bond after 6 years of pain from a 50 year franchise.",No Time to Die

James Bond doesn't die !For 60 years the franchise was simple: the actor gets too old (or isn't good)... he just gets replaced. That is it. The James Bond story simply goes on.With these producers from lets say the ""Craig-series"", they changed the rules from day one.First, a blond James Bond and I'm sorry but anyone who have read a James Bond book said..... euh, what ?Then, the actor looks more like the ""russian baddy"" then an english charming spy and it got a lot of slack when Craig was announced as the new Bond. But hey, simpel marketing trick with a ""papperazzi photo"" with Craig in a bathing suit, which later turned out to be just a set-photo but the marketing strategy had started: D G looks great and women love him. Annoying fact, television just followed this but when I ask my female friends if they think Daniel Craig is attractive......most of the time, just no.But hey, the first one (Casino Royal) wasn't bad as a film', even a Bond-film and lets face it, this was the ""new Bond"", so we just had to deal with it.But now, we know all the Craig-films really just had one bad guy: Blofeld and the 5 Craig-films are really 1 story. Again, totally different from the franchise.Now I do get it and trying to ""reinvent"" the concept of Bond doesn't have to be a bad thing but with this ending and Bond actually dying is just ""no go"".I feel it is a big middlefinger to all the other Bonds: They are saying there is just one James Bond and that is Daniel Craig. We (the producers of the Craig series) tell the story of Bond from the beginning (before he is a 007) till his death. They are just saying f-u Connery, Moore, etc...
So hence me titler: can they be sued for ruining the whole Bond franshise ?I mean, when a new Blue Ray or other format Bond series release arrive, are the Craig-films included ? I mean, these films differ from the franchise, just like ""Never say never"".By the way, it was funny to see at the end of the credits to see ""james Bond eill return"".

1210,zakmasterson-59436,A flawed but overall satisfying conclusion,6,2 October 2021,"So I'm quite a new James Bond fan watching my first bond film casino royale a year ago. I really enjoyed the bond films and thought they were fun action thrillers. Now Daniel Craig's films haven't been perfect, I found both quantum of solace and spectre to be lacking. But I view both casino royale and sky fall in highly regard and I was extremely excited for Daniel Craig's final appearance as the popular character.So overall I thought this film was decent, good action, entertaining, funny and containing all of the great characters that comes with bond. However I must say that I found that the film was lacking in some parts, first of all although the film try's to build a somewhat serious tone it has many silly moments and plot holes that even casual moviegoers will be asking 'how did that happen?' Imo the weakest part is the villain and it's not because of rami malek not being able to portray a menacing villain. This movie suffers from the same flaw as spectre in that they have a great actor playing a great villain and give him nothing to do, now this villain is way better than blofeld in spectre as he has a decent amount of screen time and does some cool things. However for a film nearing the three hour mark you'd think they'd spend more time developing the villain. His motive is undercooked and confusing and also delivered in a vague and complicated way.However as I said I still enjoyed this film it's fun and entertaining and a good send off to Daniel Craig as bond. It just annoys me that this film honestly could've been one of the best bond films up there with casino royale and skyfall. Oh well bond fans should be satisfied with this movie experience.",No Time to Die

It really exemplifies how hard it is for someone like him to change. I would have liked to see him go unhinged more and start just killing everyone, then we would get to see this point more.

There was hardly any action and why did you blew Bond!! That is sooo incorrect!After all that what his step brother wanted, is it not the case??

Absolutely not!! And what was that big secret that Madeleine couldn't reveal on time!!I mean its just garbage on top of garbage!The truth is , u didnt know how to end the story. Neither had good writers to back up the plot. Moreover daniel clearly looks uninterested and maybe forced to do this one ( thats why doubles were used) Production house too revenged on the convincing they had to do to get daniel onboard by killing him at the end.So what we saw was the hustle behind the screens !!Plzzzzzz give me the money instead and save us from bad cinema!!

Being a life long Bond Fan and having watched every Bond movie to date this was a bit of a let down in the end. The movie is OK at best, there is a good amount of action and the chase in the opening credits is brilliant. The movie lost momentum about half way through and towards the end it was all rushed just to give Daniel Craig a big final send off. The ending was suppose to make you feel emotional and sad but I just didn't buy it at all, as quite a lot of people have mentioned one of the great things about James Bond is that he always lives to fight another day and that it never takes itself too seriously. When the end credits were rolling I was left sitting confused and no emotion at all apart from maybe being a bit angry at that ending itself. I get that this a new generation of Bond and we have seen a more serious side to the character with Daniel Craig but there's some thing's you just don't need to change.

1221,coneal-89692,Absolutely Disgusted!,1,10 October 2021,"Waited for this movie for six years and it was terrible. A complete letdown for the end of Daniel Craig. The movie was slow, and you never knew where it was going: There was no big moment that it was building up to. The villain (Rami Malek) was a complete let down and up until his death was very anticlimactic. Same as for Christoph Waltz he had a very small part and was ""accidentally"" killed after all the buildup for his character in the last movie, Spectre.As for Madeleine she should have never been in this movie, she should have only been in Spectre. As a result, she has a daughter with Bond. The second that little girl showed up it was like a huge wet blanket was thrown on the film. There has never been a child in all the other 24 movies because a child doesn't belong there. After she showed up the movie was only about her and protecting her. You knew that nothing was going to happen to them because they had this child. She was like a safety net, and it took all the suspense out of the movie.However, the absolute worst thing was the ending (MAJOR SPOILER): The killing of James Bond. This was the stupidest decision ever made. JAMES BOND DOES NOT DIE. He exists in one timeline that is timeless. There have been five other Bonds and they were not killed to leave the franchise, and Bond has been alive since 1962 and now he is dead! The producer, Barbara Broccoli, should be ashamed of herself. Her father, Albert R. Broccoli, is turning over in his grave from this movie because JAMES BOND IS DEAD! I don't know why people are not more upset about this point. Not only did James Bond give up and die, but he also had his daughter's favorite toy when he got blown up. A real father would have gotten that toy to their daughter, no matter what!The major problem with this movie was it was too modern, trying to keep up with the current trends. Soon everyone will look back and wish they had not bended so hard to the will of the public but stayed with tradition.",No Time to Die
1222,sjhunt-50458,Highly satisfying conclusion to an incredible take on Bond,9,10 October 2021,"This movie has been my most anticipated for 2 years straight, and it's almost surreal to see it finally released. It's been over a week since I've watched it and I'm pretty sure I've gathered my final thoughts.First of all, this film is not as good as Casino Royale and Skyfall; it would have to be pretty spectacular to beat them. But it's miles better than Quantum of Solace and better than Spectre too. Daniel Craig gives a great final performance of Bond, and the film dives deep into giving Bond more character than just a badass woman's man, which really makes you respect the film, even if any other aspects of the film turned out to be mediocre; luckily, this isn't the case. The action is shot beautifully, some standouts include a chase sequence in the first act of the film with Bond's iconic car, and a shootout in a foggy forest in the second act of the film. Billie Eilish's song has really grown on me, too. I didn't like it much when I first heard it, but I've learned to enjoy it leading up to watching the film, and hearing it in the cinema gave me chills. And of course Hans Zimmer's score is the cherry on top.However, Rami Malek's Safin wasn't a hugely convincing villain, his intentions aren't justified enough to really buy into him, and we didn't see nearly enough of him. Although I think Malek played him very well and creepily, and I love his other work such as his performance as Freddie Mercury in 2018's Bohemian Rhapsody. I'd also like to mention Lashana Lynch's character; I know there was a lot of controversy surrounding her role in the film, and this has nothing to do with that, but I didn't like her character very much at all. She gets some good scenes of action and some nice banter with Bond but I didn't think she was likeable, and some of her dialogue executions were a bit off to me, which is a shame because I enjoyed Lynch's performance in Captain Marvel (an otherwise meh Marvel movie). I would've preferred Ana de Armas to have a bigger role in the film instead, whose bubbly and likeable personality I thoroughly enjoyed. As I previously mentioned, I loved the action in the film a lot, and it was one of the best aspects of the film in my opinion, but a huge amount of the action we do see in the film was already revealed in the trailers, and I wish we saw only snippets of the action in the film instead of extended sequences in the trailers we were given. My final mention will be the runtime, I think it was maybe a bit too long, which stops it from being hugely rewatchable, compared to other films like Skyfall, which is a super easy film to put on in the background.But all in all, I thought No Time to Die was an incredible conclusion to Daniel Craig's era of Bond and one of the best Bond films to date. Although I thought some of the characters could've been explored more, but I was satisfied with the depth they gave Bond himself. Thank you Daniel Craig for your incredible performance as Bond, you've been amazing.",No Time to Die

It was pragmatic, dark and sophisticated movie about a British spy that had trouble with achieving his objectives but finally made it despite a great cost. Blofeld and spectre insides made it relatable to its predecessors and gave it a good twist. Rami Malek played a very dark villain as ""Lucifer"", supported by Christof Waltz as also very scary.

Life is full of different opinions and if you are reading these then you are perhaps taking them into account on whether to see this film - however, all get to see is the persons review but not the person. So for what it is worth, as a mid 50's person who probably goes to the cinema 3-4 times a year, will watch maybe 1-2 films a week at home off varying ""genres"", I genuinely cannot ever understand the low reviews. The more I consider the film the MORE it seems to pay respect to Bond, deliver an excellent movie and complete the circle of one of the most iconic characters in movie history.Part Two:
Daniel Craig plays the role brilliantly, there is a weight of history and expectation on him. This has been there from Casino Royale - from the ""I cant believe a blonde haired Bond"" seriously? Lets remember where he had to take it from: With the Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton era taking Bond down into an area that only Roger Moore could carry off in an earlier era. Anyone remember seeing the start of the movie XXX and the ""Bond character"" getting killed right at the start? I was one thinking that's spot on, time to hang up the licence JB there newer and better on the block now - Jason Bourne and co.Consider yourself a ""typical cinema goer"" - go you will almost certainly have a good experience.

It seems they wanted to concentrate on the emotional side of James Bond but that is not what James Bond is about. Missed the charming, tough James Bond like the classics.The final bit that disappointed us was how they killed James Bond at the end, making you wonder how they are going to come back from this film with a new James Bond or are they going in a completely different direction.I wonder how differently the film would have been if they chose different writers to the ones they used as it didn't seem to be clear, entertaining storyline.",No Time to Die

1264,HarrisonFnD,"""You have all the time in the world...""",9,9 October 2021,"In 2015, I saw Spectre in cinema. It was entertaining enough, although I felt disconnected from the events on-screen. That sentiment could be said of my exposure to the Craig-era at that time. It was not until the first delay of 'No Time to Die' (a film which, if it had come out in 2019 I would not have appreciated) that I decided to re-visit the series.I found 'Casino Royale', as expected, to hit all the right notes. It's a crying shame that 'Quantum of Solace' didn't build off their newly found goodwill, opting to squander it. The much appraised 'Skyfall', despite clear improvements across the board, didn't resonate as much as I wanted, leading to my complete disinterest in viewing 'Spectre'.Hiatus. After months had passed, 'No Time to Die' was delayed for another year. Upon rediscovering the IMBD page of 'Spectre', I was taken aback by two flawless '100' critic scores. As a result, I decided to once again view 'Spectre', a film that I once easily dismissed. With an intriguing introduction of Madeline Swan, coupled with many thematic and emotional threads that lay unresolved, I found that 'No Time to Die' had many threads to tie together.2021. Nearing the (actual) release of the film, controversy builds. Interviews are highlighted and dissected, agendas are identified and criticised, cast are judged and ridiculed. I was concerned. For both the reality of a Bond film littered with agenda and one in-which a vocal majority have mislabelled and overblown minutia. I knew that the only answer to my concern was to head to the cinema, and now, I finally could.I enjoyed 'No Time to Die', with a strong identity rooted in the history of the Craig tenure and a respect for the enduring characters, it was the continuation to 'Spectre' that I had hoped. In a sense of tone, a melancholic presence overhangs the proceedings, with bursts of life bought by the action and co-stars. Despite inconsistencies with the nature of the threat and the necessity for an all-new villain (Blofeld, despite being used well, is still untapped) 'No Time to Die' remains the journey of Bond, bringing his tale to a reverential close.Discourse abounded from the introduction of 'Nomi' as a potential '00' agent, with fear the new character(s) would stray from Bond norm. In reality, Nomi provides a charismatic foil to Bond, with a small yet effective arc that highlights the respect Craig (as Bond) commands. In step, the film does not have clear moments of pandering or jarring political messages. As we move further from this moment in time, I believe the discourse will shift as the exposure to audiences rises.The sentimental nature of the third-act has torn opinions, opinions of which I would stand with on a cynical perspective had I not focused on the Craig tenure as of late. This Bond frequently loses those he cares for, with death permeating his adventures. Despite this, he's been willing to let others behind his armour, displaying a longing for connection and an escape from the life of death. This film offers a sense of finality to his struggle, as hard as that may be to watch.I urge you to watch this one for yourself. I believe that this marks the most ambitious through-line Bond has had between films, with a result that will be appreciated with retrospection and time. ""It is eternal, Bond...""",No Time to Die

1267,paulp-784-404178,Lazy Filmmaking,5,10 October 2021,"No Time To Die has many of the high-quality production elements we've seen in the Craig series: stunning locations (shot beautifully by Linus Sandgren), exotic cars and striking costumes, impressive set pieces and the ""polish"" we've seen throughout the series. It is not the production that is lazy. The film is lazy in its storytelling.This final Craig installment has James Bond chasing and stopping a villain (Lyutsifer Safin played by Rami Malek) who has stolen a super weapon that was developed clandestinely by the British government. In Skyfall, a mission like this served as the bones on which all the side stories hung. In No Time To Die, things are reversed. The primary mission serves merely as a secondary plot device used to tie off story lines that were introduced in the previous four films. The problem is that most of those story lines didn't need tying off and when the final credits roll, I had the sense that the writing team just wasn't into it.For example, in No Time To Die, primary characters Felix Leiter (Jeffery Wright) and Ernst Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) both die rather quickly and unceremoniously, and mostly for no good reason. Leiter's death seemed only to happen so that Bond would have an emotional motivation to avenge him. I get that, in a post-heroic age like ours, patriotism as a motivator falls on deaf ears to the younger demographic. But I'd argue so does the death of a colleague. And killing off Leiter as a motivator just comes across as manipulative and quite lazy.Similarly, the introduction of a child as a primary character into a Bond narrative apparently for the sole purpose of giving Bond something to protect is the obvious go to plot device for writers who can't think of any more creative way to motivate a character (or who are so cynical that they've come to believe that only children are innocent enough for audiences to care anything about). Even the design of the super weapon-a material that targets an individual person, family, race (it changes based on what plot hole needs filling)-is lazy. It's used to virtue signal some vague message about genocide. It's used to kill off Blofeld. It's used to ensure Bond can never see Madeleine or his daughter ever again. This weapon is a lazy script writer's dream.What's worse, all of this boring material took almost three hours to get through. The person I was with fell asleep 2/3rds of the way through and I found myself nodding off now and then. Mercifully we see little of Malek in this film and thankfully Sedoux has a ton of screen time. It also was refreshing (and somewhat surprising) to see that Craig didn't mail this one in and he has a lot of energy throughout. The lovely Ana de Armas was a treat and stole the show in my opinion. But these highlights just couldn't save the tedium of the obvious script, boring family issues, and thin plot.Skyfall and Casino Royale represent the best of what a Bond film could be. I actually liked Spectre as well though many see precursors in that film to the ennui that No Time To Die produces. Hopefully the next film will be a reboot of the series as Royale was and we'll get a new generation of old fashioned, rich, spy-themed storytelling. Time will tell.",No Time to Die

It was worth seeing in theatres! However, I had much higher expecations of Rami Malek's part. I say this, not because I didn't like his portrayal, but because he was given very little screen time and the suspense of his initial introduciton lost its momentum in the next hour where he was barely mentioned. Great potential for a villain, lost in all the other intricate plot lines. I thought that the mellow side of Bond was at times out of charachter as was the amount of dialogue he had, but otherwise Daniel Craig remains my favourite bond. I'm glad they tied some loose end story lines from previous films, even if it made for a very long, unusually complicated Bond instalment. This movie was also unexpectedly dark, both literally and figuratively. Serously, I had to squint at the screen during some scenes, while during others I looked away.The only thing I'm truly mad about is the ending. As beautiful and heart-wrenching as that final scene was, I can't get over the fact that they killed off a charachter so iconic for being timeless. I teared up in the theater, now I'm just pissed. I guess that answers the ""who's going to be the next James Bond"" question everyone has been asking. There isn't going to be one.

1279,king_cameron,Good action but disappointing in other ways,5,11 October 2021,"The problem this film has is that it's a finale and not a stand alone film. Therefore it Had to spend much time tying up loose ends from characters in previous films which didn't leave much time to develop the films villain, and other characters which seemed shoehorned in for a variety of reasons. The film wouldve been far better had they focused on concluding the battle with Spectre.After 15 years of tackling the insidious Spectre organisation, to simply kill them off in 30 seconds is bizarre. In addition without any knowledge of the new super villain and how he was able to do this. The Christopher Waltz scene had great build up but lacked bite.Now let's get to Remi Malek. Poor acting wasnt the reason this character failed. There was no development nor plausible motive identification for killing millions other than an assumption we'd get it because of Thanos from Marvel.The was no chemistry between bond and Madeleine. For her to be the leading lady in 2 films was poor, especially when they reminded us at the beginning of what real chemistry was with Vesper. Bond had more chemistry with Ana de Armas in 1 minute than in 2 films with maddy.Finally, wheeling out this old and broken shell of a man who: doesn't appeal to women and is shunned by them when making advances as in Cuba, is desperate to be a father, damaged from previous films, chooses USA over UK, to die alone on an island killed by British missiles just is not what anyone wants to see.This was a depressing, elongated, confused mish mash of a film that didn't know what it was.

It's want bad but it has nothing new to it.AnaDe Armas characters has an incredible cute personality which made you like her immediately. Unfortunately her screen time was very little.The last 15min was perfect. It matches the first 20min.Whats the point if living if you cant touch your loved one.,No Time to Die
1281,GeneralHail,Time to say Goodbye to Mr. Craig (Bond).,8,11 October 2021,"""Closing time, James! Last call!""Ah... Where should I start. First of all, I loved all of the movies with Daniel Craig, some more, some less, but I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy them. I saw all of them in the cinema, only for Casino Royale, I didn't have the opportunity.For those saying the movie was too long, I would not say that at all. It was long, but while watching it, it didn't feel long. Watching a LotR extended edition would be described or felt long for me.So back to the movie. I loved it. Those rating it with 1 star or saying it wasn't good - probably didn't understand it or try too hard to compare it with other movies or the other actors. Daniel Craig's display of James Bond was different. (""Do I look like I give a damn?"") It was different from the very first movie in which he played the character James Bond. He didn't want to copy or replay some other actors, or combine somthing, he just made his own appearance and manifestation of James Bond. And that is (at least for me) a good thing.(I wouldn't go so far as calling him the Best Bond ever, because you can't compare actors of different eras playing a fictional character, but he is definetely one of the best)The movie was action packed, very well implented and not so stressful, and shaky-cam filmed with a frantic editing cut as for example QoS. There were some good jokes in it and also the ""crew"" or the actors from its predecessors stayed the same. (M, Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter etc.) The used locations in the film were great, from Italy, to Jamaica, to Norway, Denmark and London. Billie Eilish's intro song was also great and felt good. I also liked that they showed Vesper's grave, as the movies with Daniel Craig all had a continuing storyline and have like a red thread through it and every movie did not feel like a closed story/film.Ana de Armas as Paloma was great, but unfortunately her appearance was too short. Hopefully she can return in other, future movies.I think they did a great job with Daniel Craig's last Bond movie. Only the ending was surprising and sentimental. Maybe the movie was too emotional for some, but I have to say I still enjoyed it very much.If I had to rate the movies with Daniel Craig I'd put them in this order, but please do not take my subjective rating too personal:
1. Casino Royale (10/10)
2. Skyfall (9/10)
3. No Time to Die (8/10)
4. Quantum of Solace (7/10)
5. Spectre (6.5/10)Farewell Daniel Craig, well deserved, but you will be greatly missed. I think you did a fantastic job as James Bond and your upcoming successor has quite some shoes to fill.""For England James? No, for me.""",No Time to Die
1282,cowelljeremy,Best Bond Ever,10,30 September 2021,Do not listen to the naysayers on this site. This film has it all and is the best of the best and a fitting end to DC's tenure. This is from a person who has been Bond obsessed for 48 of his 56 years.😍,No Time to Die
1283,basillatif,Solid Bond Film,8,10 October 2021,"In this film, Bond is struggling to get back in the action as he is enjoying a nice retirement in Jamaica. The bad guys from the previous film (Spectre) are working with other villains to develop a nasty weapon. Bond is cajoled into getting back in to the action. Like previous films, Bond has headaches to deal: M from MI6, his ex-lover's intentions, and the bad guys. Bond comes thru in Bond fashion with his high-tech gadgetry and fearless instincts. Nice film.",No Time to Die

The sound..... it was hard to understand what they were saying. Our film was in English with Spanish subtitles.I've read all the different reviews. I agree with most of the negative reviews. 2 hours and 45 minutes is a long time when you aren't enjoying the film. We were just bored.I noticed Daniel Craig was one of the producers.All the rumors about the next Bond movie being a woman..........now I understand why.He dies.......and his daughter will become 007. All this just to pass on his title.I miss the old 007 Bond movies.",No Time to Die

1286,totevilija,"Expectedly decent, but no surprises",7,13 October 2021,"The movie's key components largely rely on knowledge on previous films, and the connections between are worryingly blurry and rather boring yet again.The new twists are rather interesting, but lack the original 007 action soul that it used to have. Had my hopes up that the movies would get more interesting and engaging storyline when Casino Royale was released, but the entire story just became boring and repetitive with this film.The beginning is indeed long, but also very engaging and fun to watch. The animated intro and song didn't match the movie in my opinion, but still served right.The plot of the movie and main villain are yet again pulled out of the bottom of a pitless hole with new caracters that hate on Bond, and have an uninteresting, almost familiar and expected story behind them, making this movie very boring when scenes that contained the villain plain and dull.The comedic parts, small details and all other elements of the movie, that make the movie a 007 movie are all perfectly delivered and make the movie watchable.The ending of the movie was very satisfying and well delivered.The movie deserves a higher rating only because of the grandiocity and elegance of the whole plot. The movie just barely has a Bond-like feeling, still managed to deliver better than some other Craig Bond movies, but was very shallow in story. Still managed to turn out good in the franchise and show that a single movie doesn't have to be as bad as a previous one.Expectedly decent, but no surprises.",No Time to Die
1287,djarvis-08744,No Time To Die. So brilliant it hurts.,9,4 October 2021,"Daniel Craig has been magnificent as Bond! He's brought new life to this franchise and for me, stolen the show. From Casino Royale in 2006 to No Time To Die, he's been a breath of fresh air to this inconic role and he will be sorely missed. More than you know..Giving nothing away about this film as that would be unfair to those who haven't been lucky enough to see this yet but let me tell you, It's got everything a Bond film needs along with a whole new element not seen in any previous installments of 007. Do not miss this!Bond, James Bond.",No Time to Die

I'm gonna draw a comparison that's probably completely irrelevant for most of the viewers, but at first there was supposed to be Aston Marin Valhalla in this movie. I was looking to see that stylish elegance in action, but it just wasn't there. Ultimately, that's how i felt about the whole movie. Even though there where some beautiful locations, the cinematography was lacking compared to previous ones and it didn't really have the style factor of Bond movies. Other disappointment was how they handled the villains, the character was lost and their actions just didn't whole lot of sense. And even though Rami Malek is an amazing actor, the dialogue just felt kind of empty and forced. Just like the end of the movie.",No Time to Die

1290,kawad-14666,Romance novel where Bond is not the main protagonist,6,23 October 2021,"Pretty good start to this film, the promise of action, plot, villainy, conflict but really, this is a love story. It's not really Bond.Im not sure who was responsible but I see this as more a story written from the point of view of the leading lady... a pretty disappointing one at that with Bond being a catalyst and participant of her story. She in herself is not the Madeleine of before and Rami Malek as a villain was less threatening than Logan Ash.I think that the promise was there, right up until the end of Ana De Armas main featuring. After that, down hill, predictable, light of depth.It would have been better that Blofeld feature more heavily and Malek be a side villain.In essence, this is just a hash of the previous Craig features. It's a shame it went the way it didn't. It wasn't all bad. I like the beginning until Aramas went on her way, and the last 5 minutes.... Anything else, basically just a romance with a Bond theme.I wouldn't say don't watch it, Craig is still a great Bond, it's just a shame the writers did what they did... and I am not referring to the very end... that was actually quite a good touch.",No Time to Die
1291,pandrewbattye,Entertaining,8,1 October 2021,"Time flew, very entertaining, Daniel Craig and cinema photography fantastic, Bond's love interest lacked the chemistry like with Eva Green. Rami Malek over rated, thought his performance could have been far more menacing, struggled at times to understand what he was saying. Other supporting cast very good. Action scenes well shot very Bournesque. Loads of references to On her Majesty's Secret Service clearly trying to capture the emotion from that film which stands it out from the rest. Slightly concerned re ending which was good but leaves a big question over the future direction of the franchise which is a real concern for bond fans. Enjoyable and a fitting tribute to Craig's tenure. Felt like the last half hour could have been better on a number of fronts. Had potential to be best bond film ever but I think it fell short After few more viewings I may decide otherwise.",No Time to Die

Underused and just pretty uselessRami malek in this movie? No in-depth insights as of why he does what he does and who he is.Bond in this movie? More in touch with and talking about feelings than the cool secret agent he's supposed to be. Don't get me wrong , I love the more human Bond with Craig but this felt like watching a 2 hours Oprah episode.As a independent movie this movie was probably ok but as part of the franchise it was awful.Only highlights in the movie were the opening scene and Ana de Armas. That's about it.",No Time to Die

It seems like people are too hung up on old time Bond and says this movie is to political. Old Bond is dated and this movie is not political. Just because a black female is a 00 agent and probably will be the main character in the future does not mean the movie is political or trying to ""woke"". This movie has great action, stunts, music and a pretty good pacing for this long of a movie. Even though it is pretty lengthy it still seems like a few minor things were cut, which could confuse someone. But it's not hard to put the pieces together by the end. Other than that I loved it, great cinema experience which has you at the edge of your seat and almost in tears by the end.",No Time to Die
1301,amandahiltonj,Just simply badly written...,4,8 October 2021,"I'd put this down within the worst three Bond films. I think the most infuriating is that the concept was largely sound but after the first hour it just is a waste of potential. A lot of it has been done before and better but I just feel cheated. You could trim off at least 30 minutes and improve the flow. At times it feels laboured.Craig is good within a bad script. The support is excellent but it's just the script (not the concept) a godawful script.I actually liked the dynamic of Dr Swann being compromised, the addition of the child could have been used so much more intelligently with greater jeopardy and the concept of the perfect weapon was very sound. Where it goes wrong is they tried too too hard. The Bond / Blofeld scene in particular is very bloated , awkward and entirely out of context in comparison to previous meetings. Malek is gloriously wasted and as for the evil lair this has been subject to previous ridicule, see Austin Powers / Incredibles, that it just felt comic. The jokes were crowbared in and as for the ending....sorry no. Reusing a classic track didn't give it any credibility either. All in all a massive missed opportunity, will create a lot of lost goodwill to the franchise and mean yet another reboot. Should have left after Spectre...",No Time to Die

But the final...how did they aprove that? Giving a family to Bond, i think, it was a good way to close Craig's legacy. A final mission before he steps out of scene for good and goes live in peace with the woman he loves and now a daughter. They should have stopped there. Why would they think that Bond fans wanted to see the man who never dies giving up in the end and dying? That was an unforgivable ending and it ruined everything.",No Time to Die
1303,subintegral,No Time For This Movie,1,2 October 2021,"This movie was boring. I kept asking my friend for the time, because I was excited to leave the movie and be done with it. What I was astounded by is how packed the theatre was-it can't just be me that found it to be a snooze fest.As for the movie itself, of course we know it's going to be an action movie, but it gives off this vibe of middle school theatre production at times. Prepare to suspend your disbelief (or possibly see the movie in 4DX) to be able to enjoy it even vaguely.At one point, the geek is asked to ""hack in"" and I believe the Oscar for best performance goes to the text-to-speech robotic voice that announces that the hack was successful-because I wasn't really engrossed by the others' acting skills.They also politicised this movie a bit too much in a way that didn't add value; it felt forced, just as the acting felt forced. It didn't make for compelling cinematic viewing.I would have preferred a cohesive story. Much of what plays out is so 'unrealistic', even for an action movie, that I was rooting for the villain instead of Bond to keep things interesting. What doesn't make any sense is that the daughter just escapes at the end. Why give up your bargaining chip after all that work? Laziness?In the opening sequence, we see Bond's DNA helix at the molecular level Is actually made up of guns instead of nucleotides, which quietly alarms you that you're not going to get a ton of personality or heroism from Bond.I would say the first few minutes are good and then it is pretty much downhill from there.",No Time to Die

Terrible villian.",2,2 October 2021,Absolute nonsense of a movie.The villian was so under used and was downright boring when he was on screen. The final confrontation between him and Bond was very predicatable and such a non event.The plot was garbage. Very badly written with a middle section that just dragged.Dialogue seemed very forced with throwbacks thrown in very clumsily.Action before the credits was great but that's where it ended. The rest was completely run of the mill and nothing new. Best action is what you've seen in the trailer.Didn't feel like a Bond movie at all. Bond used to be the lone agent who went in and got the job done himself. Now he needs a whole team with him.He didn't even seem to be the lead in his own movie in parts. He doesn't get to drive the new Aston Martin. He doesn't get to fly the cool plane. It's meant to be a James Bond movie.

1307,TheKing87,Unfortunately this was not a Bond movie.,2,10 October 2021,"As a James Bond fan I was incredibly disappointed about ""No time to die"". If you removed all references to ""James Bond"" and ""007"" in the film and removed the gunbarrel scene, you wouldn't think that you were watching a James Bond movie. This was not a spy movie with secret missions combined with action scenes! This was just a typical Hollywood action film with the ""spying"" part missing. There was way too much focus on the protagonist's personal life rather than focus on secret missions, which is the very essence of a James Bond movie! It was a very messy film and way too long. For example the villain first wants revenge agsinst Spectre, which he gets, and then he suddenly wants to kill a lot of people with a virus, which is unclear why he wants to do that.Also they are purposely pushing a woke agenda with this movie with focus on women and minority (because of the Hollywood criteria about more women and minorities in the movie if it has to be qualified for an Oscar). The movie introduces a new black female character who has taken the number ""007"", because ""James Bond"" has retired, which is uncalled for. It's like they are purposely trying to make the next James Bond a female.There were many aspects of the film that are not in the essence of a James Bond movie. For example they gave James Bond a child and made him a family man in love with Madeline who is the daughter of mr. White, who was a part of Spectre. So way to much focus on his personal life, which is not in the essence of a James Bond movie.Even worse is that James Bond dies at the end of the film, which is very unusual!

I was expecting more. This might be the worst of all Craig's Bonds, but someone else might argue differently. I personally liked all the previous one's, even Quantum of Solace. This however left me somehow uninvested. The main reason is the story itself. Uninspiring bad guy. Pointless appearances of Christoph Walts and Ana de Armas. CIA agents showing without any purpose or meaning. Just a poor plot. Also this Bond is inconsistent with the character that Craig created. It feels he's not himself, at least for the majority of the movie, which I can somehow accept, although I'm not a fan of.

I don't agree with the idea that these films have to all follow a similar format for what James Bond should be as I think that gets quick fast. Having different takes on Bond is interesting, but if you don't like the direction they take that's fine. For me, I enjoyed the direction they took with Craig's run of the Bond name, and felt that (Major Spoiler here) his death at the end of the film felt rather impactful and in a way fitting for this more gritty, modernised tone they went for. The film definitely has flaws though beyond your enjoyment of this Bond, with the villain and other small plot elements feel either weak or not having enough time to mature. Overall, I personally enjoyed this one and if you like this style of Bond film chances are you will too. If you didn't, that's also ok!

1324,miguelusho,"Painful, polemic but necessary for end a full cycle of Craig as Bond (?)",8,5 October 2021,"The film in general terms is a good closing, epic at times although the end is painful, perhaps controversial for everything that precedes James Bond, along with some elements added to the film not so established in the literary canon and in the general ideology of what agent 007 is, but they are risks that for me work to give evolution to the character and a closing arc to the interpretation of Daniel Craig. Now, for me, what it really doesn't work in this film and Spectre, which has the same mistake, is that the villains are wasted and do not have as much spectacularity as expected, since by making them relatively work from the shadows or with brief notoriety, it ends up happening throughout the entire staging; look, in Spectre, Blofeld, in the scene of the meeting that appears in the dark, as the mastermind behind everything, indicated his terrible threat that ends up collapsing with relative ease and Safin beyond his reasons for revenge are quite justified, his other motivations lose strength because they are not clear, maybe due to the fact he doesn't appear that much for go in deep (perhaps he had many cut scenes and the film in general), although he is the villain who without having a strong connection with James, indirectly achieves what previous ones couldn't ... make Craig Bond die.",No Time to Die

This movie is far different a very Balsy script some amazing action scenes which I felt at times was drawn out and too long , script was confusing , the female new actors was brillant and gave some much needed pace to the movie!The villain such a shame he was wasted because has the potential to be incredible, the film very modern lots of explosions and big shock at the end
But it was a Daniel Craig bond and it didn't not feel like a bond movie!, it was very different but very enjoyable well worth a cinema visit I think.The effects and stage of drama very good just wish the action scenes was shorter , because at times it felt like

But as I sat there through 2 and a half hours I constantly found myself not enjoying what I was watching. It's basically a love story with some action scenes and a broken record of a plot.They've managed to turn bond into an emotional soppy wet wipe, Remi Malek couldn't turn his character into anything like a proper villain, and the whole film just didn't make sense!Here's a list of things I liked:
Ana de armasThings I didn't like:
Bond being a retired old man.The new 007- her attitude of ""move over bond"" I'm pretty sure anyone in her position would show a bit more respect.The plot was so tired. Lab on an island...yawn
THEY KILLED OFF BOND!The constant drinking, I like a bev, but there was barely a scene without one.It was a love story, bond isn't a love story character.The whole ""she's not yours"". Please, we all knew it, you weren't fooling anyone so it wasn't a plot twist at the end.Killing off a whole evil organisation in minutes but giving no back story to the new villain.Pointless scenes like when M walked to reveal a new prototype Aston Martin but was never mentioned or seen again.I could go on, but you get the point.

He has played the character closer to the rough uncompromising Bond envisaged in the original novels by Ian Fleming.However this reboot is very much a film for 2021, overly woke in its delivery with an eye on offending know one.The signature Bond intro is tame, almost a melodrama. Where is the action that normally drags you into the film whist setting the pace of the movie.Where are the Bond girls, the love interest is not the normal 007 stunner, with little chemistry. The best of the bunch only gets some air time in the Cuban scenes. Not really sure what the point was of the female 007, other than to tick another box that is so important in todays world.Of course it's superbly shot, the action scenes when they come are excellent especially those in the italian village on the hill. There are also some great locations as you would expect.The villain is the bloke from the Queen film and I felt he was more threatening in that!!The ending was lazy, I'm pretty sure there have been a number of Bond films that finish with him blowing up a former soviet base on an island.The finish is a tad unbelievable, Bond can't be dead he has many more billions to make for the studios. However it was a good way to say goodbye to Craig who has delivered a solid Bond. Although it definitely felt like he was happy to give up the tux and martinis.",No Time to Die
1332,ducland,"What was setup to be a ""real"" Bond movie descended into a melodrama that was a kick in the teeth for true Bond fans",4,29 September 2021,"Daniel Craig is an amazing actor who has done so well considering the terrible world the writers and producers have put him in for his Bond arc. In fact, Craig never quite got to play the James Bond he deserved to play - only a stilted and decimated version of the character and the Craig era seemed to pack in all the baggage that Bond was famously beloved precisely for not including.Gone are the days where you could just have a fun spy-thriller. These days, the writers feel the need to add in emotional and family drama in all the places that could do without it. They reduced one of the best franchises of all time into a soap opera.What could have been the fun mission-oriented Bond adventure we've been waiting for, turned out to be a yet another melodrama, with what's supposed to be an emotional punch coming off as the trope-of-the era fad and one that is particularly ill-fitting in Bond, considering his history. Cubby Broccoli must be turning in his grave.The final act is a kick in the teeth for true Bond fans, maliciously forcing them to see something they never wanted to see and, at best, will be divisive among even casual fans.James Bond - Craig nails his performance every time. Whatever problems have been in the movies of his arc, it's never been down to Daniel Craig. He's a true professional. In NTTD, we see him much more expressive and chatty than he's ever been - but it's funny, it fits, and it works.Madeleine Swann - Despite still being the worst Bond girl the series for her moody, painful expressions and not even the slightest sense of fun, she's a step up from how she was in Spectre. She still has zero chemistry with Craig's Bond, which makes it all the more surprising they tried to add in a family drama storyline with her character. It's supposed to be emotional but doesn't work. If you were going to ruin Bond, you may as well do it with a believable love interest. She's no Vesper, let's put it that way.Paloma - Ana de Armas' character was fantastic and a real cool fighter. It's a shame she was hardly in the movie.Nomi - For all the fears about Lynch's character, she's actually good and could have been utilized a lot more and it wouldn't have hurt the movie.Safin - Rami Malek is just Rami Malek, but his mannerisms are just creepy anyway so it pretty much works. Not the best villain by far, but not the worst either. The fact that the plot and threat is so heightened in some ways takes over from the need for a strong rememberable villain.Blofeld - Waltz is an amazing actor and has been totally wasted in the Craig era. The producers should be ashamed of themselves, the way they've wasted a two-time Academy Award winning actor of this calibre.M, Moneypenny, and Q - They were all decent and better used than in Spectre. They're not overused this time and they all work towards supporting the main plot and Bond, instead of acting like the Scooby Doo gang like they did in Spectre.Felix - Perfectly fine but hardly in it.Side characters - no complaints.Action - Some of the best action in the Craig era with much of it on par with Casino Royale. In some places it was even better.Across all of the Craig era movies, NTTD ranks somewhere in the middle. Like with most of the Craig era, the end is weak. The ending is miserable, felt desperate, and cost more goodwill from true fans than the series had even attempted to earn.Hopefully, the next movie gets back to basics and gives us James Bond in an actual Bond movie that starts like a Bond movie and ends like a Bond movie. If the Broccolis are bored with Bond they should hand him to someone that cares, rather than treat our hero with such disrespect as to do what they did in this movie.",No Time to Die

I was a fan of gadgets, the sophistication, the goofy comments and the crazy villain's. I loved the cars, the locations and the fight scenes. I get that in this day and age, that's not as pc as other movies but they were just that, movies. Bond to me was a sign of strength and intelligence in positions of chaos and this is why I wasn't a fan of how he was played by Daniel Craig who I think is a great actor. They tore Bond down over those movies and now they killed him? Minimal stunts and wooden acting made this movie boring, predictable and in some cases, just confusing. Rami Malek is a great actor but probably the worst bond villain I have ever seen.What happens to the franchise now? It was always ""my name is Bond, James Bond"" yes he was 007 but that saying was famous, now what are they going to say?Its sad to see this happen but in this day and age, I guess I am a bit of a relic and so I do not rate this movie very high (3 stars) I feel like I wasted my $15 and nearly 3 hours of my time.",No Time to Die

1343,alvarez_milan,"""James Bond will return."" Will he really?",6,10 October 2021,"Quick review: A close to the Bond story, or at least Craig's tenure as Bond. If this was ""The Bourne Legacy"", or other spy movie I'd give it a 4.5 stars, but this being a James Bond movie, it was too dramatic, too complex and somewhat boring at times. But I guess the aim was closing the Bond story in a fitting manner for a millennial focused world. I wonder what all time Bond fans think, not the casual moviegoers.Going deeper (spoiler alert):The tenure of Craig has been filled with ups and downs. From an unconventional retelling of Bond's origins in Casino Royale, and a deeper exploration of Bond's past in Skyfall, to complex quite slow dramas like Quantum of Solace and Specter, so I guess it's fitting that the fifth and final incarnation of Bond by Craig reflected that ferris wheel 🎡 of emotions. The first half of the movie is very epic, revisiting Bond's biggest regret and reprising Craig's Bond desire for retirement - this Bond tried to retire from service 4 times in 5 movies - and bringing some old characters to reprise their roles one more time. The scenes in Cuba with Ana de Armas were just great, and it is a shame she has very little screen time, Ana's beauty and wit makes her perfect for a ""traditional"" main Bond girl. The movie aims at being a total closure to the James Bond story, killing allies, wiping out Specter and his main nemesis, and transforming the traditional carefree Bond in anguish father, trying to save his daughter and her mother, and sacrificing himself not because he couldn't save himself, in a maybe quite last minute Hail Mary Bond's style, but because he could never be close to the woman he loves and his daughter. If this had been a Connery, Moore, Brosnan or maybe even Dalton type of James Bond, he could have gone and save himself sacrifice been with his family. But no this is Craig's Bond, buoy for a post 9/11 world, and he had to ultimately die in the screen.So what now? Other generations watched and accepted a transition of the Bond character from one actor to the next one. In Craig's case we saw and accepted a ""reboot"" of Bond. Bond had been a traditional male hero and fantasy role. The wise guy, who got the women, the cars, the gadgets and ultimately scaled death defeating the bad guys. Bond at his core was a flawed creature, a functional alcoholic and remorseless killer, created in a Cold War era. But in a world where many accused this character of chauvinism, and bad male fantasy, maybe the aim is to finally destroy James Bond. The movie spent a lot of effort telling us 007 y just a number, and towards the end at credits, we can read the traditional ""James Bond will return"". But what kind of 007? Will the audience accept (male/female) a character far removed from what James Bond has been?",No Time to Die

I honestly hope this movie is not a success for all the reasons above that it fails to fulfill. Daniel Craig was a good Bond with ups and downs but you always got the impression that he hated the role but put up with it because of the money, fame and opportunity for other acting pursuits that playing Bond brought.

1355,BadCheesoid,It's a great action film,7,3 October 2021,"I went to see this film with literally no expectations at all. Bond films are so inconsistent with how good they actually are, so there really is no point in getting hyped. Here's a spoiler free review because I really recommend seeing this film before looking at any spoilers.In the Daniel Craig saga I think that I would put this at number 3 out of 5 in terms of quality. It's not as good as Casino Royale or Skyfall, but it's better than Solace and Spectre, in my honest opinion. I think that the action scenes probably are the best out of all 5, they were very well shot and all of the actors were exceptional during these. Lots of great creativity in these scenes too - there was some really interesting technology used to mix it up a bit.I do think that it's Daniel Craig's best performance as Bond, too. He felt very human and fallable, which is what we've come to expect from the Craig era. On the whole, the writing is inconsistent, but I really think that the writers have done a fantastic job at writing his character in No Time to Die.Okay, so the bad stuff - there are some serious issues. I agree with some of what people have put here. It is too long. The pacing does feel really off in places. It's best during the action scenes and the moments where the characters show some humour. But, there is a lot of bloating and padding in the script, which is really unnecessary. It's a bloody Bond film, not some oscar bait drama. If I could make a key criticism, it's that the filmakers did not always know what they were making - that much is clear from the film as a whole.The villain also isn't great. Similar issues come up as in Spectre, where they don't give the main antagonist enough screen time to develop and be threatening. It's ironic considering how long the bleeding film actually is. Rather than dangerous, Saffin comes across as a creepy child catcher. He would be more in place in a crime drama than a Bond film.Overall, I thought that this is probably a better action film than Bond film. It's certainly not dreadful, but it's not as good as some of the stronger Bond films are.",No Time to Die

The beginning of the movie felt like a love letter to the early James Bond movies, but also contained some new and interesting aspects, like the introduction to the villain. But before you know it, Daniel Craig is beating skulls in left, right and center.The movie was entertaining, but I have mixed opinions about it. The plot in the second half of the movie felt more like something from Mission Impossible instead of a James Bond- movie. As often mentioned, Ana de Armas was fun and refreshing and the locations chosen for the movie were stunning. But the plot felt like the new Star Wars trilogy, where it felt like there were 10 different plot points and different directors with different views and nothing really clicked. This was very evident in the ending of the movie. The death of Bond was also quite weird. One of the biggest charms in the James Bond movies is that you can always be sure that Bond survives, even though he faces inconceivable odds.An entertaining movie but it does not feel like a James Bond movie.

But however things got a little down in the second half it was good and normal until it reaches the island part in the movie where the climax and story's definition starts and also turns it was quite slow but will not be recognisable for everyone definitely not , but it was still fairly good . Yes this is the most emotional bond film ever and will even leave you in tears in some places . But in the second the whole music rate and action was less there were not many scenes which had music which was also one of the dropback of its dally-ness it may be because of the reason that a bond film mainly stands on it actions and music on as one of its Main part in its base , like every bond film is a bit slow and concentrated but it was quite more here . The emotions came out perfectly too it connected with because of their acting and the whole subtle scene and good dialogues during it , it will be so emotional in some scenes even with the lighter ones . The action sequences were great ! In the first half of the film it was marvellous but again in the second it was not much .Acting : Everyone have done it realistic and great we thought of giving a special mention but then we would have to give it to everyone their acting in this is that Great . But still Léa Seydoux's emotional performance was outstanding and also the same goes for Jeffery wright and also Ralph Fiennes , Ben Wishaw , lashana Lynch and Naomie Harris for their serious , fun performances respectively , but man Daniel Craig's work is spectacular , astonishing especially those emotional scenes his acting totally lifted the sequence . He literally deserves more just for this acting . If you are skeptical about how everyone says he is the perfect bond , this movie will make justice for that words his work was totally sterling and admirable.Music : the music was great,impressive and substantial
In the first half it was extraordinary . And in IMAX you would definitely love it . But in the second half it was very normal like typical Hans Zimmer kind of music for building a tension in a scene and also there was not that much of music itself, also when it had it was just acceptable and just good . Not like in the first half .The imax shots were stunning however it lasted only around 30 mins of the whole 2hr43 min film but it was quite worth it for the sounds and visuals combination. Other than that some scenes were impressive and quite marvellous too however luckily the typical anamorphic look didn't show much in this film . The colours were blue in most of the film and it was good too other than that the di the visuals and shots were also amazing and satisfactory as it will appeal easily to everyone also in enjoyable and satisfying way . The shots in opening scene in the character Madeleine Swann's childhood place was beautiful and subtly appealing . The opening action sequences cinemotography were astounding with its totally warm colours and setting which was pleasurable .Other than that the film was near very good might be impressive and satisfactory for some
The first half was excellent and definitely satisfactory while the second half was fairly good too but not as much as the first half in every angle and can be just good for some other than that the music was fantastic the visuals were Gorgeous both was impressive , action sequences , VISUALS and music in the first was amazing ,emotions were a bit deep and superb in the entire film on the whole everything was great and wonderful and satisfactory totally except the second half where it lost a tiny bit .

1366,jdongen,hopeless storyline,3,11 October 2021,"The film its self as production has good things . The acting of Daniel Crag , Lea Seydoux, Ana de Armas ,Lashanda Lynch and a few more is noteworthy good . The scenes are spectacular , the effects good,
However the story line is diabolic . Ian Flemming would have turned in his grave .The whole concept of James bond being a secret agent is more or less pushed to the background he's busy saving his own love life instead of his country and the world as in former bond films and the involvement a small child in the plot is even worse. (not the beginning scene but the later one ). Is sad to see Craig has to end his Bond career like this . Lets hope the script writers also have applied for their place in the retiring homes
Also the end of the film is hopeless. Despite the good production unfortunately it's the worst bond film.",No Time to Die

1368,xva-54290,It's all but a Bond movie,5,5 October 2021,"My first reaction was, is there a scene after the titles.Then I felt empty, like something was missing.Now, a few hours after I think I know what that something is.This isn't a Bond movie, it has all the characters, it has the action, and bloody good action scenes they are too, but it doesn't feel like a James Bond movie.The music is forgettable, I think I read comments were someone has said they have taken OHMSS music and updated it.The plot is also a rework of the same movie, OHMSS and tagging on the continuation of the romance between Sawn and Bond. Which to me feels old and boring, we had all this with casino and Vesper, but to have Bond and Swan's romance continue, feels to me goes against Bond in the books.There are some funny lines in this movie which I think I was the only one to get, the lines called back to previous movies and I thought were good.Malek is probably the second worst Bond villain, take him out of this movie and you wouldn't miss him.You could have the main henchmen play the opening scene and in the woodland and it would work just as well. Then use a computer generated Joseph Wiseman play Dr No on the island, it would work just as well if not better.They gave Malek no memorably lines and zone presence.Felix is useless yet again, how the man got a job in the CIA is beyond me, he doesn't know the person he's working with is rotten. This is just poor writing for a great actor, he's more memorable than Malek and he has less screen time and lines, that probably includes all the movies he appears in.The ending, to me they have written themselves into a corner. Does this now mean they have set a precedent for every new Bond actor they are going to do a reboot or are they saying Daniels Bond was a mini break in the series and we are now going back and following on from Brosnan?It will be interesting to see how they deal with this. People will say and are saying the next Bond should be black. I think he should be and always be a white man, people will then says why and my reply will be because he's white in the books.The reason I will give for this answer is that no white man can play a black character without there being a massive uproar, and quite rightly I might add, so why shouldn't there be that same uproar the other way round.This movie is alright, long entertaining but doesn't feel like a bond movie, to me.",No Time to Die

With Ana de Armas as Agent Paloma in it she is the best non-Bond character we had in James Bond franchise, well it is a pity that she didn't get much screen time.

1371,harshathebale,No Time to Wait for,8,30 September 2021,I am obsessed & I am depressed. Its been an year since I've seen a decent film in theatres. This film is more emotional than intense. The story could've felt routine if it was fast paced. The slow sequences made made me feel each scene. The elements felt ordinary when you've known many films for example extra flashbacks which were never mentioned before. I would rate 10/10 for action sequences. I've waited months for this film now I feel empty that I've watched it. I could say this film held on both sides as Casino Royal & Skyfall. I couldn't say this is better than those both but this film did what the other two films didn't. That is it broke my heart. It felt completely emotional. I wish I had seen more of Ana de Armas character. The rest of characters felt like they doesn't matter and that's because this film is completely centred on Bond. I still feel the entire movie in my head. I am connected to him in this than any other his film. Daniel Craig has done an excellent Job on his last Bond film. If you want to watch this keep this in mind that this film isn't about British Secret Service or the end of the world. This is about James Bond.,No Time to Die

What can I say I was very disappointed with Daniel Craig's final outing as 007. To be honest Daniel played his role well (not my favourite Bond btw) but nonetheless he did his best. Coming back to the film, everything felt very prolonged and lethargic in my opinion. But I thought this was a James Bond movie with him as 007 (he gets his 00's long into the film pathetic. The lady who played 007 was absolutely rubbish and didn't have the spark or wit about her , totally miscast. Bond unfortunately didn't get to know his new found daughter .... shame. Rami's villainous character weakest bond baddie ever boring as a s@@. Best character was by Ana de armas short but brill!! Killing Bond then saying in the end credits that 'James Bond will return' ......big faux pas in my eyes.. car chases were well choreographed and intense....but I was weary at the end ,far too long . And then wanted the entire thing to end.... definitely the weakest of Daniel Craig's tenure and the last. Let's see who the next James Bond shall be. Need to go back to him being suave and sophisticated. Casino Royale bought it back to its roots in how 007 is played, rest of Mr Craig's Bond movies were borefests.....anyway that my two cents.Bond is back but not in the way we see or want to !!!!",No Time to Die

But the makers of this film failed in one thing , they weren't able to manage the the screen time for each actor like its a 2hr 48m long movie and Rami Malek had so less screen time with just one too long monologue, being the main antagonist i guess he could have been much more efficient with more action scenes in the movie or more remarkable dialogues and Ana de Armas should have had more screen time too as she was great at playing her role but anyways its a great movie and a great ending to Daniel Craig's James Bond era.",No Time to Die

The storyline still makes little sense and yes, the bad guy is meh, but thank God for Anna de Armas. Her character needs her own Paloma spin-off. No Time To Die is not a Casino Royale, more like a stepped up Spectre.The ending makes sense as it ties the all the films together into a 15 hour movie. On this point, it more or less confirms the fan theory that ""James Bond 007"" is just an interchangeable title for several agents that typically retire every 15 years to be replaced by another.You definately can see Phoebe Waller-Bridge's wise-ass contributions to the script such as the way that every time a female is introduced to Bond, he takes it (as we do watching) that they were coming on to him and he about to get laid, when in fact they weren't suggesting that at all but something completely benign; it's running joke that I don't think most viewers catch. Plus the humorous bit where gay Q with his cats worrying about his date showing up while Bond and Moneypenny drink his prized bottle of wine.The Jack London quote at the coda was a nice touch, one of my favorites. Here's the whole quote:I would rather be ashes than dust!I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.The function of man is to live, not to exist.I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.I shall use my time.",No Time to Die

All we wanted was more time with the characters we love. But my sole criticism is the ending. SPOILERS AHEAD: Look I have no problem with killing a character, but killing James Bond is just stupid. Bond isn't supposed to die he is the best spy to ever live. It should have just ended with bond settling down, not dying.With all of that said I do think that this is a good send off for the character and more importantly a good send off for Craig and definitely worth a watch.",No Time to Die

1392,thjkvgbfvy,"A ""sad"" departure for Daniel",2,9 October 2021,"Daniel Craig is probably my favorite Bond. It is hard to see his last chapter ending in a disgraceful way like this movie was.1) the new 007 is just bad. Her role is so extra and never really act as a someone who could replace or honor the 007 number. Maybe that is why she gave him the 007 title back. Just a number. Exactly, she never took that job seriously. I felt also her character was sometimes arrogant and did not captivated me at all2) Ana de Armas probably the best part of the whole movie. Way way better than the new 007 girl.3) the storyline is not well developed, there is never a climax or a real menace. They just keep pushing it until the end and presenting simple solutions/path to all the problems.4) the villain well maybe the worst villain of all the Bond series. Honestly I don't know what Hollywood was thinking when they gave Malek an oscars. He never get out of his mr robot character. In this movie the villain doesn't exist. He never become a real threat or fear with his presence.5) the ending is just like oh hey guys we can't forget we have to kill this guy cause he is getting old. I mean I was so mad the way it was staged. Even the old lady M death was more impactful. They should at least give him a properly departure for the best Bond in years.

Did you even watch Mission Impossible: Fallout 2018 to learn action in a Bond movie should be like?* And don't get me talking about the plot, which if you think about isn't even a plot.

Just a weird man but not scary.The female 007 was just there for no reason. She brought nothing to the story and had no depth. It was one of the worst Bond films with Daniel Craig.

what IF wrote should be the agent, all this chatter about female and
black actors having James Bond name is just that.As it is said in the movie the 007 designation is just a number and THAT
can be passed to whoever, but not the James Bond name.Having said that and returning to the movie, it was typical James Bond:
Action filled, with a GOOD storyline and it went at a brisk pace.The action was awesome, not overly done, not to little, and the fact that
JB had a crush and she lived was amazing.It also underlines one of this times greatest threats as I can see it, people
are so eager to share their DNA that they do not see the danger in it becoming a weapon, this movie highlights that and I am glad:The ending for Daniel was awesome, he died as he lived, in the service of her majesty's secret service.Sure I was a bit bummed out that he did not get to ride off into the sunset with his girl but this was as good ending to James Bond as it could be.Please creators, let the James Bond brand be laid at rest now.Only reason this is not a 10/10 was cause sentimental values, the movie was brilliant and so was the action packed ending.",No Time to Die

I honestly don't understand why he's gotten so much push back over the years--I think it's a sign he's done something right because he's made the Bond character something that can be criticized, argued over, and made to feel accessible enough that we as mere mortals can express our opinion. I haven't seen that same level of access with the other Bond's, they were untouchable.The ending broke my heart but they had to do it (right? Right?). The ultimate unfair solution to the troubled character with a drive to keep going despite losing everything.The ""gadget"" ratio was just about right in this one--some very fun moments with lots of the expected whiz bang solutions, including an exploding eye that was pretty wild. I even appreciated the cheesy dialog--it tapped into Craig's natural ability to be funny and snarky and wry and it can be almost impossible to deliver those types of lines without taking everyone out of the scene--Craig and the cast did a great job thru and thru.Overall it was worth the wait and whomever is going to fill these shoes has a lot of work to do--they have to be prepared to show up with as much heart and grit as Craig and make the character their own.",No Time to Die

1409,whizzkid74,"Thematically adventurous, poorly executed",6,4 October 2021,"Let's start with some positives:The first hour of No Time to Die has some fantastic locations, setpieces and a great pace. Daniel Craig gives an abdolutely committed performance which is undoubtedly the best by an actor at the end of his run as Bond.Unfortunately, after the Cuba-set sequence, the movie drastically loses its way, with about 45 mins where barely any action occurs, there is a lot of overly-complex exposition and the few action scenes that occur (a 4x4 chase sequence) aren't as well-staged as the opening sequences. I found myself snapping out of the film and realising I was getting bored.That puts pressure on the final 30 mins to really deliver a big action finale and for me that fell flat too. There are big emotional notes in this finale, but juggling that and great action seems to have been beyond the director and editor. It doesn't help that the main villain (Rami Malek) is poorly written in terms of motivation (despite taking quite a but of time to establish his history).I also felt the lack of a really good henchman, a key element of Bond films, was lacking. Instead we have a fairly non-descript character and actor who lacks genuine threat. Oh for a Dave Bautista or Robert Shaw in this film!Without giving anything away the final element this film needs to succeed is for the audience to really buy into the Bond/Madeline Swan relationship. And between Spectre and this film, I just didn't really feel that chemistry and why this woman would have had such an effect on Bond. This is amplified by much more sizzle between Bond and Paloma, played with a real sense of fun by Ana de Armas in her cameo.I'm ok with there this movie tried to go, it might not be my preference but I admire they tried to do something different. But this film needed a much sharper edit, better villains and stronger direction. It feels slightly done by committee, perhaps explaining why Danny Boyle didn't remain on board.It's a 6/10 and to be honest I'm not sure after 25 films whether I'm really interested in seeing Bond rebooted again after this.",No Time to Die

This is the first 007 movie that's ever made me cry because this film has so much to offer to it's viewers. I've loved James Bond for probably about the last ten years but tbh I never thought I would walk out of the theater feeling as satisfied as I am right now. It was the perfect way to end off Daniel Craig's version of 007 and I honestly couldn't image the end to happen any other way. I am a little disappointed that Ana de Armas's character was only in the film for about 20 minutes, I honestly would've loved to see her more involved in the movie than she was. Other than that I absolutely loved this flick. Even though it wasn't DP'd by Roger Deakin, the cinematography was excellent, and Hans Zimmer delivered yet again another amazing sound track. I honestly can't wait to see what's next in the 007 franchise even though we will be missing Daniel Craig.",No Time to Die

But I spent half of this year watching these movies it does shed a tear that he dies. I love it when they mix up the formula. The best bond films are when they try something new and not by thinking about something new at the top of their head like spectre.This takes a bunch of elements from spectre that were misused and makes them present and correct. (Bond girl, blowfeld and action) Daniel Craig looks like he actually cares and is enjoying himself and wants to be there. The song and credits scene are good with interesting visuals again.The runtime will be preference some found it too long I didn't mind.

The Bond Family. This is Bond as soap opera.If the filmmakers cared about this narrative, it probably would have worked. The first half of the film was well done and had some brio. But I can see why Danny Boyle left. It was obvious this film was designed to die.The first thing that dies in a large film is always the plot. After almost 3 hours of film, I cannot tell you what the bad guy actually wanted The plot confuses a nanobot with a virus (hence you hear 'farming nanobots'), a henchman just switches sides - because the writers forgot, and the bad guy is literally the wrong age for the plot to work. And we still don't quite know how Spectre did know where Bond was in the first part.This makes the end half flaccid despite itself. Little things happen for no reason, clearly because the ending was rewritten. And it feels like it was rewritten a lot until any possible meaning was clubbed out of it. Forget the woke factor - this was probably toned down with yet more rewrites.The constant call backs to old bond plots, like the poison garden, finally sent the message from the production team. We are done with Bond. This is for people who just don't want him to die. But we do.",No Time to Die

The script was great and very well executed by the cast. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! The pacing was so well done; I was never bored. The opening song was another classic; Billie Eilish killed it!My one complaint was the villain. I just found his motive to be a little questionable or fuzzy.

The problem is, it is a Bond movie and i simply cannot rate it higher than 5 for that.Now why is that? In itself, you get a great script, great action, great actors, great cinematography, great soundtrack, everything appears to be top notch. Judging this movie alone in itself, it is a great movie and you should absolutely watch it. As long as you don't expect it to be a Bond movie.If you watch a horror movie, you want to get a bit frightened. If you watch a comedy, you want to laugh. Movies come with an expectation and a promise. If you make a movie, that simply does not deliver what it promises, you will disappoint your viewers.Spoilers ahead!Where does this movie break its promises:JB is not a special agent, he is an old man coming out of retirement. Gives you the vibe of an old man's tale, not like watching a superhero special agentThe movie is making you sad, instead of giving you a feel good time like all the Bonds beforeThe movie is a closer to a tragedy, than to an action comedyThey kill Bond - this is not game of thrones, you do not go into bond movies wanting to worry about if he survives, these movies always have happy endsThey kill Felix LeiterThey are ok with showing the abduction of little childrens, the movie just feels ""dark"" from time to timeBond is a Family man, many tears, many emotionsThey drag the 007 joke with replacing him with a woman too far. We get it, women can also be strong super heroes, but it felt like they wanted to ride that horse to the death throughout the movie until he finally gets reinstatedMoney Penny, who was developing as a key figure gets thrown back to the sideline with basically no screentime at allThey focussed a lot on the family drama and showing an emotional sideThe movie doesn't have a happy end and ends in a tragedy. I get why they made that decision to end the Craig era, but Bond always floats away in a yacht at the end of movies, this simply leaves a sour tasteNow all these points are completely fine, if this wasn't a bond movie. Just rename him and make another type of spy movie, totally fine, would love to watch that. This just isn't Bond anymore, they took it too far. Yes, Bond stayed at the top because the movies managed to capture the spirit of their time, adjusting to different social environments, but they always stayed true to their core. This movie just throws too much overboard to still be called a Bond movie.It appears that with Daniel Craig's screen death, the James Bond era has also ended. Goodbye and thank you for the good times Mr. Bond. From now on you simply have no idea what to expect from a Bond movie, the brand has basically ended. What will the next Bond be like?

1418,DaveVanDamage,No Time to write a proper story,4,11 October 2021,"For such a long film this lacks a lot.It is built upon a love story which has little development. Ok the relationship began at the end of the last film but we're so used to Bond's lovers playing no part in the next movie that it's easy to forget. Their fleeting romance is very hard to care about yet WE ARE supposed to be invested in it as that is what is driving the plot.Secondly this line of Bond was to be more serious and therefore lacking with some of the comedic relief in other Bonds. The part with Hugh Dennis in it could have worked well in other Bonds but it took me right out of the movie in this one. Seemed like something out of a sitcom. Were we supposed to care when they got shot or just laugh?We are also meant to recognise these characters as intelligent yet Bond stands in the line of fire against trained killers so often in this movie that it's lucky they must have skipped the lesson in how to shoot in a straight line. He took no attempt to take cover whatsoever wearing zero body armour. The villains also spend a remarkable amount of time trying to kill Bond and botching it. You'd think they'd have better things to do than send their top men to stand by the grave of Vespa for an infinite time incase Bond shows up. That being if the explosive they planted didn't wasn't so weak as to leave him without a scratch.Blofeld also spends ages concocting an event in his cell to lead Bond to kill him in such a spectacular fashion. Again you'd think they'd have better things to do and in this World than set up an elaborate scheme just to kill Bond at the very moment he discovers it's a setup.To explain this all by Blofeld having a bionic eyeball too was just mental. The other villain's bionic eye was bloody obvious ao how come Blofelds was so undetectable in the most secure prison ever? That scene too where his cage took a lifetime to move towards Bond seemed like something out an Oscar piss take. Made me laugh at what was supposed to be a climatic moment.Anyway I can't be bothered explaining more about what I consider to be wrong with this movie. I haven't even got to the weak plot, terrible antagonist, tenuous linking of the various plots to tie it all up, the female Bond, the daft escape down a one way road straight in to danger where the bad guys were coming for Bond.So much just didn't ring true for this World of Bond and the character we are led to believe he is.Worst Bond ever.",No Time to Die

After that director loses it all, rest of the screenplay is dull. Bond Villian is lacking efficacy, he seems more damaged than intimidating. Even the 5 yr. Old is not scared of him. Scene between Bond and Blofeld is weak and doesn't have the same effect as the scene from Skyfall between Bond and Silva (Javier Bardem), or first scene at the poker table when Bond and Le-chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) are face-to-face.I think overall direction is very weak, could have stuck with Sam Mendes like the previous movies.There is some un-explained trivia about Felix and 007 being BFFs. Yes Felix is in other bond movies but human touch is kind of a drag. Also fixation with which 00 number feels silly and occupies screen time for no good reason. Could have given Paloma more screen time.Last 1 hour is seems like an old bond movie-villain plot on a random island doing random science projects to build DNA based WMDs.

No Time To Die was disappointing in many aspects and failed to match the energy, edge and tension in his previous four efforts. He's the best Bond for me and Casino Royale, Skyfall and Spectre are exceptional films. Craig infused them with a jolt of attitude and gave the franchise a needed lift, but it's missing in installment five. The film never takes off, and only in the last half does it get a spark. Moreover, Rami Malek is a terrible villain. He's not threatening at all. And the run time is way too long. Sadly, this Bond doesn't reach the high bar that Craig had set in the series....",No Time to Die
1427,ChemicalBrother13,"No, you're not bigger than your character, Mr. Craig. No one was.",3,29 October 2021,"I have been a fan since my teens, have seen them all many times over and over. This film is a profound disrespect for what Bond is (or rather was), for the original character Ian Fleming has envisioned. Most likely, it is targeted at the current/future generations, with all of the worst political bias possible thrown in.Horrendous script. Bond's relationship in the best films in series (OHMSS, Casino Royale) was so naturally interwoven into the actual action/thriller scripts. Here his love takes center stage. And, honestly, it felt so false to me. Why would a character like Bond, who truly fell in love with energetic, strong-willed, even feisty women like Vesper (Greene) or Theresa (Diane Rigg), would fall in love with that uncharismatic mouse of a woman is beyond me. Lea Seydoux is not a bad actress, but she has a zero screen presence here and zero chemistry with Daniel Craig. Bad character writing coupled with the lousy casting that somehow lasted for not just one but two films.Dreadful directing. A director who doesn't know how to control his editing team and scriptwriters. Obviously, egos are let loose here yet again as this film is dragging so badly and should have been at least 25, maybe even 40 minutes shorter.A weak villain. I think that Rami Malek is a good actor (although I don't see him as bigger-than-life Freddie Mercury); then again, the Oscars have discredited their artistic merit a very long time ago for me. So whatever. But here, he comes off like a creepy nerd with a not so believable love for plants. Why does he want to erase millions? No reason at all (bad script-writing yet again). No, you can't explain away this kind of desire with just a couple of sentences at the end.Lashana Lynch. I could not understand what the point of that character was. She was just obnoxious for no reason and then suddenly warmed up to Bond. Laughable script-writing move. Here are your extra 20 plus minutes of her screen time that could have been easily left on the editing room floor. You can't help but feel that she was brought only for a fashionable diversity as she adds nothing to move the script along.The theme song by a one-hit-wonder teenager is so weak. I know that many people would disagree but to me, the fact that producers have hired someone who is absolutely immature as an artist is just another sign that this film was aimed at a very young audience from the very start. Yet again ignored are great potential JB song-writers (Arctic Monkeys - My Propeller, Beth Gibbons - almost everything, Radiohead - yes, again).Why do we need to know that Q is gay? Maybe because Ben Wishaw is gay? You're supposedly fighting the sexual objectification with the one hand, and then with the other, you bring sex orientation in. Was it supposed to be a joke? No one laughed in a very liberal NYC theater, and I have watched the film twice. Pathetic.The best parts of that film (Matera, Havana) leave one to desire that Bond would have been more of something it used to be: a fun, escapist thrilling ride. And no - I don't think it should not/could not be intelligent (like CasinoRoyale yet again, or From Russia with Love), but Bond films should tread a fine line of a sound simple (not convoluted) story and a thrill ride feeling. The funny thing is that Fleming, obviously not the best writer in the post-WWII world, is still a superior writer to a group of 300 supposedly crafty people. In that sense, even the worst Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan films are better than this pretentious egotistic drivel for people born in the 90-s, the latest.To sum up, I remember how excited I was to see how Casino Royale was a game-changing entry in the series that needed a breath of fresh air. Yes, ""Quantum of Solace"" was nowhere near as good, but at least it was devoid of this unnecessary drama and politics. Skyfall was ok for me; Spectre mediocre, but still ok. All of them were re-visited by me many times. But this film made me want to hurl a few times and laugh in the most inappropriate places. It is sad to see that the very man who revived Bond has single-handedly killed him as a character and a genre. Disappointed in Daniel Craig's decisions as, unlike his predecessors, he is a producer and has had a considerable impact on his final film. I was his avid fan right till that one. He had no right to have 007 killed. No, James Bond is not a code name. No, you're not bigger than your character, Mr. Craig. No one was.",No Time to Die

J. M. MORRISSEYThe long awaited and long delayed James Bond film No Time To Die has finally opened. I went to an IMAX screening at Universal Studio's city walk cinema and was surprised to find there was no social distancing involved at all. The theater was packed and while I was masked throughout, there were customers sitting directly on either side of me. I thought about moving to another seat, but looking around I saw there were none to be had. Every seat was full. Combined with the films plotline of a nano virus threat, this made for some uneasiness, but I was determined that this was - and forgive me - no time to die. Take me later if you will, but I had been waiting for this movie for a long time and I would not be denied.So, was it worth the wait?Yes... and no.And by no I mean I've reached an age where such enthusiasms seem childish.And yet I had to admit that I delighted in some of the twists and turns rendered to a franchise that I'd seen since its very beginning.God knows, the Bond films have had many a cringe worthy moment over the years but lately there seems to have been an attempt to delve into the character a bit more and that is where my continued interest lay. The elaborate action sequences will either satisfy the punters or not but I'm more concerned about this character who has held sway over my imagination through all the movies and all the books and all the ballyhoo down through the years. Granted he is a two-dimensional construct, especially in cinematic form, but he was occasionally grounded in reality. I related to him not as a fantasy figure but as a human being who's had to navigate life's relationships, just as we all do, whether they be at work or at home. I believe that is precisely why the Bond film's audiences tend to skew older. It's not merely for Nostalgia's sake, although that is undoubtedly a factor, but they are sharing life's travails with an old friend.Love, marriage, the passing of friends; all tell us we're getting on but James Bond will return. There's a comfort in that consistency.Maybe that's why the end of No Time To Die was so impactful for so many.Maybe he won't return.But just to make sure I stayed to the very end of the credits.Yes, it appears our old friend will live on.But in what form?Hopefully he will reappear in a cold hard reboot with no Hollywood gimcrackery involved. No dream sequences, no re-animation from the dead thanks to the latest from Q branch, no retrofit to the fifties.No, just cast it well and write hard.Finally, I'll make you an offer 007. Come back to us in recognizable form...

I was just looking at my watch 50% in. Basically enemies running at Bond blindly while he single shot snaps then dead. Bunch of NPC moments. The villains weren't intimidating at all. Actually I was confused what their motivation was or why they were supposed to be scary and powerful. Daniel Craig also looks old and worn in this. This movie felt like the script was meddled with by producers and given to 50 different writers to rewrite. It was all over the place. I guess its really not worth going to the movies these days.

1436,okomachi,An Epic Conclusion,10,14 October 2021,"Still, this is a breathtakingly gorgeous, thrilling, well-acted and suitably profound sendoff to Daniel Craig in all his ice-blue-eyed, tightly wound, gritty gravitas -a Bond who seemed much more of this world than, a Bond who bled when he was cut and bruised when he was beaten, a Bond who grieved deeply for those he lost, a Bond who will be a very, very tough act to follow. Craig was simply one of the best James Bond since Sean Connery & Timothy Dalton, and I won't argue about who was the better one, because each was perfectly suited to their tenor of their respective times.As huge fans of Bond movies, Daniel Craig's final moments as Bond rank among the most moving sequences in the history of this franchise, which has long favored the fantastic and the eye-popping in favor of genuine emotional stakes. This time, you might even choke up a little as we close the book on this version of James Bond. Craig's Bond contrasts with the unwittingly weaponized people around him, making him stand out. As he always has.In this case, yes., Craig leaves his own stylish, gritty marks on the otherwise straight-camp character. The directors and writers of Bond's 21st-century films reshaped 007's world around him, further dragging a bloodied relic into the psychological light of day. Looking over one's shoulder is a theme in the film, and it's a little sad to see Craig doing it one last time but it also feels like a genuine ending, which is arguably new for the series.In addition to its nearly three-hour runtime, ""No Time to Die"" stretches out Bond's legs, allowing him to seem at ease when we first meet him. It checks all the boxes - bug-eyed Eurotrash baddies on dirt bikes; narrow-street chase scenes; gorgeous scenery and white-knuckled fist rights; techie tricks; global terror; and an extreme body count.Craig's movies are not the first to reckon with the character's misogyny, racism and wholesale murder, but thinking wistfully about Bond's tonal evolution while watching ""No Time to Die."" It's as crisply entertaining as any of the previous Craig movies, this final quest to tie them all together comes in full circle from Craig's first Bond Casino Royale to the final epic conclusion, No Time To Die.",No Time to Die
1437,filmfan1986,WTAF,4,1 October 2021,"I have been a fan of Bond my whole life and up until now I have felt Daniel Craig was a fantastic Bond, gritty, ruthless and strong. This film had me so excited and I couldn't wait to see who Craig would bow out BUT never in a million years did I actually think the producers would kill him off.... NEVER.Maybe I am too much of a traditionalist but when it comes to something like Bond, there are certain things you do not mess with. For decades one of the things we have all loved about Bond was that he always found a way to get away and survive, no matter how ridiculous the situation may be. Its Bond after all and he always makes it, no matter what.With this movie I felt the first hour was amazing, the opening scene and titles where stunning and the storyline around the anatabots intriguing, however it quickly became a bit confusing and convoluted and I sat in my seat wondering if I had missed something as confusion slowly started to creep in. In regards to the Swann character I kept waiting for some kind of big bombshell but it didn't come in the way I imagined. Once her and Bonds daughter was revealed, my stomach started to turn and I had a bad feeling of where the story was starting to go. I felt Rami Malek was excellent but so underused. He could have been one of the great Bond bad guys but they blew it. The Paloma character was one of the best things in the movie for me, she was charming, funny, geeky but a complete bad ass but as soon as he appears, she's gone never to be seen again.....WTFI feel this movie was a complete indulgence for Daniel Craig and his Bond got a send off no other Bond had gotten before, even the great Sean Connery. Bond is dead now and I don't know where they go from here. For me the only thing they can do now is start a fresh, cast a new Bond, M, Q and Moneypenny and bring back back to what we know and love but even then I'm not sure they will be enough. We have had our time if a ""real"" Bond and it didn't work in my opinion. This movie had so much promise but let itself down by its outrageous and unforgivable ending. For me it would have been better if Swann turned out to be bad (minus the kid because Bond should never have a kid anyway), betrayed Bond, Bond came out of retirement, beat her and the bad guys and carried on working in MI5, paving the way for a new Bond to take over. I now know why Danny Boyle walked away due to creative differences, why would me to his name to this. Such a let down and disappointment.",No Time to Die

There are generally some good vibes at the end in the fight scenes in the underground facility.Everything else is poor at the most. The romance plots are unconvincing and does not fit very well in Bonds genre. Main villain is so poorly written. I mean Malek is a really good actor, but his script is so illogical and one-dimensional - i couldn't get his motives, and the actions at the end is just one big wtf - what is for him the priority? The woman he feels reportedly the immense connections with, the money (he is waiting for the customers and he does everything so the facility does not blows out) or the Bond (because he is sacrificing himself by not trying to escape just to try to kill or to hurt the Bond)? His actions with the Bond's child are also completely illogical. And we cannot forget about his background - stupid!The movie was too long. I wouldn't""t complain if it would build some connections to the characters but it is the other way around.And the ending. I have generally nothing against killing Bond.

1444,overlord0108,A fitting and emotional final outing to conclude Daniel Craig's tenure as 007.,10,5 October 2021,"So this is a deliberately spoiler-free review, so will not be as detailed as it could be, but nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed No Time to Die and had to put some of my thoughts into writing.As someone with a deep love and encyclopaedic knowledge of the Bond franchise I was a bit worried that I was going into this film with unachievably high expectations, but in my view it's a top tier Bond movie and a wonderful love letter to the franchise as a whole.Daniel's performance has always been exceptional because of the level of emotion he brings to the character of Bond and this film is easily his most emotional and characterful portrayal yet. No Time to Die effortlessly juggles heartfelt character moments and visceral action sequences, injecting energy and modernity to the existing Bond formula whilst paying homage to many familiar tropes with its, often subtle, references to the series' heritage.All of the female characters were phenomenally well-written with the trademark witty dialogue from Phoebe Waller-Bridge being a welcome and refreshing inclusion in the franchise. Adding Hans Zimmer's fantastic score, Linus Sandgren's beautiful cinematography and Cary Fukunaga's stellar artistic direction to this cocktail of winning elements elevates the film, ensuring that Daniel Craig's final mission as James Bond 007 will never be forgotten. It will be a very difficult task for his successor to live up to the legacy he leaves behind!",No Time to Die
1445,tim122,The plot has been lost.,2,2 October 2021,"Having had so much hype leading up to it release and been Daniel Craig's final outing I was hoping for a stunning final. Oh, how disappointed am I.The opening was okay with a hint or two to the past. Although having the opening credits 15-20min into the start was a bit odd.Up to this point Daniel Craig has played the Bond character pretty much the same, in this movie he was different always speaking his mind were previously there was much more emphasis on his silences and expression.The relationship with Madeleine had zero chemistry and was awkward and came over as story packing when adding her daughter.I found the female 007 just plain dull, she came over snotty and arrogant and up tight. Her presence did not bring much to the story or move it along any faster. If this was the trial for a woman to take 007, I won't be watching.Paloma - Ana de Armas' character was fantastic. It's a shame she was hardly in the movie, she could maybe take over the Felix role in the future.The deaths of Felix, Blofeld, and Safin were all anticlimactic. Felix and Blofeld could have added some much more depth to the story with or without the death scenes. Safin was under-used and well boring. He mumbled his way through the few lines he had. I don't believe Madeleine would have forgotten him from her past, after all he had a face that was not easy to forget.My biggest issue is the running time at nearly 3 hours it fails to draw you into the story, watch the trailers then you've seen the action. It needs more action and more story depth, as it stands you could cut, an hour out and still had the same story.As for Bonds death it was unnecessary and dissatisfying. This is a man that's been shot, drugged, tortured, poisoned, nearly been killed a thousand times and always kicks the bad guy's a** in the end. And lives to make it out in one peace.As for the future of Bond, well whoever takes of the has their work cut out. We need to get back to the basics of a Bond film and plays out like a Bond movie. If the Broccolis are bored with Bond, they should hand him to someone that cares and will make Bond films as Bond films.Actors, Styles, principles, views all change, but the recipe must always remain the same when working with long established characters that the public know and love.I would have loved to see what Danny Boyle had offer, it must have been better than what was delivered.",No Time to Die
1446,just-clo,Someone get the script writer a new job,3,23 October 2021,"I had heard good things about the latest Bond; alas - as always, friends and family film recommendations are not to be trusted.Cinematically, some great shots. Clearly a large budget. Gorgeous vistas, ominous cityscapes. Norway, Italy, London, the Caribbean... a different landscape to suit every taste. Two of my three stars go to the cinematography.Now; I thought in 2021 we would be able to make films with some sort of substance. This is not one of them. The plot is vapid. All of the characters unlikable. How am I supposed to be sad about the death of a man who comes across as pompous, unnecessarily overconfident, and terribly dull? The supporting roles aren't much better, with unconvincing villains and irritating protagonists. I need to know why Madeleine put on such uncomfortable high-heeled shoes as they quickly grabbed their stuff after realising they were being hunted by Ash et al, before running out of the house. She was barefoot before leaving. How impractical and unrealistic. Was then forced to spend the rest of the film shooting people and trying to save her daughter in strappy heels. Waltz was good; yet only had about 3 minutes of screen time. Such a waste.The dialogue is an embarrassment. Honestly, how they come up with such toe-curling ""funny"" lines in the most predictable spots is actually an art in itself. So bad. Not funny. Incredibly uncreative. I should have written some down, but rubbish one liners about tables, the number 007 and drinking alcohol really stick out.The narrative is predictable - I think 80% of the population could have mapped out where the story was going to go, within the first seven minutes. This made for extremely dull storytelling; my other half fell asleep midway through and I was envious.You might be thinking - where does the third star go?! This goes to the French conversation, and the little girl. The only moments of the film that didn't feel like an utter farce.Ignore your friends - really, don't bother.",No Time to Die

No one in the fully loaded cinema understood why this girl did not get more screen time kicking some asses.Waltz was completely wasted. No idea why an actor of his calibre accepted this role.The action in this movie was ok but not a typical Bond action.This movie and especially its ending destroyed the complete James Bond franchise in my eyes.Spectre completely eliminated.Felix Leiter dead.James Bond dead.When the next Bond is a woman NTTD will be the last movie I watched of this franchise.Even if Ana de Armas will be next 007 I won't watch it, we already have Vikander as Lara Croft.The creators and writers should come back to the 007 roots.

1450,eichbdani,A perfect farewell to Daniel Craig's Bond,10,14 October 2021,"I've been reading quite many reviews and opinions of Bond Fans not liking the movie and saying that it doesn't feel like a Bond film and then of course some others who deem this as Bond going woke and hating on Lashana Lynch's character. Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion and movies are always subjective experiences and that's how they should be.But well, speaking from my perspective: I've seen this movie 3 times now at the Cinema and loved every second of it. In my eyes, it is the perfect ending to a beloved actor's run as James Bond; a fitting, emotional and engaging send-off with high stakes, great action set-pieces and in my opinion the best James Bond performance ever. Craig here is not only flexing all his emotional muscles but is more fun and easy-going in just the right moments, with flashes of the Brosnan- and even Moore-esque comedy style adding some relief to the otherwise dramatic story. The movie makes bold risks never seen before in the franchise which pay off brilliantly, with such an emotional ending that still hit me even when seeing it for the third time. To top it off and tackle this topic, I believe that Lashana Lynch's character is the perfect example of how to promote diversity in an interesting and smart way without doing it just for the sake of being woke. It is truly a shame that there is such a blowback on social media regarding her character. Now, I do have to admit that I grew up watching Craig's bond and enjoyed his story arc and character development more than the (still very good) episodic style of the actors who came before him. However, I am here to give my subjective opinion, and I do think that this Bond entry ranks among the best ever.",No Time to Die

The ending was quite surprising and I completely understand why they ended it this way.Nevertheless, I had some troubles to believe the development in the beginning. Bond found the love of his life and then dumps her because He thinks she betrayed him.

In the last hour or so, it feels like the creators just thought about how many cliche's could be rolled out from other films.For this to be the way Craig, arguably the best Bond, ends his tenure is borderline upsetting - it feels like it was close to at least sticking the ending, but then slips and has an almighty (sky)fall.See it, but it will just probably disappoint.",No Time to Die

Those bring me back to the times of American Ninja with Michael Dudikoff.Bond's opponent is Remi Malek in the movie. His motivations are unclear throughout the whole movie... he's dramatically underused... has like 15 minutes of screen time where he tries to justify why he's there with no success. It's a shame that a great talent like him gets such a poor role.Throughout I had the feeling that someone stood besides the director and randomly told: ""Hey... don't forget this is a Bond movie, so let's put an Aston Martin there!""... so they did, and they thought that's the key to success. They even managed to ruin the music... Hans Zimmer is great, but David Arnold would have done a better job within a day or two. I really have the feeling that the people who made this movie had a lack of understanding what a Bond movie is about.The only bright spot is Ana De Armas's appearance.

It does continue the story of Daniel Craig's Bond and concludes a 5 film series in, what I thought was, a perfect way. It's unpredictable and possibly unpopular.The movie starts to pay off very early with a proper Bond style car chase and the next bit of action is never too far away. The movie really does do a great job of dealing with the flawed character that is James Bond and his struggles with the job he was born to do, his desire for a peaceful life and his battle with booze. It's the first Bond film that I can recall having such strong feelings towards our hero.It's not perfect. It does deviate from the classic Bond formula a bit which won't be popular with many fans. Rami Malek is underused and almost a side character which is a crying shame. Try not to go in expecting more of the same old, same old. This one is a little bit different.I came away from the cinema feeling very satisfied and I reckon I'll be thinking about it for days to come.

Plots has so many things to offer (Felix and Ash, Safin, all that happened with SPECTRE, Hercules Project and its potential risks, new entries of MI6 and of course the little cute Mrs. Bond).Lastly, Hans Zimmer did it again.

Why on earth everyone is so upset with the ending when the whole Bond character (since 90s and until now) was actually ""getting there""?! Why sobbing so loudly over that?To me ""No time to die"" is no doubt a movie with a very dynamic visual storytelling that can blow your mind, or at least keep you watching it all for the whole 2 hr 30 something minutes on one breath. However, the main antagonist is weak. His actions are loud (according to the script), not so the acting...
You can see Freddie Mercury with an injured face or a copy of DR. No or even a Pharaon from the ""Night at the Museum"" (wearing a different costume). But no, you will not see a Character that would be capable of plotting the whole Spectrum to go down, a figure who was supposingly holding nearly a whole armed army of crazy Russians making them keeping all that blood squirting, having the intention to wipe somewhat half the planet due to some serious mental issues.No.Safins strong visual character and appearance in the beginning of the movie was totally wiped off the face of the screen by the bad acting, in hand with it's undeveloped character in the script.

Black woman as a new agent 007 could have had a stronger role! Then, in one scene she was ""losing it"" kicking the arse of the Crazy Russian scientist but only after his promising speach of being capable ""wiping out her entire race at no time"". What a blunt sample! Was that written by a 1st year student for the 12 year olds BLM followers? Do not take me wrong, I do LOVE the idea for the next J. Bond to be of African origin, a woman. What was put in this script was simply shallow and somewhat white... New 007 had to be as solid as the old! Instead of that we see a new 007 as a career builder.But despite all that, we have one amazing cast and filming, astonishing scenes of action, dramatic moments and so much loved Bondiana comical twists. Unfortunately all that is in hand with weak script and one sloppy villain.",No Time to Die

Neither The evil plan to destroy the world, nor the vilan are that powerful or coherent for all that matters, but that's ok, because this movie is not about the plot, it's about the Bond and the people in the ""James Bond"" universe.

I loved Rami in Mr Robot but I didn't like him at all in here. I'm not sure I can blame it on him though. Muddy direction? Ridiculous writing? Everything was so forced and Craig looked like he didn't want to be there. Plus the 007 subplot with the new female agent? Is she supposed to be the new bond? I think a Bond girl can work but if that actress was the first choice then it was a sad sad casting choice. She is not talented nor pretty.

Perhaps. But this is not a James Bond film it's just a film. Especially now I don't want to leave the cinema feeling confused and down.Let's make wonder woman a man.

Political correctness has never been Bonds main trait so to force feed him a black female replacement seemed to be just for the sake of political correctness.I had such high hopes for this film and I've just left the cinema feeling very deflated.To many negative points to list so I'll list what I did like. Action sequences were spot on, car chases and fight scenes were some of the best I've seen. Main theme and incidental music were excellent (maybe the use of hints and themes from ""On her majesty's secret service"" had something to do with that).All I can wish for after this is that the next bond movie is a complete reboot and we get to see Bond, Blofeld, Spectre, Felix Leiter etc return from the dead and give us the OO7 we all hoped this would be.",No Time to Die

1488,the_demolished_man,He's supposed to be a Hero...,5,11 October 2021,"Finally got to see the film after what seems like years... and what a mixed bag it is.Great music (nice use of John Barry's ""All the Time in the World"" from OHMSS), good action sequences, nice acting, good to see the Aston Martin back in action, an interesting new 007, and a fantastic sequence with Paloma in Cuba.However, 40 mins too long, very very loud, a weak villain, no chemistry between Bond and Swann making the central love story hard to accept.However, my main problem is the killing of Bond. Not the actual idea of killing him, but the way they did it. What a waste of his death. In a traditional Bond film, Bond would have saved Madeline and Mathilde, fought the villain, got shot, but still opened the blast shields, and swan-dived off the tower at the last second - a hero. He could then retire officially from the service with honours and live a long, happy life with his family.However, the writers and presumably Craig (also a producer) wanted the character to die. Fair enough, I don't really have an issue with this, but he should have at least have been given a hero's death - sacrificing his life to save his family and/or the whole world. But no - he is unnecessarily infected by the poison, removing his ability to be with his family. He has already killed the villain, saved the world, and his family is safe. But now he has no reason to live, so he gives up and dies - for no good reason in the plot. Dying miserably, rather than as the true hero he is. That's just cruel. And what a lazy, unforgivable insult to the legions of Bond fans through the years who have supported this franchise.Still, one good thing is that I can now treat the 5 Craig films as a separate mini-series, an interesting alternative take on the life of a superspy, and set them aside from the original 20 films from Connery to Brosnan, which I now see as the true ""Bond"" canon. And I can watch those films without thinking that the series will eventually end in misery. Win-win. Whatever happens now, at least I still have that.There will be new films, obviously, but James Bond Will Return? - I don't really see how.Oh, and one more thing - can anyone explain just how every single member of Spectre from all over the globe has the same DNA?",No Time to Die

The Bond i knew always finds a way to save himself. I was expecting same. None of the bonds died. After seeing his death, you can't bring out another actor with name of bond. It's just unrealistic. If you'd like to continue with Nomi, this means you are betraying the iconic serie. This was like end of all serie. At this point it is better to not continue the serie. I wished you did not kill bond. But it's too late. Thank you writers. I also felt sad for Felix Leiter. Bond took his cigar after his death. This event was emphesised but we could not see cigar again. Bond might be smoking it before dying. I also felt diconnection in Saphin's story. About why is he doing all the things? Who were coming to take lab's product? This iconic serie needed older, more mature singer for the theme. She is successful and talented but her style is not for this movie in my opinion. Other thing is Paloma had less scenes than i expected. I loved Italy scenes they were amazing. I can watch it more than 100 times. My vote was 10 until last scene. I wanted to give 10/10 because this serie is important for me, it must be fighting with overrated marvel series in top lists. More classic movies have to come in next era.

Fast & Furious before Fast & Furious.But Craig's era changed that. For one, they made a Bond universe. Instead of movies feeling like they had no connection to movies before, now there is a link. Craig also showed that Bond actually cared about people around him, which was new. And made the viewer care about them. First time in the franchise.And killing Bond at the end was the right decision.

However, with Soectre it became less about the character of Bond and more about the character of Craig. All the traits that were the essential make up of Bond, that made him into the cold hard assassin began to disappear and in this film they have been wiped out. What we are left with is nothing like the character Fleming wrote about and has been portrayed for so many years.Add to this, NTTD has a very weak, and at times incomprehensible, plot line with a very bland and poor villain whom appears more like a whinging teenager (also Malik is only 5 years older than Sedoux so how their back story works out I don't know). The humour is limited and when delivered sounds contrived and lame. It's way too long and often scenes ramble on without any bearing on the non existent plot. Even the action scenes seem overworked and at times pushing belief, which for a Bind film is quite an achievement. Lynch is under used, under developed and unbelievable in the role of a professional assassin. Other characters have story arcs moving in unlikely directions or just get discarded. For me the only bright spark was Ana de Armas.My advice, use the ticket price for a pizza and stick on the dvd From Russia with Love.",No Time to Die

Cary Fukunaga balances light and dark, injecting some early Bond-style humour while delivering many tense sequences of action and drama that contribute in crafting one of the most memorable and technically-impressive Bond films ever. The opening pre-title sequence, shot entirely in 65mm IMAX, instantly solidifies No Time To Die as a top-tier Bond film.

A great 25th movie with a interesting storyline and a wonderful use of it's cinematography!It's not the best Bond movie but surely one to remember for a long time.Casting Daniel Craig as bond is still one of the best movie castings to date and this one proves that again.Somehow the humor was pretty great throughout the length of the film!The Storyline is good but sometimes a bit too long and that way it became overstretched at times..
I couldn't really feel the villain he was there but that was it, can't really rely on his motive on why he's doing what he does.Overall, it's a great action movie and i had a lot of fun watching it!",No Time to Die

1529,Aror1991,007 without James Bond,5,20 October 2021,"To me this movie has a very clear message. James Bond is obsolete. An old white man that has become irrelevant. Not only is his 007 title taken from him, he is outmatched by three women, average weight around 100 lbs, who could easily have achieved victory over all the enemies in the movie without him.He has no added value in this modern world, where women are not only incredibly smart but also physically superior to men thrice their size.It's hard not to see the message the movie is portraying as a broader effort; the world is different now and certain people can no longer play the main roles.It's a sad goodbye to Daniel's Craig Bond and to me it feels like the end of James Bond itself, regardless of what comes next for the character.Overall I must say it's not a bad action movie, although the main characters seem immortal, which makes it quite boring. Think John Wick, in terms of power levels.Regardless, it's not Bond as we know him, most likely it never will be again.",No Time to Die

1532,ryanbradford,The worst Bond film yet?,2,30 September 2021,"Possibly one of the worst Bond films of the past 60 years. The first 30-45 minutes are excellent and reminiscent of Casino Royale and Skyfall, however it slowly drops in quality from there. Some of the characters appear to have been added in purely for the sake of it and add very little value, and there is a large proportion of time where the film feels very slow. The new female characters are very greatly portrayed and I commend the fact that this film has much less of the traditional ""Bond girl"" moments. The storyline is relatively good, however the execution and focus into the personal life of Bond in this film detracts from its value - it feels like any other film from any other title and NOT part of this franchise. Without spoiling this film for anyone, the ending is terrible - I have no issue at all with what happens, however it doesn't actually make sense and does not fit the continuity of the previous 60 years of the franchise. It would appear the Bond series is over for some bizarre reason (although the end of the credits does state ""Bond will return"" which is technically impossible given the finale of this terrible installment). Overall I have to say that I was disappointed and left very confused.",No Time to Die
1533,gabrielemoratti,No Bond at all. And that's the biggest disappointment.,4,4 October 2021,"The feeling I have is is that writers have been looking for shocking moments at all costs (there's a few across the movie), without any consideration of what is really important in a Bond movie. As a consequence, there's plenty of terrible holes in the screenplay. I will mention just a couple and yes, with spoilers because I really can't stand such a terrible writing made by professional people on a Bond movie.1) A romantic trip to Matera just to visit Vesper's tomb? With your new fiancee? And for what reason? To get peace from your former lover who died three movies ago? No Bond at all!2) Spectre is gone, deleted, dead, in the blink of an eye. Really? Are you serious?3) Blofeld is contained in the most secure and isolated bunker in the world. He probably had the most severe body check in the universe, and still he communicates at the party in Cuba via a bionic eye? Oh c'mon! I want Moonraker back! It was more credible.It's not really about the ending, although I personally found it very disappointing. It's about the misinterpretation of what a Bond movie is. This is the less Bond-esque of the entire franchise. And here's why, in my humble opinion. The overall feeling of the movie is just a continuous sense of anxiety that gets under your skin and never abandons you. Not Bond at all. Bond is tension, not anxiety! You need some humor, even just a bit. You need some light and refreshing action that is almost totally missing here.Yes, you should put some LGBT and racial themes in a Bond movie. It makes perfect sense. As long as you keep them integrated and consistent in the story. Having a single line randomly written and placed just for the sake of it is ridiculous and disrespectful.The villain is almost non-existent. His actions are totally nonsense,
The direction is forced, too introspective. Too many close-ups. I had the feeling I was watching a completely different kind of film.So. No. This is not Bond. This is a forced step that is probably intended to prepare a brand new ground for the next 007. But this is not bringing new allure to Bond's legacy, like the past 5 movies greatly did; this is a slap in the face of Bond, Fleming, Cubby Broccoli and all the fans across the world.",No Time to Die
1534,kevin_H_,A bold yet an epic conclusion! Thank you for everything Craig!,10,8 October 2021,"Simply outstanding and Craigs best since ""Casino Royale"". After seven polarizing days im ready to review this movie.Its bold, gripping and very cinematic. Have seen it three times already!First viewing: HATED IT! (I almost declared the mess ""Spectre"" as the better film) But after the second viewing, it grew on me, and right after the third viewing (IMAX) I finally embraced it! ""No time to Die"" is extremely hard to digest and this film feels like a modern ""On her Majestys secret service""! Disliked in the past, loved by most in the present (Not to mention all the references of OHMSS in the actual movie).I think NTTD will grow as time passes!Sure, its a tad too long and Safin deserved more screentime, but other than that... I had a blast! Lush cinematography, Outstanding action (Single-take fight at safins lair) and a tone close to that of ""Casino Royale"". Craigs second best! Accept it for what it is and give it time and another viewing! I sure did and now i truly enjoy it!PS. Craigs performance is topnotch!

1536,doctororly,"No. Simply no. If you really love bond, skip this movie. Trust me.",2,4 October 2021,"My rating is based on the lousy story and broken formula, and not about the great acting.A little about me first: I am still a young guy and been a bond fan for all my life. I was even thinking about buying the massively overpriced Omega watch shown in this film. That is just how much I love this franchise. So I think my review has at least a little bit of weight. Hint: I won't touch that watch now, not even for free. To wear it would feel like a taunt of the franchise.I rate the Craig Movies like this:
1. Casino Royal (9)
2. Skyfall (7)
3. Quantum of Solace (6)
4. Spectre (3)Note that I think only Casino Royal and Skyfall were really good out if these. And guess why No Time to Die is not on the list? This is just not a Bond movie anymore. Honestly. If there are people that like it, good for them. But the current 7.7 rating is just a taunt. GoldenEye has a 7.2 on here and is one of the greatest Bond movies of all time. I love the Bond franchise because the recipe of the movies just works. This movie and also Spectre move far away from this recipe. Therefor I can only rate this as a 2/10 because I felt and still feel betrayed that this is even sold as a Bond movie. It simply is not.There is almost no humour or dark humour.The ending doesn't work for a Bond.The story is messy.The story is like a sequel to Spectre. Bond movies don't need sequels.The relationships between the characters are unbelievable at times.Bond should never be a love story. If you want a love story, invent a new franchise.Some scenes with the kid are just ridiculous. Seriously, who wrote the last scene with the villain and the kid?Could this be the reason why there was a director change and a writer change during the production? Maybe they felt like I do?I feel sorry for the great actors in this movie. They deserved something better. And we fans did too.So with all honesty, if you really really love the old Bond formula like I do, I think this will be the first Bond movie I recommend to simply skip it. Because you will simply not feel happy after seeing it.",No Time to Die
1537,mchootz,Time to Nap,5,31 October 2021,"At almost three hours long this movie should hold you on the edge of your seat but instead you keep wondering just how high the body count will go before 007 (the real one) bites the dust. Daniel Craig is fine in his swan song, even managing a fast smile now and then like David Jansen did on ""The Fugitive "" but the thought suddenly occurs as Felix Leiter, Blofeld and then James Bond all perish.It's great sport to argue about who was the best Bond?Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Peirce Brosnan (and the rest) but nobody killed off James Bond when Connery or Moore left the series, and they were pretty big names at the time. I'd hate to think this was a marketing ploy to get people into the theaters to see this overfed documentary and then come back in a couple years to see the rebooted James Bond. Will Hollywood do that ? Nah.The actors were all fine and I get the point of ""James Bond's life had meaning because he fathered a child"" but it seemed oddly out of character and distasteful to have such long scenes of a really bad guy threatening great harm to a little child.At the end of the day do we rate the movie as a James Bond movie or a movie with interchangeable character names ? If it was about a spy named Tom Jones, I might rate the movie a 6-7. Rating it as a James Bond movie it's a 3-4. Hence my 5 rating. I don't know what it is.",No Time to Die
1538,dj_patkica,Daniel Craig never was James Bond,1,11 October 2021,Daniel Craig lacks the charm that is personification of James Bond. He can be 007 but not the Bond. He is just a brute. Real James Bond wouldn't ever enter the club such that one on Jamaica where he has a meeting with Felix. Also Paloma is way more interesting than that wannabe 007 female replacement.

I've loved Craig's Bond movies for the most part but Rami Malek's villain just seemed weak to me.

Opening shot is the least memorable and iconic of the franchise... not a Bond film from minute one. Classic bond is great locations... short of Jamaica & Cuba scenes (10 minutes at best) there are no glamorous iconic locations. Way too caught up in legacy of the cast to actually write a well rounded villain or non sprawling back story. Well done Danny Boyle for getting out while you could!

1546,leonardohunter,A strong farewell to one of the best James Bond we ever had.,8,6 October 2021,"16 years after what I consider to be the best film of the 'Daniel Craig' era 'Casino Royale', comes the long awaited conclusion, one that fans and movie buffs alike have been waiting for to see the final assault that Craig and company had in store for us, and for me, all the films have been quite special, and I can't say goodbye to this last one them without this review, for all the good times and astoning fight sequences that bring me emotion, throught the years.'No Time To Die' is epitomized by all of its predecessors, it is the pinnacle of this Bond narrative in its journey of death, betrayal, loss and saving the world. Here we finally close all the loose ends that have been left in past films including the one that for me was the most important, the Vesper one. Bond does the human thing and goes to the grave of the one he once loved to simply tell her ""I miss you"" while burning a piece of paper with the word ""forgive me"" on it where he repents and finally lets go of all the suffering he felt for her to finally forgive himself as well.After this we have a pretty extensive and intense action sequence with what I think is the best part of 'Han Zimmer's' score in the film where we go back to the old ways and the most representative element of this story: the secrets. After being attacked by Spectre thinking that maybe Madeleine, the love of his life has betrayed him, bringing him absolutely all the pain that made him close himself off from the world. In the end, in order for the tape to unfold the two are separated and we are given a span of 5 years that have passed that I think, are not entirely justified, but there they are.The film more generally speaking is not perfect, has several clichés of the genre and forced situations that are made to advance the story, the action sequences are not as dazzling as in previous tapes but I must say that I found this interesting, as we not only see the already so well known brute force of the character but now we test their intelligence in combat, the camera work is amazing in many of these sequences, it feels more real than what we are used to.The length for me was on point and in retrospect, it's because from my point of view the story isn't that challenging or trying to take on a narrative that will blow your mind, it has several very intense thrilling moments which is something I personally enjoy a lot, but from there on out it went for a story that relies more on the humanity of James than how competitive a more unique narrative could have been.There are parts where the humour for me didn't quite work and it's more in thethought out jokes, the humour I enjoyed was the subtle, deadpan humour that simply exists because the situation warrants it.The way of filming is another strong point of the movie, I really enjoyed that they went out of the conventionalism and tried to do something more unique for this farewell, the photography with the different landscapes, especially the green areas is a visual delight to see.And now to finish and not make this review longer, the characters. The villain played by 'Rami Malek' I liked, but he is not as memorable as 'Javier Bardem's' Silvia who is the best villain for me of these films, the motivations of the character are not necessary for me to consider him a villain out of the general format, he is interesting, but at the same time very monotonous, he has no real reason to want to destroy everyone and unfortunately it is not fully explored. Blofeld is one of the characters that I think is redeemed a bit but not entirely because I couldn't help but feel that it's very out of nowhere that he orchestrated Italy's plan to make James abandon everything... again, and then with his respective death I still maintain the position that they could have done much better things for the character that would have put him as the best villain of the entire Bond saga, with an actor of the caliber of 'Christoph Waltz' they already had it all.The supporting and secondary characters were fine, unlike Spectre we see them less time because of the intervention of the new 007. Mone I thought was well introduced and fit into the story better than I expected, it's nice to see a bit of a dynamic with herand Bond, but she also shines on her own, but without really being the main focus. Felix is one of the flaws I find in the film, he just doesn't get enough screen time and in the same film we're given his death to make aself-improvement and personal vendetta arc for Bond. 'Ana de Armas' is quite the star, but here she has a short role that yes, it's dazzling to see her in action, but it's nothing very special in the end, it serves its purpose in the story, but I would have loved to see more of her.And finally, the main arc of the story, James Bond, Madeleine Swan and her daughter Mathilde. To tell you the truth, I didn't see the daughter's appeal coming until I had her on screen. I didn't know how to feel about it at first until I understood why they did it at the end. I said before that this movie opts for Bond's humanity and it does,before he had nothing to lose, but now, with no time to die he has a family, which as any father has to protect. That's the dynamic I enjoyed the most because we see the character mature and understand a little more all the actions of his life that have brought him there.That's where we get to the conclusion, the closure to the first complete James Bond narrative. Safin in one of my favorite moments of the film uses one of the best philosophies against Bond, telling him that everything they touch, caress or interact with dies, no matter what. It is here where our protagonist realizes that it is true, remembering all those who died because of him or circumstances where he was involved, so he makes the hardest decision of his life, with the poison and the particularity that can never touch their loved ones is sacrificed as the hero he is, in one of the most human moments of the saga. In spite of everything, he was able to save everyone he loved and he knows that he will always live in his daughter and in her beautiful blue eyes, like those of his father.The Bond arc closes and we have his farewell, with the last scene where Madeleine tells her daughter that she will tell her the story of a James Bond, making a nice homage to the character's source material to end Daniel Craig's era as the British secret agent.A very worthy closure for the character, who for the first time has what he needed to evolve and does it in agood way, the most human way to say goodbye to an icon of popular culture. Despite it's flaws I find 'No Time To Die' worth seeing and more if you're a fanof this saga, is a movie that certainly can not miss because of the meaning andbecause it is loaded with a good dose of action that will please anyone to havea good time at the movies. Without a doubt I'm happy and anxious to see what this saga has in store for us in the future, but in the meantime thank you, 'Daniel Craig', for giving us one of the best versions of the character.Final grade: 7.8/10.",No Time to Die

Stylistically it was cool and it definitely threw some surprises our way! But I was not satisfied with the ending at all.

1560,MariSo9319,"This is not a Bond-Movie, ...",3,2 October 2021,"... this is fundamentaly a romantic-drama that was forcibly pushed into the framework of a Bond-Movie.I never thought I would ever be able to say this, but the existance of this now makes ""Spectre"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" only the mediocre movies of the Craig-Era.It's not a completely horrible film, but it definetly misunderstands who the Bond-Character is and why most people like watching movies about the guy. If you ever wanted to see James Bond recite long-winded speaches about how much he still loves his wife, make breakfast for his ""daughter"" and get into emptyheaded, fortune-cookieesque discussions about the morality of violence with a villain who has basically no redeeming qualities or even a good motivation for why he does what he does, then this is the movie for you. And while having an action-movie focused around family-drama with a black-and-white villain isn't a bad thing in and of itself, it's not a good fit for James Bond, a suave spy who works alone, does inhuman stunts, snarks a lot, beds beautiful women and always comes out on top above a clever villain. Bond is cliché, but thats part of the charme and something that shouldn't be changed about the character.Amidst all that there are some positives to note though:
side-characters are mostely fine. Q and Moneypenny are a delight, but sadly very sparesly used in this movie.it's always nice to see Felix Leiter in a Bond-Movie (sadly they kill him of for no real reason).Lashana Lynch's character was a nice addition, that doesn't fall into the hole of ""I'm so much better than the old 007"", she gets as good as she gives and she and Craig actually play well off each other.everything about the part of the movie that was set in and around Santiago de Cuba worked very well.most action-scenes are fun and the film is all in all well shoot.There are some neutral points:
M's fine, but pretty bland and at times somewhat confusing in his mannerism and decision-making.the movie looks nice, but with a budget that is higher than the GDP of some african countries they don't get points for that anymore nowadays.intro-song is nothing special and Billie Eilish can definetly do better, but at least it's not offensively bad.But the biggest parts of the movie are just plain awful:
villain has no real motivation, besides maybe greed and being evil? He doesn't really show up until about two-thirds into the movie (defing time and space with his appearance, since apparently everybody ages except him) and his reasons for doing what he does are flimsy at best (he wants to maybe kill Madeline, because he let her live as a child, when he set out to kill her whole family, because her father killed his and he wanted to make him suffer (why he let her live is never explained). He wants her child, to maybe raise as his own and to ""protect"" her, why and from what they never really elaborate anything about either and he lets her go without a fuss in the end anyway. He also constantly says that he hates violent people, but he sells terrible bioweapons to the highest bidder, because maybe he likes money, even though he's shown to already have loads of it (the guy owns his own island, attack-helicopters and an army of henchman before even making his first sale)? He whipes out Spectre and uses Madeline to assassinate Blofeld, because why I don't know, maybe he just felt like it that day?)big, bad bioweapon is completely inconsistent, sometimes they have to specifically encode it with the DNA of it's intended victims to make it dangerous, but at the end simply peripherally touching the DNA also does the job, which is stupid, since people can also get ""infected"" with it and that doesn't kill them instantly.they got Christoph Waltz to play Blofeld, one of the most iconic Bond-Villains ever and the only thing they really did with him in two movies was to make him a generic, evil crazy-man that dies like a little b*tch.an ungodly amount of relationship/family-drama that completly misses what James Bond is at it's core.Craig and Seydoux still have next to no on-screen chemistry, which makes the relationship-drama even more agonizing to watch.and worst of all, they kill of the titular character at the end of the movie. Something that has never been done before in this franchise and never should have, because it destroys the mythos around the character.After this I don't really care anymore in what way, shape or form ""James Bond will return"". They have thoroughly soured me towards the character and this movie-franchise. James Bond died here, may he stay that way and rest in peace.",No Time to Die

I've been anxiously awaiting this release for 2 years and I have to say I was a little disappointed, considering it was Craig's final film in the series. Without going into detail, I wasn't happy with the ending. But I still thought it was well done and I respect the writers decisions in that respect. The middle was the real let down for me. Not much happened, not much character development, and honestly, it was a bit confusing. I haven't seen the previous movies in awhile so maybe the confusion was my fault. But it was slow, and not in a plot-building sort of way. Just empty. I honestly don't remember the middle. My other major problem, which isn't necessarily the film's fault, is that Ana de Armas part was insignificant yet she's being touted as a major character. She was in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and it was a silly role. I think the producers were trying to capitalize on the buzz around her personal relationship at the time of original release and, to me, that seems cheap. But again, nothing to do with the film.

Bond grew up and so did we.On a very thin negative side I would have wished for a bit more information about Safin to get a more urgent feeling of danger around his actions but that movie could have been easily 4h long.All in all, I can only say thank you to the producers and to Daniel Craig for creating beautiful movies and a Bond character that is a definition of coolness & skill but also flawed, vulnerable and, yes, relatable.",No Time to Die

1568,acquaman,Good but not great,7,12 October 2021,"I've read all the books and I've seen all the movies more times than I can count. If you are an aficionado of James Bond, the movies between Sean Connery and Daniel Craig, at least for me, don't count. They were just Hollywood nonsense, particularly the ones with Roger Moore. Daniel Craig picked up the franchise where Sean Connery left off. He was/is a great bond but, as good as he is, Connery had it all. The super agent that was well-versed in everything. Fearless, smart, ridiculously suave and sophisticated. A man of few words and purposeful deeds. But when he did speak, his quips were historic. This movie took bond out of that category, Mouthing things that the real bond would never say. While writing this, in reflection, it's like the Alien franchise. The very first alien movie was a horror movie, disguised as science-fiction. Virtually No music. Only Essential dialogue. Visuals that furthered the story. Brilliance in film making. This movie caved and pandered to Hollywood blockbuster theory, just as the the later aliens had big music, ridiculous dialogue and people in outer space taking off their helmets and trying to play with unknown alien creatures. There's certainly Big bond action, but They turned him into something that bond is not, vociferous and unsure, He's always calculated in everything. This is not the bond who disposed of the villains he opposed during his tenure. Yes he is older, yes he is retired, but that's no reason to make him less of what he Was/is. He's a virtually unstoppable machine. Point and shoot. He always succeeds, despite the odds. This was not a good sendoff for Bond.",No Time to Die

1571,david_morenoj,It was a great movie but it wasn't really the time to die.,9,6 October 2021,"The movie was amazing. As a James Bond fan, I think the people who are complaining about giving 1 star either haven't seen the movie or didn't understand it at all.True, when I went to see the movie I was a bit skeptical because of all the bad comments and when Nomi is presented as the new 007 I was quite disappointed because James Bond is not only a spy but a symbol of masculinity, something that in 2021 is not well seen. A generation that grew up watching American Dad and now they get upset about everything.The movie is great, and for all those who say it's not a James Bond movie, I suggest you re-watch all the movies to get your mind right.This film is full of hidden clues, such as Ana de Armas saying that she was very nervous because this was her biggest job so far.Okay back to James Bond and the fact that they introduce the new 007 as a woman.We live in an era where everything has to be politically correct and where the feminist movement is becoming more and more radicalized.From my point of view, the director in this film mocks this radical feminist mentality, they present Nomi as an insecure person who practically at no point wins the affection of the viewer unless at the end of the film.First of all, it begins with a joke since in Jamaica when they are in Bond's room the first thing Nomi takes off is the wig to which James replies: I never thought it was the first thing you take off or something like that.There is a moment in the movie when James Bond is reinstated as 00 and Nomi keeps asking what number he had been assigned, but the way she expresses herself shows only insecurity, meanwhile James Bond continues to show his mature and confident personality referring to her at all times as 007 and thanks to her for all the help.Many people say it's a boring movie, but the action doesn't stop, one of Daniel's movies in the character with more action actually.I just don't like the ending, because if I was the director I would have given James a happy ending for his years of service.I have to say that Lashana Lynch's performance as Nomi was great, but I don't think we will see a sequel of the actress as the new 007, just like we will never see a Wander Man or Brad Pitt playing Lara Croft.

Almost all of them are for political reasons, either offended that there is a female character who is a 00 agent (will likely refer to it as 'woke nonsense') or didn't stick around for the post credits which reassured that JAMES BOND WILL RETURN. This is a brilliant bond film. Fantastic action, and fresh ideas too (incredibly difficult for a 50 year old franchise). Craig is excellent, and a worthy bow for the man who has given us 2 of the very best bond films ever (Casino Royale + Skyfall). Ralph Fiennes is intense which i enjoyed and Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris are fun to watch, being semi comic relief in the middle act. I enjoyed the plot, some bond films have annoyed me with an incredibly boring (For Your Eyes Only, The Living Daylights etc) plot or a ridiculously stupid (Die Another Day, Moonraker) plot, but this is exciting, tense, gritty and doesn't confuse the viewer.I do have 3 minor gripes which keep this from being a 10 in my opinion.1 - I do not care for the song, this is purely musical taste and personal opinion and i don't believe the song matters to be honest, but it's too slow and dull for my taste. My favourite bond songs are A View to A Kill and You Know My Name, i guess i just prefer songs with some energy, but this is incredibly minor and really not important.2 - The underuse of Ana De Armes. I thought she was excellent in her scenes in Cuba and i was sort of waiting for her to come back throughout the film but she just...didn't. Would have liked to have seen more of her as she was brilliant in my opinion and had a level of wit missing from plenty of the stereotypical 'eye candy' bond girls.3 - The underuse of Remi Malek. This irked me slightly, as Malek has shown how brilliant he is and i just wanted to see more of him. I don't know exactly the length but it feels like i waited at least half of the film for him to show up. Seriously? I wish he had been brought into the plot earlier, rather than messing with Blofeld before killing him off in the first half. And even after we know he is the man in the mask from the films beginning, he's still barely in the film. The film takes much more time focusing on Bond and Swans relationship, rather than building a great main villain. I believe Malek will soon be forgotten as a Bond villain, and it's such a shame because from his limited screen time he was a pretty good bond villain.But overall, this is an excellent bond film.

After more reflection and careful consideration, I am starting to think they did the right thing here. Bond isn't Superman after all, he's a man. A flawed man just like from the novels. He died a hero and for such an explosive, gritty, brutal rendition of Bond I think it may have been better to burn out than fade away.

1609,gking-08230,this was not Fleming,1,28 October 2021,"Just my opinion... The character and success of 007 was laid by Ian Fleming. A brilliant writer with a pedigree background in espionage..most i guess have never opened his books. His success with the stories and the overwhelming popularity of the larger than life character he invented are the DNA which made Bond, James Bond....this junket was not a tribute and preservation of this character. It was, as the script and sad ending demonstrated, a deformed and confusing translation of a superspy character which should never be tampered with, for to do so is to say you are better than Fleming, and you arent. M is to be respected and revered as commander in chief. Moneypenny and Q have their small and yet very specific position's... While I understand the compulsion to create a unique series, and I accept the challenges to push extremes I think this was more of a movie to exit Daniel Craig (a fine actor) and adore the modern day attitude of the dispensible male, rather than a James bond epic to remember... Unlike the fabulous adventure of Casino Royale which for me brought the 007 vintage into almost perfect alignment with Flemings mastery, who reminds us that these elegant and sophisticated transits are there to escape a mundane life and not to be reminded of it. I wish I had not seen this....can I have my money back please?",No Time to Die

Entertaining overall, but agree with other reviewers that it felt more like a typical and cliched action movie, particularly in the second half - more of a parody than a homage. Above all, while it's reasonable to modernise the Bond character, we may have now reached a point of no return for the spirit of Fleming's real Bond. The next movie will be make - or I fear break - to the substance of what has made Bond movies distinctive and great.",No Time to Die
1612,lukicalexander,Immediate reaction 15 minutes after credits,9,10 November 2021,"Wow. Kind of sad to think this is the end of my generations James Bond. I wonder if Sean Connery was given an emotional goodbye like Daniel Craig. When Daniel Craig was first cast to play James in the Casino Royale in 2006, I honestly remembering being upset by the choice of a Blond Bond. After 5 movies over a 15 year period, I can confidently say he's the greatest Bond ever. Period, and period. The ending of No Time to Die felt like the end of the Harry Potter series where you've developed a fondness for all of the characters that have been there throughout the journey.Was this the greatest bond of the Daniel Craig series? Of course not. That honor belongs to Skyfall or Casino Royale, whichever camp you fall in. This was a fun movie, it went through the highlight reel giving the important players in the franchise each a respective spotlight. It was a mix of the Sam Mendes ultra real life Bond with a sprinkle of classic cheesy throwbacks. There's an evil villain on a secret island and Bond must get off! There are henchmen that can't seem to find a bullet to hit James Bond, a martini that's shaken and not stirred, and of course, a perfect corny punch line after a gritty death (""I showed him your watch Q, it blew his mind""). The introduction of the new 007 was executed well and done with class. Rami Malek played a fine villain. Billie Eilish intro song was okay. A favorite scene of mine that deserves to be noted. Bond in the villains hide out seemingly defeating every bad guy in site, and a distant gunshot in a corridor visually similar to the classic 007 intro where he snaps back to the camera and pops off a shot, with the sharp horns music and blood falling over the screen. We saw a rolodex of the finest Aston Martins from each decade since the franchise inception. Ralph Fiennes leaving the audience with a quote that serves as an homage and memoir to James Bond, reminding everyone not to simply exist, but truly live. This was a great 007 adventure, and I will truly miss Daniel Craig. He's the Bond I grew up with.",No Time to Die

1626,smileosofficial,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a refreshing curveball",9,13 October 2021,"Whilst this Bond film behaves differently to almost all of the other ""traditional"" bond films, it carries with it a refreshing air which a lot of critics are bound to scrutinise.In particular, I've read a lot of scrutiny about Malek's character, Safin. ""Dull, boring, not threatening, underdeveloped"" etc.However, a lot of this scrutiny I find incredibly unjust. At the end of the film, Malek's character carries out without a doubt the most heartless, cruel psychopathic act of any Bond villain, ever. How on earth is this boring? How is this not cruel or dull? This is absolutely heartbreaking.Being the last of Daniel Craig's films, he certainly gets a proper sendoff -despite not being a traditional sendoff, an appropriate one at that.What I love most about this film, is that it's not your classic Bond narrative fuelled by misogynistic humour and a happy ending. It's new. It's pure boldness and emotional relevance, coupled with an interesting and gripping complexity threaded into a story which yes, it doesn't have the ending we came in for, it doesn't have the traditional narrative we came in for, because it was undoubtedly written to surprise and veer off into a fresh direction which should be extremely welcomed in today's society. It's time for this level of boldness, it's time for the different, and it's absolutely time to explore the James Bond character in new ways.The only reason I'm unable to give this film a 10 is because the sound design in places stopped me from understanding certain bits of dialogue. Radio earpieces panned to the surrounds - what were they thinking? Sure, this is bold, creatively different and interesting, but unfortunately it just takes you out of the film for a brief moment. Worth exploring but should have been flagged before cinematic release... Other than that, it was absolutely outstanding.",No Time to Die
1627,thatpigaming,"An enjoyable ""Madeline"" swan-song for the Craig era.",7,9 October 2021,"As a huge fan of bond, this film meant a huge deal to me. I have always felt ""glass half empty"" with the ending of Spectre. I also wasn't taken by Madeleines character in her first outing and felt that her and James chemistry was forced.Now onto No Time To Die. For me, this is no Casino Royale or Skyfall, however it is certainly better than Quantum of Solace and Spectre. It is too long and Safins intentions are confused with the plot, which in itself is among the weaker ""World Ending or Revenge"" plots of the series.On the other hand, the scenes in Norway and Cuba are intense and had me on the edge of my seat. I loved 007 in this! What a fantastic plot twist with James and Madeleines daughter. And without giving away too much this film is an emotional roller coaster and really did leave me almost in tears at the end.Other great things include the opening 25 mins, the cars are brilliant and stunts great. I also liked Logan Ash a lot. And the references to the classics, particularly On her majesty's secret service and thunderball.If Safin was more developed and the film 20 mins shorter, this could have been not far of Casino Royale levels.

The beginning was good but plots fell flat, because kicking some bad ass and saving the world again isn't as eyes-catching as 20 years ago anymore.

Deep down we all wanted this arc of bond to end on a positive note for him, and seeing Bond go through all that he went through in his life, such tragic ending leaves an emotional impact on a Bond fan like me, which would certainly not be temporary. The look on his face when he knew all this was about to end just leaves an impact on you like no other. Seeing Felix Leiter die broke my heart. Bond reffering Leiter as his brother was equally heart touching, given the number of betrayals he's faced in his lifetime. Seeing Bond in the beginning visiting Vesper's grave was equally heart touching, which shows that she never left his heart and he still misses her to this day. This movie made me cry.

1634,lilienthalm,Good although still highlights the industries creative lazyness,6,2 November 2021,"I've been a bond fan for 50 years. Even as a kid I had the Corgi Aston Martin and the figurines. Unfortunately I've been disappointed with the franchise since the Moore maybe even the Dalton days. The problem is once they ran out of Fleming novels there wasn't any talent around to write a compelling story. Or, they just didn't pay enough. It shouldn't be that hard, plot lines with depth and substance, character development, etc. Instead they just spend the money on special effects and write in as many action/shoot-em-up scenes as possible so you wont notice there isn't any real story there. I titled this review as ""good"" because in 2 hours and 45 minutes they did get in enough story to cover an hour movie so better than previous try's but still not up the high Bond standard the originals set. BTW, the CGI chase scenes are terrible (great looking but soooo unrealistic). What ever happened to Rémy Julienne doing real car chases? Also, typical to most action movies, Bond get shot at a thousand times by hundreds of guys with automatic weapons and no one hits him, but one shot from his ""never needs reloading"" gun and they are down. All in all just way overdone as an action movie and way underdone as a suspense/intrigue movie. More like a marvel superhero movie than a Bond spy novel. Then again superhero's make money these days so there you have it. On the one hand I could say that the old days of Sean Connery and Thunderball were the best combination of action, intrigue, charisma and realistic villain's but that might date myself and my interests. But how about taking a hint from something more recent like the Bourne Identity which also hits the perfect combination. Then again the Bourne movie came from a book like the original Bond movies did so maybe that's the Achilles heal. Spend more on writing and less on special effects. Guess this ended up being more a rant than a review but at least no spoilers...lol.",No Time to Die

1641,garnuti,Very good action movie using the James Bond codes,6,3 October 2021,"When I left the cinema yesterday, I was not sure what to think about the movie. I could not objectively say that it was bad but also not that it was a good James Bond movie.For those putting a 10, this is far overrating, does it mean you should give Skyfall 12/10?For the score below 5, I guess this is an expression of the frustration due to the storyline.There is some very good stuff in this movie (locations, production design, costumes, stunts as well as some good acting - mainly from the 2nd roles).On the other end I have some major issue with the plot (I did not really feel in a James Bond movie most of the time).Not because you are using the codes of the franchise means that you should be dismissed to put together a real James Bond story (Ian Fleming style).I don't want to see the story of a family man or a melodrama when seeing a James Bond! James Bind is the guy that all guys want to be and all girls want to be with (RIP - Sean Connery).Finally, I will add that the music from Billie Eilish is more than average and Hans Zimmer has probably given one of the most basic performance. The score doesn't serve the film like it did in the Dark Knight trilogy.As mentioned in the title, good action movie yes for sure, good James Bond? Not really... still better than Spectre which was a disaster in my opinion.Is Eon trying to copy the MI franchise? Or are they simply get down the politically correct Disney world?I still hope James Bond will return!I really liked Casino Royale and Skyfall from the Craig era and I m happy to move on from him now.PS: I hope they will stop this stupid idea of making the JB as a serie - simply not working (ei: quantum of solace, spectre, no time to die).",No Time to Die
1642,danaco11,Amazing Craig Saga Finale,9,3 October 2021,"I personally, as an always fan of James Bond movies, loved No Time To Die, as it delivered excellently. For the Craig saga, this 5th and final movie shows that it was greatly written, with well character development over the films, and a beautiful and brave way of ending the saga. The nostalgic or referencial uses of the Bond universe like music and songs, places and gadgets, and some characters shows the delicacy, legacy, and respect from the team that made the movie. I'm just worried of one thing that could meant a very important change in the franchise, but that's a spoiler talk.The cinematography is spectacular with things we haven't seen in a Bond movie, like the forest scene. The action sequences are impressive, suspenseful, well made, and at the end even redeems, like the stairs action scene in the last parts of the movie. The use of sound is well built, and becomes an integral part of the movie, making you feel you are really there.Of course, I have my problems with some parts of the stories. ****SPOILER AHEAD**** I did not like how they tried at the beginning to change the 007 archetype with the new agent, but I agree it was well managed at the end and (hopefully for me) it stays there, just in this movie. I didn't have to know who was Q's date, since I think it's just a little bit forced, but hey, It does not affect the character archetype at all and Q was great in the film. The villain: I realize he's not the protagonist of the film, so he's arch was not well developed, it was hard to understand his world plans motivations, but I know what we needed of him was not to be the all-invincible villain Blofield was, but means to help end the Craig saga.I liked that James fell in love. At the beginning, the song of Her Majesty Secret Service was well put. I mean, for the final film and personal growth of Craig's Bond, it was a great finale. Only Bond decides how to end it, if you know what I mean.Lastly, my worries lies with the franchise future, just because of a Cameo. I like that each Bond is a saga. Each actor has there Bond Universe. Yes, some actors besides Bond shared sagas, like M's and some Q's (if im not wrong), but we saw it as a cool part of the franchise and not so as continuity or same universe. But when I saw the past M's like Judy Dencher next to Bernard Lee or Robert Brown, was it a fun cameo, OR, implying that all the movies has taken place in the exact same universe and Craig 007 is just another one? That means Pierce Brosnan is somewhere in there smoking cigars retired? I hope not (the name James Bond apparently is not a code).In No Time To Die, 007 number was almost treated as ""just a number"", until they redeemed with the respect Bond has for the number. But what if the next film is just a number and we have another 007 with another name? With what Disney Star Wars and Disney Marvel in-universe trends, I was a bit worried that they tried to do that in Bond world. Hey, I understand that the franchise is in a story wise difficult point, Craig saga is a modern theme and was great, and since we can't go back to the Roger Moore silly movies, what's next? I just hope they don't try to change the James Bond 007 archetype we all love because that would be another Last Jedi/Rise Skywalkers deception. I don't want the next movie with Lashana Lynch as 007. In this movie she was great, and necessary, so let's just leave her in this.No Time to Die was fun, amazing, and a perfect and beautiful ending for the Craig saga. I left the theaters trembling. Now I have to go. Time for a Dry Martini, shaken, not stirred.",No Time to Die

Nobody is going to come back to the theater and spend their money to watch 007 nomi or anyone else. I'm sorry 007 is not gender neutral or that it heaven forbid is a man who fights bad guys with a gun and loves women. When you take away James Bond you take away 007. I'm honestly surprised that Eon films decided to go in a direction that would put them off the map. Unless you revive James Bond for other spin-offs or remakes, you have cut the life support off from 007 and anything related to James bond or Ian flemings. Nobody will want to watch anything else if James Bond is gone, he is the lifeblood, there is not other 007 no matter how badly they think that the world wants a black female 007 named nomi or anyone else, people only want James Bond.

1646,immanuelkloesel-35260,Daniel Craig's Second best Bond,9,7 October 2021,"I cannot understand the complaints about the love story and not being a Bond movie. Daniel Craig said it in interviews before, he doesn't want to imitate older Bond movies and that's perfectly fine. Given the story arch from Casino Royal on, it is just natural, that there is more substance to this movie than a simple spy on his mission. And it didn't even bother me, that there's not much background to the villain and his intentions, because in my opinion this one is all about bond and his desire to finally find peace after all he went through. And given this desire to settle down and find peace getting crushed again, the ending makes perfect sense and hits you right in the feels.Overall, the movie was really entertaining for me. Cool action scenes, emotional ending, once again an awesome performance from Daniel Craig, making up for certain characters without that much depth. Although I'm not really sure how they want to continue the bond series so that it still makes sense.9/10.",No Time to Die
1647,clairelauralovely,"A great conclusion to the series, very emotionally impactful.",9,17 October 2021,"I had been very excited to see this Bond film since I saw the first trailers in early 2020. The glimpses we saw showed us that this film would be an epic grand finale that tied together all the previous four films of the Daniel Craig era. After two delays, the film finally released in October 2021. No Time to Die definitely lived up to my expectations and combined aspects of the older and current Bond films to deliver what I thought was the best Bond film yet.Formats

First off, if you have a theater that supports the 4DX format near you, I definitely recommend seeing it this way. 4DX is a very immersive way to view movies with moving chairs, air jets, smoke and weather effects, and smells. 4DX also naturally comes with 3D. Unfortunately for this Bond film, the 3D effects were done in post-processing, so it isn't real 3D from the point of being filmed in 3D from the start like Avatar. Even though the 3D was done in post-processing, some of the scenes do benefit from this effect well, and it was cool that this is the first Bond film that has offered a 3D format.I would also like to re-watch the film in IMAX. I believe that this is the first Bond film to use this format, and director Cary Fukunaga shot about 40 minutes of footage with 15/70 mm IMAX film cameras. Unfortunately there were only 8 IMAX cameras of this type at the time and most of them were being used by Christopher Nolan for Tenet, but as far as display quality goes this should be the best bet out of all the formats.Cinematography and Sound Design

This film has some amazing sets, especially the portion filmed in Matera. The scenes before the title sequence are extremely memorable. Cary Fukunaga did an excellent job capturing all the actions and emotions of each scene and I was thoroughly impressed with his cinematic visions for Bond.The title sequence was beautifully animated, with the symbolism blending ancient concepts with the new to convey the film's main story. Billie Eilish's vocals also had even more of an emotional impact than I expected in the theater, especially due to the perfect timing of where they chose to cut to the title sequence.Although I'm not an expert in the coloring process of films, I liked how the visuals were represented throughout and the overall color tone of the movie. I don't know how to exactly describe it but it felt very unique when presented.Hans Zimmer's soundtrack adds heavily to the emotion of this film. Fans that have watched the previous Bond films will also recognize a newer rendition of an older soundtrack, a nice surprise while watching.Plot
---
I was really captivated by the plot of this film because it really showed an emotional side of Bond that had not been displayed before. The relationship between Madeleine and Bond is displayed very well here while it wasn't as convincing in Spectre.We were shown a lot of different characters in the trailer and it seemed like it may have been a lot to work into one film, but they are balanced properly for the most part. Nomi was a great counterpart to Bond throughout and Paloma shares a short but intense moment with Bond. M has become more serious with each film since Skyfall and you can tell that the character is conflicted with the tough decisions that he has to uphold.The main issue I had with the plot is that they didn't show enough of the main villain. Safin is a complex and tormented figure, and throughout the film we learn more about his connections to Blofeld and Madeleine, as well as his various motivations. However, his time on screen is very short and he doesn't really appear too much until the end. I thought that both Safin and Blofeld were portrayed excellently in this film and given great dialogue, but it would have been better if they played a larger role. The threat Safin poses to the world is palpable, but the plot would have benefited if he was introduced earlier and had more backstory. The writers were definitely going in the right direction with his relationship to Blofeld and Madeleine, but it wasn't expanded upon enough.Another unavoidable problem was that No Time to Die had to conclude the plots established in the first four films. I feel that the producers made a mistake in Spectre by linking all of the Craig films together. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace don't really belong in the same world as Skyfall and Spectre. I think it would have been better if Skyfall was a standalone series and Spectre was the prequel to No Time to Die. However, the choice to combine all the films did let the writers incorporate Vesper Lynd into No Time to Die, placing some emotional weight on Bond's past. For what they were given, I think they concluded the series well.One cool thing about this film is that Bond uses advanced gadgets like the pre-Craig era, while also incorporating the more serious feel of the previous Craig films. Casino Royale or Quantum of Solace were great, but I felt that Q wouldn't have fit into those movies, so I was glad that they brought him back in Skyfall. However, in Skyfall or Spectre, he didn't give Bond anything exceptionally advanced. In No Time to Die we get to see unique Q gadgets like the pre-Craig era films.Conclusion
---
Overall, No Time to Die was a very great movie and combined the best of the previous Bond films together for an excellent film experience. The action is ongoing from the very beginning to end but yet the film managed to be the most emotional Bond film at the same time.I think the impressiveness from its emotional impact can be seen in a quote from actress Léa Seydoux, who plays Madeleine Swann:""There's a lot of emotion in this Bond. It's very moving. I bet you're going to cry. When I watched it, I cried, which is weird because I am in it.""This was the first time that I was still thinking about a Bond film days later after I had seen it. Bond films have usually not showcased emotion to this level and they aren't particularly known for it, but the writers really did an amazing job of it and I hope that the next Bond films have this level of impact as well.No Time to Die combined the best of multiple aspects to make a great film. Excellent cinematography, great performances by the actors and actresses, an emotional soundtrack from Hans Zimmer and hauntingly beautiful theme by Billie Eilish. It was a beautiful and satisfying conclusion to both this current storyline of Bond and Daniel Craig's career as Bond.",No Time to Die
1648,junichinogo,I'm confused,5,3 October 2021,"I am 14 years old. Daniel Craig is my generation's Bond. I have always loved every single entry of this franchise. This film was the first time I have ever seen a bond film at the cinema. I was HYPED. I was already aware that this was going to be Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond before watching this.After finishing the film, I felt confused. Extremely confused. And quite frankly, I still am.Why did they kill Bond?I know that the Daniel Craig era of bond films are in a separate continuity to the other films. So even if Bond dies, technically it doesn't change anything about the series. However, I am failing to find a compelling reason for Bond to die in this film. I don't understand why the filmmakers behind this film thought of killing him. It doesn't even make any thematic sense to the film. Were they trying to shock us? Were they trying to make us cry? Because I didn't feel either of those emotions when bond died. Just utter confusion. They could've made it open to interpretation about his fate. Heck, even having him live a happy life with his family would've been better.I am curious for what the franchise will become latter on. However, I feel that a part of myself died with bond's death.I give this film a 5 only because it has some of my favourite moments of all of bond history (the pre-credit sequence was absolutely phenomenal), and it made some of the most questionable decisions in not only bond film history but cinema as a whole.I may not be considered a true bond fan due to my age, but these are my true feelings on this film.Thank you for reading my first ever review.",No Time to Die
1649,sdarty-61611,They have stolen from us a cinematic treasure.,1,13 October 2021,"I understand if many viewers have grown weary of a six, going on seven decade series. But many of us love the series and even celebrate some of the shark jumping. The ridiculousness of some of the action scenes are not only accepted, but expected. Much like how everyone smiles and laughs in the presence of children doing silly things.Bond was one of the last true masculine heroes that we've had, and now that is gone. It's truly sad, I feel like I've been robbed of a few more decades of one of my favorite stories. It seems selfish that this generation of Bond writers and directors feel so self important that they can kill a series that was loved before they were even born. Deny those generations yet to come.I guess the only thing worse then ending the series, is trying to reinvent it with a non-masculine 007. If so, Ian Fleming will be rolling in his grave and rightfully so.",No Time to Die
1650,mgdiaz913-1,WELL WORTH THE WAIT,10,11 October 2021,"I have been a James Bond fan since I was a child, in fact, I was 2 years old when ""Dr. No"" appeared in movie theaters. I have to admit that Sean Connery was the first and the best of all the Bonds, but I had a soft spot for George Lazenby; because I loved ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" 1969. It showed a side of Bond that the audience perhaps didn't expect.2021, Daniel Craig brought that part of Bond back and did it with flair, convincingly and bid his portrayal of the super spy fond goodbye. The cinematography, the locations, the action, fight scenes and chase scenes all came together like you would expect a Bond film to be. But then there was the emotional side, he finally had something to live for and retire from his super duties. The soundtrack provided a familiar score and I knew how this movie was going to end, but not the way that it did. Jeffrey Wright, your Felix Lighter will not be forgotten. The bond between the two characters are like bookends. This movie is a fitting end to both their careers in this franchise.Thank you Daniel Craig for making Bond human and for your years ""In Her Majesty's Secret Service"".PS For those of you out there that have read the previous reviews, judge for yourself and watch the film.",No Time to Die

Times are changing, I see these 5 movies as a reboot in the way that we see Mr. Bond: as a human being (I think that's why we like this character so much) and not a Marvel superhero.It is a monument to every Bond fan, a love letter to a legendary character. It is a ""must-see"" at the cinema for more than one time if you'd like (I'll probably see it again), especially if you're a 007 fan.There's a good balance between action, British humor, cruelty, and love. Although too long for the plot, it is still acceptable for the importance of the movie in my point of view.It does not top Casino Royale, but I think it is very close to Skyfall's overall. It's also important to pinpoint Hans Zimmer's work once again. Brilliant job. I would sum up the movie with the last song ""Final Ascent"", so intense and so sensitive at the same time!I don't know who is the best bond after this, Sean Connery or Daniel Craig.

1653,pawankhatri-1,A finale for Daniel Craig,7,2 October 2021,"The film is a must watch for Bond fans - specially since this is the last time Daniel Craig plays Bond. As a film however, it is nowhere close to Casino Royale or Skyfall. The chemistry between Bond and Madeleine doesn't hold a candle to what Bond had with Vesper. The villian is underwhelming and the Nomi as new 007 character could simply have been given a miss. The movie ends up emphasizing the need for a refresh for the Bond franchise.

1655,nora-56660,Disappointing,5,10 October 2021,I do like Daniel Craig but was hoping for more of the debonair side to come out with playful banter. The whole script and character development was disappointing. Ana de armas should have had a much bigger role. Why did the outfits onthe other chick look like a college kid hanging out at home? The whole movie lost what makes James bond so appealing. I can't believe they are killing the franchise with that ending. I'll stick to the older movies and have no hope for what the future holds with this direction they are taking. Needless to say it was a depressing experience.,No Time to Die
1656,demepap,Great film. Poor Bond film.,6,3 October 2021,"If this movie was about some other secret service agent, if this movie's character didn't have such shoes to fill, then it could have been a really good movie. The cinematography was spectacular, some astonishing views, superb action sequences, and with the kind of musical soundtrack other movies could only aspire to have. The acting was mostly good. The plot itself was not a bad one. Sure, the main villain had questionable motivations and was a bit flat - not as much because of poor acting, but because of the script, and there were some other plot holes that could have been addressed. The truth is though that none of the above really takes away that much from the film. If this movie wasn't a James Bond movie, it would have been a great cinematic experience for me.That having been said, this was a James Bond movie. And at being a James Bond movie, it failed miserably. I still remember watching the older James Bond movies, sitting with my parents in the house I grew up in, and those are treasured memories. My parents were the ones to introduce me to Bond, and I loved the character and the Bond-movie concept ever since I first watched it. We are not talking about one or two movies, that the writers of this movie could have just ignored. We're talking about numerous movies, that have set the tone and carved a very specific path that is meant to be followed. This movie fully breaks the mold of who Bond is supposed to be. I am not going to go political and call it a sign of the times or anything of that sort. I don't care to talk about list of boxes that need to be ticked nowadays, nor is diversity my problem with this movie.Older versions of Bond are often mislabeled as ""sexist"" nowadays, but Bond loved women. The times were different, and the gender roles were more discrete. The way Bond never truly fell fully in love didn't mean he wouldn't go almost to the point of self sacrifice to save one of the Bond girls. He just wasn't monogamous. That was the character. And men can still be non-monogamous these days. Women too. And that's OK. I don't think this is perceived as politically incorrect. Daniel Craig's Bond, especially as emphasized in this movie, is nothing like the old Bonds. He falls in love deeply and truly and utterly. And that's not a bad thing in general, but that's not who Bond was or should be. Bond didn't take on his missions with grimness. He was always an eloquent, elegant, cheerful fellow, who enjoyed the women that got in his way and risked his life to save the world. But he always did save the world. And he always did survive. The tone of the movies was always relatively light. You just knew that Bond would survive. That the good guys would win. That Bond would not commit.In this movie, Bond is not Bond. He is serious and unpleasant and stiff. His emotions and his past are filled with the thickest of darkness. All light has faded. Not only is he hopelessly and helplessly in love, but he also has a ..daughter! Bond has been made a loving daddy. The whole film's tone is dark and ominous. The traditional flirting has been withdrawn, its void filled with a tragic vulnerability which is very unlike what Bond has always been.And in the end, Bond has to make a choice. Due to a nanobot infection, he knows he will never be able to see his woman and his daughter again, because if he does, this infection will be the death of them. Does he take that as a chance to finally return to the mold? Leave them behind and manage to raise his chin up and walk forward in life? No. He gives up. Bond gives up, he doesn't even try to escape a pending air strike, and the missiles explode next to him to take his life.This is not Bond. It's not bad writing overall. But it's certainly bad Bond writing. It ruins what the Bond universe stands for. And it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. I hope the reboot will return the new movies to their roots.",No Time to Die
1657,imdb-15095,Entire Childhood -- LOST!,6,13 October 2021,"*** REITERATING THAT THERE ARE HUGE SPOILERS IN HERE. DO NOT READ IF YOU PLAN ON WATCHING IT ***I gave this a movie six, because I did like the storyline, but I hated that they destroyed my entire childhood.I saw my first James Bond movie, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", in the theater with my father when I was 10 years old, and I've seen everyone that came out after that on opening night. It was almost a right of passage for a young boy to see his first Bond movie, and when my son was old enough I took him to see his first one too.I understand Daniel Craig was getting too old for the part, and he needed to be replaced. But to kill off James Bond and set up his replacement to be a black woman, is unforgivable. This is truly a slap in the face to Ian Fleming, who based the character on a composite of himself and other operatives he met while in MI6. He has to be rolling over in his grave.The writers missed a huge opportunity. They could have still killed off James Bond and allowed for the franchise to continue. I would have given him a son to Madeline instead of a daughter, and then I would have killed off Madeline as well. At the end we could have seen ""M"" take the orphan into MI6 to be trained. That would have even made for a really great next movie, where we see his son going through the training, and at the end of the film, a fully grown son, and the next adult James Bond would be introduced.I refuse to watch James Bond as a black woman. So, it's likely that I'll never be able to watch another 007 movie again, and that's the real tragedy.",No Time to Die

I would have hoped to see more of Rami Malek as i feel like Safin as a character was just missing a few more pieces to really make him as good as LeChiffre or Silva, but on the whole, the other new characters, Paloma, Nomi and returning characters such as Madeleine, were all delivered brilliantly.I can't guarantee anyone that they will enjoy this film the same way i did, but nevertheless, there are action scenes and character moments that no one can put down, some of the best in the entire bond franchise, creating a somewhat mixed film with incredibly high highs and sometimes more divisive moments, that on the whole, i thoroughly enjoyed!!",No Time to Die

The film had a slow pacing and not many action scenes, it was soppy, and didn't achieve what I'd expect from a Bond movie despite the great supporting cast. The other 007 was a convincing role and enjoyable in conjunction with Craig. However the villain was anecdotal at best due to a lack of screen time, and largely unconvincing as a bad guy, but that didn't matter to the filmmakers because it slowly becomes apparent they had a more 'important agenda' with this movie, for which the whole movie had been one long emotional manipulation.

You cannot and should not, kill, James bond, he is a icon that I gave idealised my whole childhood on. And now, because you have ran out of ideas, you kill him.

Rami malek, I was looking forward to his portrayal of the villain but he's barely in it and his accent is so bad I can't understand what he says, especially for his final scene. The camera work and action scenes are pretty amazing tho, but, you have to wait about an hour between each considering it's over 2 and a half hour running time. It's almost an insulting remaking of on her majesty's secret service, there are so many nods to it.

1667,ameyabenz,Unconventional bond movie,8,4 November 2021,"We all have been seen 007 as a macho man with super-gadgets, movie starting with a breathtaking chase scene and exquisite and exclusive graphic song. But this one breaks certain traditions. Particularly from 'Casino Royal' onwards we have seen emotional side of the agent 007 which Daniel has played marvelously. Bond movies before Casino Royal not only lacked continuity but also emotional touch and displayed pure action. In continuation with storyline from previous bond movies, the 'no time to die' beautifully picks up the pace even though it doesn't start with the adrenaline rushing chase scene. Although most of the film is predictable but there are some surprise elements seeded at certain points which makes it interesting. Daniel does look bit older but it doesn't reflect in his action scenes. Ana looks beautiful but in couple of scenes she appears bit underconfident. But overall she justifies her role. I wasn't fan of Lea (madeleine) but I think this was her best best performance so far. I became her fan. Rest all artists have done their job well as usual. There are certain moments when it feels like Ralph (M) would take out the elder want n say Avada Kedavra. But we can neglect that. Over all the movie is very good for Bond lovers. The only thing I did not like was the character of Lashana Lynch. Why was she given 007??? I am clueless. She did not seem like replacement of 007. Moneypenny's character seems more meaningful than hers. Anyways.. Hans Zimmer's music is simply awesome. I would stop here or else I may reveal something in the heat of writing. I would recommend this movie even to those who have not seen Daniel in 007 suite earlier. You can watch no time to die first and watch previous parts later on.

1671,SamuelQuastro,"A flawed but action packed, emotional farewell to Craig's Bond.",7,1 October 2021,"While not reaching the highs of Casino Royale and Skyfall, Craig's final outing as Bond delivers some superb action sequences (although perhaps a few too many car chases) fight scenes, and set pieces.Unlike most Bond movies, this felt far more focussed on the personal and emotional story of the character himself, and the relationship with Madeleine, rather than the villain and the threat he poses. In this way, it felt reminiscent of 'On Her Majesties Secret Service', and I enjoyed how Louis Armstrongs classic 'We Have All The Time in the World' was incorporated. Craig's adaptation of the character has certainly seen major developments over his tenure and has build a satisfying arc.Zimmer's score, a mix of old and new, was brilliant and pounding - instantly recognisable as his work, while incorporating the classic Bond themes.The plot is convoluted, with many unnecessary sub plots encompassed - Skyfall has proven that sometimes simplicity can work wonders. Although the principal villainous weapon (infectious nanobots which can be tracked to affect certain DNA types), is an interesting example of modern film utilising technology of the modern world, relevant today, in this case biological warfare, to enhance the realism and threat the audience feel.Rami Malek as the prime antagonist feels wasted - he has an anti climatic amount of screen time, and I couldn't help feel that his backstory feels futile. The character's sole motivation being 'revenge' makes for for a very bland, cliche villain.I also didn't feel some comedic elements were combined with the story particularly well. There are some great lines between Bond and the new 007, and plenty of one liners, but the Russian Scientist Obruchev's comedic accent, intentional or not, distracts from some very serious, thrilling action sequences.There are plenty of plot holes throughout, but did Bond films ever pretend to be particularly realistic?Overall, I enjoyed the film. The very opening scene, which was far closer to the horror genre than espionage, was intriguing, and looked to set up a terrifying antagonist, it's just a shame he didn't reappear until about half way through. The way the trust between Bond and Swann crumbles is suspenseful, leaving the audience shocked going into the opening credits.The ending is bittersweet, despite it being evident what was coming, ending to our time with Craig at the helm. He will be missed.",No Time to Die

Daniel Craig once again elevates the result by managing to perceive the difficulty in trusting and expressing emotions. In doing so, being cold and calculating which historically is a strong point of the character, is not betrayed.It's a true shame that the challenge with the character of Rami Malek will last just one film; I would have loved to see a bit more of how were imagined the paternal aspect of 007.I strongly believe that the best Bond ever, for similarities with Fleming's character, will be missed so much!",No Time to Die

The acting and physicality of James Bond as played by Daniel Craig is, IMO, the best it's ever been. He's more serious than the 007's of the past, but shouldn't he be? Back in the 60's & 70's, the action scenes, the way women were portrayed and the physical demands of the role were different. To expect no evolution of this character does a disservice to it.If you prefer the old Bond, you have 20 other movies to chose from.

1681,jjavez,"Well the end was... unexpected, expected",9,1 October 2021,"I absolutely enjoyed the film the Story was great and also the acting of Seydoux and Craig was immaculate. The ending... well I don't know what to think about it I mean it's a shame that the Craig era ends with the dead of his 007 but somehow I can understand. There was never a Bond who lived a happy life with a Family and a Child this would have destroyed the classic Bond Picture. But y'all hear me out... Rami Malek as the Bad guy... in my opinion he was by far the WORST Bond villain to date... his character had, well, no Character I mean his acting was great but there was just no depth to it. He was kidnapping a child ok he was creating a Bio weapon to kill Madeline wow but yea he was rather Boring.But over all I really really enjoyed the film definitely one of the best Bonds ever made and you can also see that the Producers tried to be more ""modern"" in certain ways which I absolutely adore.",No Time to Die
1682,kalaglow,A fitting finale for Daniel Craig's exit,8,2 October 2021,"At 2h 43m I approached No Time To Die with some trepidation, but never got fidgety or bored and was mostly on the edge of my seat. The grand scale we have come to expect was on show and Daniel Craig gave his best performance, as both an all action and sensitive James Bond in equal measures. Although of the quintet, Skyfall and Casino Royale are better films.No Time To Die starts with romance and betrayal but soon explodes into action. The action sequences throughout the film are thrilling and exciting, the motor bike chase especially so. There are a few plot twists and some plot holes, but things keep ticking along nicely and plenty of edge of your seat moments.Léa Seydoux portrayal as Madeleine Swann the love interest with a past of course was not one of the highlights for me. Neither was Rami Malek as Safin. However, this did not matter as Craig held it altogether brilliantly ably supported by Lashana Lynch, Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris.The all too brief action scenes with Ana de Armas as Poloma only lasted about 10 minutes but were electric and the film at its best, classic Bond.There are plenty of nods to previous Bond films especially On Her Majesty's Secret Service. This is Bond film to see straight-away before the plot and twists get out on social media. You will enjoy the ending better when the hidden theme plays out. Recommended to all Bond fans.",No Time to Die

Cinematography is flawless, the use of fog in this film should be a director's trademark, racial equality is addressed, gender roles are addressed, and choice of antagonist arsenal gives organizations like Project Veritas a shoulder to lean on. In the words of Pierce Brosnan himself, ""it's like we're living in a real Bond movie"" with the times we're living in right now.This movie is a celebration of humanity, a real ode to 1969, and a challenge for Bond historians to embrace change and vulnerability in a main character.Oddly enough, I didn't cry at the end of the movie, but when I saw the Michael Wilson easter egg.

The only charming part in this entire movie when Anna de Armas appears, completely lights up the screen, rest of the actresses are nothing to write about.It's literally made by people who dont understand James Bond!The last part is the worst when they are all making toast to Bond, OMG zero zero charm of all the actors!",No Time to Die

In that regard it FAILED SPECTACULARLY.Negatives: Plot has major holes every few minutes (like no one has actually read the script) and its flat out stupid and naive, action comes down to ""I am shooting you with automatic weapon from 3 feet away, and cannot hit you"" , main villain is totally unconvincing and underdeveloped or even consistent in nutcase type of a thing ... not even the cheesy ending can salvage this one.Positives: ""The Cuban agent chick"".

I think maybe the villain, while acted well enough just didn't have any real impact to the point he was overshadowed by the bit part return of Blofeld almost as if the writers realised he needed propping up? The action sequences were pretty standard Bond stuff as you'd expect but even they lacked grandeur and excitement (thinking compared to the opening sequence of QoS, an overall poor film for me)And then we get to the end, well that's pretty much killed the franchise, I can see how they've tried to spin it by references to ""it's just a number"" earlier in the film but the films weren't about the number, they were about the man and when you kill the man can you really carry on with just the number?""The names Spencer, Frank Spencer""",No Time to Die

1691,andrewbubb,More of an 'Artistic Expression' than a Bond Movie,7,5 October 2021,"*Writer's Note: My first written film review, and like NTTD, it's a little all over the place, so apologies*No Time To Die (NTTD) clearly suffers from its troubled writing passed and while it's still better than Quantum and Spectre, with some excellent artistic choices, it lacks the classic James Bond troupes that restricts this film's potential.NTTD, while at some points soulless, does have the best action sequences of any James Bond film to date. Locations were used well and showed off what can be done with good set pieces, with elements of other movie genres integrated for some very interesting diverse sequences, such as the horror/thriller forest scene. The fight sequence in Italy, as shown in the trailer was fast-paced and exciting, with the glorious DB5 kitted out with some new gadgets that were used to good effect. Also a very special shoutout to the one shot in the film where Bond turns and shoots an enemy who we believe to be behind the camera, and in doing so in a cylindrical tunnel emulates the iconic opening gun barrel sequence. Unfortunately, due to the run-and-gun nature of this film, it's quite indistinguishable from any other action film and lacks the classic 'spy' troupes we all know and love from a Bond film, this could easily be something ripped from a fast and furious film, seriously.Another way this film breaks previous barriers is the artistic direction the director clearly employed in this film. Speaking sequences are shot very close to the face of those speaking, almost suffocating the viewer but in such a way that you can almost see the thought behind the eyes of said characters. The colours on show are tremendous, with vibrant setpieces almost being TOO good as they draw focus away from the main focal point of the shot. There is almost a Japanese theme that runs throughout the film, with Bond's beach house's interior sharing similarities to previously seen Japanese interior architecture in media. Combine this with the aforementioned vibrant set pieces, with the bar and club scenes being overwhelmingly neon, not to mention the Japanese minimalist garden at the end - the director has managed to maintain a cohesive aesthetic throughout the film.Unfortunately, NTTD falls pretty flat on its face *big spoilers coming up* with the emotional sequences in this film, and it is clear that an emotionally-scared James Bond just isn't cut out for emotional sequences. The scene in Madeleine's home where Bond confesses his ever-lasting love is supposed to be a poignant, heart-felt moment however the script feels dry and predictable. The message was a good one but didn't have the delivery and impact that I expected, especially between two of the main characters that we've known for some time now. All of this with the clear undertone of Bond's daughter being in the setting should have been way more powerful.HOWEVER, this was *almost* redeemed at the climax of the film, where we, as the viewer, come to the realisation that Bond will not be riding off into the sunset this time, that his age has now got the better of him and he can finally rest. Bond accepting his fate is a powerful moment, the man who has sworn by giving his life for Queen and Country finally gets a second where he's not looking over his shoulder, but rather across the sea to Madeleine and his daughter. Their short conversation is rife with emotion and ends with Madeleine accepting the truth that it is indeed James's child, revealing her last secret which has a satisfying nature to it given how the movie began. From a personal standpoint, I thought I would be more upset by the ending and I'm a little disappointed I wasn't.One of the biggest criticisms I've seen is the main Villain, played by Rami Malek, is poor and not given the depth that a 21st Century Bond Villain should have - and I have to say I agree. We get very little into his backstory and some of the design decisions confuse me. Why does he wear a mask? Why does he have a burnt up face? I feel that neither of these was necessary to the plot and unfortunately fell into the trap of having a Bond Villain with a facial deformity - something that will surely change in the future. It has been done well in the past when given a story behind it but this time it was needless and made in poor taste. That being said, I enjoyed the conversation between Bond and Safin - the tension in that scene was immeasurable and you could physically see Bond struggling with the thought of seeing his daughter (although not to his knowledge at the time) potentially killed.Along with Safin, we had two more characters come into the fold in the form of the new 007 Nomi and then the awkward but funny and dangerous Paloma. Nomi would have certainly ruffled a few feathers when she announced herself as the new 007 but through some really good character development, paired with superb acting from Lashana Lynch, Nomi became a deadly aid to Bond and one who grew more likeable as the film went on - which may set her up for a solo film in the future. Whilst Nomi was well developed and grew on the audience, Paloma was not, but that doesn't make her not likeable. She had some awkward but funny quips - something that the film as a whole lacked and was, in place of a more technical term, a complete badass. She and Bond teamed up for a thrilling action sequence, which was fast-paced and well-directed, executed with cut-throat precision. I would have liked to see her return at a later point in the film, but that short cameo potentially sets her up for a future appearance, perhaps as a Felix Leiter replacement.A short word on Felix - a bit of a fan favourite and didn't play into the American espionage the regime put him under. A great assist for our protagonist since Casino Royal and while his death was a little poorly written, it capped off what was an extremely enjoyable run in the franchise. You will be missed, friend.Whilst NTTD was a solid entry into the franchise, it seemed that it was more of a Daniel Craig victory lap than a Bond movie. I disagree with the people who say it's funny - it's not. The humour is poorly written and badly timed and doesn't suit the merciless Daniel Craig's Bond as much as it did Connery's or Moore's. As I mentioned towards the start, while the action is excellent, it doesn't feel like Bond. It's just an action film with Aston Martin's. M's actions, unlike the previous two entries, don't have any consequence at all - which is surprising given how much time was given to laying out the problems with the 00 program in previous films. M's cover-up of the weaponised nanobites directly leads to Bond's death, yet this is never mentioned or argued.Bond has never died before - and Daniel Craig's exit leaves a gaping hole in the franchise with people asking, what's next? His death should have been cathartic, but instead left me feeling slightly underwhelmed. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.7/10 - The director's art style and action sequences save this film from mediocrity.",No Time to Die

I'll accept 4 stars and up, but lower is unnecessary.First of all, the ending was a good ending. I preferably would have loved to see james survive at the end, but it's also the first time a james bond iteration has die; which is pretty interesting imo. I wanna talk about daniel craig, this is one of his best performances next to skyfall. Daniel's iteration of james bond is personally my favourite, his humor, charm and genuine reason for his womanising is intriguing.Hans zimmer owns the score for this movie, he never disappoints with his scores.And the best part of the movie, is moneypenny, q and james's familiar relationship. They really do act like a family and i adore the chemistry. Especially in q's apartment, that scene was great (also very happy that q was confirmed to be gay, ben whishaw plays q excellently). Moneypenny, q and james's relationship has been developed since skyfall, it was the only part i liked about spectre and i really liked their scenes.Now, i'm gonna agree that ana de armas was criminally underused. She was fantastic. Her demeanour was so fun and different, it made me very excited for more of her character. A bit depressing we only got less than 10 minutes of screen time with her. It was also depressing to see the end of felix leiter, i've loved the character since casino royale.Anyways, it's not a 10/10 but it's definitely not a 1/10 either.",No Time to Die

Not to mention the ending that really ruined this legendary saga. The 'villain' does nothing, not even a fight scene, spills poison and thats it. In his FINAL film. There were just so many better ways than that whether he lived or died... I just can't wrap my head around it. Truly a shame.Lashana Lynch and Ana de Armas were both great - wish we could have seen her more, she was a highlight of the movie. I appreciate Lea Seydoux as her character but I just don't see the chemistry between her and Bond like the way he and Vesper does. And while Rami Malek is an amazing actor, he was REALLY weak as the last villain... after seeing such incredible and powerful performances by Javier Bardem and Christoph Waltz. It could have been much much more exciting, seamless, and relatable if the last villain to kill remained Christoph with Malek playing a side villain character.",No Time to Die

But, oh bad, evil director, did he just make a new movie? How could he!!!This movie was great from start until the end. The locations are nice as always.

1701,jonhansen1-1,Ironic Title for a Shocking Movie,5,2 October 2021,"After waiting for an eternity with great excitement, what is delivered is an over long, misguidedly focused film that centers on a manufactured, paper thin relationship that was hardly developed from the last one and is still far inferior to his true love from Casino Royale. But they more than double down, unfortunately.It all starts with the classic gun barrel sequence being super imposed over the Universal logo and when Bond shoots, no red, so he misses? Unfortunate foreshadowing of the movie right from the jump.Craig does a fine job with the schlock he's given to work with. And even though this reviewer doesn't buy his relationship, at all, Lea Seydoux is a good actress, but hers is not a Bond character worth such painful investment. That's why Eva Green literally still haunts him, and us all.The producers and director have chosen to go nuclear on the classic Bond (and classic Bond characters) and really alienate longtime fans who have stuck with the franchise through thick and very thin (looking at you, Die Another Day).That comment doesn't mean give us the same formula but for god sakes the overt focus on being so correct (too much new 007, who is a bigger jerk than our beloved James usually is, and comes off poorly and Q?) coupled with no fun.Bond is supposed to be escapism and we're asked to swallow this personal journey. It worked in OHMSS and Casino Royale - both superior singular movies. But we're now five movies in and this really sucks the life out of what could have been a decent bow out. And that same hideous Louis Armstrong song from OHMSS is here, as is Billie Eilish channeling Sam Smith.And something that should never be, but has been forgotten....this is supposed to be a JAMES BOND movie and NOT a Daniel Craig movie. An actor is never bigger than the character, even Sean Connery, but the main producers have criminally elevated Craig to that status.The only good characters in this movie are barely in it (NOTE: maybe it's time to ditch the very forced ""love of your life "" romantic thread from 2 movies when the new girl, who is in it for 10 minutes - and is an awesome badass - has more chemistry with Bond. They really could have had something there). Ana de Armas maximizes her time and plays her character to the hilt. She absolutely kills it. Sexy, smart, fun, capable, and not following the man. That's some good woke writing. Kudos to Fiennes, Whishaw, Campbell, and Kinnear, but no time for them really either. Jeffrey Wright, always awesome, and finally the perfect consistent Felix Leiter that the series never figured out before, is given some particularly horrible treatment. I won't reveal it.The villain, this time out played by Rami Malek, has no real development or screen time, which forces a good actor to glare and preen almost as much as Freddie Mercury. Oh, and his name is Lyutsifer, get it? Scared yet? His henchman has a bionic spy eye and the doctor is an idiot that would be killed immediately in any other sane Bond pic. Billy Magnusson, Game Night guy? Once again, Christoph Walz is criminally used and confused as Blofeld.This is all topped off by an absolutely unforgivable ending and production and direction choice that literally could kill the franchise. Again I won't reveal it, but No Time to Die? Really?Another reboot is needed, unfortunately, with the ones who badly need the reboot being the executive producers. They did it well once with Casino Royale, but this entry leaves you firmly believing that Broccoli and Wilson are totally played out. Fleming and Cubby Broccoli would be absolutely appalled at what this franchise has been turned into. Not fun (Cubby's rule #1), unexciting, lazy nods to their glorious past, and writers who just mail it in or are recruited to stay with the Un-Bondian times. It's unfortunate when the part of the production left with any integrity is the original director who actually refused to do it. We now understand why. There was a good movie in here somewhere, but the producers have trampled on Bond. History is unlikely to be kind to this movie, or them.",No Time to Die

Once he lost vesper in casino royal, his love became work, once more. When he found Madeleine, she became his love. He never wanted to go back to MI6. He just wanted to get revenge for what had happen with Madeleine and for the death of Felix. The whole movie he was trying to get Madeleine back, this is not obvious but if you look hard and see it two or three times you will see this. Daniel Craig never wanted to make this film, but Eon Productions convinced him to make one more. In specter he retired, this faced them with the challenge of bringing him back.

The consolation was that it was a surprisingly fitting - fake end for a fake Bond.The wokeness in this movie was out of control. Enjoyed the world over for decades, the Bond franchise has turned into a parody of itself the last couple of years.. No witticisms, sarcasm, charm or excitement left. The fact that Daniel Craig had the audacity to change Ian Fleming's work so extensively and still call himself James Bond is beyond me.

1712,amp68,A slap in the face,3,1 October 2021,"This is my first movie review ever but this time I really needed to write one (sorry for my bad English).I have watched every Bond movie at least three times (since 1975) and I started to be very concerned from the second half of Skyfall (Bond kidnaps M so that she can be easily killed, seriously?).However, Spectre put the nails in the coffin and NTTD buried it.Bond movies were born in the 60' without serious competitors are were fresh and enjoyable until The Spy Who Loved Me but since at least 1990 there are plenty of Bond-ish movies which are much better than the original (apart from the superbe Casino Royale), such as True Lies, all Mission Impossible movies, the first Bourne movies, Jack Ryan, etc. So I am thinking that this should be the last Bond movie.At least, Bond's child could have been a boy called James: that would have been a good idea to continue the franchise! Mathilde Bond is really impossible to imagine.The good of NTTD (to reach rate 3):1. The Cuba mission and the ""unexperienced"" female agent: something really Bond-ish and new, despite Blofeld's presentation of Bond to the Spectre agents (and his subsequent run), which was copied 100% from Spectre.2. The music3. The landscapesThe bad of NTTD:1. The plotholes/stupidities:a. Bond visits Vesper's grave and does not expect a killer waiting for him?B. Bond pulls a Spectre card to trigger a bomb?C. Bond is not even injured by a bomb exploding at 1-meter distance ?D. why does Bond blame Madeline for the bomb (see a.)?E. Blofeld analyzed by Madeline: impossible considering who killed her father!F. Why does the villain leave Mathilde run away?G. the whole Norwegian car chase: heavy SUVs smashed by one Toyota? Heavy-armed soldiers killed by a family with child and one pistol?H. why does (woman) 007 leave Bond alone on the island? Is Madeline unable to use the boat?I. how could M alone start his super-expensive and super-secret project?J. etc. Etc. (I could go on forever)2. The waste of potentialBlofeld killed after 5 minutes (what a shame!!!), villian's plan unclear and unmotivated (what was his idea?), Leiter's death (Licence to Kill dedicated a whole movie on Bond's revenge!), M's hidden plan, a new 007, etc. Etc.3. The endingLet alone the idea of Bond's death, which is very very stupid by itself (unless you want to really bury this movie and the whole the franchise), the whole ending is poorly written and unrealistic.4. Madeline
Worst Bond girl ever. No beauty, no charisma, just sad and boring. Even Dame Dench was sexier.5. The plot
Awful, just awful, no new idea (apart from Cuba), no surprise (apart from crazy things, like: M is an idiot, Q is gay, Blofeld is powerless, Bond has a child, etc. Etc.)6. The concept

The extra humour was most welcome as were the many references (some obvious, some subtle) to previous films and the books. The scenery was lovely and the locations interesting.It is definitely too long, the main villain is just a rambling bore (thanks to the script) with tenuous motive and I think that Lea Seydoux is just very average in general as the supposed ultimate love interest.As a stand-alone movie it's decent, but ultimately the decision to make Bond a father and then kill him off on screen undermines the film, the legacy and the Bond character. I left the cinema feeling disappointed as opposed to entertained or emotional.The makers off this film were clearly torn between sticking to the formula and trying to add unexpected twists, but Bond dying and having a child actually didn't come across as shocking - just cheap.I'm not sure what the intentions for the franchise are from here, but any sort of continuity will be very difficult.

Instead of making her intelligent,badass, and full of style, they made her into some moody/pretentious character throughout the entire movie.

They had an idea for this film where Naomi would take over as 007 but, thank god for the pandemic and the delays to the release of this film, which gave them enough feedback to show that this was a very bad idea and they ultimately have changed their mind, and even stated that Bond would always be a male. However they just left the film alone and never made any changes to the end and this has completely ruined the film. They even have the Gaul to put James Bond will return at the end of the credits.

1731,chris-74335-38081,Back to Roger Moore days,3,12 October 2021,"Remember back in the bad old days, back when a Bond film was basically just a bunch of building blocks hanging around a loose thread of a story which advances only thanks to increasingly silly sci-fi gimmicks? Remember when a directors' job was just to decide how many car chases to insert and thousands of bullets Bond mysteriously avoids? Remember when the human story had been totally sacrificed at the alter of goodies and baddies, and misogyny wasnt just excused but positively celebrated?This is one of those films.It's lazy, lowest-denominator stuff. It's a tragic waste of an opportunity, it's an insult to Daniel Craig and fans, and it plays clumsily and irresponsibly with massive ideas - like a toddler let loose in a workshop.It's not totally awful. Daniel Craig IS Bond, and brings a character he has crafted in to someone compelling and considered. In his last outing this film rightly attempts to give him a worthy send-off.Unfortunately the film does nothing of the sort. The script and director simply ask Craig to go through the motions. What could have been a Masterclass in character and closure is instead a ham-fisted paint-by-numbers affair that harks back to the worst of Bond.Hollywood has shown us it CAN do faded glory, it CAN humanise superheroes, it CAN map the decline of a legend. But to do those things takes bravery, and a studio willing to gamble on talent rather than formulas. I guess the endless delays to the release date should have told us where the priorities lay.So long Daniel Craig. You were brilliant. I'll just try to remember the films that allowed you to be that.",No Time to Die
1732,dan-88493,Infuriating finale to Daniel Craig's 007,6,1 October 2021,"Having heard Mark Kermode's review (someone I respect enormously) and having seen lots of other very positive reviews, I have to conclude that the reviewers gave this film a free pass, because a) it was Craig's swansong and especially because b) the 'industry' is desperate to reignite cinema post-pandemic.The trouble is, it just isn't a great movie. And it's not about the ending, I actually thought that was brilliant in its bravery. It's about everything that led up to that moment.Right from the opening, under the pressure of being no.25, it felt that the whole team was 'trying too hard' and what followed were a series of spectacular but dislocated set pieces that were in their own right beautifully shot and well-conceived. Despite the valiant efforts of several excellent actors it felt like a gilded patchwork quilt, held together with a fraying thread. It was also as clear as day that the script was written by committee, containing as it did so many competing voices.There is much to commend, which is precisely why it was so infuriating. In addition to the ever excellent Craig, the female cast, to a woman, was unimpeachable. But I'm sad to say the male cast was, despite the fact that it included some first-class actors, strangely two dimensional. Worst of all - and I hate myself for saying it - Rami Malek's character was beyond parody. It wasn't his fault per se, the exposition behind his character was confused and his lair was Dr Evil-esque, but with so little explanation of his background, how he turned Blofeld's henchman etc ultimately it led to hurried denouement. Perhaps conscious that it had taken so, so long to get there.And all of that is such a shame, there were so many moments of pathos and ingenuity, but above all it felt like less than the sum of its parts.Perhaps, most pertinently it doesn't change the fact that Daniel Craig is as Bond, impossible to follow, but after 5 films it doesn't feel like he got the quality of films that his performances deserved.",No Time to Die

It seemed a little pathetic like they wanted the shock and awe of killing the hero but didn't want to lose an obvious cash cow.There were moments of the film that were out and out Bond but, as other reviewers have stated, those moments disappear after the scene with Paloma and then it just turns to a drama that's very light on action. The finale on Safin's island was really poorly executed. Having introduced Nomi as a female 007 (which I'm fine with by the way) they give her almost nothing to do. She launches into a kick at the scientist who probably couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag and....... THAT'S IT!!!! I would expect a lot more of a 007, Paloma was a lot more feisty and completely underused. If it weren't for her the ladies in the movie would seem to be there for little more than political correctness. Nomi seemed to be there purely to trade verbal banter with Bond rather than do any of the heavy lifting which is a shame as I thought her character was going to be really cool and high kick her way through a few henchmen, that would have been good to see. Instead they give her a fast car and ridiculous ""fashion statement"" sunglasses to make her seem more current. I'm sure Miss Lynch was capable of a lot more than that.I'm just hoping that the ""James Bond will return"" signifies that they are going to re-visit the Ian Fleming novels and remake some of the old movies. Whilst classic and well loved they do show signs of age and if Spielberg can remake West Side Story anything is possible. The old films with Connery were on the whole just about the right balance of action, humour (not slapstick like some of the films Roger Moore was forced to endure - Vijay Amritraj in ""Octopussy"" anyone - or the Beach Boys kicking in the soundtrack to ""View to a Kill"" and don't even get me started on ""Jaws"" character ark). Also, even though I loved Lazenby and ""OHMSS"" I appreciate that's a less than popular opinion so why not take this opportunity to right all the past wrongs from the previous movies.It would be great for them to cast a younger actor who has the longevity to play Bond in a lot of the Fleming novels and that's something I'd personally love to see.",No Time to Die

1742,ja-maq,Gets worse the longer it goes,6,4 October 2021,"I actually really enjoyed the first half of this movie. Sadly, the two best action scenes both took place in this first half and one of them was even part of the intro.Felix Leiter's death at the hands of Logan Ash (who didn't even need to be in this movie, rather take his screentime and use it to flesh out Safin a bit instead) was the first thing that left a bad taste in my mouth. Nevertheless, I liked Daniel Craig as Bond, Madeleine was... ok, Fiennes as M great, Nomi was alright, Felix was cool and Paloma amazing but underused (at this point I feel the need to say that Ana de Armas is incredibly badass and beautiful).The turning point for me was Bond interrogating Blofeld. Another criminally underutilized character, once maybe the most iconic Bond villain, dying a stupid death and opening the curtain for Safin, maybe the worst Bond villain of the Daniel Craig era. This second half lives from its tension but it doesn't click for me, neither it has the one moment that really puts the audience at the edge of their seats. Bond having a family now also wasn't what I needed to see.Back to Safin, I don't get this villain. First he wants to take revenge on Spectre for killing his family, but then suddenly he wants... money by selling ""his"" super weapon? World Domination? It doesn't help that he feels more creepy than actually threatening and that he only has 2 short interactions with Bond. He then seemingly wants to make the lives of Bond and his family as miserable as possible which Bond geniusly solves by shooting Safin and then sacrificing himself. Yeah, he got killed and his sendoff, after such a long movie, felt very short and underwhelming.1st half 8/10, 2nd half 4/10, makes 6/10 in total.",No Time to Die

1745,madssd,Time To Change,9,1 October 2021,"This review, is for the disapointed 007's out there. Please ignore the rating for now. Although I know, it will bring alot of downvotes. I put it there because that is what I felt when I left the cinema. When a movie makes me feel like I witnessed something historical, I tend to give it a good rating.Anyways, here are my thoughts and feelings:I was in the pub the other day, with some of my mates. They have this quizz, at the pub, every thursday. This one had a question about an actor named Timothy Dalton, who very fittingly, played the infamous agent 007. The question was simply, which bond movies he played. Now as a real die hard fan, some of you may be able to name these two movies quite easily. However, I have seen most bond movies, but I suck at remembering who starred in what. One of my mates though, is just a huge movie geek in general, and just has this vast, seemingly unending trivial knowledge, when it comes to movies. So we sat there, me naming titles of bond films, him going:"" Nah, that one was Roger Moore, and the other one was Sean Connery"". I think I named about 15-20 movies, before we were settled. We got Licensed to Kill correct, but didnt get both answers. This started the inevitable argument, that there just is A LOT og Bond movies, and that it seemed, no one had the balls to say, alright, this is it, the last movie.You can imagine the shock I had, when watching this seemingly, ""last"" Bond movie. Although they gave us many, a bit too many hints maybe, about the ending.I get it, you have this brilliant recipe for spaghetti, that your passed away grandmother gave you. It tastes just how she made it, and will make you feel happy and satisfied inside. WHY would you ever change that recipe? Why would you try adding something, that she wouldnt? It could ruin the dish, although there is a slim chance, it would make it better, why risk it?Well, someone took the chance, and added something new. Maybe olives?Now you always thought that there could be added olives, heck you like olives, but then her entire recipe, would mean nothing anymore, it changed. It wouldnt be the same recipe, that she gave you. And it tastes different. And therefore, you dont like it.Back to the pub, you could keep making Bond movies forever. The recipe is there, but there is a lot already, I mean there really is. And I for one, will enjoy going back and watching one of classics from the 60's, and think about how much has changed. But I will also enjoy this latest movie again.I am a Star Wars fan, and when they made the new trilogy, I was like hell yeah, Star Wars, but now with new cool cgi tech.But after watching them, I knew its just not the same, and wish they would stop milking that same cow.Do spin-offs or series instead, let these classic movies be their own legacy. The same goes for this series. Its done.The old school fans, probably wont enjoy this new direction, the new fans wouldnt mind a change of title or platform.My mother is a hardcore Bond fan, I always watched the movies with her, but not this newest release. She is watching it on sunday, and I dont know what to tell her. I know she is going to cry, but I hope she can enjoy this movie, for the chances they took and the end product.To comment on the movie in general, its alright really. Maleks villian was a bit dissapointing, he is a brilliant actor, but just isnt very fitting for a Bond villian, in my opinion. The character seemed dull, the accent vague and his motives not quite there.We got a lot of classic Bond movie action scenes, jokes and heavy drinking. Through filmmaking goggles, it was amazingly filmed, brilliant use of special effects, the cutting had some flaws, but made a very long movie feel, well not too neverending.Craig does well, his role in Knives Out, will always outshine his bond, but this performance was good, he can rest proud in my opinion.Seydoux manages to be a badass ""Bondgirl"", I cant stand the helpless female characters, some movies introduce. She seemed a strong-minded mother who can protect herself.Waltz as always, the greatest actor out there at the moment.The other supportive roles are all good, even the new 007, she brings some of that classic Bond vibes.Anyways, I think I lost my initial thoughts. Hope I some of my thoughts, might have made you think something. And if you agree or dont agree with anything I wrote, well that is exactly why I love movies. We all have different perspectives.Bond is dead, but he really isnt. We have so many good Bond movies already, someone had to pull the plug, and I enjoyed the way, they went about it.Peace.",No Time to Die
1746,Detachablekid,A scintillating blockbuster,7,6 October 2021,"Like most James Bond films, ""No time to die"" succeeded in giving you a hell of a ride at the cinema, without causing you to think deeply about the film upon returning home.As you would expect, the action is a thrilling mix of vehicular combat, high stakes and ""gadgetary carnage"". The villain is (naturally) a disfigured, sociopathic leader of a secret organisation based on a private island, missile silo, hollowed out volcano etc. Although it is important to note that Rami Malek does a fantastic job at portraying Safin, and was seemingly born to play this emotionless maniac.Plot wise, it's nothing special, usual nonsense, evil bloke trying to wipe out humanity for its own good, recurring characters are just that, no real development outside of arguably James Bond himself. Speaking of Bond, Daniel Craig has once again nailed it as 007, bringing the real pain of bonds life and the struggle to trust others to the surface.The film itself is a visual spectacle, with wonderful stunts, brilliant fight choreography, beautiful settings, cars, suits and VFX. They really knocked it out of the park with this one, and the wide range of locations helps to bring variety and flavour to the film as a whole.All in all, No time to die is a somewhat anti climactic end to the franchise but is a great watch especially in cinemas, it fulfils its purpose and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.

And it's one that builds on much of what has gone before - even to before Craig donned Bond's tuxedo.So this is a film Bond lovers should enjoy, both because of the many Easter Eggs that can spot referencing previous movies, but also because with this film Daniel Craig really makes his Bond the definitive one. No doubt the franchise will be rebooted one day, but whoever takes on the role will have a tough job surpassing this depiction of the character.In short, No Time To Die draws from and helps make complete the entire 5-film Craig Bond collection.

1756,bretgrenz-90488,The big Craig Bond finale,7,30 September 2021,"TRDL: Great Bond finale, just some nitpicks about the story and some tempo issues in some scenes, but other than that, it's worth paying a visit to the theater for. Not the best Bond, but a solid one to finish off the Craig era.--So, this is it. The last Craig Bond. Lots of hype, delay, but here we are. Before I went to my local theater to watch the midnight showing, I had a lot of thoughts about it, and coming back from the theater just now, most are answered. As a Craig Bond fan, I wasn't disappointed.Let me start out with saying that I had my doubts beforehand. I loved 'Casino Royale' (2006), 'Quantum of Solace' (2008) was alright in my mind (just the poor editing which tanked the movie), 'Skyfall' (2012) was excellent, 'Spectre' (2015) was okay but nothing special and No Time to Die falls somewhere between Skyfall and Spectre, it isn't the best but it's a pretty great action movie overall.Straight on, the story was a little confusing. The idea behind the villain (played really well by Rami Malek) on paper is solid, but it almost seemed like the other characters knew exactly what was going on, yet it felt to me that us as viewers were missing some key points that connected all the dots. Everything else was solid and thought out if you've seen all the previous Craig Bonds, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (played by Cristoph Waltz) makes a guest return as well. This movie is entirely around James and Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), their secrets and their relationship, which ends in a unexpected turn near and at the end. Gotta say, hats off to the young Mathilde (Lisa-Dorah Sonne) as well.If you've seen all the Craig Bond movies, this is like a love letter to all the previous characters and some little details here and there (such as the dog figurine from Skyfall, M and Vesper Lynd, just to name a few). Some of these little winks from the past were greatly timed, others not so much.The action scenes are awesome. The DB5 is back with some nifty gadgets on board and the equipment that Q provides are pretty predictable to fit with the plot, but fun to see in action (again with the watch my dude..). This is not a realistic movie in any way but at least it isn't way over the top like that helicopter scene from Spectre. If felt to me like the action scenes kept this movie going, some scenes in between were slowing down the movie a little too much for my taste, but it isn't a deal breaker at all.Most of the old crew are back as well, like Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright, he was great to watch), M (Ralph Fiennes, really well played like always), Q (Ben Whishaw, still awesome with the classic British jokes), Tanner (Rory Kinnear, glad to see him still being here) and Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris, sadly under used). Some new faces were also introduced, like Nomi (Lashana Lynch, I liked her role, not overpowering like I was expecting) and Paloma (Ana de Armas). I felt like Paloma was greatly under used and she should've gotten some more screen time for sure, but for the time that she was on the screen, I loved her, she reminded me a little of 'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012) with Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, very good at changing personality and with some surprises in there.The filming and editing are excellent, not like that shaky cam syndrome from 'Quantum of Solace' but sharp, crisp images (most of the scenes were filmed with IMAX camera's and you notice that instantly on the screen) with great sound to go with it and a brilliant soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, he never fails to amaze me.So, where does this leave us? If you're a Bond and/or an action movie fan, go watch it, you will not be disappointed. It isn't over the top like 'Spectre' was (yes, there are some explosive elements in this movie but nothing too overbearing) and it keeps most good things from previous movies around while introducing some new elements to keep the movie interesting.Enjoy your day!--This review was made after a midnight viewing in the Netherlands with Dolby Atmos sound enabled. I apologise for any errors, my vocabulary or grammar, English isn't my first language.",No Time to Die
1757,cerqueira-97499,Amazing Bond MOVIE!!!!,9,30 September 2021,"Bond left the British service for a quiet life in Jamaica. His peace is taken away when his CIA friend Felix Leiter asks him for help. The mission is to rescue a scientist who has been mysteriously captured. Thus, the clues lead him once again to come into conflict with a dangerous villain, equipped with a new technology.007- No Time to Die is a perfect ending to a Craig saga. All the elements you can expect from the series are here: beautiful women, gadgets, cars, amazing action sequences and megalomaniac villains.The script is very well written, manages to lock in elements from all the films in the Casino Royale series, 2006. The criminal organization Specter once again becomes a problem for Bond, this time a second great villain is presented, the mysterious Safin. The mission of uniting so many plots was extremely arduous, well executed thanks to the fabulous direction of Cary Joji Fukunaga, who explores a more human side never seen in a series in which several nuances are well connected to 007- A Secret Service of Her Majesty, of 1969.Technically, this movie has one of the best photographs in the series, I smell an Oscar nomination. All shot in IMAX format, Linus Sandgren offers work as competent as what we saw in 007-Operation Skyfall, photographed by Roger Deakins. What about Hans Zimmer here? A work very different from the ""sound design"" that he has been altering in recent years and making any kind of listening break tiring. Here we have the melody, depth of character and even references to John Barry, Thomas Newman and David Arnold. Billie Eillish's theme song is supreme, it stays on your mind even when you don't think about it. The film's montage is also precious, Tom Cross already won the Oscar for Whiplash 2014 brings here a complex work, likely to be the best ever made in the series in this aspect.As for acting, Rami Malek has a short act like the villain Safin, but very efficient. He manages to be both subject and powerful, same caliber as Silva, played by Javier Bardem in Skyfall. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent, high point for Ana de Armas as Paloma, a feast for the eyes.007- No Time to Die brings things that will change the series forever. There won't be a new Bond after this one for many years, certainly. The effort to produce this one here was so great and it will take a new saga, with a new actor. Daniel Craig is James Bond, Secret Agent 007. His best performance in his career.",No Time to Die

1769,malefbusiness,What a shame!,4,1 October 2021,"Honestly, I love James Bond. Grew up watching all the movies mostly from 2000 and after and ALL the previous in DVD's. I am true fan of James Bond and I think I have a objective opinion about our favourite hero.But. But, what happened is a shame! A disgrace towards the James Bond, by I don't know who Japanese person was behind, with complete-TOTAL- lack of 007 knowledge. HAS HE EVER WATCHED BEFORE A MOVIE?I have to admit that it started extremely well. It might be a little over-strecthed, but when that movie comes at the best every 2 year is not bad to have an over extended version of our hero.It run well BUT, WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED ON THE LAST PART OF THE FILM? It is shame and the people behind it made terrible wrongs! Firstly, James Bond is a symbol. Never dies. What you have done is a total disgrace and will hunt you forever. It would be much better if we had killed villain, opened the safety bunker doors and not be poisoned by the enemy. Instead you kill 007?!? Again a nice ending, I know, BUT that is the point! WITH WHAT PERMISSION YOU BUNCH OF IGNORANTS, WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF JAMES BOND AT ALL MADE THESE DECISIONS?!It was the first time EVER that I left sad, mad and angry from a cinema outraged about the bunch of ignorant people who thought it is a good ending. Shame on you.P. S.: BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THE NEXT JAMES BOND. His name is James. Not Jina, Jenny or any other stuff you will come from your heads. We want a top selection to be made with much years ahead of him to create a new series that will outcome Daniel which was excellent as James Bond overall all this yeas. Any new revolutionary ideas your heads come up with will mean the end of you and of our favourite hero. Equality can be and must be chased on everyday life, streets jobs etc. NOT IN JAMES BOND FILMS.

1775,rominet-86275,Sad,4,1 October 2021,"In case the team behind this didn't realise: James Bond flirts with death and the ladies. He doesn't actually marry them!!I left the cinema feeling overwhelmed and actually mostly sad. Yes the movie is well made, but yes everything that everyone is saying about it tapping into the woke, melodramatic writing is also true and not bondesque. Also like everyone else I feel robbed of one of my childhood hero. That ending was the worst and until that point I refused to believe the rumors because it would simply be too insulting. It is also not believable, which is normally not an issue in Bond movies - who goes to see a Bond movie to see believable stuff - but in the whole Craig era they have attempted to make it more real and natural. In any other story, the girl and the kid would have died - because who imagines Bond living on with a family? Or at the risk of killing them - that would have solved the issue, he would have had one more traumatic experience in his life, adding to his tortured personality and they could have kept an open ending. Or even better, Bond kills the villain - who by the way left the island before with his entourage and dangerous weapons only to come back and confront Bond? - Before any of this happens. So unnecessary, really. I have to say that I also wonder what the point of the other 007 was. She was probably meant to embody the female, not sexy, black powerful character but actually makes the character feel very insecure, arrogant and useless. I literally don't see the point of the character in the whole story.Craig was great as usual and the cinematography majestic. It is action packed and has the little funny punchlines we love, but it doesn't make up for the terrible waste it makes you feel at the end. Now even if they want to reboot it with a prequel or something, we will always know when and how he dies, taking away again that idea that he always flirts with death. How could they take that away from the fans and story makers?",No Time to Die

1778,chicob-06773,Warning Spoliers! It's Bond but not as we know him,3,1 October 2021,"I was looking at another reviewer who quoted the following.""They actually killed off James Bond at the end of the movie. You can't do that. It has never happened before, for a good reason. James Bond is never supposed to actually die. We as an audience like seeing him in dangerous situations, but, he always was able to turn things around and ultimately win. That is why we loved him. By definitively killing the character here, it will never be the same again when they now try and bring him back.This was the worst creative decision that they could have ever made, it is like making a fun Christmas movie and then giving Santa terminal cancer at the end. It might shock the audience, but, that does not mean that it is good story telling.""I have to agree wit every word, killing James Bond is like breaking the 4th wall, in doing this they have utterly destroyed the Bond mythos and i don't see how it can recover.Like death and taxes James Bond surviving every attempt on his life, no matter how ridiculous it might have seemed, was what made the films legendary in first place. Bond was like this indestructible force and no mattr what he faced he would find a way to survive and films always ened on an upbeat note with Bond getting the girl and making a smart quip. It was uplifting and part of the Bond charm.Indeed that is why Austin Powers became such a huge success becuase they parodies James Bond so well based on the fact that Bond always got the woman, villain and survived no matter if he should have been dead a hundred times over.The film itself had some decent action scenes and there were a few great turns by some of the cast. However i feel like over that last 5 Daniel Craig films they have sucked all the fun & life out of James Bond (literally now) and everything that made Bond unique amongst all the other spy thriller series has been thrown aside for ever. I suspect this is to pander to PC brigade who have made it impossible for Fleming's Bond to exist in modern world.I will stick to watching all the pre Daniel Craig Bond films apart from Skyfall which i think is the only one of his films that had a real Bond feel about it.",No Time to Die

I don't know who they attempt to make him into but I do know Fleming has now officially turned into a rotating fan, wherever he is, turning in sheer agony in his grave every time they destroy his creative works.The writing is awful - I mean plain AWFUL - and the directing no better. The story is all over the place, the narrative borderlines the absurd at times.How many times do you need to hire the same low-grade writers, like Robert Wade, for example and that immature child of a director?? I wouldn't put him in charge of a $1,000 budget let alone $250 mil. Is there actually no one else who is a capable screenplay writer and director in the entire film industry? This constant recycling of the same tosh again and again is tiresome and reflect in the pure garbage churned out from the industry, which is getting worse and worse.Many people in the audienc were leaving the film halfway through. Even Craig looked out of place in some scenes not knowing where to take his character.It's infuritating what Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, Cary Joji Fukunaga and Phoebe Waller-Bridge has done to this classic. Just a sad and pathetic ex term ination of a great franchise that have a lot more to give - and I don't mean the ending of the character in the film, which was just another pathetic pre-school attempt to attract a shock effect in lack of a proper screenplay or directing skills.Rest assure the next Bond will be a one-legged trans single-parent of colour.... with an artificial cervix (not made in China).And the evil villain must surely be of wh ite complexion of Western decent.We already see where the future is heading with this trainwreck.I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!",No Time to Die

That's the Bond I love , like most Bond fans.Craig plays Bond like the Fleming Bond but is placed in a script where so many unnatural non-Bonds Things happen that any real Bond fan cannot relate. When watching this movie. The movie fealt to me like a parody to Bond like the sixties version with David Niven and Woody allen, or Moonraker (which did follow the bond rules) At least there we knew it was a parody.When watching the movie it blew me of when They killed Felix Leiter that's one thing but ok. Then they killed Blofeld the biggest and greatest Bond adversary of all times in such an easy way. Why do this? In the whole franchise is was never completely clear if Blofeld was dead. Now we have our answer. A simpele dead caged in prison. And then the the bad guy, why did he have such a strange face? . His motives for wanting to destroy the world are vague. Is it money or a world domination he wants? Or he just wants to kill to purifiy the human race? I still don't know.The other things I don't like is the thing with Q, his daughter, the suicide of Bond. I all read it in other reviews and I agree with others.At last in generall something. I was so dissapointed when they Introduced Pierce Brosnan in the nineties and let Brosnan play Bond in his Remington style and not use his potential as an actor like Brosnan displayed in the movie the fourth protocol where he showed his Real Bond potential.I was thrilled with Craig in Casino Royale the best Bond movie of the last 25 years, But this movie is a parody.Then to end with something positive. If you take away all the Bond sentiment and just look at it as another action movie, it's still enjoyable to watch. The majority of the public will probably love it.

I like Craig as Bond. He deserved more from this final outing. The new 007 worked well in the film, but again, could have had more to do. To be honest, it didn't feel overly long watching it, and as a film I quite enjoyed it. BUT it isn't Bond. All the things which make Bond what he is are gone. And the obsession with turning this era of films in to a soap opera is the real problem. Go back to the simple formula of stand alone movies. The ending is plain stupid and actually made me laugh.

1810,lutz_87,"Good conclusion - same level as ""SPECTRE""",8,12 October 2021,"For me, the story of ""No Time To Die"" is pretty classically laid out. In parts it is very reminiscent of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".Craig plays Bond brilliantly as always, a rather laconic portrayal of the character (the oneliners almost always worked for me, which is probably mainly due to Craig's acting), but he gives it a particularly strong emotional depth compared to his predecessors.I won't spoil anything else about the story, except to say that the film as a whole has to be regarded as an action drama rather than an action thriller. The ending really got to me and almost takes on the features of a Shakespearian drama. The antagonist and his right-hand man actually go down a bit, but work quite well in their roles.The motivations of the individual characters were coherent overall, the story had a comprehensible plot and especially the first 2/3 of the film was quite exciting. In the last third it flattens out a bit, but then ends with an emotional bang.For me, one of the biggest plus points: The technical gadgets and gimmicks.In ""Spectre"", gadgets were brought into play again, but in ""No Time to Die"", at least for me, the child in the man was awakened again :-D It was simply ""cool"" to see how technology was used in the film.Partly outstanding action scenes, an overall good and for me comprehensible story (in contrast to ""SPECTRE"" where I always found the ""relationship"" between Bond and Blofeld rather contrived and forced), a great soundtrack and a good acting ensemble. Only the look of the film was - despite fantastic sets - not quite as chic & classy as in ""Spectre"" or ""Skyfall"".8/10 overall.",No Time to Die

1812,garethhonour,Shear Disappointment,3,2 October 2021,"Having had so much build up and hype for this film, and hearing the encouraging words of the cast prior to the premier I went into the cinema with high expectations and how quickly my confidence disappeared.The opening sequence was good, with tasteful music from Zimmer hinting OHMSS throughout the film which worked well. The film is visually stunning too but that's as far as my praise can go.Right from the start Bond and Swann's relationship is so unbelievable it's almost awkward to watch. Their exchange of dialogue seems unnatural and clumpy further worsening the issue. There is simply no chemistry there at all.Bond himself seemed like a new person. Whereas in the other Craig films there was much more emphasis on silences and facial expressions here Bond is constantly speaking his mind. The fact this is inconsistent with the other films bothers me. There are no memorable quotes or tactful comebacks further highlighting the weak dialogue in the script.The deaths of Felix, Blofeld, and Safin were all anticlimactic. Safin seemed to be underused and slightly irrelevant with so much else going on. Paloma was one of the best characters in the film and she barely got any screen time. M, Moneypenny, Q and Tanner were linked in okay but nothing notable.The ending was so unnecessary and dissatisfying. One of the core attributes of Bond is always being able to get out of situation no matter what. ALWAYS. Why break the formula then?Without a doubt the worst of the Craig Bond films and possibly one of the worst in the series. I left the cinema feeling depressed and empty. Such a shame.

I left the theatre last night thinking about why excitedly I was waiting a year and half for this film to come. This movie was made to self explode the entire Bond industry. Everything about it seemed anti-Bond.My points as to why,Daniel Craig's Bond always seems to be always gone Rogue from the agency. This movie really exploits that.His replacement, the black girl 007 was completely there for political correctness or for BLM. I really hope this is not the Jane Bond they are thinking of doing? Because the Jane thing will only make this worse. It will be the end of Bond films.the Villain Rami? He seemed to have talent doing the Queen movie but since I've seen him in other movies including this one, he either is miscast or he just not good. What a lame villain.No dynamic Bond music. Opening song was pathetic and hardly any good fills during the film to the end.All talky talk, one scene to another was just 2 people conversing forever, then they finally put in a mediocre action scene.Overall this movie was no fun. Very dark. No humor in certain spots that previous Bond films always had. Plus killing off Bond in the end was ridiculous. Bond never dies. So did they intentionally do this to kill the Bond movie industry?I read the high reviews on here and no doubt these people are paid to give it a high review or it is people involved in the film. Easy to do.Really sad to see James Bond self destruct like this. Daniel Craig should be ashamed of being part of this, I've lost a lot of respect for this guy.I would put this fluff of a film on the bottom for worst movies made.",No Time to Die

Even Daniel Craig didn't look interested during most of the movie.Plot was weak. Dialogues were flat. Movie was missing action. Villain was a joke. Movie was way too long means bad editing.Best thing in the movie was Ana de Armas. Well done to her for brighten up the movie for 5 minutes.They killed Bond in the end. Ridiculous. James Bond never dies. It is a FACT established by 60 years of tradition.As a big James Bond fan I am here save the franchise here. Since these writers can not come up any decent ideas, Here is my plot to bring back James Bond with dignity:After the explosion James fly of to the ocean, very badly injured. Nomi rides her boat and fish him out from the water and they fly him off to top secret, state of the art medical facility. Many, long operations after he is shown with fully bandaged lying in hospital bed with his team in the room.

The death of Craig's Bond needed a cinema release to do it justice. It also makes sense why Craig agreed to sign up for one last outing.There are a number of reasons to mark this entry in the canon down, especially as this is the first Bond baddie that has a justifiable reason to turn bad. Not sure this is a theme the brand should want to continue. Who wants to sympathise with the villain? However, did this stop me from being rendered to tears in the final scene? No it didn't. This is a Bond movie with production about as big as it comes. They've done the franchise proud in my book. I only hope that the rest of the cast continue in their roles and that the next outing isn't a reboot, that would be a real shame. I applaud all involved in making this the absolute delight it was to watch and I make no apology to anyone that has to endure my emotional reaction to its cataclysmic finale. A beautiful story realised. And to those that state that Fleming would be rolling in his grave have missed the point.

1832,malchikalex,The Worst Bond Ever Made,1,3 October 2021,"If someone had gifted me the ability to time travel in the past just once, I would probably go just a few hours back and tell myself never to see this movie. I really can't think of any other event in my life that needs such a drastic change 🤣 This is not just the worst Daniel Craig Bond. It's the worst Bond. Of them all. It's one thing to want to demolish the myth of something or make a version more in tune with the world today. Casino Royale did that perfectly. Even Goldeneye, by 90's standards evolved the character. And it all comes down to the persons handling the reigns. Fukunaga and company ruined this up big time. By all means technically it's a solid movie, and claiming otherwise would be stupid and ignorant. But who cares? All such high caliber movies nowadays are perfect like that. As they should be. So moving on. NTTD continues the story from all the previous Craig Bonds, and tries to balance inserts of forced homage to previous movies and concluding the saga, all while making Bond more serious, emotional and human. Even more than he already is. And it's a mess. His love story with Vesper worked because he was a young arrogant agent falling in love. And Craig/Green had the best chemistry ever. Doing the same with Madeleine feels forced and unreal. It appeals only to high school girls and people of such mentality. He is a 50 year old spy! 🤣 As is her initial is it or is it not betrayal. And their whole emotional journey throughout the movie is so soapy and melodramatic it's just eye rolling. And that's mostly to some horribly written dialogue, that brings out Brazilian soap opera performances. Malek is one of the worst villains ever. There's just no pulse in his performance or his character. Not even the simplest line to explain anything about him but his past. How the hell did he manage to command an army? Scientists? Workers? Technology? Give us a stupid excuse in one line of dialogue! Anything! He is like a background actor with too much dialogue not the main villain! It really destroys any sort of tension or drama. The action is mostly dull. A few cool shots among the sequences but nothing of tension. Casino and Quantum were tense and visceral, Skyfall was elegant, Spectre was stylish. Here it's just flat. Even the attempt at some sort of PlayStation/John Wick action sequence on the stairs made me snore. The best action bits are in the trailer. And the emotional finale? With all the above mentioned and more that I can't write without giving away spoilers made it so redundant. There was no gravity to that ending. And that stuffed animal sure didn't help. I'd rather end this horrible movie on a more positive note, so here are the good stuff:
1. The city of Matera in Italy is gorgeous.2. The new Land Rover Defender is equally gorgeous. 3. Lashana Lynch as the new 00 was great! Her chemistry with Craig was spot on!4. Ana De Armas was the cutest most fun agent Bond ever teamed with. Such a shame she was in the movie for so little time. Again her chemistry with Craig was fantastic, waaaayyy better than what he had with his intended love interest.MINOR SPOILER FOLLOWS.5. Q as always was a pleasure, and his sexual preferences a nice nod to a not forced diversity.END OF MINOR SPOILER :)My biggest disagreement is that this wasn't a Bond movie. It's a mediocre melodramatic action movie that features a spy. Could be anyone. Could be Bruce Willis on a Netflix ""because you liked 007"" suggestion. And like I deleted The Last Jedi from my personal canon of Star Wars films, in the same way I will delete this.

At least in the case of Felix, we actually saw him die. So that part of the story is over forever. Technically speaking we did not _see_ James' body shred to pieces by the explosion, but I cannot imagine one acceptable way to explain why James Bond would not have died in this situation. Ok, maybe some of his body cells survived and Q will breed a new James Bond out of them...only kidding.So James Bond is dead. A constant in the life of many people is gone. Anyway, there is more in life than looking at a more and more disillusioned spy who has lost all sense of humor. But this also means that in case that this franchise will be continued, it will miserably fail. Maybe a new start after 30 or 40 years is possible when all the old fans and knowledgeable James Bond experts of today have died and a new generation, who never ever saw the original movies is willing to accept that the story is retold from the beginning.Goodbye James, goodbye Felix, M, Q, Moneypenny.

Even as a non James Bond movie it's over long, very dull in parts and extremely badly written.It has a relationship at it's center that is just unbelievable. There is no chemistry between Bond and Madeleine Swann, none at all. The relationship seems to be the central driving force in the story and all other story threads are given a back seat at times. It's a Bond movie, get a grip.Bond doesn't even feel like the lead in his own movie at timesBond jumped way to quickly to the assumption that Madeleine was a villain without giving her a chance to explain. Totally unbelievable.Just kill off all of Spectre to be replaced by Safin? Eh?Blofeld was underused and his death was a joke. .What exactly is Safin going to use the nanobots he's developing for? It's never really explained. The love story was more important than the actual plotSafin has to be the weakest villian we've ever had. He's hardly in the movie and when he does arrive he's just meh. Absolute waste of such a great actor. No real menace at all.Since when did a Bond movie use children as a threat device? Twice it was used in this film and both times it felt ridiculous and forced.Paloma was fantastic. She was the best part of the movie but she's only in it for 10 minutes.Nomi is so unlikeable it draws you out of the film every time shes on screen. Would of been better having Miss Moneypenny promoted to 007. She had an existing relationship with Bond and the viewer.Q didn't need to be on the plane. It served no purpose except putting him in peril. He could quiet easily of been back home in his slippers.The middle section of the movie is so dull.The best action scenes are the ones before the credits, of which most i'd seen in the trailers. The credit sequence is one of the worst and easily forgotten.All of that aside, it's the ending that will be the most talked about and most divisive. Bond goes into the villains lair, gets the job done and gets the girl. That's Bond. In this one they kill him off for an emotional payoff that's sadly lacking. Then at the end of the credits we get the usual Bond will return but by that stage I couldn't care less.The team behind this just doesn't get what a Bond film is. This was an absolute mess with a love story gone wrong, a bit of action, some kind of under developed villain with a non developed plan for world domination and a rubbish end.Been a Bond fan for over 40 years and this is by far the worst one yet.

1848,tom-jall,This is (not) the end...,8,3 October 2021,"Two things to assess: the film in itself and the consequences of the end.No Time To Die is graphically splendid, every shot - whether it involves dialogues, fighting or pure landscapes - has been ""created"" like a piece of art. The photography is stunning and the music fits in with each moment. All those aspects make this film a very pleasant one to watch. In spite of an outrageous length and a few incoherent facts, I found the plot straightforward to understand, every scene leading to the following quite logically. The actors are perfect but that is the least you could expect from such a super production. Overall, this film is a good representation of what Daniel Craig has brought to the part: a less funny and cynical but more physical and more human James Bond.Now the end did come as a shock indeed as heroes are not supposed to die and one might, as I did, go out of the theater with a mixed feeling of bitterness and nostalgia... Rightfully so I guess if you are a genuine fan... However, it turns out that we have all the time in the world ... This is not the end of James Bond, only the end of an era started in 2006 by a superb actor offering a new and different version of the famous spy, an era where every Bond movie is related to one another, an era where the main character is actually evolving from one mission to the next. This cycle is over and it ended in a bold move that I personally respect. Cry the actor if you wish but do not cry the character. Because James Bond is more than just an era, he is a legend and yes, he will return.",No Time to Die

A poignant and emotionally-draining drama which will no doubt meet with acclaim, especially amongst the pretentious, arty, (wannabe) film critics it serves to please.Meanwhile, Eon have decided to discontinue their fantastical film franchise about a handsome secret agent who drives fast cars, is popular with the ladies and saves the world from baddies.I can't say it's not good but it's depressing and not what I bought a ticket to see.",No Time to Die

I never write reviews, this is my first review, and the reason I do this now it's because I am furious. After 59 years and 26 James Bond movies, someone decided that the James Bond movies should be about something more. I have been a James Bond fan since I was a kid, and I have seen all Bond movies numerous times. The only Bond movie I will never see again is this one. James Bond movies were about having a good evening at the movies. They were about charm, they were witty, they had class, and they were fun. I have no idea how we went from ""little Nellie"" to this. Neither Ian Fleming nor Albert Broccoli ever conceived of James Bond dying. Part of the charm was that you knew he could pull off just about anything. I don't care if some people decided to make James Bond movies about something more, but this is not what the Bond movies were about. You left the film with a smile and with a good feeling about the movie. You knew it was not realistic, but you didn't care. The one thing you were sure about was that you weren't going to watch a ""dark"" movie. Unfortunately, the latest trend caught up with the producers who decided to make No time to die a ""dark"" film. This Bond movie does not leave you with a pleasant aftertaste and is missing most of the James Bond movie attributes. It's the first time I left a James Bond movie without that ""feel good"" taste. If you are a Bond fan like I am, I think you will be very disappointed.",No Time to Die

Craig's 007 is pursuing another arc than the previous Bond movies & Bond actors in the EON cannon. There's,a Casino Royale Scene between M and Daniel Craigs version of James Bond where Bond says to M that 00's have a short life expectancy and her mistake will be short lived. In, all of Craig's tenure as 007, characters were killed off. Vesper(Casino Royale), Rene Matthis (Quantum of Solace), M(Skyfall), Mr White(Spectre) and in No Time to die such characters as James Bond ,himself, Blofeld and Felix Leiter are killed in this particular actor's portrayal & arc of the character. For me, it makes sense that the ending to that movie sends him to his demise if we follow that version of James Bond portrayal of Bond.From Mauritius with Love ;-}",No Time to Die

1856,avalonmemoir,"Don't fall for the hype, it's below average.",4,4 October 2021,"All the silly political correctness aside, what actually makes this a poor Bond movie is the criminal under-utilization of it's main villain.Daniel Craig might not be the best actors, but his steely-blue eyed and rugged interpretation of the old Bond-character has suited the movies and his performances have always been more than adequate.During Craig's tenure, the difference between the good and the ""meh"" Bond movies has been the villains and how the plots have revolved around them;Casino Royale and. Skyfall; both had good performances from Mads Mikkelsen and Javier Badem, the aims of the villains and the interaction between them and Bond was excellent.Whereas the interaction between villain and Bond in Quantum and Spectre was much less interesting and the performances of the villains much less memorable.With an actor as talented as Rami Malek, I was hoping for a much more central role for him, the opening scene was very promising but then the villains motivations become fuzzy (apart from grrr I want revenge for my family), what he is trying to accomplish and why is he going through all this trouble to achieve it. Especially the final confrontations between Bond and villain left a lot to be desired.Furthermore, apart from the standard ""strange, dodgy guy we haven't met before turns out to be a bad guy"" - twist, there are no surprises, which makes the plot extremely predictable and it's utterly bizarre that a movie this long, can has so little plot and character development.Also I beg the British film industry, if they must have a collection of every ethnicity in supporting roles, to please start casting actors from other nations, the black population in Britain is just 3% and there clearly just isn't enough talented individuals to meet demand. The Bond series can handle an average playing but cool looking Daniel Craig, who then has people around him doing the good acting, but when you then add the average playing but cool looking Lashana Lynch, it just doesn't work.The hype makes it seem like we're back on Skyfall and Casino Royale level, in reality it's below average, underused villains, no real plot or character development and the little plot there is is entirely predictable.",No Time to Die

Second half left we waiting for the end, which when the end did come, it got even worse.It feels like they had half a script laying around from another (non Bond) film and just went 'that will do'. Its almost like they knew this was so un-Bond-like that they over compensated by throwing as many Aston Martins at it as they could to try and convince otherwise.And then that ending... where they kill Bond and at the end of the credits still have 'James Bond Will Return'. So now he's going to be just like Kenny from Southpark? Him dying and coming back will not make the viewer value the character but see him as disposable.Very disappointed for this to be how they end the Craig era, especially when they had so much extra time due to delayed release to reconsider.

Lots of suspense and good action that kept me mesmerised throughout - even though it was too long. I'm also surprised people think Bond was killed at the end. There was no body. It was a transparent setup for Bond faking his own death so he could disappear. It's why he climbed to the top of the structure so the missiles would fall into the silos and explode inside without him getting hurt. If he wanted to commit suicide, he'd have stayed inside.

Terrible villain - may as well be acted by a burnt plank of wood. Terrible script where a whitty quip is shoe-horned in by every single character numerous times which ultimately cheapens any subsequent attempt to be whitty. Let's not even start on the ending before I pass out with rage...I want to genuinely apologise on behalf of whoever made this rubbish to any kid who hasn't been brought up on bond and thinks this is what it's all about.

1862,marxylius-42896,Bond gives up: a first,7,5 October 2021,"The ""We Have All The Time In The World"" is still singing in my ear a day after seeing ""No Time To Die"". The tune will never be the same again.Here we have a long awaited last Craig Bond which already had numerous problems during production. Directors walking away, change of musical director, scripwriters adding and changing. And then came the worldwide lockdown. Alas, these problems show in what is delivered up there on the big screen and makes NTTD a mixed bag.The in duration record-breaking traditional pre-credits ""short"" is to be honest wonderful and sets the pieces for what could be a true ""big stakes"" Daniel Craig flick with loads of salutations to the classic ""crazy badguy with crazy plot to destroy us all"" Bond-theme. The Cuba chapter is 007-perfection, giving us the most original side-character, the brilliant Paloma, since.....? Pure Bond bliss and thunder. The new 007 Nomi gets introduced and although she just brings the ""squabble between forced allies"" story-trick and is even pretty useless at times, this 2-D sidekick isn't annoying or attracts emotional relevance but works amazingly well for what the character needs to do. The same goes for supporting Q, with even a small joke about his ""mistake"" in Skyfall, who is solid.But the problems start somewhere around the time Saffin and Madeline meet again, Madeline being some sort of Stockholm syndrome Blofeldt.shrink Macguffin sets up more dying and the ""twist"" in the plot. Yes, Blofeldt is literally being dragged out again and Christoph Walz' performance, getting a second shot at it, once again suffers under the Brofeldt sillyness. Saffin is creapy enough, his hate for Spectre makes sense, but follow-up motive for ""making the world a little tidy-er"" doesn't come off. Badguys motivations don't need to be all clear in Bond films but in this case it feels just ad lib, almost a second thought with the baddie needing his vulcano-lair to wrap up the ""James Bond greatest hits show"".After finishing off Leiter and Blofeldt, 007 himself gets murdered in Norway with the revelation he is a dad. So much for the ""blunt weapon"" and it is now clear to the audience that after NTTD the Bond-universe will never be the same. Capture and chase commence with Saffin giving a tribute to the Fleming books with his garden but the whole finale is so messy, although the fight scenes are sometimes great, culminating in the illogical death of the hero. James Bond gives up. That is probably the greates sinn of this film. With the exception of Lazeby, I can't think of any other time 007 actually throws in the towel.So now James Bond has moved to the world of Madeline telling her daughter stories about her father.NTTD is great in action, has a strong first hour but makes the same mistake as it's predecessor Spectre with the ""family angle"". Instead of pushing Saffin more to the foreground and straighten the script, the film ends in mubblejumble not really knowing how to wrap up it's story.",No Time to Die

It's just wrong and unrealistic.007 is supposed to be able to run for long distances, get up quickly when knocked down and have incredible stamina to save the world. HOW CAN AN OVERWEIGHT (slightly obese) person do this?Since when do you see obese people in the SAS (Secret Army Service) or Navy Seals? How can they perform their duty if they are not in good health?This is NOT a hit at being fat.It is a criticism of the casting & directors choosing a person who is not at all 'fit' for the role of 007.There are plenty of black actresses in the world who are in better shape.I want a film to be realistic.I noticed that the director tried hard to cut out the bottom half of her body (obviously to hide her size).The story was a bit predictable; and a few parts youre left wondering why they do what they do.

James Bond down on his knees whimpering that he's so, so, so sorry and then, well,... the clue is in the false promise of the title. What a cruel, sick and sadistic joke to make such a promise to Bond fans and moviegoers the world over, especially after the tragedies of COVID, and then stab us all in the back with this utter betrayal, not to mention all the brands that spent millions to sponsor this movie (Do you really want to wear the clothes that Bond died in? Or to think about his death every time you pick up a bottle of Heineken?)Everyone associated with this production knows they have screwed up big time and fatally sabotaged the franchise. That's why all the objective, truthful and authentic reviews on this site are quickly and mysteriously followed by one or two glowing 10/10 reviews (that read like movie studio press releases) urging you to ignore the negatives and go and see this so-called masterpiece for yourself. It's a desperate attempt at damage control.What we all need right now is levity and hope. That's what the James Bond franchise has always provided. That's it's role and the reason it's been so popular for 60 years. It's supposed to be escapist adventure (think Mission Impossible), not some solemn message about... what exactly? When we go to watch a Bond movie, we don't want to see actors trying to be taken oh so seriously and exploring the deeper meaning of the material, or trying to change society, or deconstructing their character (a cultural icon we all love), or looking for epic sagas where they don't exist.Daniel Craig's 5-movie story arc is not and never has been an epic saga. That whole construct has been forced down our throats. It's just a very thin story dressed up with all sorts of fake family/relationship drama that nobody wants or believes. Blofeld is Bond's long-lost step-brother who is the author of all his pain. Madeleine, who can hardly even smile at him, is now the love of his life and the woman he would sacrifice everything for. Come on! Brosnan's invisible car and even his infamous kite-surfing-a-tsunami scene were more credible than this!I loved Craig as Bond in Casino Royale and, despite its deficiencies, in Quantum of Solace, too. He was a flawed hero but he still represented an ideal - a classic archetype - for millions of men and women around the globe. Skyfall was a great and very different Bond movie that we all loved. Bond was battered and bruised, but he was still a dependable beacon of hope for all of us in a troubled world, as he was also in the slow and boring SPECTRE, although I see now that the writing was already on the wall for the Bond franchise. Looks like the box office sales went to people's heads and hubris soon took over with the folks at EON Productions. And now, with No Time To Die, the goose that laid the golden eggs - for 6 decades! - the character we invested in all our lives, has been slaughtered for the sake of one actor's ego and to get across a political message that fell completely flat because it was so blatantly and patronizingly handled (talk about a blunt instrument!). It seems the producers designed this movie to try to appease and pander to every faction out there - except Bond fans (Hey, but we threw in a boatload of Aston Martins, a vodka martini, a dinner suit, and one or two gadgets for you kids, didn't we?).How sad and ironic to destroy such a beloved franchise just as we were about to celebrate its 60th anniversary.

""Well just goes to show, no one's indestructible"" from Diamonds are Forever",2,9 October 2021,"Tiffany Case: (reading Bond's ID card planted on the deceased Franks)My God! You just killed James Bond!James Bond: Is that who it was? Well just goes to show, no one's indestructible""Tiffany Case: ""You don't kill James Bond..."" from Diamonds are Forever movieSo this quote has two key opposing ideas, you don't just kill Bond and Bond's not indestructible-certainly not Daniel Craig's Bond, as we find out. Killing James Bond is not sacrosanct in Daniel Craig's Bond, nothing is off-limited as added to the sacred altar Felix Leiter, Blofeld, the exclusive 007 designation and even the Spectre organisation. NTTD doesn't just kill Bond, it kills many of the core aspects associated with Bond, he is no longer the womanizing bachelor (save a brief flirtation e.g. In OHMSS) but now a committed family man, he no longer just carries a Water PPK in his belt, now it's a fluffy bunny rabbit. Whereas James Bond was synonymously and the only person tied with the ""007"" designation, now it is no longer the case. Is it still Bond? Well no, because he's now ""enjoying death"" while the sky falls. It's not so much killing the sacred cow as killing the whole herd in a convoluted and lengthy way. This is no killing off a character in a film series, this is killing off THE only character of a film series. Begs the question, why??? You don't just kill James Bond...but in NTTD nothing is off limits in the Bond world. Now he's taking a back seat (literally, not just once either but it's like he prefers to be a passenger in the film after its opening -5 years certainly changes a man). Maybe it's a matter of Daniel Craig wanting to coast along in the film so he can line up for killing off his character at the end...with British missiles. Even Blofeld and Spectre's deaths are thanks to Safin, rather than Bond who is more Safin's pawn while Safin is the chessmaster doing the checkmates. Bond seems to choose killing himself rather than being killed - Die and Let Live.And also the music from previously classics is heavily borrowed to beef up the NTTD soundtrack and story. What would NTTD be without borrowing from OHMSS and other films in script, quotes, titles, music, themes. Even visiting Vesper's grave is borrowed from the OHMSS book. Why is NTTD so derivative? Maybe that it is not a standalone movie. It depends on its Bond past while it seeks to destroy that same past. Spoilers - this film depends on spoilers when it didn't need to. It would still be a good film without killing so much of Bond and killing off so much of Bond doesn't make it a great film, certainly not a great Bond movie. Casino Royale and Skyfall managed to be excellent movies without going to the lengths of NTTD to not play with the formula but rather pay lipservice to the formula in order to distract from a future with Swan, Mathilde Swan - yeap, Bond's daughter. Is Bond's daughter an ingenious or cynical way to expand into a spin-off? All the key male characters die (Leiter, Blofeld,Bond even the Russian scientist) while the main female characters come out unscathed (Nomi - it's back to work) to Live Another Day. More emotion and build-up were given to M's and Vesper's deaths than given to James Bond's. Again, why?Even if someone had said ""My God, you just killed James Bond"" would have been more meaningful and respective to keen Bond fans than what NTTD offered them with M's ""back to work"" and smiling Madeline and daughter driving along. Even if the critics, audiences and commercial success of NTTD are highly positive, it will be at a cost of the soul of the James Bond film series, a big negative.In the end, James Bond played Daniel Craig instead of Daniel Craig playing James Bond in NTTD. Many will have wished now that Daniel Craig had ended his run on all time high of Skyfall than giving us Spectre and NTTD which just made things worse even if good movies in many ways. It is almost like the first two thirds of NTTD is so Bondian to distract before pulling the rug out in the last third. Why so serious? If Danny Boyle refused to go along with killing off James Bond then he showed more respect for the character and fans than the Producers including Daniel Craig and ultimate Director of NTTD. Seems they felt Daniel Craig can do no wrong, an indulgence not even offered to the original Sean Connery. Tiffany Case said it best. Diamonds are Forever but, thanks to NTTD, James Bond isn't. Sacrificed for the sake of spin-offs and modern sensibilities to perhaps expand the most successful single-character franchise rather than stay true to its creation and core and continue it's success. James Bond is a fantasy figure...or more accurately now...was...the final title card should have been ""James Bond is dead"" ""The End"" (full stop) "" not ""James Bond will return"". The Bond franchise might be back in some form (Mathilde Swan, Nomi 007) but many true James Bond fans won't meekly follow along -for them ""You've just killed James Bond...you don't JUST kill James Bond""",No Time to Die

A very comprehensive actor who fitted perfectly and suited remarkably as the super spy called James Bond. It was a complete shock to watch such a weak ending to Blofeld, Rami Malik could have had stronger intro and a better ending like previous villains ..... big disappointment and completely no justification to Daniel Craig's James Bond. This is second worst ending to a movie/series after Game of Thrones. Even TV Series Lucifer had better ending (not that it was a good ending).To me James Bond always learned from his mistakes and is a patriot who always fights for the country and was extremely perfect till Spectre, but it seems as if writer is not content with the very qualities of soldier who will do anything for his country and wanted to create weaknesses and destroy his reputation.Waste of money and waiting time and just seems like it is written to humiliate the very concept of patriotism and character of James Bond.",No Time to Die

1879,baileybehzadi,Bittersweet,7,7 October 2021,I've been a life long Bond fan growing up seeing Pierce Brosnan and watching the classics with my father and then Daniel Craig in my teens. This Bond had a lot of hype to meet up to. The action was great and some of the story was amazing but for me it's the ending that was the downfall. In Spectre we felt as if Bond truly deserved to retire in peace but here he isn't granted that request which I understand since it's the last film however I feel James deserved more. The new 007 is a good character but she doesn't need to be the new 007 she should have her own identity and probably a new title. The new Bond girl got very little screen time and didn't really feel substantial. In my conclusion it didn't feel like it was Bonds time to die hopefully they can start a new timeline and story with a new James Bond that's the only way I see it going forward.,No Time to Die

He is a nothing to write home about, which is a shame because I like him as an actor.It's ridiculous that he knows Swann. Everyone doesn't have to know everyone else in a fictional universe.I don't see why people are freaking out about the ending.

There's very little action, a lot of soppy, filler romance, which didn't work. There's no chemistry between Craig and Seadoux. The villain is ok, but the motive isn't clear at all. Craig isn't acting like Bond at all, I saw more Daniel Craig than James Bond.If I close my eyes, I can't see any redeeming qualities in this movie apart from the beautiful set pieces and acting.What gives them the right to mess with almost a 70 year old franchise?",No Time to Die

With the worst bond villain ever, a very flat and boring performance by an actor who has the talent to do much better. A jumbled story line, no definable motivation for the villain, besides revenge, with no clear end goal. Leaves you with nothing but pity for the lost, quite man. There was some good action sequences however they are not enough to carry the film. I never thought I would complain that a Bond movie was to long. However, if you don't add value to the story with the time, which they did not, then it's just a sad waste. Both the writers and director should be ashamed of the mediocre job they did.

Pathetic! Believe me, you should be glad I'm telling you and you are not wasting your $ and 3 hours. The few thrills and your hope for something better around the next turn, are not worth the effort.

I may have gotten caught up in the rumours of the franchise going with someone 'less traditional' than they most recently have, I didn't actually think they would, but it's fun to speculate. Apparently, they've fully embraced this new direction and I'm disheartened. I would go see any spin off, and these types of movies are my favourite, so I'm sure I'd enjoy it. But there is something satisfying walking into a movie theatre having a really good idea what you're going to see. The plot might change but the signature lines will always be there and I get pretty excited hearing the 'Bond, James Bond' tagline. A nice little ode to previous Bonds. Three words I will hear no more, now that there is no more Bond, James Bond. I wasn't really sad James Bond died, I was dumbfounded that I won't be hearing those three words on the big screen again. I suspect they'll walk that back and still have a James Bond in the future, they've killed a few key characters in the past, only to have them reappear in the following movie, but never James. For now, I feel like it was unnecessary and went against the James Bond recipe - James Bond saves the world and walks away with the girl, with a few minor cuts and bruises, with the villains lair in rubble in the background.

He did not age with the franchise and instead was always middle(ish) aged and yet his world was always the current one.I am fine with the changing aspects of the franchise as it should change the aspects that are considered unacceptable by the current day standards.It's just that Bond does not die.I don't think I will be paying to watch anymore Bond films.",No Time to Die

For the final film in the Craig series, the writers failed to give Safin (Rami) the depth and complexity necessary to make a great villain, and thus Bond's triumph was less impactful.Safin was driven to avenge the death of his family, orchestrating the demise of Spectre. But once he's accomplished his goal, what drives him to orchestrate the demise of humanity? The writers give the character less than 30 seconds to explain his philosophy - oblivion and existence. Why not allow Safin to give a short monologue to explain his worldview, adding greater depth and complexity to the character, and thus his overall impact in the film?We're introduced to Safin in the beginning of the film as an assassin out to kill Mr. White. When Bond is being briefed on Safin halfway through the film, why not add some sort of military-style experience to his background? Bond easily defeats Safin in less than 30 seconds, why not make Safin a formidable opponent and expand the hand-to-hand combat scene?For four films Bond had unknowingly faced Spectre, this highly sophisticated and intricate shadow network. Safin comes along in the 5th film and orchestrates the demise of the organization and it's leader Blofeld (Waltz) with little to no resistance. Then, when it's time for Safin to make his mark as the greatest villain in the Craig franchise, the writers failed to give him the qualities, complexity, and depth needed for a great antagonist.

No. Instead we have a cameo villain, a lame, poor storyline and then we get into the killing off of the main characters. Why? The first one in the film should come with an apology. Why did he have to go and why there? Lazy writing that's why. The last one we don't actually see (the only positive) but again...why? I think it's only because the writers are void of ideas to the point where they don't even understand the main character.

The biggest weak points have been highlighted on other reviews already but here's what I personally found annoyingwhy is there such a big gap, of what seems like forever given this film's length, between the introduction of the villain at the beginning and when we get to see him again (in that room with Madeline)? They had an opportunity to make him a focal point of the story and a lot more of a sinister character but they didn't do it, wasted.the new 007 (why??) has been given a script that sounds like it's been taken from car bumper-stickers. And she talks in bumper-sticker constantly.Logan Ash? Seemed to enter 1 minute then killed off the next, nowhere near memorable enough as a character.As for Bond knowing he's not getting off that island, by the end I was wondering when the music from EastEnders would start playing. Dragged out for what seems like an eternity, tears down the phone line, ""I never told you how much I loved you""..... 2 words - SOAP OPERA. I wanted to pull out a violin in the cinema, literally it would have got the rest of the audience more emotional with laughter. But seriously, I still can't believe actually they did it. And I'm not against Bond films taking different styles - I love Goldeneye, Casino Royale and Skyfall and they are all different.

I can also guarantee that if you watch Daniel Craig's five Bond films in order you will have felt that you've been introduced to, connected with, and said goodbye to a dynamic character as he progresses through his 00-tenure.Connery was the OG, Lazenby was the fill-in, Moore had the camp and the wit, Dalton had good writers, and Brosnan brought us the looks and the charm. The Craig era brought us an entirely different spy than his predecessors, a far more grounded take on the character, more rugged and realistic, more human-like. As a life long and avid Bond fan, I appreciated that, and I compare Craig's tenure to that of Christian Bale's in the Dark Knight Trilogy - where we experience love, tragedy, loss, and revenge with this character and the story takes more than 2.5 hours to tell in its entirety. That's never been done before with the Bond films. They've been fun, short anthologies that are interchangeable but consistently entertaining.I can definitively say it was a bold choice the writers made to conclude this storyline. There's no question in that. However, Craig was our human James Bond. A Bond that can fall in love, that can bleed and cry, that can be shot and slowed down, that can be tortured, and that can tragically die.With an heavy heart, I feel this was a truly beautiful conclusion of a storyline and I give wild acclaim to Daniel Craig and the incredibly talented supporting actors and actresses that made his films so impactful.",No Time to Die

Good cinematography follows through the rest of the movie with tight action scenes that keep you engaged.Then come the starting credits. Video was great and very bondesque but...What's up with the music score? I remember the Skyfall theme. I even remember diamonds are forever and goldeye and I haven't watched these in many years. But I cannot remember one word or one melody line of this and I watched it 3 days ago. Was there any even?I couldn't get myself to be immersed in the new 007. She felt more like a Marvel superhero or a special Ops to me and in that she could have been great. Acting or scripting issue, I am not sure, I just missed the spy context.Ana was good and really fit her role, albeit a bit goofy. Why was she only used in the club scene? Was she even needed in the movie just for that? Talk about wasted potential.Ash. Dead. Started out goofy but when he beat James and killed Felix, it was his shining moment, at that point he seemed like a legit bad guy. Ok we might be on to something with him, this might get juicy. Only to stick his head out of the window and die in the next scene. End of line for Ash. Snoke had a more involved death scene than this guy. Talk about wasted potential and a wasted opportunity to escalate Felix's death into a much more personal and meaningful fight.Blofeld and the whole of Spectre. Around since forever but dead in a heartbeat. Why? Well... the franchise has to let go of the past and go to a different direction.Felix. Dead. Why? Well... the franchise has to let go of the past and go to a different direction.What were the intentions of the bad guy, other than killing Blofeld? I never fully understood. He genetically profiled everyone. He intended to kill everyone? Did he want to kill some? Was he about to use his weapon or he would only sell it, and to whom? I liked his style but he was underdeveloped, sparingly interacting only with Lea throughout the movie. And why did he have to threaten a child to hold Bond off? A man of such means and poisonous purposes, surely must have a better and mightier way to intimidate Bond. Really who thought of that, makes the bad guy look like a joke.Bond. Since when is Bond so open with his feelings? Charm yes, swagger yes, sentimental and vulnerable yes but he got melodramatic. Also I don't think him and Lea connected as well as they were meant to. They were both good in their separate roles though.Bond, dead. Bond is the definition of the guy that gets out of trouble eventually, him and Indy. Killing this pesky flirtatious man and replacing him with a woman may be a feminist's paradise but is not what I went to the movies for. Good luck with the next 007.Bond chose the sacrifice path because of his illness stopping him from ever seeing his family. Shouldn't he have fought and hoped for a cure? Being a father wouldn't have further enforced that feeling? Isn't that what everyone would have done even in this tragic situation?No Time to Die is a movie with its share of plot holes, with tight action, good cinematography and mixed up situational writing, trying harder to kill and replace James Bond and his peers with their aspired versions than deliver a solid end to end script to the viewers. I don't know who will say the line ""Bond, James Bond"" in the future but even if you decide to resurrect him somehow, this movie has butchered the franchise.As a standalone movie? Despite the flaws, it is gripping and in the 7 range. But it is not a standalone movie. As a James Bond movie? It is a dishonor and for many, a disappointment. 4/10.",No Time to Die

Forgetting that you are in the cinema, as happens when watching a really high-quality show, will not succeed you will come true again and again; caricature decorations, predictability, long inappropriate dialogues will return.Bond's new girlfriend is quite cute, but white jeans stretched to the chest, a passion for flour and unpretentious boring looks like the only and last chance for bond not to die alone.The story is very similar to real events in the world.

In general, the entire secret organization to which the savior of everything belongs - an atavism or a rudiment - is the root of all world problems.It would be very correct once and for all to end the series with a victory of James over his colleagues who have played into the only correct gendarme of humanity with self-elimination.Once upon a time, this film was a mark of quality, a bright sign of what everyone should want to buy. A ready-made dream for those who cannot formulate it for themselves.But there were also few advertising partners, only Nokia and Tayota. Land Rover refused to pay and in revenge the offended producers turned over and smashed the brand new Defenders like a kid on the beach with an old secret.Movies about cowboys are relevant when the action takes place in the wild west, movies about knights are relevant during the Middle Ages. Bond is also, alas, not relevant today.Even Kingsman will be a more interesting and sophisticated film of the genre.New Bond must be watched! Watching a movie is a lot and different!Everybody in the cinema!",No Time to Die

Be careful how you use it as it has the potential to kill you off and end the franchise....but it is effective to tick all the Woke boxes!"".The first 30 minutes pre title had some promise but the rest was somewhat a downer.After all the delays ( read that for probable reshoots/rewrites) a slap in the face for Bond fans.He was never a family man-he was a trained assassin, a killer who took comfort where he could between and during his assignments. He didn't analyse why he did what he did-he shot up the show and his main instinct was to survive and enjoy the high life where he could.The Bond I knew of the cinema had panache, wit, style, cynicism, style and good humour-not an angst filled man reflecting on past regrets.The team involved with this series have totally deconstructed what was built up from Connery to Brosnan for me.For this generation , it might have been a great end but to me the franchise was killed by those who are trying to change it to suit what appears to be of the fashion of the moment.

1923,hanthomas-21084,"Too long, too dark",3,10 October 2021,It's overly long and just not very 'fun' in the way a James Bond movie should be. Heavy handed and dark. Not a movie that will make you leave the theater in a good mood.,No Time to Die
1924,andrewgallagher-82029,"In With The Old, Out With The New",5,18 October 2021,"No Time To Die feels like the estranged uncle, ousted at the family dinner party, as he refuses to stop quoting fictitious movie lines and connecting everything back to 'the old days'.No Time To Die is perhaps the largest departure from the modern 'Craig' Bond formula that we've seen in the past, however, ultimately it feels half-baked and goofy.It's hard to consider No Time To Die in a vacuum, so firstly let's get a few things out of the way. The film looks great, although it's no match for Roger Deakins cinematography in Skyfall, it still manages to have that clean/cohesive feel to the action. The cutting is a huge progression from the seizure inducing set-pieces in Quantum of Solace. The color is lush, the sets are lavish, and it does feel like a James Bond film, just not a modern one. The suits look debonair, the banter is quick and snappy, and overall it feels flowing.Ultimately, the main fault is in all of this. It is the final progression of the beaten and battered Craig Bond, he has the cars and the gadgets but it feels as though there is nothing left at stake. As he dances around his one-off counterpart in Cuba, dispensing headshots, and pumping lead, there is a sort of forcefield around him. The set-pieces feel fun and light, for example when he takes a shot in the middle of a gun fight, remarking a snarky quip, and then proceeding. It all feels very old-school, which is nice if you liked Roger Moore, but it doesn't fit into the characterization of the new James Bond, the Daniel Craig James Bond.What made Casino Royale so good? It wasn't entirely the sheen of a new entry, it was that for the first time the character felt grounded. You can argue, ""Well they could do that because it was an origin story,"" which would be correct, but that completely discredits the arch of Bond as a whole. For an easy explanation let's consider the staircase brawl in Casino Royale, and the high rise dual in Skyfall. As Bond grapples with two blood-thirsty militia warlords, he is tossed and thrown, beaten and battered. There is significant weight to his punches and the blows he takes, and finally when he gets the upper hand, he struggles to strangle his last opponent, panting and exerting. This is the unexperienced Bond. In Skyfall, Bond comes back from retirement (pseudo-death). He ends up in a fight with a hitman on a high-rise. The beautifully shot scene shows our guy throwing punches, countering blows, all while getting thrown through glass and narrowly escaping the barrel of the hitman's sniper. It feels real, it feels as though his life is at stake.I will stray away from spoilers, so I will not discuss the ending, which is a disaster in itself.All in all, No Time To Die feels like raised glass to the past, a buttoned-up and ironed to perfection suit for Craig to wear on his last debut. As he dawns the suit, it absolves his scars and wounds, sheathing himself in invincible super-hero power-trip, muddying the triumphs of his character development in the past. It's sad to see his character go with a whisper into the long night.",No Time to Die

The plot, while slightly interesting fell flat. Even the returning characters acted a bit sluggish and lacked any real passion.

It was a great balance between action, romance, drama, and just a touch of humor. It wrapped up Daniel Craig's movies nicely. I will miss him playing our beloved 007.",No Time to Die
1930,lorenzuela,Left after 20 mins,1,10 October 2021,"After a lovely late Sunday afternoon stroll and given all my friends had seen the movie already, I decided to go to watch it by myself.Excited to be back at the cinema after 2 year lockdown and with this movie being one of the most anticipated of the past years, I bought myself some popcorn amd gummy bears.I got in the cinema and the movie started.Already 3 min in the minute my anxiety and disgust rose to 100.The most horrific first scene left shocked and in a bad mood. A mom and daughter having a relaxing time and here comes a masked men to murder them ruthlessly.In which world do we live in where a the classic James Bond movies were about elegance and action and this movie chooses to start with the most horrid violent situation and wants for the public to be amazed and in owe ? The classic movies would have never showed how a kid almost gets killed.Having survived the first scene, I said to myself maybe this was the worst scene.I continue watching. Soon after, another 5 minutes, and having just had a rest of the disgusting violence of the first scene, some gun men enter a lab and ruthlessly murder innocent scientists without mercy.This scene reminds me very much of the Paris attacks where no mercy was shown to innocent people.After just 20 minutes in I grabbed my bag and left as soon as I could. I will not allow this horrific disgusting form of entertainment enter my mind. We already went through some really hard times with covid, the last thing is to poison my life with cheap and disgusting violence . Just because it's James Bond or a high budget production doesn't mean it's is good or we should watch it.Very sadly, previous James bond characters had charm and were charismatic.With daniel Craig every single movie to this last one shows a lonely, depressed, uncharismatic James Bond, with no charm or flare. A victim of his own tragedy and not a handsome charming ladies man who has swagger.This morbid violent movie with scenes that should not be rated family friendly and the portrayal of a sad and pathetic bond make me give this movie 1 star.I really felt bad for the children watching this movie in the Audience and I feel angry at those parents present that did not have the strength, like I did, to walk away and leave the room.I really hope the next James Bond will bring joy and fun back to the story. I don't mind action when it's done tastefully and graciously like in the fifth element or kingsman. This movie was a real disappointment.Thank god, I got home and took a bath along a nice glass of red wine and jazz. Something the classic James Bond would have done.",No Time to Die

I'm a bond fan because of my father but watching that with him, was to me, anyways worth every penny.He could feel the depth to the character and you could feel like you would actually want to be him. And not just because he's a cool spy but because he's the type of person I could look up to; a man who evolved and went onto his heroes journey.In the very beginning he cares about no one but himself ,but throughout the films and in the very end you can definitely believe his sacrifice.

1933,josephgallina-85728,SPOILERS - I FIGURED OUT WHY SOME OF US HATED IT (ANALYTICAL REVIEW).,9,11 October 2021,"BOND WASN'T KILLED. HE KILLED HIMSELF.For me to accept Bond's cinematic death, there are things I feel NEEDED to be established. This is a doctrine based on the history of cinematic deaths of major characters. In my opinion, when a cinematic death misses one of these crucial aspects, we leave disappointed. Here they are:1) A HERO'S DEATH MUST HAVE PURPOSEThis is the BIGGEST most TENABLE reason I am fundamentally disappointed with how Bond ends.The filmmakers knew they needed a purpose to Bond's death. This tenet in writing literally goes back thousands of years. It's necessary. It has to happen to provide enough psychological cushion for us to accept and appreciate the ending.In real life, people die without purpose everyday. It's the most traumatic thing EVERY human being will be FORCED to face. Instead, however, we have a higher standard for cinema because the filmmakers control our character's destiny. There is no reason to put us through witnessing the trauma of losing our heroes. It's cruel. Films offer an escape from reality, and when reality and film collide the consequences are to leave us suffering an immense emotional toll.HERE'S WHAT HAPPENEDThe filmmakers THOUGHT they satisfied this tenet.Heres what they gave us:Bond becomes infected with a nano virus that will preclude him from ever seeing the love of his life and his child ever again. If he goes near them, they will die immediately. He is also gravely(?) injured with gunshots but also is walking. He decides that he must sacrifice(?) himself to save his family, and also because without his love he has no will to live. So he takes a front row seat of some ballistic missiles and ceremoniously baptizes himself with their mercy of a swift death.WHY THE DEATH HAD NO PURPOSELets break it down.1) THE NANO PREMISEI am willing to buy into the entire convoluted, bloated, nano virus plot. Ok sure. It's big, it's Bondian. Most of Craig's films came down to earth but in his swan song we go back to the big ornate super villain with a giant plan to end the world with a super plot. I'm ok with that. The angry dude with the flowers wants to terminate millions of people for literally no reason so soon after Thanos' tired population control? Ok whatever, new ideas are at a premium.But to tie Bond's death to this overly convoluted plot cheapens it. I would have accepted it more readily if it was designed a bit more cerebrally, but we have to accept Bond's fate based on three bits of spoon fed exposition.First, Bond can't remove the nano virus from his body. ""It's in you forever.""Second, this nano bug isn't precise and it kills relatives. As a writer, the minute Q utters the nearly (then) useless words, ""well it's a good thing you didn't go near anyone related to Blofeld, you'd have killed them too,"" or something, the alarm bell rang.""Ok they wanted us to know that this spray kills relatives. Noted.""Generally with writing, the best films SHOW you important points. Weak writing TELLS you.Exposition is lazy writing. Foreshadowing can be interesting, but it should have meaning. Some examples of cinematic foreshadowing is masterful. Sometimes foreshadowing is a red herring which is also masterful. But ok, enough about the writing.Finally, in his final moments, Q confirms via radio the nano virus is ""eternal."" Strong words.2) BOND IS SHOT 91 TIMES IN THE BACKOk, the writers here raised the stakes by making him bleed. He's hurt. They give you enough time to maybe perhaps come to terms with the reality than Bond might just be too hurt to get out of this. Then he springs up and holds his shoulder in a non vital location, and he limps on, speaks, climbs a ladder, and smiles on his twisted sun deck of death.The gunshots are there for a reason.The filmmakers couldn't make you think that Bond could have easily escaped (bulls*t), so they raise the stakes. But! They also needed Bond to have a dignified swan song on his two legs and a pouty chest.These two premises collide where we are left not really believing Bond is mortally wounded. After all, he has been escaping similar fate for half a century.With no real belief that Bond is about to succumb to his wounds, we are left with no other feeling than the following:3) BOND COMMITS SUICIDEThe first thing I heard someone utter as they walked out of the theater was ""I guess Bond had to sacrifice himself?"" They looked as confused as I did.Did he?Here's basically what the filmmakers presented.Q is telling Bond he needs to get out of there. Sure he doesn't know he was shot, and yes it's an island, but it's Bond. There's not one person on Earth who wouldn't find it just as believable if Craig leaps out of the window before the missiles fall and swims to some miraculous safety. In fact, we are EXPECTING that.Instead, Bond gives in to his fate and ends it.For that to be a ""SACRIFICE,"" Bond needs to be sacrificing something. That is the act of giving something up for the sake of something else. Otherwise he is just OFFING HIMSELF.The only logical sacrifice is that he is killing himself to remove the temptation of his wife and daughter from the desire to see him, that would put themselves in harms way. He also perhaps thinks that a Swift death and grief would be better for them than to have him alive somewhere on the opposite side of the world. BOND literally decided he'd rather DIE than watch his daughter grow up through FaceTime and Zoom.That's a weak sacrifice.Not to mention, he had potentially years, DECADES for some cure of the nanos to be developed at some distant time. His death was an answer to a problem they really didn't convince me existed with two lines of quick dialogue.4) BOND'S DEATH LACKED MEANINGWithout adequate purpose (that he absolutely needed to die), there could be no meaning.Bond is a modern mythology. Ingrained in his intrigue is a social contract he has with the audience: that no matter how bad his situation looks, no matter how untenable; dangerous; hopeless, Bond will not only survive, but get the girl, and save the world. The historic Greek's, through Latin, called it Deus ex Machina. The idea that just when the situation reaches its peak impossibility, the hands of fate will reach in and present glorious salvation. For 007, sometimes it's the right gadget and exactly the right time. Sometimes it's an ally with a gun just out of frame before revealing herself.Obviously for a hero to die, this contract between the character and the unseen hands of ""God,"" or his writers, must end.But Bond's ""end"" was too unceremonious to signify the machinations of what kept him alive all these years was through with its purpose.What makes Deus ex Machina work and the concept that is ingrained in nearly every one of our big modern mythological heroes (Bond, Indiana Jones, Star Wars) is an almost supernatural protection of our heroes. They are agents of GOOD, and as such, the very universe keeps them alive so they can carry out their purpose.I could have bought Bond's death. I could have understood that with the death of the last big baddie in the world, Bond outlived his need for supernatural protection. The Gods pack it up and he's on his own.But there's just something so merciless to have Bond abandoned so dramatically by his savior's hands with no reward. Sure he gets to smile and think about his daughter and love living out the rest of their days with all the time in the world, but that would have happened anyway - whether he lived or died, as long as he stayed away from them. That isn't a reward. It's a punishment.5) BOND WAS PUNISHED, BUT WHY?Bond's death is ultimately a punishment for his character. He LOSES.Bond ""winning"" would be the enjoyment of his last days in the happiness of his loved ones. Instead, he is left with the realization that Blofeld STOLE his happiness for half a decade, separating him from all he cared about in the world, only to have to lose it again.It's not an ending that befits a ""Knight of Good.""Bond doesn't deserve punishment. He doesn't need to atone. Yes he's a killer, but for half a century, he has used awful means to serve a greater purpose. Yes there has been collateral damage and friends have died, but not one of them died without serving the greater good.HOW BOND'S DEATH COULD AND SHOULD HAVE HAPPENEDBond could have died on screen and it could have been tragic but so glorious that we would leave feeling like our hero was given a fitting end. Something to hang our hat on knowing it exists in the world. Why do I know that? Because it has been done: Tony Stark, Neo, Han Solo, Bruce Willis in Armageddon. Each of those deaths left us with extraordinary peace in knowing the world was saved not INSPITE of their death but BECAUSE of it.Bond should have died AS THE ARCHITECT of salvation, not a passive spectator. He should have turned the key that blew up the facility.But maybe I'm lying to myself. Maybe I just didn't want our hero to die at all. Maybe I just wanted the hands of fate to reach in one last time, but this time, let him survive to serve his OWN purpose, and not just theirs.Because Bond has no time to die.",No Time to Die

The first part of the film picks up where the darkness of Spectre left off and the first sequences are well done, especially Italy. Then to Jamaica where he meets the current 007, who seemed like an unlikely secret agent. The next scene in Cuba was very good with Ana as a new agent who had far more charisma than the 007 girl. The ship scene was not very original. Soon we get a short bit with Blofeld, then enters Rami Malek, whose accent is very hard to understand. Not sure about him as a villain, either. The scenes on the island were fairly good at first, then became more emotional toward the end. A lot of the plot line was confusing and the general tone was as dark as Spectre, along with broody and plodding. Personally, I've never cared much for Craig as Bond, so I won't be sorry if this really is his last time. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan were my preference. It will be interesting to see who's next, plus a new director, too, I hope. We also need a plot that does not involve DNA, bio or chem weapons that remind us of COVID.",No Time to Die

I've also read every Fleming novel as well as more than a half dozen or so Bond novels by other author's and another dozen books & video's on the making & history of the films.

This is Craig's most traditional Bond movie ! The scenery, locations, music & sets have not been this good since the Connery/Lazenby days........The potential world destruction & DNA selection chemical dioxin poison feels like a plot line from a Fleming novel, The Island base was the best & coolest setting since the magnificent sets designed by Ken Adam who for me was as important to early James Bond films as Sean Connery & John Barry ! These were the elements that made the original early James Bond films stand out from anything out at the time. Something I've missed for many years...I will agree there is drama & sensitivity that was not in the earlier films at least not to the level of No Time To Die but its presence in this film does not take anything away from all the great things in this film.I loved the titles opening an homage to Dr. No we see vibrating round colored dots appear !I like that Bond was in retirement which made his aging more acceptable.

His version of Bond imo is better than his predecessor, he fights harder, faster, and cooler. The stories are also better and more realistic.If you feel Daniel Craig is aging a lot, yes, he is. But it fits well with the time frame and the story of a pension Bond. I love Bond and Madeleine's great affection toward each other which conveyed strongly through their acting. The casts are fantastic, everybody plays their respective part outstandingly. I was astonished of the efforts that Rami Malek puts in his character, Lyutsifer Safin. Every word that comes out from him feels heavy and pressing. I guess the lack in writing makes him a less villain despite his great performance.Ana de Armas herself shines bright like a diamond as one of Bond girls. I guess no guy will turn his head away when she presents. I like the way they put her in a brief spotlight without affecting the story of Bond and Madeleine.For this last instalment of Craig's Bond: No Time to Die, it closes the curtains with a great closure. I never thought a Bond film can hit me that hard, I was in tears. It ends with a great quote:""The proper function of man is to live, not to exist.

It was no longer about James Bond, the hero, bachelor spy we've loved for 40 years. It's more about, an old, tired spy that's loved up, even though they don't really click on screen. The action was just action and no thrill. The one liners were few and far between and fell flat, and then the ending. Well its safe to say, that will be the last Bond I see.

1950,rwall-15147,Daniel Craig or Bonds last movie?,5,13 October 2021,"There are far too many ""10"" and ""1"" star reviews out there. This is in no way a 1 star movie, the production value alone starts this movie off at at least a 4. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. Unfortunately, in their attempt to make this movie stand out from the other Bond movies, made some of the worst choices they could have ever made.Almost everything in this movie, in my opinion fails.The opening theme song is horribleThe action scenes are too few and lack action, making this one of the slower moving bond filmsThe villain has little to no backstory and is very weak, and not just in a physical senseI felt the story was horrible. Another post picked apart this movie and actually provided some way better choices that could have been made to improve the movie.To me, this definitely ranks as one of the worst bond movies ever made. Granted I grew up watching Roger Moore, who just seemed to have more fun in the role.Daniel Craig has openly admitted that this was his last Bond film, but this movie makes me wonder if they were also trying to end the franchise as well. Can they make another Bond movie? Yes... Unfortunately, in order to preserve the essence of Bond/007, they had better come up with some creative writing to derail the incredibly poor choices that were made with the direction this movie took, as it will take a miracle to get this franchise back on track.I suppose if I were to make another bond movie here's what I'd do: Go back to basics, start an origin story before James even became 007, make sure to include a training sequence (I love those).

It is a truly fitting end to Daniel Craig's time as James Bond. Witty, action packed and more emotional than any film in the Bond cannon since On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which it echoes throughout.The choice of music is perfect from the title song, to the score and the music over the closing credits which is without doubt the greatest Bond song of all time!See it in a big screen as Bond is definitely back and going out with a bang.Addition:
Since originally writing this review I have seen so many 1 star reviews and cannot understand why. The ending is fitting in so many ways, it is set up in Casino Royale, it is inevitable.""Well, I understand 00s have a very short life expectancy... so your mistake will be short-lived.""It is the only ending there could be. All those bemoaning the ending, think about it. How did you want it to end? Bond in a retirement home?M quotes a line from Jack London at the end of the film that for me sums it all up, in full it goes:""I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, ever atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.""Those who give the film 1 star due to Bond's death do not understand the point bring made.Anyone who thinks they have all the time in the world is in for a disappointment! Everything must come to an end sometime!Whilst it does have a long run time, I never looked at my watch and it was over before I knew it. Yes, of course it could have been tighter, but the film never feels too slow or worse, rushed like Quantum of Solace.I have been a huge fan of Bond films for 45 years and found the ending emotional and sat in silence as the film ended, not because it was rubbish, but because I needed to take it in. The last line is perfect!!No Time to Die is a deeply satisfying film and ending. Anyone giving this film 1 star is not a Bond fan or even a film fan for that matter. In fact, those giving this film 1 star insult the many talented people who made this film.James Bond will return, as it states at the end and whoever takes over will start their own journey. This was Craig's Bond and it had a beginning, a middle and an end... and what an end!Ignore the 1 star reviews and watch the film and make your own mind up.",No Time to Die
1958,bdgolfer-16281,"Ditching the Bond formula, almost worked",7,15 October 2021,"First off, this movie wasn't bad. As a die hard Bond fan, I try to evaluate the individual movies elements and then as a whole.Acting: Daniel Craig has arguably his best acting performance as James Bond, and he certainly wanted to go out on a high note. With the exception of Ana de Armas, who easily stole all of her brief time on screen, all of the other characters are shadowed by Bond. Rami Malek's character was well acted, but his story and lines were so poorly written that he is a forgettable foe, and not fitting for Craig's last outing.Visuals: This is where the movie excels in my opinion. The locations tie wonderfully to the classic Bond movies, in that it feels both familiar and new simultaneously. For those familiar with classic Bond, the sets will encourage re-watching the films the locations were based on. The fight scenes are well directed and impressive.Audio: Excellent music, no complaints. Love the ties to previous movies.Story: Unfortunately, this is the primary flaw in this movie. It is apparent that the writers were being influenced by too many parties, and explains why the original director left the movie. The filmmakers felt the need to tie up all of the potential loose ends, and gave unceremoniously deaths to Felix, Blofeld and all of Spectre. While I do not like the Spectre organization as a plotline, it is difficult to see the ""villain's"" from the last several movies being killed off easily and quickly. The villain also wasn't given enough time to explain why they want to kill off a portion of the planet, and writing of their motives are just kind of lazy. Also, killing Bond at the end was used to prevent Craig from being brought back and allowing the studio to start fresh. This felt like they broke a cardinal rule just to emphasize how important Craig and Bond's 25th adventure were supposed to be.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The biggest issue I have with Craig's bond films is that they are somehow supposed to be sequential and viewed as a whole. All of the previous Bond movies were standalone missions, to be viewed in whatever order the audience chose. The first 3/4's of the movie were extremely entertaining and fast paced, but once the villain was introduced it just felt lazy. Though it was nearly 3 hours long, much of the ""tying up"" felt rushed. There are enough Easter eggs to appease the die hard fans, while still being able to appeal to casual viewers. In my top ten of Bond films, but barely.",No Time to Die

The new 007 acting was mediocre to say the least, there were no appeal to her, there was no chemistry and most importantly there was no cause to explore future offerings.After so many years of watching, inclusion of James Bond in our cultural presence, and the sense of anticipation, I will not watch anymore.They could have given her an alternative/parallel storyline and made a new franchise if she is that bankable.

1975,nqmhb,Good way to end the saga,8,21 October 2021,"This is my first time writing a review and I feel that this movie deserves it. Especially after reading some of the other reviews from people who don't understand how a character should evolve from 1967.The movie starts in the typically James Bond style of an action packed scene leading into a brilliant main theme song and your gripped from the very start. It's worth pointing out at this moment that you do need to watch the previous films to understand the details in this one (especially Spectre).The plot flows nicely and there is always something happening. It's feels like 007 but on a larger scale. Gone are the days of missions with hardly any drama, cheesy lines and ridiculous gadgets.Daniel Craig carries on with his portrayal of a more aggressive style of Bond and really shows the pain that the character is going through throughout this movie. The supporting cast play their roles to perfection and you can really see that this film was made to be a swan song for Craig.It is not all positive though, I'm afraid as there are a few points that I feel could have been addressed throughout. The first of which being Rami's antagonist character who you only really briefly see. You understand by the end of the movie that he is a very bad man but you don't despise the guy as you don't get shown much of him. I feel as though the ending would have been even more dramatic if we got to see how truly demonic the man is.The ending also seemed rushed and looked as though they just wanted to get the filming over with at that point, but on the other hand I understand that this was filmed in a global pandemic and the ending still made sense.Overall I'd say you should definitely see this movie especially if you have watched the other bonds as it really does tie up the loose ends and gives a thrilling and dramatic end to the best Bond we've probably ever seen.",No Time to Die

The action, scenes, and atmosphere were great! I will be stuck in that forest, where Bond was fighting for his life and the life of his family, for a long time! I felt the fear of Valdo when thrown in the elevator, or the excitement of Paloma during the mission, Nomi could have used more power moments but overall the character was treated fairly!And that shows with how the characters around Bond finally got some gravitas! They each finally felt like having a life outside of being Bond's sidelings, and values and goals! Which is great compared to the other titles of the Craig era. And no I am not talking about that one scene only activists care about.That and we finally got some villains worthy of the mantle. Cyclops went for the throat whenever he could and was a presence during the whole film! Valdo was hilarious and had a great character for a villain! Safin got slowly but surely into the shoes of a classic Bond villain, and did so with a touch, if only a slight one. If Logan got a little more screen and weight everything would have been excellent on that department!But overall, a good and solid Bond to say bye to the Craig era, I was never sold on Craig as James Bond, but this is the movie that made me reconsider!",No Time to Die

I was disappointment during the whole movie because this new bonds are off the track due to the old fashion bond with Connery, Moore, and maybe Brosnan.There is no Jaws, OddJob, Nick Nack... In all Daniel Craig Bond movies we see depression and imagined in his own world with sadness. And, somehow people are pitying him and eventually at the end he is a tortured hero.Why all new movies went so differently than the old fashion Bonds ?

1990,sjxjfbfrrm,James Bond is no longer special...,5,25 October 2021,"While the movie is definitely not bad. There are some major flaws.The problem with the feminist / female empowerement undertone within movies these days is that it seems to unintentionally weaken the structure of the hero stories.Whilst the script is desperate to balance its wokeness without overstepping - as was the case with the light hearted back and forths about the 007 designation between the new female agent and Bond.It didn't really balance the events depicted on screen.And as you can imagine, a picture says more than a 1000 words.It's not so much the fact that the other 00-agents were female, it's how these characters frame the main protagenist and hero: James Bond.For example, the nervous female agent - who was a delight on screen and actually a highlight in the film - said she had only 3 weeks of training and then started to kick ass like she was a John Wick stand-in or at the very least ""as capable as James Bond"".The same with the black female agent who had taken the 007 designation after Bond had retired.She was shown to be extremely capable, stylish and even cruising in the iconic Aston Martin, which had been a classic trait for Bond.If you were to imagine these characters switched from being female to male, perhaps the problem with how it frames James Bond becomes more apparent.It makes Bond less special and unique, he even felt common place.Why?There are plenty of other agents who are just as capable - some even had little to no training. They are stylish, given the cool gadgets and cars, just like Bond was before.And that is where this movie utterly fails.When you take away things that make the hero unique - he feels common place and easily replaced i.e. No longer the hero.You make the whole ""we need Bond for this"" narrative feel a bit forced.And it leaves the audience to wonder: was that really necessary?Did we really need two other agents to show how equal they were to Bond in this franchise?When you think about Bond it used to come down to the phrase:Men want to be him and women want to be with him.The completely fictional and over the top hero.The movie wasn't bad, and they definitely succeeded in changing the Bond narrative.It just wasn't that good of a 'lone hero' movie because of the way they proceeded to portray him this time around.",No Time to Die

He is not a man of 2021, he is man of an unspecified time. No Time to Die is a betrayal of the Bond character. It is a slap in the face to all the loyal, lifelong Bond fans. The Bond producers have left Bond with nowhere now to go. Nothing can repair the ending of this calamity. Overall, the film was stale, too long, unimaginative ... but could have held together if Bond flew away at the end to live to fight and win another day. You don't kill James Bond. That is like having a Charlie Brown and Snoopy movie where Charlie Brown is a teenager with issues. Some things are just not done! You don't kill James Bond!!

2012,doug_coleman,"The Bond film that will divide opinion for years to come, but, poignant, somewhat haunting and yet undeniably brilliant",10,2 October 2021,"I sat pensively at the end of this film, trying to find ways to hate the film based on the conclusion.A die hard Bond fan, something I was raised on since the early 80's, seeing every film time and time again,the ending momentarily threatened to rip apart my love for the franchise, until I remembered:The last thing I saw on the screen was:'James Bond Will Return'Approach this film separately to anything Pre-Daniel Craig, this is a 5 film Bond Series, with a start middle and an end - for once.Which brought me back to my senses and reflecting on 163 minutes of masterful filmmaking.There will be a lot of reviews here baselessy rating 1 or 2 stars because they didn't like the ending.Truthfully, the producers have been brave and bold with this film, going to places no other Bond film has been to, ever.Breaking it down, it's well paced, nostalgic, brave, poignant, powerful, dark at times and emotional - and yet still action packed Bond when it needed to be with a few dashes of Connery-esque humour.Is it a typical Bond movie? No. But that is what sets it apart, the producers have crossed boundaries into new territories with the film (although elements of these are in the Fleming Novels, I'll come to this later.)The opening sequence is different, very different, in terms of the usual expectation, action sandwiched between two slices of drama for the first 23 mins, but - it worked, all beautifully filmed across Norway and Matera, Italy.The titles, felt dark, and moody but again it sets the scene for what is to come.The first sequence after the titles, reminded me slightly of Goldeneye's post credits sequence.Jamaica and Cuba scenes were once again well shot, the pace never lagged for me, Ana De Armas made a huge impact, as did Lashana Lynch, stong female performances gave the film a different feel to usual, but in a good way - again a different perspective, a changing world that Bond is adapting to - but to say it's 'Woke', is going too far. Respectful and more modern in comparison to some of the attitudes presented in the films of yesteryear, yes, but woke, no.Craig performs with his heart and soul, as good a performance as Casino Royale, showing true range as a tired, broken, and ultimately a nothing to lose Bond.Malek's performance I have seen dividing opinion.He's no Bardem, but he's still good. His almost frail, creepy, psycho persona is enough to get under your skin, he's a villain hiding behind an army of henchmen, Physically no match for Bond but mentally, you can see where they were trying to go here.Lea Seydoux, improves and develops on her character from SPECTRE, Christoph Waltz's small cameo here was perhaps my one disappointment, I'd have liked him to play a bigger part, and it's always nice to see Jeffery Wright return as Leiter - in this case again for a small but significant part.The use of the Aston Martin V8 from The Living Daylights was a nice touch, the references in the paintings on walls in MI6 of the M's of the past and there were a few other nods including one I can relate to For Your Eyes Only - see if you can spot it, think Locque in the car on the cliff.The biggest nods are to OHMSS, including the wonderfully OHMSS infused score by Hans Zimmer and the closing scene and end credits going out to Louis Armstrong's 'We have all the time in the world'.If you've not read the novels, there are two things relevant here to this movie relating to the novel of You Only Live Twice.1. The poison garden. Which in the novel belonged to Shatterhand, but - in this case it's been rewritten to suit Malek's Safin character, I enjoyed this reference at least finally being used in a Bond film.2. Bond finds out he has a son in YOLT, in this case a daughter with Madeleine - it has it's comic moments that are well timed, but also you see that it changes Bond's world.There is a lot to absorb and I've not covered everything in the slightest but I guess the biggest talking point has been the ending.Without spoiling things too much, for me it worked in this film (Despite my initial opposition), Bond goes out his way, could he have saved himself? Possibly. But what kind of life would he have had left for himself?He saves the world, saves his family - real hero stuff.It would take a lot of explaining if they tried to continue this arc given this ending, almost impossible - but then we've seen stranger things.It's not the end, it just ushers in a new beginning.As I mentioned, James Bond Will Return, the key final words on the screen, the question is when and how - reboot? Continuation? We shall see.Craig has given the franchise 15 years of his best work, now time to pass the torch.Go and see this, enjoy, embrace and shed a tear, it's masterful, emotional and action packed, it's a real, it's different but it's still Bond, James Bond.",No Time to Die

The complete history of the franchise has been wiped out and to kill all of the history, kills the identity of what makes Bond, James Bond. Yes, it's really that bad and they've completely destroyed Bond as we know him.A franchise with a rich, beautiful history brought to its knees by a director who clearly did not watch any of the 24 previous films or read any of the books and did not care or have any respect about the franchise history. Nothing about this film felt like Bond. The characters you once loved and knew are all gone, reduced to vague, watered-down caricatures of their former selves.Growing up watching the Bond classics, I can only say that Ian Fleming is turning in his grave at this sad moment in time. Fortunate for him he passed on prior to the release of this cinematic disaster.Cary Joji Fukunaga hopefully the next thing you will direct is traffic. I can't believe that the so called guardians of the franchise Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson allowed this to be filmed.A 2 hour and 45-minute torture session for any James Bond fan.

-the introduction;
-beautifully shot and good locations;
-good acting from Craig;
-amazing scene from Bond and Paloma in Cuba;The many bad parts:
-the bad guy is not developed at all, we don't know what he wants, why he does everything, why his obsession with Bond, etc. And he also has very few lines, and really terrible ones, especially with the kid;
-disastrous plot : nothing makes sense, especially towards the end - why does Safin let the girl go out of nowhere, why doesn't he leave the island, where was he while Bond was killing everybody, only to appear right at the end. What are all the minions in hazmat suits in the water, and lots of unanswered questions like this. What is the dangerous plan of Safin (no exact explanations, some few dots on a Europe map and some big numbers on a screen, that's it.-terrible ending, with Bond dying.... no comment here, lots of people already made clear that Bond shouldnt die.-pointless ""woke"" lines : Q is gay apparently, and we know that for no reason whatsoever, probably just to tick some quota, Bond cooking for the kid, and many other gestures;
-too much melodrama, too many love statements etc. Just not the right place in a Bond movie, to waste 30-45 mins on this type of scenes.-too much follow up from previous films. I had to explain my wife half the film.All in all, bad film, but good entertainment.Considering Covid and the quality of recent Holywood films, I consider my money well spent.Just not your usual Bond film.",No Time to Die

2033,dave_deluxeedition,Awful,1,1 October 2021,"It pains me to say this because I wanted to love it, I even told myself ""it wasn't that bad"" while leaving the cinema but I've had time to sit with it and it's just awful, the usual exciting opening is replaced with a melodrama and it just falls flat. I was fairly excited to see the reveal of a female 007 rather than just making a reboot and calling her Debra Bond or something, this made much more sense to me but it honestly just felt flat & shoehorned in for political reasons, the character is extremely unlikable and comes off as entitled and arrogant although later in the film she does show mutual respect to Bond and hands over the 007 title back to Bond but even that feels somewhat forced, it just feels messy, like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Ana adds a little comic relief but isn't in the film enough, there's a really awkward moment where Bond kinda flirts with her & she acts almost scared and backs off which was super awkward and didn't really need to be in the film.The villain didn't feel like a serious threat and his demise was lacklustre, it just felt like the characters didn't really matter, including Bond!.With all that aside the film itself is just boring, I kept waiting for something big to happen and it just didn't come.WARNING MAJOR SPOILERSAs for the ending, for Bond to die in such a way? After everything the character has been through he dies like this? He's been in way worse predicaments. Usually I would understand the ""I've got nothing to live for now I can't be with my loved ones"" but this is Bond, he's programmed differently to your average human.This is probably just my personal take away and feelings but Bond dying just ruins it for me, it's supposed to be pure escapism where the hero of the piece walks away to fight another day, it also kinda takes away from the more ridiculous stuff Bond has walked away from.All in all it is a boring, political mess.",No Time to Die

The historically stuck individuals should have recognised the subtle nods to past films. Linking through to epic set pieces and a few surprises along the way.It isn't a James Bond of the past.

There are ways to demonstrate you are an ally without shoving it in peoples' faces and this movie got it all wrong.I feel for some of the actors who must've felt they were filling some sort of quota rather than having the role on merit.In terms of the villains, who are often the most interesting characters in the franchise, Christopher Waltz still steals the show. Rami Malek is Rami Malek with makeup and doesn't really stray too far away from the awkward weirdo we've come to know in Mr Robot and Papillon.They had an extra year to get this right and with a budget of £180m I feel they could've done better.

There may be a few too many characters in the movie which means that Rami malek's role is a tad watered down, to the point that when he appeared later on in the movie I thought, ""Oh yeah, I'd forgotten about him..."" so as a villain its a bit light.In this movie Bond is a more grateful, reflective, emotive character which I believe matches the age of Craig's Bond.The action is perfectly spaced out and is extremely well choreographed and shot. Theres a beautiful sound track that borrows themes from other bond films, and gave me shivers at one point.For me, it isn't as good as Casino Royal, but perhaps a tie in second place with Skyfall.Finally, because Daniel Craig has been my very favourite Bond, I also felt so saddened as the end credits rolled, that all three of us are now on prozac!!",No Time to Die

For me personally, it feels more bittersweet.The film isn't perfect and has its ups and downs but overall I enjoyed it.I did fear a little that the movie would be over run by the ""woke culture"" but it wasn't over used and was fine.I would say the main villain wasn't in it enough though.PS. I don't fully understand why people are so unhappy he didn't live. (like all the other movies) He got infected so he couldn't make contact with Madeleine or his Daughter, he's lived a troubled life and was on the brink of happiness and he couldn't grasp it in the end, surely it was easier to not survive? Q made Bond aware that once the infection got in the body it doesn't come out, if they need to make the film longer just for the ""5 years later"" we found a cure scene it would be too typical.

2061,djchucky-207-6073,Please please do not listen to the bad reviews .,9,3 October 2021,"Easily the best bond film ever made...Been a massive 007 fan since I can remember, the Daniel Craig era has been for me the best overall sequence of films in the franchise. Sure some are clearly better than others (sky fall, casino royal). However the overall run of his tenure as 007 has produced the best features thus far.I can't help feeling so many of the negative reviews on this film are political. The last 30/40 minutes or so are for me the best cinema I have seen in years. Never thought a 007 film would have people so far on the edge of their seats to having tears in their eyes within minutes.Just to be completely impartial only reason the film doesn't get a perfect 10 for me is -1. Main bad guys reason for destruction of the world is pretty lost within the action. Sure every bond film had a vilan trying to kill everyone for some reason, but this one is slightly vanilla.2. Around the hour mark a character answers a telephone, the camera cuts to another angle to show the call is secretive. You see him pick up the telephone in first angle then again in second angle. (18 months of delays Surley editing crew pick this up).3. Lashana Lynch performance is a bit iffy, in no way believable as bonds replacement as 007 and just feels mis placed through the full film. Naomi Harris much better acted this role in Skyfall and specture. Ana De Armas short role in this film also much better performed and should have had a more leading role.Other than that perfect, the action shots the best you will ever had, and the best send off a bond actor has had.",No Time to Die

However, after this film, I am not sure that even a reboot can revive this legacy series. True Bond fans must have been quite disappointed after this movie.I left the cinema with a bad taste in the mouth, what I had watched just did not feel right. In contradiction with other ""classic"" Bond films, I cannot watch this a second time. There are good and worse Bond films and for me Craig's best was Casino Royale. But this one is in the middle or lower. What works only is that we know Daniel Craig was James Bond in the previous 4 films. The main problem were not the actors but the story and script.The story had no adventure, fun and interesting villain like the Bond movies used to have. The recipe worked well in the past whenever Bond had a separate mission. What the writers have done in Craig's era combining the stories between films did not work. I find this 5th rather useless, just a way to say goodbye to Daniel Craig. It did not add something meaningful to the series. I expected to see a film better than Spectre. But no, despite the long viewing time, the money spent and the talented actors, the script once again was not good.The chemistry between Bond and Madeleine did not work as it did with Vesper. I liked Paloma and I expected to see her more in the movie but that did not happen. I did not like the character of Nomi, I kept asking myself why they repeat in the script that 007 is only a number... What was the point of these ""jokes"" about the number? I think 007 is not just a number. It was THE number in the essence of the series so far. We know 00 means a license to kill and 007 is our beloved character, the secret agent who is maybe special or better than other 00 agents. Yes, it happens that 007 is named James Bond. But the number is known to anyone already. There are no substitutes. We know that from all previous films. 007 is an agent who carries out the mission in the end and never quits even if his life is threatened on the way. James Bond uses wit but can also kill cold blood. Bond is not a character like Rambo killing all the bad guys on his way for revenge. He gets hurt, he makes mistakes, he is not sure if he can make it but eventually, somehow, he managed to survive and leave the audience with a happy nice feeling.In this film, there is no real fun. It is melodrama all the way. The plot is weak. I did not understand why the bad guy was doing all this. Nothing in the story was truly believable. Why to try to combine all the Craig films once again and come to this ugly finale? Just to say goodbye to Craig? Why to say also goodbye to the character (!)? How is James Bond supposed to return after this even with another actor. It will not be believable anymore. There was no need to end it this way. Didn't anybody think deeper what they have done? This has been a series of films for the last 60 years!Personally, I think that this was not a good Bond film and that it was also not pure entertainment; may be most Bond fans will agree. I would rate it 6 out of 10 if not lower than that. Please return to the classic Bond recipe with a modern view and do not try to imitate other characters.

2082,vadim_arventiev,I fell asleep watching,4,9 November 2021,"I normaly go to sleep around 2-3 AM on a regular basis. The COVID made me like this, with the full time remote working. I don't have to wake up too early to prepare for the office and the ride there. I asume I chose to profit from this and live more. I yook my time to play the movie, around 7 PM. First time in almost 2 years when i fell asleep at 9 PM. Huge disapointment for a 007 movie. I don' t know who was this version of Bond. It started with a bang and that was it. My wife told me how it ended the next day.A very predictable movie with most action elements borrowed from the other chapters.I laughed my ass off when they broke into the secret MI6 lab: really, no security? I guess even Wuhan had some security peraonel there. And the scene where. And the talk with Blofeld, what was that? All the talk I was looking at Daniels hand, which by the way he moved is so much in his childish questions and display of emotions... How is he going to touch him? Scratch his chin, slap him, pat on the back. The whole pointless dialoge was to make Bond break and strangle himThe story made Bond so weak and almost stupid, you could feel how everyone around him was smarter and he had no control over anything. He didn't made a connection about Mathilde. And tons of more things to say.Why did he had to die? Could he just turn into a protective father for Mathilde, maybe start a new 007 saga with a female character, who is ""accidentaly"" his daughter and also trained by him, just saying. I'm writing all this not seing the death scene yet. Whenever I have 30 minutes I'll watch the end of the movie.Lately it's like every good thing that is out there, in TV world, keeping you entertained for 10-15 years is meant to be ruined in the end.Thank you for reading!",No Time to Die
2083,jhoexp-366-899262,00-0,1,6 October 2021,"The worst Bond movie of them all. Just a good starting scene at Matera and then 2 hours of nonsense. No plot, no story, no joy. Double 0 - 0. Avoid at all cost.",No Time to Die
2084,donnald0-373-72013,I'm going to pretend this film never happened,4,6 October 2021,"SPOILER ALERT BELOW.I think I'd summarise this as: a film not for Bond fans. It's more of a weird drama that doesn't make a lot of sense. It has some random action sequences and a bunch of characters you care very, very little about about.You're forced to buy into an unconvincing relationship in-order for the terrible ending to make some degree of sense. But for me, the ending is a desperate attention-seeking attempt to make history in the Bond franchise. 'I love you so much I'll stand here and get blown up by missiles'. That's not Bond. Bond would doubt whether he had been poisoned. Bond would work with Q to reverse it. Crazy reason to commit suicide.I won't say what everyone else has but the villain was poor. Not the actor but the script. When he just let the child go after building it up to be a big thing I actually laughed out loud.Overall it's a very mediocre action-drama that left a skid-mark on the Bond franchise. The directors and producers crossed a line that should not be crossed. Bond is the one guy you can rely on to save the day and allow you to escape for a whil...oh wait, he's just committed suicide.",No Time to Die
2085,manu1999,A Bond movie made for true fans of the series,9,13 October 2021,"Let me start by saying this: I've been a fan of the James Bond franchise since i first saw Goldfinger as a 7 year old, i've watched every movie in the series at least 10-15 times. I have now seen No Time To Die 2 times, and consider it one of the best in the franchise.This movie is a love letter to any true Bond fans, who will instantly recognise references to Dr. No, You Only Live Twice as well as On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Particularly OHMSS has had a major influence on this film, an example of this is through the use of John Barry and Louis Armstrong's theme «We have all the time in the world». Like OHMSS, No Time To Die is also a very emotional movie and that is due to how the writers chose to focus on the relationship between Bond and Madeleine. In Spectre their relationship felt rushed and was not given enough time to really develop naturally. In this movie their relationship takes centre stage, just like the one between Bond and Tracy in OHMSS, and is part of the reason why the ending of this movie was extremely emotional and sad.Featuring Fukunaga's excellent direction as well as Linus Sandgren's mesmerising cinematography this really is a gorgeous Bond movie. Some of the shots in this movie is truly breathtaking, in particular the scenes from Matera. The film features heart pounding action scenes, my favorites were easily the car chase in Matera as well as the stairwell fight in the silo. The acting performances are all excellent, in particular from Seydoux and Craig. I would further argue that Craig's final portrayal of Bond in No Time To Die is his finest.Would I consider this a flawless Bond movie? No, most of the problems that I have with the movie is related to Rami Malek's Safin, who I found to be a very underused villain and I found his motivations towards the latter half of the movie confusing. As a result of this i did not find him too memorable, despite the fact that he was pretty creepy. Furthermore I would have loved to have seen more of Ana De Armas' Paloma as she was a really entertaining characterThis movie does contain all the elements of a classic Bond film (cool cars, exotic locations, exhilarating action set pieces), yet it also tries to distinguish itself by moving into unfamiliar territory, namely by introducing Mathilde as Bond's daughter and killing off Bond himself. I do see how such major decisions would result in mixed reactions, but I think it's fair to say that Daniel Craig's Bond movies have never been traditional in the sense that they've never truly followed the classic Bond formula. Nevertheless I think that the bold narrative decisions did pay off due to excellent writing and that No Time To Die is an extremely satisfying, albeit heart wrenching ending to Daniel Craigs tenure as James Bond.",No Time to Die
2086,tkbrockall,Excellent Bond film - don't be led by some of the reviews,10,4 October 2021,"This is a 21st century, very human Bond & well worth the wait! If you were after a Connery or a Moore film then dig out the VHS.",No Time to Die
2087,MovieFanaticDil,"Honest Review! ✅- Superb Action, Score, Cinematography! Good/Okay Story. Not a classic Bond.",8,6 October 2021,"NON-SPOILER I am reviewing this movie as someone in their mid-20's who has watched previous Bond films but had never carried a sentimental value of the franchise forward.If you love tense, amazingly choreographed action sequences, great cinematography and score then this movie is an absolute gem! The nearly three hours goes by quick, albeit it with some short moments in the middle that drag a little bit as a whole this is one action-packed pleaser. The score by Hanz Zimmer as great with some very tense buildups that work well.HOWEVER, if you go into this movie carrying sentimental baggage of the franchise and hopes it's a ""classic Bond movie"" then I can understand if you do come out a little disappointed. This film is less like a classic bond and more like a Tom Cruise Mission Impossible style movie with the foundations of what makes Bond, Bond.Nevertheless, it's definitely worth a watch and In All honesty I'm very confused to see a lot of 1-4 star reviews here! A lot of of the reviews really do not make a lot of sense to me. It's not a 10/10 movie, but DEFINITELY not a 3/10. I give this a solid 8 😊. A really good modern take!",No Time to Die
2088,of-398-800817,A lot of hate but I thought it was great,9,1 October 2021,"A lot of the things people are slating here are what made this film so enjoyable for me.It wasn't just another mission across the world where Bond beds gorgeous women. It had heat and heart and made me feel something because it developed characters and gave them proper arcs. Great pace, excellent action and strong performances all round! Some people are very hard to please. I thought it was the best Bond in years!",No Time to Die
2089,MarioBeky_psychologist,Psychologist's review - Bond movie that failed,1,1 October 2021,"As many of those who are making a review for a movie, this is my first one. I am a movie fan and most definitely a big Bond fan. However, but not with this movie. I'm also a psychologist and always was a target for a laugh by my colleagues for liking Bond movies because these were not artsy enough. So, this will be a different kind of a review.First of all, let me tell you that Daniel Craig is wonderful actor as well as the group of actors that starred along in Bond movies of his era. Casino Royale was beautifully scripted and filled with wonderful cinematography.Skyfall had lot of great references to old movies and so much needed end of Judi Dench as M. Since Pierce Brosnan's Golden Eye, her introduction brought color to the franchise and made all things interesting. Characters evolved naturally and were well interconnected as the franchise progressed towards the last Bond movie.I'm sure that I will speak on behalf of many of Bond fans. Not of kids who are feed with Marvel movies, but true Bond fans who started with Sean's Dr. No, went through Goldfinger, On her majesty secret service and skied with Bogner, a traveled to space with Roger, then we held our breaths when Pierce (ok not exactly him but Wayne David Michaels) bungee jump into that enormous dam.We saw Bond suffer, being kidnapped, beaten, threaten, married and yet, at the end survived. The idea of Bond was to have a hero who, despite all what is throwing at him, is alive at the end. It is an idea of modern not religion or belief in something or someone but a hope. A hope that is helping us remotely to forget our everyday fights for our own survival and just go to a movie theater to feel stronger, better, more relaxed.This is what religions are using to attract people to for centuries. A figure that gives hope for eternal life. Bond as a character never wanted to be this kind of a figure. All he wanted was to survive at the end. Bond never intended to be a God. However, I've got the feeling that producers wanted that the Bond franchise will become a god. And history is never kind to men who wanted to be God. A god who is money making, marketing bounded zeitgeist slave that bends in front of current trends.A Bond movie for me never was action movie. It's the own category - THE BOND MOVIE. Bond movie should have some action in it, be witty, had some flirt or two, well dressed folks, wonderful sceneries, talkative villain and happy ending. Unfortunately, No Time To Die isn't a Bond movie. It's a mashup of repeated ideas that are glued together with profane and disturbing gore which has nothing but a tragic end.I really miss the old Brocolli production.",No Time to Die
2090,PenelopeSmallbone,What Could Have Been?,7,23 October 2021,"This movie had the opportunity to be the best Bond movie of all time. And, it was until.... the very end. I am a grown man of 44 years. And, I cried like a baby at the end like my own father had just died. Again, this movie is a 10 for 2+ hours. But, the end is a 1. James Bond does not die.",No Time to Die
2091,grozda013,This is not a James Bond movie !!!,1,31 October 2021,"Why a grade of 1? A mediocre thriller with a huge budget. Disaster scenario. Bond survives a close explosion 3 times, drives a car like Luis Hamilton and has dialogues as if he were in a Telenovela, and the last 15 minutes of the movie kill everyone as if he were Johny Wick. One man, L. Safin manages to destroy the most dangerous organization in the world - Spectra in 5 minutes in a bar in Cuba !!!!!! Humor is like a movies of the 1990 -ties. Daniel Creig is too old for this role. A film excessively and unnecessarily long. Producers killed Felix, Blofield, all members of Specter and James Bond in one film. Which is a lot, a lot. For me this is proof that Hollywood is in a great crisis and will almost not get out of it. I'm sure the film would have gone much worse at the box office, had it not been delayed so long because of Covid. At the end just one message. James Bond can never die !!!!",No Time to Die
2092,crystalballhimes,A close second to Casino Royale,10,17 October 2021,"This film is not like anything we've seen in a very long time. And I say that in all of the best ways. Craigs tenure had its ups and downs but this film is a special one for the entire series, much like OHMSS.***SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT ****We see Bond in a different stage of life almost as if he's on the outside looking in. He operates from a distance instead of in the thick of it. Felix pulls him back in and we're introduced to Paloma (and whom is my favorite Bond girl since Xenia in Goldeneye). She really is a shining point in the film and wish she had more screen time.This isn't a run of the mill 007 movie, even though yes it has gadgets, and car chases and gun fights. This movie is clearly going one step further for the franchise and introduces new layers to the character that we've only had glimpses of in the past. He officially gets a family, he is shown having legitimate emotions about this and clearly doesn't know how to process it. That struggle is part of the complexity and brilliance that Craig brings to this movie. Madeline has also peeled back some layers and we're shown many different parts of her backstory to help round out their relationship.M is ultimately the person who kills Bond off with the not-so-secret development of Heracles. And I love the parallels between Hercules and Heracles. Even the opening title sequence shows elements of Hercules and symbolism of Greek mythology.Safin is Dr No, they never say it, but the movie is riddles with countless nods pointing back to Dr No. And I love that we started with Dr No and end with a version of Dr No. Everything comes full circle as he is so intelligent that he's awkward. And that's not easy to sell, but I feel like Rami Malek does a decent job. However I must say that Blofelds death did feel very lack luster considering the weight of his character throughout the series. He gets a chokehold on him while in prison and that's it? Does the movie have a few plot holes, yes, but most 007 movies do, we have to roll with those punches and remember it's a movie. This is for entertainment and fun.I personally agree with David from ""The Bond Experience"" in saying that this movie is on par with Skyfall. It has some of the more brutal and cold moments we've been missing from the Craig films, along with countless beautiful locations, new and old characters. The best leading Henchman we've had since Jaws with Dali Benssalah playing Primo! He's just fantastic all around.But like I said early on this isn't like anything we've seen in a long time. And I'm my opinion it's really what we needed to shake things up and say goodbye. This moreover opens the window to explain that James Bond is a Code name and 007 is a code number. Allowing the next actor to make it truly their own just as Craig did.",No Time to Die

By hook or crook he gets out.Plus, the series has become so bloated with melodramatic drama and has stoped being fun.I think that this film is perfectible serviceable to watch if you like big budget films. BUT, this isn't a Bond film. It's what they've been doing with the last three films slowly making it into a husk of the series it was and making into bland moody spy melodrama.Please please reboot the franchise again and look at what made James Bond so beloved not what other films are doing and make them popular.It just feels with this series they are doing whatever is shocking and will make people go see it.Such a shame cause this series had so much potential after Casino Royale.I just felt absolutely devastated at the end of the film and just want to warn other people who grew up loving the series that it will upset you too.Finally, what kid grows up liking this James Bond and series.

It has everything Bond fans love but done in a way that feels like a tick box exercise. The action scenes were well produced but empty and at no point did you feel like Bond was in real threat.The way he made a move on Paloma in the wine cellar moments after meeting her and then being rejected by her was almost made to feel like he was Jimmy Savile - a sign of the times perhaps that Bond's nature isn't fit for purpose anymore.But a lot of this could have been forgiven if they just kept it to the Bond tropes that fans love and given him the chance to ride off into the sunset with his future wife and daughter.

That was until I watched this latest instalment.It starts well, a good opening sequence, but then becomes a long drawn out affair, constantly waiting for some classic Bond action, which fails to appear.Despite Craig's exit from the Bond franchise, it's always assumed that Bond will return, albeit with a different actor at the helm. Killing off the character in the final few moments makes it difficult to see how this will happen. Yes, there can always be a new 007, as there was in this film, but there can't now be another James Bond without a major reboot of the movie franchise.This film could have put an end to the Bond franchise for good.

The whole Craig story arc became too personal and the last entry is definitely far away from the rest of the saga. The usual elements are completely absent and the story is rushed and goes from one chase to another without any character development, not even Bond himself. The Madeleine story in this film betrays all his previous encounters with Blofeld and her relationship with Bond ended up being very cheesy. Also, the new villain is very cartoonish and the sci-fi elements are totally unbelievable.Certainly, a bad way to finish Craig's tenure, although the previous films lead to this mess.If Ian Fleming could watch this movie, he wouldn't recognise his creation.",No Time to Die
2102,galo_costa,How to kill a James Bond franchise - by Cary Fukunaga,1,5 October 2021,"Definitely on the top 3 worst James Bond ever - Let's say Moonraker was worst, but to transform 007 on a soap opera without any James Bond content is a bad way to finish this franchise. I loved the way Sam Mendes humanized the character on Skyfall and he did it perfectly: gave James Bond a life besides the typical agent that we are used since Sean Connery, but kept the essence of the charming agent that the fans loved. As a Bond fan it was noticeble that by the many references to the movie ""On your majestie's secret service"" that it would either be the death of Madeleine or 007 itself (I would never believe it, because it would be so stupid), but as the movie goes by it goes for to much soap opera drama and little content that took Rami Malek a possible good villain. Really disappointed for Phoebe Waller Bridge as a writter and specially for Cary Fukunaga for giving one of the worst movies in almost 60 years of James Bond. It was horrible to go to the cinema after so long to be disappointed. I hope the next James Bond will be a real action movie...",No Time to Die

The ending was the worst part of this movie by far, and after watching the Craig era Bond movies for the last 15 years, it wasn't a fitting conclusion. All of the traits that made him a great Bond in movies like Casino Royale and Skyfall seem like they are gone from this movie, and overall it feels more like a forgettable drama with a few action scenes mixed in.

Lea Seydoux played her role as Dr. Swann magnificently and the two of them had excellent chemistry on screen.I was slightly disappointed by Rami Malek's character Safin who although he did look the part, I felt was almost slightly too polite for a Bond 'baddie'.There are also a few lulls in the film but this is to be expected when there is so much fast paced action and do allow you to actually catch your breath at times.I feel the maximum score I have given for this film is fair as I simply cannot stop thinking about it many days and weeks after seeing it.Am emotional rollercoaster that is a perfect last film for Daniel Craig as Bond.",No Time to Die

2107,markjdady,They have finally done it...,3,31 October 2021,"It would appear the pen is indeed mightier than the sword (or sub-machine gun). After years of surviving perilous near death experiences the writers have managed to succeed where hundreds of boiler- suited, hard hatted wearing henchmen have failed. They finished off Bond..
I can imagine a group of pale-looking sensitive types sitting in some Bistro somewhere high fiving over a soya latte on the 'bold new' direction they have taken the character. Churchill once said 'We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those that would do us harm'. Bond was that man. We all knew he was wrong, but he was like the uncle that although everyone warned you about him, he would be the first person they'd ring if something bad was about to happen. It is unfortunately a common theme throughout many franchises, the emerging 'woke brigade' are telling the audience what they should enjoy rather than what they actually enjoy. At the moment they appear unchallenged in their own bubble fueling themselves on their own importance. This effect has produced a rather lot of underwhelmed people travelling home after a night at the cinema.So what of the film itself? Production values are excellent. The cast is strong and the action scenes are exciting and explosive. It is a Bond film though and even the weaker films tick these boxes. But let's face it, after watching the whole movie you realize that if you have seen the trailer then you have seen the best parts of a long story. In effect the film is just a lot of talking and staring. Malek is criminally under used, he has a sinister presence about him, but the story just loses all momentum till he comes across as a slightly evil gardening enthusiast who just happens to own a secret base on an island but is unsure what to do with it.Craig as ever is superb, but with the exceptions of maybe Casino Royale and Skyfall he has suffered with plot lines as poor as a rusty PPK. It's frustrating to think what could have happened with stronger, better installments.In earlier films the narrative unfolded which explained why Bond was like he was. The relationship with Vespa ran through Craig's tenure and it worked well. But too much of a good idea is too much of a good idea. The point was made. Now Bond just seems to flit from one long term life altering relationship to the another, looking like a sad teenager.I saw this film at the cinema, sitting in front of me was a 7-8 year old boy, about the age I was when I saw my first Bond. I pitied him by the end of this film, I hoped it wasn't his first brush with Bond. He was denied the mind-blowing excitement which was my first experience and kept me hooked for 40 years. Although an outdated ancient tradition, the Xmas afternoon Bond film was a treat for the whole family at a time when people didn't care too much about things such as empowerment, inclusiveness and quite frankly 'being nice and decent'. They wanted adventure, thrills and an unstoppable indestructible hero who laughed in the face death. In a couple of years time this film will without doubt put everyone to sleep when it is shown.'Bond will return' as they say but will he really be Bond anymore? It would seem he has passed the point of no return..",No Time to Die

For sure I have to rewatch this film with understanding that this great odyssey, which was passed on to me by older generations has ended. It is very sad to comprehend that our society can not accept anymore movies like original James Bond series.This theory works only, if there will be no more original bond movies produced, no more bond n.26 an etc.We will welcome Spinoffs (would love to see one with ana de armas) but please leave old mr.

2114,seanfirst,Just Bad.,3,25 October 2021,"No clue how people could rate this higher. Nothing about this movie feels like a James Bond movie. I get that to be ""edgy"" the filmmakers think they have to kill off a likeable character, but killing Felix just felt forced. I will not spoil the ending, but not since the horrible scripts that Timothy Dalton had to work with has a Bond movie felt so off.",No Time to Die
2115,magdalena-k-kowalska,One hour too long,6,7 October 2021,There were so many unnecessary scenes. It would have been so much better if it was shorter. I especially didn't like how they killled Felix.,No Time to Die
2116,kelvinlaw23,Bond talks a lot but minimal wit.... still it's a bond movie.,7,1 October 2021,What shall I say here without being a spoiler? I can only say it is a movie with closure after 5 Craig Danial's Bond movies. A older Bond i guess. Watch it if u want to complete the loop.,No Time to Die
2117,espenmikkelsen,A perfect conclusion to the story that started with Casino Royale,9,1 October 2021,"Without any spoilers.I loved this movie. It didn't feel its runtime. Like the previous Craig movies it follows the same red lines that started with Casino Royale, and it continues the story from Spectre, so I strongly reccomend to see Spectre, and the previous movies before this, as this time the movie attempts to tie them all together to a conclusion that seems logical when you see the movies as a whole.On the whole the cast and acting was great and the story good, with only a few bits standing out as not-so-good, mainly perhaps Maleks characters' rationale for acting the way he does.The soundtrack from Zimmer is stellar, with a few bits of strong Bond nostalgia tied in.The set pieces, gadgets, action and tongue-in-cheek dialouge and megalomanical villain being exactly what you expect from a Bond movie.There are some scenes that doesn't focus on Bond or the main villain, which is unusual for a Bond movie, but it is refreshing to see a small change to this part of the formula.All in all this is in my opinion one of the strongest, if not the strongest of the newer Bond movies.",No Time to Die
2118,chriscorbettuk,Shocking... positively shocking,10,2 October 2021,"... but in a good way.Breathtaking action, strong story, striking retro set design, great acting and stunning cinematography make 2 hours 44 minutes fly by.Giving Bond a child really raised the stakes, especially in the tense forrest shootout. As for the big shocker at the end, I thought it was handled really well.For those who call this a betrayal of Fleming, the following novels say hi:
From Russia With Love
On Her Majesty's Secret Service
You Only Live Twice
The Man With The Golden Gun
(Basically the last quarter of his output)Bond is many things to many people, myself included, but to throw a tantrum and claim a brave decision to be different has ruined your childhood is sad, entitled and reminds me of the worst reactions to The Last Jedi, another great film that dared to explore new territory, rather than rehashing previous glories.There is a place for the comfort of nostalgia, but there is also a place for the bravery and creativity needed to be different. I am excited to see the next direction for Bond, wherever it goes.",No Time to Die
2119,alexblag,An honest review from a Craig Era/Bond fan,10,3 October 2021,"I never normally write reviews, but after leaving the cinema last night I felt the need to write my thoughts down to share, in no specific order.Just like to start with Hans Zimmer, some good scores but far from his best work. Maybe because he had to keep it Bondesq so he couldn't dive into his usual sensational work such as Inseption.Daniel Craig brought a hard, gritty, soulless Bond onto our screens in 2006, and that persona stayed throughout the subsequent 4 movies. This really worked. No Time To Die however, saw a more ""animated"", opinionated, emotional ""jokey"" Bond which does not tie in to the rest of his personality. You could say he had no soul in Casino/Quantum after what happened to Vesper, perhaps Madeleine re-warmed Bonds heart from the subsequent time there were together until she ""betrays"" him. It's not all bad because he has some brilliant action scenes whether it involves guns or fists, or how angry he is at Madeleine at the beginning if the movie.Pre-titled scene car chase was brilliant. Great score. And the follow up car chase/shoot out is also brilliant to watch. Action packed, and also on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense. Some of the gadgets were pretty cool, and somewhat believable. No hiding in alligators here.Having SPECTRE be the predominant badie through around 50% of the movie is a great touch, I felt the organisation was slightly overlooked in the last move, Spectre, and wasn't expecting a comeback after Bond took down Blofeld base and captured him. I'm not sure if I like the idea that Blofeld went mad and only spoke to Madeleine... He wasn't ever a ""mad"" scientist and I doubt his time on prison would have changed this judging by his chacter in Spectre.Paloma was absolutely overlooked in this film. I'd say she had at least 20 minutes screen on time, a real shame. Nomi was also a super character and had a better relationship with Bond than I was expecting. Felix, wow, what a mistake. Killing this character off was such a bad call. There was absolutely no need and does't add anything to the rest of the story.The ""nanobot"" virus story/splot ehhh, I mean it doesn't really have the same ""realistic"" terrorist appeal that was in the previous movies but it works as a Bond film, just doesn't tie in well enough with the previous movies.Safin. Hmm, not as amazing badie as I thought he was going to be. Again, not a lot of screen time or dialogue but enjoyable nonetheless.The ending. What an absolute mistake killing Bond. After 5 all-round good Craig movies, killing him is just a kick in the teeth to all his other movies. As the all ""tie"" in, no matter what he does in Skyfall, Casino etc. It would have all been a waste because he gets blown up.Bond, as we know is a character that is portrayed by different actors. Killing off this character means Q, M, Moneypenny, Tanner etc can also not come back, because how can you salute to Bonds death, but then introduce a new actor to play Bond when it was only in the last movie that cheers to his death. Bonkers.Here would be a better ending, Paloma comes back (as she says in the movie, ""lets do this again soon"") and rescues Bond from the missiles just in time before the island gets destroyed, which will also then destroy all the nanobot technology from harming Madeleine and his daughter and ""live happily ever after.""After 24 movies, never has Bond died, for real anyway. This is an absolute spit in the face to Ian Flemming, and I have no idea why EON, Craig and Fukunaga thought this would be a good idea and won't upset any diehard Bond fans like myself. I left the cinema feeling confused, very disappointed and let down all because of the ending. Especially having the high expectations since the film was first delayed in 2019.Killing Blofeld and taking down SPECTRE, I can understand. Felix and Bond however? No. They are characters that have span many many movies and these characters have not died, so they can come back but just portrayed by a different actor. Killing the characters though is a disgrace. A forthcoming reboot in so many years will be incredibly hard to convince when No Time To Die killed these characters off.99% of this film is at least a solid 7.5/8 stars. The length of this film didn't bother me as it was action packed all the way through. However, will I be in a rush to watch No Time To Die, or the other Craig Bond films again? Not in a hurry. For me this film almost ruined them all, purely because of the ending.",No Time to Die
2120,turntbl,Heartbroken,1,7 October 2021,"I am heartbroken, not because this was the last outing from Daniel Craig, but heartbroken because I have lived long enough to see my beloved character turn into a shell of what he once was. I won't spoil anything, which makes it harder to explain truly, and back up how I feel. All I will say is that this movie is a monstrosity, a disgrace to all that came before it. I don't know who at the studio approved this movie and it's storyline. I Honestly don't see how a whole franchise can make such a sharp turn this fast, the film right before this was actually good, and I was looking forward to seeing this movie! In conclusion, if you're a true Bond fan... Don't go see this movie, save yourself the pain and anger.",No Time to Die
2121,thenness,Ending of the Craig Arc,8,2 October 2021,Visually the moving was fantastic.I completely understand why the film was delayed with its Covid esqe plot where they mentioned it would spread through touch.Rami is under used in the film and it feels like scenes have been cut. He was the new version of Dr No but is only called Dr once - why?The death of Bond - as a Craig story you got him become a 00 and die - that is cool. Just as a childhood element Bond was invincible and now I have a Tony Stark moment of that wasn't needed but I get why it happened.The death of Felix Lighter as well cut deep.....Casting was good and story worked. Hans Zimmer's score was good in the most part but the gun fight in Cuba felt like a stretch musically - it went a little comical IMO.,No Time to Die

Cheap laughs. Forced script (esp in the scene Bond ""kills"" Blofeld)I've watched Bond films all my life. Some people saying they love it. This film will age terribly and those same people will only remember it for it's shocks.Despite that, I'm hopeful for the future of the franchise.

2123,octaviovbr-634-779614,Daniel Craig ends his tenure as James Bong with a bang!,9,3 October 2021,"Let me start by addressing the elephant in the room: The political review bombing of this film is ridiculous and the people doing this honestly have no clue about the real James Bond, written by Fleming, the man that existed before the myth created by Sean Connery in Goldfinger.There are two types of bond films, the one they try to delve deeper into the character and the ludicrous ones like Roger Moore's and Die another Day. Fans of the latter are very likely to hate this film, but in my opinion, the ones that flesh out Bond as a character and have more grounded plots are usually the best ones, and this one falls into that category, or rather, goes all in on it. And I loved it.I have no doubt this film will remain highly divisive and I predict that with time, it will age like wine, just like people weren't ready for On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969, after years of seeing Connery play that formula to exhaustion (and then again in diamonds), people weren't ready for this film now. Never before have we seen a Bond so fleshed out and so vulnerable, so human, and as a result, the stakes are higher than ever. This film, like OHMSS, dared to go where no other Bond film went.Guaranteed cult classic.",No Time to Die

2125,mattyandson,"Average, but entertaining and a fitting fairwell to Craig",7,3 October 2021,"Craigs films peaked with Casino Royale and have slowly been depreciating from there. However, this film nicely finishes his tenure as bond and left me slightly emotional at the end, not because of the ending but saying goodbye to the best Bond ever (in my opinion).Few key things to mention:
Film is 30 mins too long and they could easily cut some scenes.It is clear the screenplay writers kept getting to late stages in the film then realising they need to adjust earlier plot lines to accommodate the storyline. Most significantly the main antagonist has a key piece of collateral over Bond and simply gives it away for no apparent reason.Ana de Armas character is completely pointless, which is a shame as she is a good actor. She is simply put in as eye candy and to push forward a scene.The plot line and how it linked to Spectre was not well devised and fell flat, which great acting and interesting fight scenes managed to keep afloat. It felt like a shoddy mission impossible rip off with the Bond style overlaying.Rami Maleks character was underwhelming and a shame for how good an actor he is.Overall, Daniel Craig deserves a lot of credit for what he's done for the franchise and was a pleasure to watch him as bond.",No Time to Die

Did we watch the same movie are you saying its as good as Shindlers list.or The Shawshank Redemption. The same for people.giving it 1's and 2's. Its really not that bad.I can understand the emotional response to the ending its ridiculously stupid and was probably done so that they could cast anyone into the role in the future that would be acceptable to modern times. Don't they know James Bond has almost become a super hero, he simply cannot be killed. What have they done! Who knows maybe we will see a Black female who identifies as a man and wants to be now referred to as 'us' as the next 007.I suppose its the sign of the times but lets hope only a phase and that Bond will somehow be resurrected to continue to fight another day for King and Country.Hugely disappointed, but none the less entertaining non-bond movie.",No Time to Die

Gone is the svelte suave Bond, instead we get an aloof raucous brawler. As for Felix's apprentice, well one could easily mistake her for the Black Widow. Speaking of Felix, he's one of the highlights of the film along with M, Q and Monopenny. Predictable plot, but the Bond cars and spy gadgets make up for it. Rami Malik was convincing enough, but it's still a poor man's Lechter. A lot of wasted shoe leather prolongs this death knell too far.

2133,benfriar,A rehash of On Her Majesty's Secret Service that doesn't work,6,1 October 2021,"The first 20 minutes of this film are magnificent but from there on out I felt I was waiting far to long for the film truly get going. Aside from a few decent enough action sequences I was bored for the majority of the runtime which felt like it was far too long and desperately needed another cut in the edit room.The opening scene is chilling and feels like something out of a horror movie. The following sequence in Italy Matera is best part of the film and feels like timeless Bond with romance, a great action sequence and a stunning location. It's the only point in the film which I felt the romance worked and from there on out Craig's and Seydoux's poor chemistry from Spectre seemed to return.When Hans Zimmer utilised John Barry's iconic love theme from On her Majesty's Secret Service I got goosebumps. As the film went on I began to realise that they were going to attempt to reuse story elements from that book and film. Like in the book, Bond visits Vespers grave which is a poignant moment, except for some reason it's in Italy which doesn't make any sense considering her character had no connection to there? I liked the use of the line ""we have all the time in the world"" at the beginning of the film but when it was used again at the end of the film my eyes rolled as it felt unearned and cheap ploy by the writers to force and emotional reaction in what was already a drawn out demise. The music was over the top and despite being a first for the bond franchise it felt predictable and didn't subvert my expectations.The plot is also similar to that of On her Majesty's Secret Service given that Blofeld's scheme in that story involved biological warfare. Except this time villain's motivations for wanting to kill all these people is never fully explained and doesn't make any sense. Rami Malek's performance is fine but we never truly get to know him and why he's doing what he is. Also there are lots of unanswered questions about his character such as what is the significance of his mask? What happened to his face? What happened after he saved Seydoux's character?The film is also obsessed with reminding us that Seydoux's character has a secret that will turn Bond's world upside down but to my recollection that is never revealed or has any significance to the story. Blofeld has also been totally wasted as a character in both Spectre and this film and the way Bond suddenly starts strangling him out of nowhere in their scene together felt completely out of character and just a way to make Bond touch him so he would die.I feel as though a lot of this film is dragged down by the misgivings of Spectre and that it is having to work with certain characters and elements that never truly worked from that film. This film would have been served better to start completely fresh. At times it's far to concerned with tying up loose ends from Craig's tenure that didn't need resolving. That became very evident with the introduction of Ana De Armas who was stand out in film but sadly not in the film enough. Her and Craig actually had brilliant chemistry onscreen even though it was never meant to be romantic and I think if she had been given a more significant role the film would have benefited greatly.Despite these misgivings I'm quite surprised that the film is as good as it is considered the director was brought in 3 months before the start of shooting after Boyle's exit. I can't help but wonder that he left the project because he didn't want Bond to die at the end?The action is done well. The opening scene with the DB5 is brilliant and the woodland car chase was standout. A long take tracking shot in the climax is also a stand out moment. Taken together though the action is far less brutal and comes far less often than it has in the previous Craig films.Hans Zimmer was also brought in late to the project and his score is serviceable but far from what I would expect from a composer of his calibre. The themes he reuses are done well but apart from that the rest of the music fails to stand out.Overall, part of me just wishes they remade On her Majesty's Secret Service properly or just made something completely original. Instead we get something abit in between and half hearted. The film is constantly in battle with itself as to if it wants to be a classic bond or a modern one. And in trying to do both it succeeds at neither and when the end credits rolled a just felt dissappointed.",No Time to Die

Nothing present of the usual charm & magic of the bond franchise.The whole movies feels like rushed and improvised .Its fine if you want to kill the character and stop people from asking for Daniel craig back , what is not is to make such a miserable movie to be the ending of such successful franchise.The addition of a black woman as 007 in a side role to test water for upcoming installement came at the expense of the story and served no real purpose in the movie or the story other than testing the feeling of the audience.Seriously the long useless philosophical dialogues!!! Who's idiot idea was that.Action sequences were taken like you have seen this before nothing to focus on or watch again.The angel of a family man bond was supposed to lighten the impact of all the above and for very brief moment it did , however for that you needed to retire the character in the end and makr path for younger fresher new bond .I give it 6 only for sake of acting skills of Daniel & Ramy .",No Time to Die

It's too long. Bond is a fairly simple formula and didn't really need to be messed with, I shouldn't have to think about a bond film.

There is very little continuity between the scenes; it all weighs far too heavy and feels held together by duct tape. Far more effort is expended to connect the dangling plot strings in the franchise than make an engaging film. This is the most sentimental Bond movie yet, and it really drags on the pacing. The sentimentality makes it very slow paced and heavy handed, which would be forgivable if the characters evoked the emotional response the director was targeting. They do not. Terrible chemistry between Bond and his woman. Worst Bond villain in many, many years - a total miscast who's motivation for destruction is unclear. Superfluous set pieces and characters. Finally, the way in which Bond meets his end feels so incredibly tired, unoriginal and anticlimactic. They may as well have shot him into the sun, as that would have been more satisfying. Bond never capitulates, and he certainly doesn't never goes out with a whimper. Unfortunately, this director and screenplay had other ideas.

2149,marcelgraf,Good but sometimes a little too much,8,2 November 2021,"In Daniel Craig's run as 007 the films have alternated between great and ok from the beginning for me. While I found Casino Royale and Skyfall great, Quantum and Spectre were ok. So it was somehow clear that this one should be great again.On the positive side we can note the actors. Rami Malek is a thrilling villain. Lisa-Dorah Sonnet is just awesome as Mathilde. Also Léa Seydoux is a bit of a surprise. While - due to lacking chemistry with Bond - I didn't like her in Spectre, she really does a good job this time. Christoph Walz also performs well. Of course his story as Blofeld makes a bit more sense this time. Finally Monepenny, M and Q do solid jobs as always.The story in total is good. Despite its length, it's always interesting. Nevertheless it is clearly too long. Just like in Spectre the filmmakers tried again to stuff a bit too much into the movie.At the beginning, Safin's revenge plan makes perfect sense. Only after erasing Spectre, he carries on to threaten a lot more people, which is a bit over the top. They probably use it as a reason for Bond to hunt him down. But his mere possession of such a frightening weapon should be already quite enough for this.For my taste there are too many deaths in this film. The production must have thought: This is Craig's last Bond. We better clean up. So lets kill Leiter, the whole Spectre, Blofeld, the main villain Safin and presumably also Bond. And of course a whole lot of other henchmen. I as the villain might have found it more attractive to leave Blofeld alive to allow him to experience the elimination of his whole organisation. The killings of Leiter and Bond are also arguable for me.And one last point: in this film Bond suddenly has a child. On the one hand, it's kind of appealing.

They're increasingly tedious.The intro sequence is absolutely excellent, almost a movie in itself. Unfortunately what followed after the theme song doesn't manage to live up to it's ambitions.The plot is all over the place. It feels as if the filmmakers decided what they wanted to happen at the end and then wrote backwards from that.I don't understand the final motivation of the villain at all, I couldn't tell you exactly what he was trying to achieve with his masterplan in the third act. Rami Malik was wasted on this role.The thread about trusting Madeleine should of underpinned the whole movie but it doesn't quite come off somehow.Blofeld and the mechanical eye wtf.The new 00 had the potential to be a excellent character, a sleazy lady version of Bond would of been great, but it felt like they didn't quite know what to do with her.For all the many problems though I enjoyed it over all and it has stuck with me.It looks stunning, and the locations were excellent. There were some very solid action sequences, I really enjoyed the car chase in Norway. Ana De Armas was great.Most of all the conclusion was surprisingly emotional, and that's entirely down to Daniel Craig. Against all the odds he's been an outstanding Bond and managed to make the role his own which is no mean feat given those who came before him. I left the cinema feeling sad that his tenure is over. Hats off to him, he's up there with Connery.I'm very curious to see how they handle the upcoming reinvention, it's hard to see where they can take it next. They have 2 very difficult tasks; casting an actor capable of following Daniel Craig, and creating new villains to pit him against that feel plausible in the 20s.",No Time to Die

The plot was fair but Craig didn't seem like the same ""Bond"" from previous outings. Was it the long-winded dialogue, the fact they modernized Bond to be less masculine and more politically correct, maybe because he lacked a good villain (Rami Malek was weak and almost inaudible) or lastly the horrendous ending that we endured.It was likely the worst Bond film, right next to Quantum of Solace, of the Daniel Craig era. Very disappointed and needs a redo.",No Time to Die
2157,lpaul319,Castrated Bond - Cultural decline,6,2 October 2021,"What is Bond as a film series? A fairy tale for men. Our attractive, capable hero is constantly caught between love, trust and the brutal life of an agent. He does anything to complete the mission, but finds himself wanting to settle down, find love. By betrail or the harshness of reality he is thrown back to save the world. To put it it to terms of our current cultural disscouse: he wants to overcome toxic masculinity but the world does not let him do just that. This dynamic was perfectly captured by the last truly original Bond ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and Craig's premier in ""Casino Royal"". ""Quantum of Solace"" was the bitter sweet aftermath. While ""Skyfall"" strays away from that dynamic it is cognizant of Bond as a fairy tale and opens it up to a wider theme of tradition. ""Spectre"" was a let down but couldn't discourage my hopes for ""No Time to Die"".Review:
The film starts out great with beautiful scenery underlining the theme of overcoming the past. At the same time it serves spectacular action and stunts exquisitely. For that alone you should go an watch the movie.*Spoilers*
Bond retires and never really recovers. MI6 as well as the CIA want him back. He decides to help Felix Leiter his old friend (CIA) and is accompanied by Paloma to infiltrate a Spectre meeting in Cuba. He has to awkwardly undress in front of her. There is no real charm and as soon as the action starts she (previously clumsy) fights like a character from a video game. This contrasted to the new 007 Nomi in tactical gear and a strange rivalry makes Bond look out of place. Bond is not smarter or stronger than anybody. As soon as the films tries to invoke an emotional reaction by Leiter's death everything feels hollow. He is not scared by that death rather he is busy catching up with his friends at MI6. Christoph Waltz is especially cartoonishly portrayed and their deep history finds no release, but death from the nanobots. Bond realizing his old love interest Madeleine is in danger follows her to Norway where he meets their daughter. At this point the film commits the greatest crime in my opinion: Madeleine lies about the origin of that child. No deep relationship gets fleshed out. The only thing Bond can cry about at his end is the life that could have been. But given the lack of any honesty, real connection, love between the two it feels as hollow as Felix death. He hasn't spend time with them because of his mistrust after what happens to him via Vesper. It feels clumsy and tragic in an absurd way. With Vesper there was a real sense of betray but also honesty because she bargained for his life. Here he stands without fighting as a hopeless romantic evaporating in the explosion.We cannot make the woke police responsible for this. At the same time we cannot go back to an old Bond. I think the writers need to look at men's desire and how it can be adapted to the modern era.",No Time to Die

He has been tortured, kicked, shot, druged etc.But one thing is for sure, he's gonna kick the villans a**.If he loses one of his bondgirls, he's gonna do is mourning around a vodka martini, keep on fighting, get the job done, take the girl, drink another vodka martini, and drive his Aston Martin in to the sunset.But he's ALWAYS gona make it out in one piece.Thats it, plain and simple, it was like this for seven decades, and it worked out, the ticket sales speaks for it, thats what the legion of bond fans wants, and pays for.Times change, actors change, styles change, priciples change, but the recipie CAN'T.I had no trouble when Bond quit smoking.I had no trouble when Bond drove BMW's

But dont kill Bond.Until today, everytime a new Bond movie came to the theaters, i would watch on the premire, no matter what.After today, im having second thoughts if i will every spend one cent again on it.And unless you find a way to fix that damage you have done, you wont get a penny more out of my pocket.

Sure there were some good action scenes there but I got the feeling there was more talking than doing. And what was it actually about? I guess everyone is confused about what the actual story is. None of my friends could recall anything from the last movie because it happened 2 years ago. It's like watching the next episode of your favourite TV show once again after 2 years break. And I don't even get me started on ending here. This is basically the end of Bond and I don't really see it going anywhere from thete. And honestly if the most iconic agent of all time is supposed to be like this then I'd prefer there would be no other Bond ever.I loved Ana de Armas though- beautiful, witty and badass.

2177,nedyalkova-marya,An impressive ending to the Daniel Craig's Bond,9,30 September 2021,"What a run they've had! I'm still processing the movie but here are some bullet points:* Cinematography and music - absolutely top level, so mesmerising* Action - also top level, especially towards the end* Dialogues - all the bond movies follow the same dialogue template where there is not a lot of meaning or depth but there's a very subtle wit and humour to it. In this movie they went all out with the humour, it felt so different! I know some people will love it and some people will hate it.* Characters - lots to unpack here, but mainly I'd say that Bond's character differs MASSIVELY from the previous movies. It feels weird at times, and doesn't line up with Bond that we are used to seeing. However, even though such change didn't make a lot of sense plot wise, I was one of those people who wished more open acting from Craig, and I got it! Lashana Lynch's role was surprisingly small and I hope to see more of her because she's seriously cool. I understand that this movie was all about Craig, so I guess that's fair. I feel like Rami Malek's character could have been sooo much more! He barely scraped the surface and wasn't very charismatic.* Plot - as with a typical Bond plot, it's a tad silly, a tad over the top, a tad dramatic. Some clichés they followed such as bad Russians and a villain covered in scars... One thing that I think needed more work in the previous movies is Bond's relationships. To me to see such a deep love to a woman based on about three minutes of screen time was unconvincing of the depth of their relationship. I almost didn't believe it and didn't believe that Bond could be, all of a sudden, so romantic and articulate.OVERALL: really enjoyed it, such a powerful ending that all those criticisms I wrote about abobe almost didn't matter.

No Time to Die is not a bad movie, but it feels like more like a Mission Impossible movie than a James Bond movie. At their different bests, these two spy franchises are uniquely great. No Time to Die loses the grounded, un-silly, and non-end of the world stakes nature that made Casino Royale and Skyfall so revolutionary and fresh, especially in the Marvel climate of today's movie world. The world doesn't have to be at stake for the audience, or James Bond to care, but this idea seems to have been forgotten.

I've liked all the previous Bond movies of Daniel Craig but not this one. Quantum of Solace was 100 times better than this. To start things off, Billie Eilish's opening song was a huge bore when compared to all the previous bond songs. Then comes the plot - a bad concoction of a haphazard story (obvious problem due to change of director and bringing in Phoebe Waller Bridge to a genre she doesn't have any experience in). Next comes the pacing of the movie which felt a bit off when compared to previous Daniel Craig bond movies. Now, I'll mention the positive parts - Daniel Craig's starting action sequence (which every bond movie does well), Ana De Armas(she just shined really well). These were the only parts I liked.

I also can't believe the 1 star reviews, that really doesn't do the movie any justice.The Good:
* This is the perfect cumulative ending of a 15 year Craig period which started with Casino Royal. It could not end any other way. I'm glad Craig did this final one, to make the circle go round. When Blofeld said ""It will be the death of you"", Blofeld understands what James Bond is all about. James himself realize this at the end of the movie. He is born an orphan, always survived alone. No one can survive with him. In order to let the ""secret"" survive he have to choose between life and his own death.*The action scenes accompanied by the excellent score of Hans Zimmer is mesmerizing. This time no ""Bourne Identity"" type of action. To me the last 15 minutes of Bond solo action was a tribute to the typical Raw Craig No Nonsense ruthless fight scenes. It was the first time I actually wondered if he would survive as you could feel in your spine that things could go very bad.*Ana de Armas (Paloma) gives a short but lighthearted Kick ass performance. Just what was needed at that time of the movie. She deserves a spin-off.*The car chases was out of this world. Ever seen what a Landrover Defender can do ? This is the ultimate superbowl commercial for that.*All the James Bond elements are there. The longest pre-credit scene, Q, Gadgets, cocktails, Island with Henchmen, beautiful exotic locations, bond girls, Felix Leiter, SPECTRE, Blofeld, Two 00 Agents, Two Villains, Car chases. What more can you ask for ?*The Female 007 was a bit stereotyped Bad Ass 00 Agent. But I think it was done on purpose as she came to realize that Bond was actually outperforming her in all ways. I also noticed that that Craig was more fit and stronger than in his previous movies.*The virus McGuffin was not well executed. Sometimes I wondered who was poisened and who was a danger to who. I also didn't feel the world threat that much.*finally the villain (SAFIN) did not make an impact or scared me. This could have done better.The good outweighs the bad. This movie is not a stand alone episode, but the final conclusion of 15 years bond that began with Casino Royal. In that regared, the writers did a very good job, So don't give me that 1 star reviews. This movie was made with love.",No Time to Die
2191,jason-murray3,Threat of world destruction by Freddy Mercury,7,6 October 2021,I've been a massive fan of these latest Daniel Craig Bond offerings but this final instalment fell short of the mark for me. Probably ranks 3rd behind casino Royale and Skyfall. And how anyone sees Rami Malek as anything more than a terrible actor is beyond me. He was born to play Freddy Mercury and anything else is beyond him. Awful awful actor.,No Time to Die
2192,smylexx,"No, time to sigh.",3,30 September 2021,"An indulgent mess spoiled by politics.For me, very little worked. The pre-credits sequence is usually reserved for a cool action setpiece but here we get melodrama for 15 minutes before any threat is presented.The maguffin is not explained well, who made it? Why? Who's working for who? The villains have almost zero screen time and when they eventually show up in the third act, they have no personality. The motivation of the baddie also seems vague. He avenges those that harmed him in the first hour so why are we still dealing with him?The director almost seems embarrassed to put action scenes in and the ones that are there are shot with little interest and even less logic with the exception of one great pairing of agents in Cuba who actually had some real chemistry together.As for female 007, again this feels forced and while some may champion the character, I'd have to say that I felt she was simply dull. Every line felt a bit snotty and came off as arrogance. Her presence is not something that breaks the film or will make fans upset, they'd have to care one way or the other to do that and there's just not enough personality here to feel anything for.And the finalé, I'll just say that it's a first for this franchise and not a welcome one.

We have seen since 2006 the more human side to him which absolutely comes to a conclusion in this epic.

M, Q, Moneypenny and Felix are as brilliant as ever, and the new characters played by Ana de Armas and Lashana Lynch fit perfectly in the movie. These characters are very likeable, and so are the villains. ""No time to die"" is a perfect mixture of beautiful settings and photography, first-class acting, a smart script and the most Bond-like soundtrack in many years. Even though pace can be tricky in a 2:43 hour long action movie, every scene contributes with either entertainment for the audience or meaning to the story. I enjoyed every line and every shot fired. Daniel Craig's last interpretation of James Bond also show how much the character has evolved throughout the years. As a 00-agent in his 50s, he probably knows he has outlived himself. There seem to be a lot going on in his head, and Daniel Craig portrays this beautifully. Craig's last and slightly older version of James Bond is both tough and experienced but also wise and sensitive, naturally, after all he has been through. All this makes ""No time to die"" one of the most interesting and intriguing Bond movies ever, even though ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" remain my personal favorites.",No Time to Die

Classic acting, using old DB5 and opening scene was a treat to watch alongwith the car chase in Norway where again Bond stamped the authority of his experience and not shown as a naive agent, in the end also when Q instructing him and before that Bond did the job.Score was awesome and title song...soothing and one can listen again and again without getting ears pain.Overall great job, it would be so ahrd for next Bond (male or female)?

Some reviews have said they found it too long and too boring, well I really don't know what to say about that other than ... Malarkey!Is there action in the movie: Yes
Is there beautiful women: Yes
Is there car chases: Yes
Is there explosions: Yes
Is there gadgets: Yes
Is the Austin Martin utilized: Oh yeah finally
Are there any Bond jokes: Yep
Are bad guys killed: Yep
Does Bond save the world: When does he not?So what is different from other Bond films?It brings out emotion.It brings out character.It has a real believable story.That's the new stuff.Where Spectre failed in so many ways, No Time To Die redeemed itself.It rates (IMO) as the top of the Craig Era Bond films, ahead of Skyfall (which prior to NTTD was my favorite Bond film) and Casino Royale.There was great chemistry between the actors and there was genuine emotions throughout the film.Almost 3 hours long? Didn't even notice.The villian was not over the top which so many times is not the case in a Bond film.Was there anything I did not like?Spoiler Alert:
To be picky sure, it would have been great to see more of the new 007 (remember Bond left at the end of Spectre), a few more minutes of the Austin Martin would have been nice and an even longer scene with the new CIA operative.Plus the chances of the guy with Felix not being a bad guy was ZERO (that WAS predictable).The ultimate thing to ask yourself is whether you enjoyed the movie, did it entertain you and make you go on a ride emotionally? This film does all that.Of course my opinion is skewed towards enjoying it so as a foil, I took my partner who is not a Bond fan, who really enjoyed it.And I scanned the theatre and everyone there was enjoying the film.Go see the movie for yourself, as a Bond fan.

Sir Sean Connery was arguably the best Bond ever (mine was Daniel Craig but hey after this one I'll reconsider) and what, after Sean Connery left the franchise they should've ended Bond?!

Which in many ways was very nice to learn more about the character. And while I've been a fan of Craig since day one when first he donned the Tux and the Aston Martin, many hated him, the same people say that they now love him. *Rolls eyes*This movie, to get back on point, is Craig's last and its a good way to close his chapter as Bond. It was also nice to see gadgets back - like the ones portrayed in the trailer.Its a 9/10* Movie but it loses stars due to some of the plot mechanics. I'm a writer myself and I just don't like how some of the characters evolved through the course of the movie, it just didn't make much sense to me given how they were written in prior movies. Even the over arcing story of the movie to finish Craig's Legacy as 007 is marred by writing that lack the ""Bond finesse"".All in all, I'll be heading back a second time with another friend.Thank you Daniel Craig for everything. Thank you for the legacy you've left behind.In months to come, a new Bond will eventually be chosen, I'm with Pierce Brosnan, my money is on Idris Elba.

2243,jorlertgabriel,"Lovely movie, thankfully a different take on an almost strained series of movies",7,4 October 2021,"Loved the movie, and especially Daniel Craig who got a chance to show off his humor and not only easy quips.Most if not all bond movies have the same formula where bond completes the mission with a smile on his face with a quick witty remark on his lips before he rides off into the sunset with his arm over the newest girl with a glass of scotch in his hand.In this movie Bond is affected by the actions of the previous Daniel Craig films, it makes him have a personal stake in the game with his family and in the end of movie above just ""queen and country"".It makes him a more sympathetic character and his ultimate sacrifice hits the harder because of it.I never understood the criticism that James bond doesn't die in his movies, is that truly what you want? The same movie slightly altered every time?This diversion from the expected outcome improves the film in my most humble opinion.There are some aspects of the movie that I have some problems with as well, such as the new 007 which comes off as kind of bratty, don't really care that it's a woman but either the actress or the way she was directed didn't sit quite right with me.I don't love the woman who turns out to be the mother of his child but I realize the importance that her character plays in the story.The thing I found the hardest to swallow was the villains motivation, it was a lot of talk about the world changing and evolving from 00 agents but when the ""buyers"" at the end arrived I was confused if it ultimately was about money or not. I liked rami maleks performance however and wasn't that bothered that the movie was more about bond than the bad guy.The thing I think I liked the most about the movie is probably the very thing that most people didn't like about it, the ""lack"" of action.When there is a car chase for 10 minutes or an action scene every other scene I get bored but when they choose their moments to indulged in some action I think it was better handled because they could include better and more entertaining incidents than if they were spread out during the whole movie.Instead the movie got emotional and personal and into the drama which got me more involved in the character than seeing him murdering countless of evil goons.Not a perfect bond movie because it dared to stand out I think it became a better movie for it than if it just became another bond movie.Ps. Just because Daniel Craig's bond is dead doesn't mean the character is dead and won't be remade.",No Time to Die

Daniel Craig did well to choose to retire after this outing as James Bond. He looked aged compared to the last Bond he made. We all age, I get it, but to play a suave sophisticated 00 agent looking so tired and 'mature' just didn't cut it for me.It was a very easy to watch action movie, but Bond it wasn't. I've a dreadful feeling that we were given a clue as to the next Bond. The female who took his 007 title in the film made me wonder if this actress is going to be the next FEMALE Bond? I sincerely hope not. I know times change, but PLEASE stick as close as possible to Ian Flemings books. If they choose a black female, it will in my view be like doing a remake of Dumbo with a cat as the star.As soon as I saw her appear in the film, I immediately thought ""I hope she's not in much of the film"". I just couldn't take to her. No charisma or screen presence whatsoever.There were also a couple of things I must have missed the explanation for. Why did M appear to turn rogue then back again. Why did Madeleine betray Bond to her father? I hope I missed the reasoning in the script, which wouldn't surprise me as the sound was dreadful, especially when Bond and the newly qualified agent spoke via their earpieces.

The Bond franchise now have all the modern traits with a storyline throughout the movies, and with this movie, which had lots of references to the older Bond movies, it really feels like a great way to end James Bond.Spoilers:
The ending to this movie was perfect. James Bond was never going to be a family man, that can't happen to the character, so ending this character really opens the franchise a lot more. Historically, James Bond movies have been made (to some extend) with the same characters in mind within the universe, and therefore, during the different bond eras, we have seen the (same) stories being portrayed in different ways. Anyway, the ending to this movie have me thinking -> the James Bond era has ended. Now it's time for a new bond era -> potentially a Mathilde Bond era?Beforehand I didn't like the idea of a Female bond, but in this way, it makes a lot more sense. It would be a bold move to do this, but after seeing No Time To Die , I think it would make a lot of sense to use this character to develop the franchise to new levels and create a whole new era to Bond instead of finding new ways to tell the same story.",No Time to Die

He may not carry the glint in his eye that Connery had, or the delivery of a double entendres of Moore; what has brought is a menacing presence and vulnerability to the role that fits with the role.At nearly 3 hours this is a long movie, but wow it passed by.Great effort from the screenwriters and Eon.

That being said he also portrayed bond in two of the worst bond films being Quantum of solace and Spectre.So that leaves us with his final outing in No Time to Die. Which starts off very strong for the first 40 minutes or so, with some of the best scenes from the craig era, notably the scene where we get to see a reuniting between bond and felix leiter and also the whole action sequence in cuba.

2283,carlosandrepedro,LGBTQ+ in a Mexican Soap Opera,3,24 October 2021,"After all the time awaiting for this movie, there was of course a great expectation about it, also due to the fact would be Daniel Craig's last one.The movies as well as previous ones differs mostly from the Bond usual guidelines in the sense that it ended up being a continuation of the Spectre, which is not common on a James Bond movie ( I think only Moonraker had it previously), which makes it difficult to understand in case you missed any previous one.As for the movie itself, I felt a big pressure from the current social paradigm to be imported to it, in this case you end up having to relevant moments from my point of view which are: Q being gay, and 007 number being given to a black woman. I have no issues with any of these, but having these both processes occurred at a same time in one movie where all the LGBTQ+(and so one) are so active, looks like not a natural choice, but a commitment with those communicates and so very forced in a movie where these topics where never needed to be addresses, and based on heterosexual books where this was never mentioned.I would understand these being imported to the movie, but on a natural basis and not being a commitment to avoid any backfire. Not Natural at all.Also, on the movie, the first part felt exactly like a typical James Bond movie, thrilling, with enough manhood, cars and explosions. As for the second part, felt very much like a Mexican Soap Opera, where you are chasing a family drama and nothing interesting happens, you can leave TV playing for 10 days and come back and you still haven't missed any part of the story, very focused on family dramas which is not a 007 thing.Also as a last point, you see that there was not a clear sensual scene, which typically, should occur, Ana de Armas, has barely 7 minutes of scene and its gone, not even a sensual moment like Monica Bellucci had.All this together looks like you are addressing social pressures and trying to focus on a good end for Daniel Craig but not James Bond itself (no sex and dying in the end), which is typical from a Drama but not a James Bond.As for the actors all of them were incredibly well in the rolls they were asked to perform but clearly Lashana Lynch is the lowest quality one, not up for the task.I ended up downgrading my review while I was writing this critic from 4 to 3, because clearly a lot of disappointing things on the movie.",No Time to Die

This movie is not a James Bond movie, this is a Shakespeare movie. In every movie James Bond has the ability to escape death despite all what is throwing at him. He is alive at the end, and watching him die was horror for me. The production completely destroyed the franchise. These people can't kill an Icon like James Bond. It has been this way since 1962 don't mess with the formula. Biggest disappointment in history. This film has no villain, the love interest has no chemistry, where are the Bond lines and the Alpha male, no Bond gadgets. What's Next? They clone him? The sister of Bond takes his position or maybe the twin brother?!

2289,imogendangerfield,Lifelong Bond fan and I loved it,8,10 October 2021,"Daniel Craig is for me - a child of the 80s - the best Bond. He has the cruelty and complexity of the Bond of the books and the charisma of a Hollywood star. He IS Bond with his raging masculinity and repressed childhood trauma.This film manages to capture all of that and update the tired stereotypes of ""gadgets, girls and guns"". Ana de Armas is brilliant in her brief time on screen, her youth, naivety and femininity a foil for the aging misogynist of Bond. Lashana Lynch is great as Nomi with her dry wit and no nonsense approach to getting the job done. This didn't feel like a ticking of the ""feminism"" box for me. I would have liked a more three dimensional Madeleine Swan but Lea Seydoux captured her sadness and heartbreak well.I wasn't terribly impressed with Rémi Malek's Safin however and found him to be a bit bland and boring. He didn't ever seem capable of world domination and was more annoying than anything else.Christoph Waltz was brilliant as ever and it's a shame that more wasn't made of him; surely he deserved a more dramatic end?I loved the cinematography, especially the shot where Bond turns around and shoots down a tunnel, capturing that iconic shot 'in real-time' as it were. The make up and effects were as great as normal and the stunts bigger and better than ever. I also thought that the sound mixing was excellent. I enjoyed the script and laughed out loud at some of the one-liners.In summary then, there is more to love than hate in No Time To Die.

The chase sequences and action are perfectly judged - Bond dispatching legions of goons with a dispassionate professional demeanor, the visual stun of stalking in the mist - whilst the sci first plot is kept satisfyingly hand wavey.The action is a treat, the weaponry and magic reminiscent of classic bond, understated but effective, and earning memorable punchlines. This all takes place in locations to die for strung together with skillThe huge win is this story, and Daniel Craig's portrayal of James Bond, both author of and subject to a cold and bitter present. We're told the story of Bond's resurrection as much as his fall, Daniel Craig portrays the journey back to life in sharp detail, full of emotion.Steeped in the tradition of James Bond, with nods to the best of every previous incarnation, but making bold moves beyond them.

I haven't felt so moved from a bond film... And I mean any of them. I grew up watching all the films, and they even inspired me to go to school to study film.It was very cathartic, but it put a close to a great franchise that are the Craig era films. The Hans Zimmer score was top tier throughout, and specifically the song titled ""Final Ascent"" took the whole scene and ending to a new realm in my opinion. I can't wait to see it many more times.

No you see the pun is in the writing that tells us that 007 is fine with sailing off in a little boat and leaving the new family man to take down an installation of bad guys single handily. Not exactly speaking volumes for the new gen 007 is it?Messing with the 007 formula is not a great tribute to Craig's final bond film. A great tribute would be to ""007 the extreme"" out the character but instead we have a weaker emotional bond going to places the James Bond theme park ride isnt supposed to take us. We paid our ticket and off we went but we never arrived at our destination.Malek as the villain does his best but oh boy is this a generic ""bad guy"" - he's so bad that its impossible to ever side with him and say, gee if I was in his position maybe I would have done the same. No, not so, the character is low-hanging fruit that will force an inevitable opinion of ""I dont like this guy, he's bad"". We aren't presented with his motivations or any significant back story.James bond isn't just an action film and it isn't just a spy thriller, it's very much its own brand and there are expectations associated with that.

I actually thought they'd loaded the wrong reel into the projector! ...this can't be a Bond film. The ending was a disaster for the franchise. And everything in between was a dreadful attempt to humanise Bond by trying to make him sentimental (with zero chemistry between him and the actress, Léa Seydoux), and a confusing plot only punctuated by action scenes to wake you up. Rami Malek was one of the worst villains ever, whilst Mads Mikkelsen was the best ever in Casino Royale, which by the way is the best Bond film for me of Craig's five, and Ana de Armas was fun and in keeping with the saga.I'm of an age where I grew up with Bond films and I cannot remember being so disappointed after having watched one. There is simply too much 'political correctness' in the world today, fuelled by social media, and this, I believe, is what's behind this film. They have tried to change, unsuccessfully, a formula that has worked for more than fifty years, with differing degrees of success, into something that is supposed to please all aspects of society. Instead, they've destroyed what is at the end of the day, a fictional character that has previously adapted to life's' changes quite well.Perhaps they should have kept Danny Boyle on, who apparently did NOT want to kill Bond off!Where will the producers and script writers go from here?",No Time to Die

> It's a reasonably well-crafted film
> First hour was pretty good. Great action scenes. Left us guessing
> Paloma (we universally agreed a contender for best ever 'Bond Girl')
> Some great acknowledgments to previous Bonds
> Solid inclusiveness, diversity. Bond is a good vehicle to tackle racial stereotypes and they embrace this in a good way.But, the negatives:
> You've killed Bond. This isn't Dr Who
> It became tedious and boring for a long while after about 90 mins
> M was damaged goods and unnecessarily diminished
> Lead baddie was barely in the film and had a nonsense of a rationale for his plan
> Key players killed without note: e.g. Blofeld and Leiter.Who knows how this film will be considered long term. All I'd say is that I and Bond-loving friends were left feeling like this was the end of what Bond has been. Assume that's the aim. We didn't like it.",No Time to Die

It was unnecessary drama that went against everything we know about Bond: he's indestructible, and always returns.

What failed miserably was the writing and plot.Firstly, the bad guys can't aim or drive to save their lives and there must be at least 500 bad guys who die in this movie without being able to kill anyone or even land a bullet. They also have elaborate plots to kill Vond instead of just hiring a sniper.Secondly, the villain has no point to him. His family was wiped out by Spectre and he decides to revenge them. This however somehow turns into him wanting to wipe out most of humanity for no reason. Also where did he get the money from to fund an army? He has a very weird and all over the place relationship with the female lead. In the end he dies because he came back to the island for no reason.Thirdly, there is a serious plot hole with bond. When he was in Cuba he was exposed to the nanobots and therefore has the formula to kill all Spectre agents within him. However, to bring in some drama they make it that he needs to be infected again to kill the bad guy.People also don't age in the movie.I scratched the surface of the terrible writing in this movie and the only way to fully appreciate it is to watch it yourself.",No Time to Die

Good triumphs over bad.Where is the inspiration for the next generation now that invincibility is gone?To use the hauntingly beautiful 'We have all the Time in the World' from George Lazenby's OHMSS in the closing scene was incredibly sad - a dagger to the heart.

No Time To Die wraps up Daniel Craig's saga as Bond in a much more satisfying manner than you would expect.However, the film itself is riddled with plotholes and inconsistencies, the action storyline feels somewhat forced, and Remi Malek unfortunately plays one of the least memorable Bond villains in history.In parallel, for a character renowned for not playing ""by the book"", No Time To Die features a Bond who, despite being refreshingly mature, is also utterly uncontroversial. This approach succeeds in painting Daniel Craig in the best possible light for his swansong appearance, but also renders Bond's role as no different from your average Action Man.It would not be a stretch to say that No Time To Die is not really a James Bond film at all - it is a Daniel Craig film.

Although James Bond passed away in this film, the ending was a happy ending. It is similar to Avengers Endgame with the ending. At first you are shocked and sad. After time, when you let it melt in your mouth, you slowly understand it and find it better and better. The movie had some minor problems like the ""Why?"".... It wasn't explained in a non-explicit way why the antagonist wants to kill exactly so many people. There is still a bit of drama missing. Maybe the scene where his family is killed should have been shown in the beginning, so that we could understand it a bit better. Or the end after James' death was a bit too compact. Nevertheless, simply ingenious and pure entertainment. That's what a movie is all about. In the old movies bond was ""only"" a woman-hating guy who saves the world. Mostly no character development to see. But here: From the ruthless killer who is a loner, to the broken man where everything he loves dies in his hands, to the person who can finally reach his destiny: Just once he wanted to save the love of his life and finally did it. The price for him was high, but he made it. For many probably not the perfect happy ending, but there is hope. This movie wasn't about a villain like basically all the movies before, it was centered on Bond, James Bond.I don't want to go too far out on a limb, but I'm sure I can say that: Although the film is not perfect, it is the best James Bond film.And one more thing: James Bond will return :)Story: 9.3/10

But it's let down by the character development: the villain is a lone wolf with half a back story. The previous movies did well to build up a prolific network of villains (Spectre, covering Le Chiffre to Blomfeld)... only to kill them off in one scene. Ana De Armas was billed as an ""anti-Bond girl"", yet is plastered on every billboard despite only appearing for five minutes of the film (so is in reality the usual ""hook"" Bond girl to draw people in). Passing mention is made to Vesper and Felix, before the latter is killed off at the start. So while it ties up loose ends - it feels like it's trying to do it too hastily.Finally, the cues on the major plot reveal (spoiler: his daughter) were scattered and unclear. If Madeleine has said she's not his daughter, why wouldn't we take that as true? So why does the villain keep referring to her as his daughter? The ""big reveal"" at the end is therefore not the culmination of a well developed plotline, but a flat reversal of the cue we were given earlier in the film.

All the worst elements of the last 5 years of political correctness and a mesmerisingly dull script have dragged Bond, not into the wonderfully diverse new world we all know is out there, but into a dystopian indulgent nightmare. .Broccoli and Wilson have had a cognitive.breakdown here and apparently neither they or anyone else, on or off the set, had the vision to say ""Are you sure about all this? We can't call this a Bond film surely"". Of course, we should always smell a rat when a film runs 2 hours 43 minutes. If you can't tell a story in around two hours something's up.

2337,rjewkes-50975,Not the same James Bond you know and love,4,13 October 2021,"Let me start off by telling you about my friend Ned. Ned has this thing where he shows up to things unexpectedly at the worst time possible, and yet is oblivious to the fact that he does this. It's just his character and it's quite comical.So why am I telling you about Ned? Because as I was sitting in the theater collecting my conflicting thoughts about NO TIME TO DIE, the so-called 'Epic Conclusion to the Daniel Craig Bond films', Ned approaches me from the back of the same theater. And yet he was the only one who stayed in character.This is a very different James Bond. If anything, he was more Daniel Craig than Bond. We see him reckless and vulnerable in Casino Royale. He becomes hard-ass and vengeful in Quantum of Solace. He returns to duty because he's that same hard-ass in Skyfall. In Spectre, he has a chance to allow himself to become vulnerable again after he's once again a reckless hard-ass. But not here.The beginning was perfect. Quite literally. He's finally getting to the point that he's forgiving Vesper so he can give himself fully to Madeline. But then that trust is scraped away in an instant, proving to himself as to why he has trust issues.But then he never comes back. It's just a steady downhill slope to a weird persona of Daniel Craig that's definitely not the hard-ass we see in Casino Royale and Skyfall, and isn't anything resembling a hint of the unique persona of his predecessor Bonds.The stunts were great, cinematography was incredible (long continuous shots in fight scenes as apposed to the quick Jason Bourne-esque fight scene cuts from Casino Royale), the music was fantastic (thanks Hans). But yet the story and direction just landed flat, especially in regards to a Bond film.My biggest problem with this film is how they completely wasted the potential for a dynamic villain in Rami Malek. His delivery was great, but his character wasn't strong enough to hold a decent threat to Bond like the other villains do. Which is a shame really that they had one of the most talented actors of our time and didn't use his full arsenal. Ana de Armes was fantastic as well and a great character, but was only on screen for about 10 minutes out of the 3 hour long movie.Overall it was a very mediocre and dull conclusion to an otherwise great run of Bond films. It's just a shame that the Daniel Craig era had to end this way when they went into this film with everything they needed to make a thrilling finale.",No Time to Die

Way too long, way too overly dramatic and a villain completly boring and shallow.I feel personally insulted by the ending. Why, just why? Please, like why. Why kill the enigmatic magic of James Bond. Bond can't die, that's part of his charm. No matter what, he always makes it. Always. I don't understand the necessity of crushing the concept of the character by making him die.

2344,sivertovrebo,"Great movie, but not the ending all bond fans wanted",9,5 October 2021,"Loved the movie. Have been waiting for a new Bond movie for a while and was happy to see it back on the big screen. The acting was great and the plot was, as expected, a usual Bond movie with explosions, car-chases and of course a beautiful Bond-girl.However, this is a sad ending to the Bond franchise. Very sad to see the end of James Bond, as the 007 agent for MI6, but I guess time changes. Change plots, characters, change everything! Except take away one of the most iconic movie figures to ever be made. Sad, very sad to see a legend go after so many decades, even though this is the 25 film to be made.Please make the next film with a ""James Bond"", where he somehow survived or dreamed it all. But just please let it be James that is the first thing I see when the next movie releases!",No Time to Die
2345,samduncan-52034,Amazing ending to an amazing Bond,10,10 October 2021,"I truly believe this is the best Bond film of all time. Daniel Craig has been a truly believable, rugged Bond with a psychotic slant to his character. His motorbike stunts, his dry sense of humour and his really believable storylines made me truly sad to wave goodbye to this era of James Bond.",No Time to Die
2346,ollyhills-40112,"Low expectation, High result.",9,10 October 2021,Really enjoyed it from start to finish! Watched it in IMAX and was throughly entertained. Yes the film does have a few draw backs but the overall tone and action sequences pay off massively and is a must see at the cinema. After a long time out I highly recommend this blockbuster!,No Time to Die
2347,djkimon,This is not a James Bond film...,3,6 October 2021,"All comments with only 1-5 stars you are readind are correct. I totally agree with all these disappointed movie viewers.The huge mistake of the production is that JAMES BOND is not Daniel Greg himself. JAMES BOND is a continiuty.Connery, Moore, ... Greg, and then someone new.What a disgraceful idea was to ""finish"" him???Bond is an Imaginery character who does not die. That's the idea. And we all know that decades now.Also it was very long, too melodramatic, and the script was a chaos sometimes.I felt very disappointed after watching this film..And after his death, James Bond for the movie fans can't be ressurected.. Because as i said before, the point was that Bond always survived at the end...",No Time to Die
2348,2EZ42G,Bot what i expected,7,5 October 2021,When u watch bond u ussually get women cars and watches. You rarely get it here and now i finally realize that the plot of bond is stupid.From the start i felt like the director hates spectre. It just feels like a sequel that tries everything to destroy something.Positives are ana de armas. Just felt like she added some comedy which marvel studio people know that it brings money.,No Time to Die
2349,r_c198mp,Pathetic...,1,9 November 2021,"No excuse for this joke of a film. This film is unwatchable. I didn't finish it, so it rates a 1 and that is only because we can't rate a film any lower. Easily the worst Bond movie ever made.",No Time to Die
2350,lenaleigh-95560,Disappointing,1,10 October 2021,So terribly disappointing. I thought of asking for my money back. A thousand violins were not enough to drag a single tear from the theater's crowd.,No Time to Die
