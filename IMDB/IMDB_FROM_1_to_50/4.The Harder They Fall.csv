0,nogodnomasters,From Bad to Badder,8,2 November 2021,"This is a black western that opens up selling itself as a 70s grindhouse. The claim is the characters are real. The events are fictional. The sound track is modern. The film centers on Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) who as a child was marked by outlaw Rufus Buck (Idris Elba). Rufus murdered his parents. Long story short, they meet up again with a cast of characters.The purpose of the film appears to alert us to the fact that many cowboys were black. I enjoyed it.Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity.",The Harder They Fall
1,classicsoncall,"""Well, now there's us..., and there's y'all.""",8,4 November 2021,"I happen to belong to that school of thought that says I've never seen a Western I didn't like. As I come here for this review, ""The Harder They Fall"" only merits a 6.0 rating from over four thousand viewers, and that to me seems considerably on the low side. Although the film really doesn't break any new ground in the area of story telling, I did find it highly entertaining and enjoyable. As I read some of the more negative reviews, there seems to be a preponderance of those who can't accept the idea of black cowboys in the Old West, but even a modest internet search will reveal that there were plenty, many of them freed slaves who went West following the Civil War. And it's not like the concept has never been attempted before. As far back as the Thirties, there were a handful of all Black Western films starring Herb Jeffries as a singing cowboy who's voice sounded to me a lot like Gene Autry.The Tarantino influence is fairly evident in this picture. There's a lot of stylized violence and the song track is updated for a modern day hip-hop, reggae experience. For some, that would take the viewer right out of the story since the culture clash is right in your face, but I didn't find it all that distracting. What's novel here is a story about two outlaw gangs that go up against each other with the primary motivation being what it usually is - money, lots of it, and who it belongs to. The Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) gang finds itself allied with legendary lawman Bass Reeves (Delroy Lindo), a name most wouldn't be familiar with, including myself up until a few ago. As a real historical figure, Reeves operated as a lawman in the post-Civil War Territory of Oklahoma, arresting over three thousand outlaws and killing fourteen men.Opposing the Love Gang is an outlaw bunch that goes by the name of Crimson Hood, led by the notorious Rufus Buck (Idris Elba). Buck is a prisoner when we first meet him, making his escape when Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Cherokee Bill (LaKeith Stanfield) free him from a prison train. There's a connection between Buck and Love that's not readily apparent when they first come across each other, although observant Western fans might figure it out right out of the gate. Once it starts, the showdown between the rival desperadoes hits a fever pitch in the town of Maysville, Texas. It's where the androgynous Cuffee (Danielle Deadwyler) makes a transformative appearance in a red dress to help Nat Love rob a bank in order to settle a score with Rufus Buck. He/she also surprises with an unseen quick draw on Cherokee Bill that takes him out of the story, a character actually that I was sorry to see who didn't make it to the end of the picture.In any event, I thought the film was a blast, and was happy to catch it on it's Netflix debut last night. If it serves the purpose of inspiring a search into the history of black cowboys and the aforementioned All Black Western film genre, it will have done a nice side job to that of standing well on it's own. Just getting back to Herb Jeffries a minute, the pictures he appeared in play like virtually thousands of old B Westerns of the era, but the fact that he's in an all black cast is what makes it unusual. If you'd like a recommendation, try ""Two Gun Man From Harlem"", one of my favorites.",The Harder They Fall
2,Tweekums,An impressive modern western,9,6 November 2021,"As this western opens a reverend, his wife and their ten year old son are sitting down for dinner when a man, with associates, comes to the door. He clearly has a grudge to settle with the reverend. The woman then the reverend are gunned down before the man cuts the boy's forehead with a razor.Years pass and the boy, Nat Love, has become a man. He is operating on the wrong side of the law; although he and his gang target other thieves rather than robbing banks himself. He has also been hunting down those who killed his parents; apart from Rufus Buck, the actual killer, who is rotting in Yuma Jail. One day Buck is being transferred by train and is sprung by his gang; they return to their hometown of Redwood. Nat's latest robbery has left them desperately short of funds. Buck wants the money back with interest and Love wants his revenge. Inevitably the two gangs will clash and many involved will not survive.I first heard of this film when I read a news article about a soon to be released mostly black western; I like the genre and wondered how it would compare to more traditional westerns. It might not be the best western I've seen but it is far from the worst and to be honest the race of the characters doesn't affect the story. The characters are nicely varied; the villains are bad but not unsympathetic and the heroes are mostly good but hardly pure. Jonathan Majors impresses as Nat Love and Idris Elba is great as Rufus Buck. The rest of the cast is impressive; I particularly liked Zazie Beetz as Stagecoach Mary, Regina King as Trudy Smith, Danielle Deadwyler as Cuffee and Delroy Lindo as Marshal Bass Reeves. Writer/Director Jeymes Samuel is clearly a fan of the genre; capturing the classic feel of westerns with more modern attitudes to realistic violence and some salty language. The action is impressive and at times fairly bloody. There is a degree of humour, enough to make me laugh without getting in the way of the action. I was particularly amuse by Marysville; a 'white town' where the people are white, the buildings are painted white and even the dust is white! There are some flaws of course; at almost two hours twenty minutes it is a bit too long. Some people might not be keen on the reggae sound track but I thought it worked surprisingly well. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of westerns; it may have all black leads and several strong female characters but doesn't feel 'politically correct' or preachy because it is a cracking story.",The Harder They Fall
3,searchanddestroy-1,The harder I fell,5,7 November 2021,"I expected far more from this new Blaxploitation film, because I crave for the seventies ones. But in this time, it was different, more social, more daring and authentic. Here, I like the characters where the bad guys are shown as if they were good ones, where supporting characters have as much depth as the lead ones. Some splendid moments but unfortunately jeopardized by lousy sound, music and slow motion effects in action scenes, too Western Spaghetti for me. In the seventies, Blaxploitation did not mix up with spaghetti, which was also a genre in fashion at the same time; and maybe that's why it did not melt. The lousy way of filming is too modern for me who compares with the old Blaxploitation. But it's not a bad film, far from that. It only doesn't fit whith what I expected, that's all. Idris Elba is excellent as the bad guy. He steals the role from the lead good guy.",The Harder They Fall
4,CinemaSerf,"It's OK, without the corral...",6,7 November 2021,"I suppose the underlying message here is that not all real cowboys looked like John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart.... Otherwise, it's a pretty weakly structured story of revenge that, unfortunately, left me pretty cold. It starts in the home of a preacher having a family supper when in comes a man, wielding two golden guns. He quickly dispatches the parents, and carves the young son with a cross on his forehead. Shift on twenty years and this young boy ""Nat"" (Jonathan Majors), having tracked down and killed all the other members of the gang, discovers that their leader (Idris Elba) has escaped from prison and so his final plan for revenge is soon in play. Problem with this is that there are just far too many characters, most of whom add virtually nothing to the pretty standard, indeed really quite contrived, central narrative. Elba has no menace whatsoever, and the supporting cast all seem to lack any real commitment to their roles. Often, it is as if they are offering performances consistent with a big budget, but fairly run-of-the-mill television movie. Feisty Zazie Betts (""Mary Fields"") makes for quite a decent, entertaining, denouement with Regina King's (""Trudy Smith"") but otherwise, this is a long old two hours of ordinary film-making with a really rather disappointing conclusion.",The Harder They Fall
5,paul-allaer,Black western hits the marks,7,23 October 2021,"As ""The Harder They Fall"" (2021 release; 137 min.) opens, we are reminded that ""Although These Events Are Fictional, These. People. Existed."" We watch as a Black family in the remote West sometime in the mid-to-late 19th century is about to have dinner, someone knocks on the door. We have no idea who this is, but the guy goes on to brutally murder the parents in front of the young son, who for good measure gets a cross cut into his forehead. We then go to ""Salinas, Texas, Some Time Later"", and the young boy is now a grown man (still with the cross scar on his forehead), named Nat Love, and part of the Love gang. He is searching for the killer of his parents, and it's not long before all hell breaks loose... At this point we are 10 min into the film.Couple of comments: this is the feature-length debut of British musician Jaymes Samuel (brother of singer Seal). Jay-Z is credited as one of the producers. Samuel brings us a Black western, in which there is very little room for whites (the only sequence with whites is the train heist). The movie is highly stylish and very visual. I had no idea of any of this when I walked into the theater. I was simply looking for a good movie, and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it all. The movie features an all-star cast of Black performers, none more so than Jonathan Majors (""The Last Black Man in San Francisco""), as Nat Love, although Regina King (as one of the many bad-asses in the movie) also shines in her own way. Please note that the violence is in your face, if not over the top, almost Quentin Tarantino-like. In fact, this film reminded me on more than one occasion of the great Tarantino, and that's saying something. The movie features a bunch of great song placements and I can't wait for the soundtrack (which will be released in early November). The only criticism I have is that the film's running time is unnecessarily long at 2 hrs. 20 min and could easily have been trimmed by 20-30 minutes without losing anything essential, but in the end it's a minor quibble.""The Harder They Fall"" premiered in early October at the London film festival to immediate acclaim. There is a reason why this film currently is rated 87% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie was released in theaters this weekend for a limited run before it moves to Netflix in early November. Thankfully my art-house theater here in Cincinnati had it on its lineup. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 2 people including myself), which is a shame. If you are in the mood for a highly stylish, at times Tarantino-reminding Black western, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Harder They Fall
6,billcr12,Gunslingers in the Hood,6,7 November 2021,"Iris Elba, Regina King and the beautiful Zazie Beetz lead a strong cast in this epic Western with a seemingly endless cast of thousands and that is the problem. Too many characters within a routine spaghetti western of the kind made by Sergio Leone in the 1960s and later by Clint Eastwood and Quentin Tarantino, whose influence is obvious. Every other line contains QT's catchphrase ""mother******."" It is unnecessary and distracting. I was worn out after the two hours plus running time and wished that the editor had tightened things up a bit. In spite of my criticisms, The Harder They Fall is a decent throwback cowboy movie.",The Harder They Fall
7,stevendbeard,Entertaining Black Western,6,24 October 2021,"I saw ""The Harder They Fall"", starring Jonathan Majors-Loki_tv, White Boy Rick; Zazie Beetz-Atlanta_tv, Joker; Regina King-Watchmen_tv, This Christmas and Idris Elba-Cats, This Christmas.This is a Black Western that is based on real people that existed in the old west. Idris plays a bad_to_the_bone outlaw that kills Jonathan's parents. Jonathan was 10 years old at the time but when he gets older, he goes after his revenge on Idris and his bad_to_the_bone gang. Jonathan picks the gang members off, one by one, but by the time he gets to Idris, Idris is in prison for life, so, out of his reach. Regina is Idris' girlfriend-and the leader of Idris' gang, in his absence-and she gets their gang to break Idris out. Jonathan hears about this and gets his own gang together-including his girlfriend, Zazie-and decides to go after Idris and finish his revenge plans. Although it's pretty violent, there is some humor-one of the funniest jokes is when the outlaws raid a 'White Town'-and there are a couple of Black comedians that have cameos. There is not much new here but it is an entertaining experience.It's rated ""R"" for violence and language & has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.I would probably buy it on DVD.",The Harder They Fall
8,henry8-3,The Harder They Fall,7,5 November 2021,"After a shocking flashback beginning, anti hero outlaw Majors discovers that his enemy, the vile Idris Alba has escaped from prison and sets out to bring him down and reassembles his old gang to do this.Easy to dismiss this as Tarantinoesque which in many ways it is, but director and co-writer Samuel has created a glorious visual feast of a western, with terrific, mostly African American - particularly LaKeith Stanfield - actors playing a group of memorable characters. It is full of great action scenes and a wonderfully dark sense of humour and backed up with a memorable soundtrack of individual songs and background music. Interestingly this is brutal film, but not as excessive as Tarantino and also remarkably light on strong language. Alba is fabulous as the truly ghastly, ruthless Rufus Buck well supported by Regina King and his final speech which takes us back to the cause of Major's strong hatred is surprisingly moving. A terrific fun western.",The Harder They Fall
9,joiningjt,Hey Tarantino WATCH this film It's how you ACTUALLY make a western EXTREMELY UNDERRATED!!,8,3 November 2021,"This is an excellent western why it's getting such low scores must be because it's an all black cast. 1st off I'm a 60 year old white man and I dont get it, its not tombstone or Bone tomahawk but it's right up there.

The soundtrack, intrusive rather than supportive, grates on the ears, the story is just a Tarantino-esque mishmosh of better ideas.

11,Xstal,Once Upon a Time in Black America...,8,3 November 2021,"A wild bunch of good, bad and ugly outlaws fight over a few more than a fistful of dollars with true grit, before, after and during high noon, saddles ablaze with nothing to dodge, magnificent as many times as you like.",The Harder They Fall
12,IonicBreezeMachine,"Stylish and brutal, but also overlong with not much character resonance.",6,4 November 2021,"Orphaned at a young age by the Rufus Buck Gang, Nat Love (Johnathan Majors) has grown up to form his own gang and has killed the last man who killed his parents while Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) rots in prison and now seeks to rekindle his relationship with former partner and lover Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz). Rufus Buck's lieutenants, Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Cherokee Bill (Lakeith Stanfield) make a deal with the government in exchange for a pardon for Rufus Buck, and Buck and his gang head to the all-black town of Redwood City and remove the corrupt sheriff and former member of Buck's gang, Wiley Escoe (Deon Cole) from power asserting the town under Rufus Buck's authority. When Nat Love gets wind that Rufus Buck is free and rebuilding his power, Love reassembles his gang with Mary, Jim Beckwourth (RJ Cyler), Bill Pickett (Edi Gathegi), and Cuffee (Danielle Deadwyler) with help from U. S. Marshal Bass Reeves (Delroy Lindo) who's mutually interested in taking down Rufus Buck.Since appearing on the scene in supporting roles in films like Hostiles and White Boy Rick and the TV docudrama miniseries When We Rise playing Young Ken Jones, Johnathan Majors has slowly but surely become a major actor to look out for scoring leads in the short lived HBO horror series Lovecraft Country as well as appearing to strong acclaim in the likes of films such as Da 5 Bloods and The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Produced Will Smith's Overbrook Entertainment, Musician Shawn Carter (aka Jay-Z), and frequent Quentin Tarantino collaborator Lawrence Bender, the movie is the feature directing debut of musician/music producer Jeymes Samuel who supervised the soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatspy and co-wrote the script with Boaz Yakin. The movie features a predominantly black cast and strives to be a stylish musically infused take on gritty revenge westerns and the movie certainly has all the right pieces in place to do so. Unfortunately while the movie has all the right ingredients, they don't come together as well as you want them to.Stylistically speaking the movie looks amazing, the cinematography and costuming is gorgeous with these very colorful western towns brought to life and integrated with an energized soundtrack helping establish its identity out of the gate. The opening scene where we see Nat Love as a child witness the murder of his parents by Rufus Buck is amazingly done because you don't see Rufus Buck's face as he's shot mostly from the back or from over the shoulder giving him an imposing presence as an antagonist. When the movie does reveal Idris Elba about 40 minutes in where he steps out from the shadows in a well-choreographed train heist sequences that's both tense as well as stylish it's probably one of the best villain introductions I've seen in a modern western. The action is also quite well done with the impacts nicely conveyed and real sense of brutality to is given to them (especially a scene where Rufus Buck pistol whips a corrupt sheriff in front of a terrified town).Unfortunately once the novelty of the style wears off after the strong opening introduction the movie becomes less and less engaging as it goes on. A big issue with The Harder They Fall is in its length because the movie clocks in at 2 hours and 19 minutes when it would be better served by being 1 hour and 40 minutes at most. The movie is a pretty straight forward revenge story, and while sometimes those can justify their length (such as Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2) The Harder They Fall doesn't have the writing or character needed to justify its length down to the fact the movie manufactures a conflict with Stagecoach Mary doing a pretty ill advised action which leads her getting captured by Buck where Buck forces Nat Love to rob a bank in a white town (both literally and figuratively) which seems like it's only there to stretch the story to this length. You can tell the movie is directed by someone with a music background because not only is the soundtrack often front and center, but several scenes feel like they're one step away from turning into musical numbers (which actually does happen every so often) and while the look can sometimes be to this film's advantage such as the colorful buildings that make up Redwood City, othertimes it becomes quite distracting such as the previously mentioned white town where everything, and I do mean everything is painted white in what I guess is supposed to be a joke, but it's such a broad and exaggerated joke it feels like something that should be in a parody and not in a (somewhat) serious western.Most of the performances are kind of lost among the style and excess of the rest of the movie. The one major standout who I thought gave a really strong performance was Delroy Lindo playing a fictionalized take on U. S. Marshal Bass Reeves and while the role isn't written with all that much depth, Lindo gives the character this world weariness that gives some needed weight and investment to the film and gave the character a lot of credibility thanks to his performance. Idris Elba gets a decent introduction with a really strong train robbery set piece, but after that sequence he doesn't really get to do all that much until the very end of the movie which doesn't strike the emotional resonance it should. Johnathan Majors is serviceable as the lead, but he's also not really called upon for any commanding moments where he's allowed to own the scene and often is just sort of ""there"". Majors' Nat Love character has both a revenge plot as well as a romantic plot with Zazie Beetz' Stagecoach Mary and neither Nat Love's revenge nor his relationship with Stagecoach Mary really comes to a boiling point and feels like it's stuck on a mild simmer more than anything else.The Harder they Fall certainly is stylish and well made, but it's also not as substantive as it needs to be to justify its near 2 and ½ hour length. I think Jeymes Samuel does have merit as a director and I would like to see him do another movie, but he also needs an editor that can keep his vision focused. There's a strong performance from Delroy Lindo and some forceful fight sequences and if you are a fan of westerns or Tarantino films this might be worth a one time viewing, but I can't really give it much more than that.",The Harder They Fall
13,MadamWarden,ITALIAN STYLE SHOOTEMUP,6,9 November 2021,"A reasonably fun, stylish black spaghetti western. Nice little touches like the White town. Fun cameos but no real character development. Fun score.Worth a watch for sure.",The Harder They Fall
14,Holt344,"Ambiguous yet too flawed to truly kick off, this is a western that you'll either like or dislike and my opinion is mixed",6,4 November 2021,"The Harder They Fall is director Jeymes Samuel's feature film debut and it shows, the direction is very flawed. But the vision he has for the film deserves praise as he strides to make a visually good looking film and he succeeded with that, he co-wrote the screenplay with Boaz Yakin who is known for blockbusters. The writing is flawed but overall good, except for most of the dialogue. But one thing that I absolutely loved about the film is of course the cinematography, Mihai Malaimare Jr's work is yet again mesmerizing. Having worked as a cinematographer for films like The Master and Jojo Rabbit.With it being one of very few Westerns whose principal cast members are all African-American, it's a fictional story with most actors playing historical figures. But it's pure fiction and the writing could have been better. Yet a western film with African American actors and characters is nice to see and is played by some great actors, the performances ranges from great to okey. Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, Regina King and Delroy Lindo are among the best.The film stars Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, Regina King, Delroy Lindo, Lakeith Stanfield, RJ Cyler, Danielle Deadwyler, Edi Gathegi and Deon Cole. The story follows outlaw Nat Love as he discovers that his enemy Rufus Buck is being released from prison he rounds up his gang to track Rufus down and seek revenge. Those riding with him in this assured, righteously new school Western include his former love Stagecoach Mary, his right and left hand men hot-tempered Bill Pickett and fast drawing Jim Beckwourth and a surprising adversary-turned-ally. Rufus Buck has his own fearsome crew, including ""Treacherous"" Trudy Smith and Cherokee Bill, and they are not a group that knows how to lose.The Harder They Fall is a film I really looked forward to watch and did it meet ny expectations? Nope, I found myself bored at times because of the pacing was terrible. Lots of scenes could have been trimmed down. The dialogue wasn't strong enough and therefore, the jokes fell flat. The sets and locations used in this film was so nice, bringing quality to the film. Just wished the costume department would have been on the same level. The action sequences has some Quentin Tarantino vibes but without the great camera angles, though the cinematography and how many of the scenes are shot, it's a great looking film, artistically. But the action sequences had the potential to be great but ended up okey. Something I disliked was the soundtrack, mainly because how it's not fitting well with the western genre, fitting more the crime genre. Much of the film feels that way, Jeymes Samuel could have created a great crime film but instead he did a western without any thought of historical accuracy or of the overall authenticity. Honestly, the director seems too inspired by Quentin Tarantino's style of making movies which is a hard thing to copy, his direction is far from great as his and his writing is far from great as Tarantino's. Enough of negativity, I absolutely think that Jeymes Samuel has the potential to become a good filmmaker but this wasn't a great film. Great looking, yes. I also think that the second half of the film is pretty good, but the first half needs to be trimmed immensely to fix the pacing.",The Harder They Fall

23,ExpendableMan,"""Even the Devil needs money""",9,4 November 2021,"Netflix hits the bullseye with The Harder They Fall. This epic western with a predominantly black cast is one of the best films of 2021; a rollicking old-school adventure with an anachronistic soundtrack, masses of shoot outs and a brilliant cast tearing up the screen. To put it bluntly, it rules.The film begins when ten year old Nat Love is traumatised by the murder of his parents, gunned down at the family dinner table by ""the Devil himself,"" gang boss Rufus Buck. Years later, the adult Love (Jonathan Majors - excellent) confronts one of Buck's gang at a Church. He riddles him with bullet holes, sending the despicable villain spiralling through the air with blood spraying. Love then suggests the vicar capitalise by taking the body to collect the $3000 bounty.""Why don't you collect it,"" asks the vicar.""I'm worth ten,"" Love grins.From this searing introduction, the film expands into a riotously entertaining western with an incredible ensemble cast. Majors is the coolest cowboy to ever pull on the spurs, but he's also a complex and conflicted character whose arc develops in unexpected and enthralling ways. As the villainous Buck, Idris Elba excels, playing against type as a cold and ruthless killer who burns up the screen, even in the scenes where his face isn't shown.They're supported by a cast including Lakeith Stanfield's quietly psychotic Cherokee Bill, Zazie Beetz' hard-as-nails Stagecoach Mary and perhaps best of all, Regina King's dynamite performance as Trudy Smith. As Buck's second-in-command, King is a formidable villain, almost as dastardly as her boss and she comes within a whisker of stealing the entire film.Throw in some blistering gunfights, tense stand-offs and a hilarious detour into ""a white town"" and you've got two and a half hours of sheer cinematic joy. The soundtrack kicks, the cast give it their all, the action is top notch and there's a surprising emotional heft too, especially in the latter half. There will be other films that come out this year which get rated higher, but none of them will see Delroy Lindo walking down a main street in a full-length duster coat, gunning down everyone he sets eyes on. The Harder They Fall kicks ass and I for one had a great time.",The Harder They Fall

Period.I liked the soundtrack; however, it could have been better developed and more soulful.The film simply shows black cowboys existed in not so solid blaxploitation form.This film is not Tarantino-esque, though the influence is murkily possible.Overall, this film is boring. Funny but boring. It plays like money was spent; so, the film had to get released.",The Harder They Fall
25,Darkjak007,Once upon a time in the black west,7,7 November 2021,"The Harder they fall tells the story of Nat love(Johnathan Majors) who when he was a little boy, his home is invaded by a man named Rufus Buck(Idris Elba) who murders his Father & Mother. Decades later after being captured buck is freed by his gang. Now Nat recruits a gang to head out to exact his revenges. So lets be honest when you think of westerns, a black cast doesn't come to most people minds. Although it's been shown to work with films like Django unchained and Buck and the Preacher. So I was curious want this film had to offer. The Harder they fall manages to not only capture that wild west feel, but also managing to have a fun and do it's own thing. The production design of the sets are done with good detail, with some nice land shots. Such as the train and the saloon It's a Netflix film that does have effort put into it. The cast leaves a memorable impact. While Nat is kind of more of your basic western lied again he's a man out for revenge that's pretty standard for westerns. What they choose to do with his character, what it supposed to mean was an interesting touch. Idris character who is how you would expect from him as the villain he's cold and a monster, but has this rather opposing status. The overall endgame and what they choose to do with his character I enjoyed. Same with like Regina king and Lakeith Stanfield both are so calm, but aren't interested in games. They don't just feel like nameless henchman number 1, number 2. The overall tone of the movie, while it still has your classic revenge theme. Which most western it's a requirement. It takes time to have fun and much of the humor from the love gang hits well. The banter between the Marshall and them is good. How they emphasize about robbing an all ""white town"", and when we get there it's literally an all white painted town. The music's also rather surprising the soundtrack consists primary of rap with a mixes of reggae thrown in. It shouldn't work with the exception of the opening credits it actually does really works really well. Of course the soul of every good western is it's action. The fighting and shootouts very fast pace, very brutal there's plenty of blood Spurts. The final shootout manages to nail it all. One of the few thing i didn't really care for was the romance between Nat and Mary it didn't really serve a purpose other then driving them into Redwood. Despise saying that they have a past together I don't really care I don't buy their feelings for each other. Overall the movies good, its worth checking out if your a fan of western and looking for something familiar yet new.",The Harder They Fall

30,Lewis_Heather787,Much better than you think!!!,7,7 November 2021,"This film was a very welcome surprise and another example of Netflix building is reputation as a major studio these days!!! This film is bold, fun, extremely enjoyable, unique, different and very entertaining throughout!Jeymes Samuel what a breath of fresh air you have brought into the genre of westerns. I'd imagine that he was heavy influenced by ""Django Unchained"" by Tarantino however I think Quentin would take that as the ultimate compliment. That is not to say that this is a direct copy of anyone else's work because it is 100% not!! This film oozes style and is such a cool addition to the western genre, I feel it may even be a way into this genre for a whole new younger audience. The directing is simply brilliant and I find it to be one of the strongest parts of this film. His choice of shots and transitions throughout the film changes and keeps you engaged throughout. Very modern and different approach with so nice to see. Awesome work, I cant wait to see when this guy brings out another film !!!What an incredible cast !!! I won't talk about all of them because I'll definitely run over the word count on here haha. Idris Elba, Jonathan Major, LaKeith Stanfield, RJ Cyler and Edi Gathegi to me are absolutely flawless from start to finish. All of their characters are given time to flesh out individually and also as a collective. All brought a different element to the table and the interactions between them was fantastic, surprisingly funny in some instances. The best part about their performances and characters is the fact that as the audience we end up caring about them and what happens to them. Samuel and Boaz Yakin have created such a rich, vibrant world for these multi layered characters to live in and is a pure joy to watch. They wrote emotion, stakes and laughs into one rollercoaster of a script.75% out 100 I had no idea that this film was going to be as good as this!!! Always got to be careful with trying to modernise a genre because it may not work. Thankfully this works to perfection, I cant wait to watch it again! Fantastic directing, phenomenal cast, great fun story and a satisfying, emotional and warranted ending!Lastly the soundtrack and score to this film is the cherry on top of the cake!",The Harder They Fall

32,nidhunmoviebuff,"Idris Elba and Jonathan Majors shine in this stylish, old school Western!",7,4 November 2021,"An ensemble star-studded cast can more often not that not be a crutch that breaks down the narrative as the director tries to justify each actor's role. But thankfully, director Jeymes Samuel had a screenplay that made his job easier with each of the superstars on show putting in masterful performances.The film's hero is also ironically Marvel's next big villain, Jonathan Majors, who played Kang the Conqueror in Loki and is set to essay the same role in Ant Man: Quantumania. Majors stars as the outlaw 'Noah Love' who is traversing the Old West to claim retribution from the notorious Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) and his gang for having killed his parents.Despite using the same old-school Western templates and motifs, it is the performances that stand out with Elba oozing gravitas in every frame he is in as per usual and Majors providing an able foil. Oscar winner Regina King and Oscar nominee Lakeith Steinfeld shine in well-crafted, impactful supporting roles.Just when you get the feeling that the movie is falling back on old tropes and western-film clichés, the director will throw a spanner into the works and completely catch you off-guard. The action sequences are painstakingly detailed but clearly realism was sacrificed to make room for stylishness.The fact that the director made his mark as a song writer and producer first is evident from the film's music. Each turn in the storyline and crunch sequence is layered with soulful tracks from artists ranging from Jay-Z and Kid Cudi to Judakiss and Conway The Machine and many more.A gritty, exhilarating western elevated by a talented, in-form cast, where even the music ends up becomes a protagonist.

In a horribly failed attempt to be ""tough"" or ""hard"" they went beyond those and became dense and thick. The acting was over the top bad complete with over acting under acting and plain old bad acting. The interaction between Love and Mary was unbelievable to say the least.I cannot even believe that the makers of this film want the watcher to believe that in these times a train would stop for someone on the tracks. Nor can I believe that they expect the watcher to believe that an entire troop would surrender to train robbers.It only gets worse from there.It gets 5 stars for Idris Elba.

The performances are fine across the board. But the script, especially the unnecessarily overlong monologues, is tedious and lifeless. There's just not enough plot to support the two hours and ten minutes run time. This makes for a waste of some fine acting talent, especially Elba and King. On the bright side, Danielle Deadwyler is wonderful, comedic or serious she rules the roost here.

36,Spartan_1_1_7,A Surprisingly Fresh Western with an All Black Cast. Oozing with Style.,7,9 November 2021,"The Harder They Fall (2021) is a western film with a complete Black cast as the main characters portraying real people who existed back in the day in a fictional story. It's a tale of revenge split between the outlaw group whose leader is hunting the people that did him wrong and the outlaw group whose leader did the wrongdoing. As a whole in terms of story, it's nothing new, but where this movie shines and gives you a fresh experience is in its execution.From the getgo, you can tell that this is a passion project for Jeymes Samuel, the director and co-writer, who wanted to give a unique or different feel to a well-known genre. The madlad also did the soundtrack and worked tightly with the cinematographer and editor so that his clean and polished vision of westerns can be properly brought on to the screen. The film is oozing with style and slickness as all the technical elements synergize together properly and seamlessly flow. It looks great and sounds great, and the odd mix of hip-hop and classic western music works surprisingly well.The main attraction of the film, though, is the amazing cast. Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, Lakeith Stanfield, Regina King, Zazzie Beats and the rest of them were on top of their game and since they were inhabiting colourful/interesting characters, it was an absolute blast watching them go at it. Couple that with fun and often interesting dialogue and I could watch these characters interact with each other for a long time.While not a full-blown action film, whatever thrilling scenes it did have were entertaining and bloody. The pacing can be slow for long stretches, though, as you go through the 140 mins runtime while things are being set up but it's not boring. I was enjoying the characters a great deal regardless of whether they are shooting each other or are just conversing. In fact, the first 40-50 mins or so were amazing. I was hooked and was loving the larger-than-life feel of some of the characters as well as the visuals and sounds accompanying it. It's a pleasure in a Home Theater.However, where the movie faltered for me was in the second half where it lost some of that steam and intrigue. The biggest issue for me was that the writing couldn't balance all the main characters well and some remained on the sidelines throughout as well as the expectations that get built up early on and not being delivered fully. There was also a lack of Idris Elba that kinda annoyed me and I was so wishing that the creators could somehow channel Tarantino to have long stretches of dialogue for key scenes. I kinda wish they focused a bit less on the romance and more on the smaller characters as well as the personal vendetta.Also, the final shootout, while thrilling and enjoyable, did ask for a lot of suspension of disbelief. The stormtrooper aim got ridiculous at points. And had the movie ended that way, I would have been disappointed but thankfully it had a trump card that was played wonderfully in the end and brought it home nicely even if I wish it was given a few mins more.All in all, this was a welcome surprise. I honestly wasn't expecting to get something fresh from a genre that has been done so many times but here we are. Sure the film has its faults that keep it from being a truly great experience for me but it is still damn good and I'd recommend it without a second thought. It's on Netflix, so you can easily access it. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 7.8/10.",The Harder They Fall
37,isaacochoterena,Very good movie,8,8 November 2021,"This movie is entertaining and also manages to stand out in several ways.The development of the story is very good that it manages to keep your attention focused on what is going to happen, most of the characters are well developed, although there are some others of which nothing is developed, the plot twist is convincing and enlightening, the action and blood scenes are compelling, the acting is very good, the photography is colorful, the cinematography is good, the costume design is remarkable, the production design is mind-blowing. There are some editing errors, some character development is lacking and in some parts it becomes similar to Tarantino films due to the unexpected violence it handles.It is a film that I enjoyed a lot and that I feel was very close to being perfect, but without a doubt it is one of the best films of the year.",The Harder They Fall

It has the trannies, Black and Woman Power, and Kill Whitey agenda.I thought some of the jokes were pretty funny and I thought it was a fun watch overall. The Black on Black crime is also pretty funny as a microcosm of today's violence in Democrat cities.People that really get off on watching cool, bling-bling black people do an artsy ""Western thingy,"" with modern accents, colorful sets, and the current, Hollywood racism against white people, will really like this movie.For everyone else, it's either really boring, really bad, or just ok.It's got a great plot and concept, actually, just ruined by the director and today's Hollywood.

44,BijeshNagesh,A Genre-Redefining Spectacle,10,5 November 2021,"Some people might see this movie as a classic Western but with a progressive African-American twist. But there's so much more to ""The Harder They Fall"" than meets the eye.Directed by Jeymes Samuel for Netflix, with him also writing the screenplay (packed with symbolism, wordplay, and wit) with Boaz Yakin, as well as handling the musical score (!), you won't be wrong in assuming that a certain style of genius went into making this movie.""The Harder They Fall"" contained everything needed to redefine the genre without remaking it entirely. Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s cinematography took the cake and Antoinette Messam's costume design was the cherry on it.Art direction, production design, editing, set decoration, and soundtracks - that theme song by Koffee was sublime, Pretty Yende gave us Western-opera gold, Seal made a love song you won't soon forget, CeelLo Green added a superb tune to the mix, Barrington Levy sang unforgettable notes, Kid Cudi brought slivers of perfection, and Fatoumata Diawara added chunks of excellence - all worked 'movie magic' on this project, to say nothing of what the stunt and sound departments accomplished. Remarkable work also by the hair and makeup department - especially the realistic blood splatter and staining. Their collective efforts 'sold' each scene in this must-watch 'Netflix Western'.Real, raw, heart-warming, heart-breaking, and brutal... The artists too brought their A-game. Performances by Idris Elba (As Rufus Buck), Delroy Lindo (as Bass Reeves), LaKeith Stanfield (as Cherokee Bill), Zazie Beetz (as Mary Fields), Edi Gathegi (as Bill Pickett), RJ Cyler (as Jim Beckworth), Danielle Deadwyler (as Cuffee), Jonathan Majors (as Nat Love), and Regina King (as Trudy Smith) all did outstanding work. Other cast members provided splendid support.Bloody robberies, betrayals, deceptions, tragic romances, plot twists, and 'Wild West' themes galore... You name it, this movie has it. A superb revenge arc unfolded between outlaw Nat Love and criminal Rufus Buck. Gangs take sides after Rufus is broken out of incarceration during a prisoner-transit - the train-break scene was mindblowing. Action, the purposeful kind, held sway. It saw Netflix's ""The Harder They Fall"" through to a fantastic finish.Jeymes made it harder than I'd expected to find fault with this film. It is a game-changer and standard-setter, especially in regards to the 'representation' angle. The film was not just an ode to Black Culture but was also immensely entertaining. This is one Western you simply have to see to realize the risk, bravery, and genius that went into its making. ""The Harder They Fall"" (IMDB)",The Harder They Fall

The flashy cinematography, garish color palette, and the extravagant violence comes together in this black and white western, I have no problem with all of that. Unfortunately having only those things doesn't make a good movie. You need to also have a good dialogue, good acting, good characters and a good story. That's where the movie is lacking. These so called famous actors aren't acting for most of the time, they just strike poses like they think those gunslingers would do back in the days. I really can't stand the dialogue, some of them are good. Half the time they're just really cringey punchline. There aren't much characters either. They're mostly just cringe looking dude and gal with worn-out and cliche traits. While the violent is really violent and over the top, the story is really tame and the execution is really lame. There's no sense of tension or suspense even if the soundtrack wants it to be there. I personally hate the soundtrack. Not only that the songs aren't good but they also couldn't seem to stop playing it. In every 5 minutes there will be another soundtrack playing, it adds nothing to the scene and if anything, it ruins it. Coming into this I really wanted to like it.

Netflix has a bad reputation when it comes to making movies, their latest, Army of the dead was terrible, Project Power had so much potential but failed in giving that, Triple Frontier was boring and so on and on, and at the bottom of the pit Rim of the world and Vampires vs the Bronx.

I'm not sure why so many much have rated it low to lower it to anything less than an 7, although I personally feel it's worthy of an 8. I'm not going to waste my time reading through all the bad ratings to see why they were bad, tbh IDC what their reasons are. I personally really liked this movie. It had an excellent group of actors all the way across the board, so well done, that for once I actually don't want to specify anyone because then I would feel I had to mention everyone. I recognized quite literally all of the main and supporting cast. I also loved how the score was handled, everything had a decidedly modern feel without taking away from the time period. The songs not ones you would expect, but theu fit really well. An extremely difficult balance to maintain. The storyline was good, yes revenge plots are nothing new, especially in a western. On the other hand it could almost be said that a movie can't be a true western unless it's either a revenge story, a heist story, a hero story, or a combination of two or more of those things. That said the script was well written, well acted, and moved at a good steady pace that didn't feel long and drawn out like a lot of movies can. The two hours flew by and I was glued to it the whole time, and thats actually saying a lot for someone like me who has serious attention span issues.

The casting is pitch perfect and it's just a master class for everyone watching. The film strikes an excellent balance of traditional western with some modern sensibility thrown in, including terrific music.I just loved the twist at the end and it allowed Idris a spectacular scene. The women kick ass, which is important for me (as much as I enjoy the male actors).

Film progresses with a steady tone as well as pacing with slight bumps here and there. The performance of the actors attracts a lot of attention, whether it is Jonathan Majors and Idris Elba or Regina King and Zazie Beetz. Every other actor put a lot of soul behind their act to give as much feel as possible. Talking about the story, from start to finish everyone can smell that this dish is nothing new of its own but another variant of its many predecessors. The plot and pattern itself makes this movie quite predictable in every twist and turn. At some moments the length of the movie feels stretched and in other moments you just want to skip to the end and see the outcome. The presentation this movie offers is one of the reasons which pushes it upwards. Talking about the ending it also stands out predictable except the few elements director Jeymes Samuel has put into it. Overall this movie stands out high but not too high in front of the audience.

You would be lucky to find enough successful black people to fill a stage coach in any town back then and yet they had a whole town with nothing but black people. I don't have a problem with black lead actors but it takes away from the feel of the movie for believability when a western town has all black people. The music was also not proper for the setting.Gold guns? Did they do such shallow things back then? You would think that functionality would be the highest concern. And all the places were so clean and tidy. I know these are kind of petty but it's a lot of small annoying things that add up.They could have done the same movie with the main characters as black and all the background people white or other.

the director took his inspiration in my opinion from a few of my favorite euro western directors Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Leone also with modern touches from Quentin Tarantino with the witty dialogue, I loved how aggressive the female lead actors were in this film, the secondary actors also stood out they did a solid job, the action scenes were well staged and executed, the soundtrack was also was good, Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba , Delroy Lindo, Regina King knock it out of the park, I want to see more Westerns like this in the future, told from a different view, a fresh look, a lot of the newer westerns look like they were shot in somebody's backyard and have atrocious actors, movie sets and costumes, the last decent pseudo-western I watched was Bone Tomahawk, revive this overlooked genre, there are many stories that could be told, this movie in my opinion is not to be missed, if you enjoy a good cowboy flick, well this is it.",The Harder They Fall

62,rogier-86785,Charismatic new take on the western,7,5 November 2021,"The harder they fall is a combination of Tarantino-esque montage, established western genre tropes and Blaxploitation influences, which immediately makes it an interesting film too watch. The story is your typical revenge plot which I'll leave for you to discover yourself, but it is important to note it's a different film than your usual western, which thrives on understatement. This one is overstated. And that's just the first of many original differences.The most obvious - but not most important - is its all black cast. Since about a quarter of all cowboys those days were of darker skin, this should not come as a surprise. However, the filmmakers could've chosen to still make it an old-school western with that cast and leave it at that. Yet, they choose to make faster cuts, use centered shots reminiscent of Wes Anderson and much brighter colouring. And most importantly: very different music. It gives the film a different pace, to its benefit.There are niggles however. It is not as intricately detailed as a Tarantino, whose influence is felt here. It's more light-hearted but less suspenseful because of it, with a lot less character development. Most of the music is great but not all. Jay-Z his soundtrack is full of middle-of-the-road chords and annoying autotunes which break the fourth wall. This may be a modern take, but we're still in cowboy-era America here. There are also too many tracks used, which means the film never gets a theme, a missed opportunity. Stiil, the modern soul songs fit the period well, and especially the reggae is really, really good.The dialogue is clichéd (it's still a western...) with a few good scenes, but there are also plenty of moments where the comedic and cheecky timing is off, plus a twist that just comes too late. Yet the actors get away with it just by sheer charisma. Let's just say I grabbed a whiskey watching (again, it's still a western).And that's probably the best description: it's too theatrical yes, and don't expect a masterpiece, but it oozes charisma across the board. And in the Wild West, that's sometimes all you need.",The Harder They Fall
63,dcoydcoy,Fun movie!,7,4 November 2021,"It's cheesy and they spend an entire hour just showing us how badass everyone is. But you stay interested and the enjoyable characters keep it exciting. It isn't a believable western such as Open Range, but more closer to the recent remake of The Magnificent Seven.",The Harder They Fall
64,marcusdavis40,This Movie Was Great,10,5 November 2021,"I just watched this movie last night .This movie is great .Damn good cast in this. A very well made film. It is excessively violent though,but then the west was violent . Loved the music in this except for the hip hop track at the begining. Idris Elba ,Delroy Lindo ,Regina King ,they're all very good in this .This film kind of reminds me of that other movie called Posse that came out in the 90's and was directed by Mario Van Peebles. It kind has the same type of feel to it. But i loved it ,i'm going to re-watch it again later on .Whats with all the negative reviews ?? Bunch of non thinking morons who cares what they think?",The Harder They Fall
65,gliderguy,This is too violent for Tanantino,2,6 November 2021,"The concept here is that there were Black gunslingers, cowboys and outlaws in the West, which is true. This movie brings them all together into one film and weaves a totally unbelievable yarn around the entire group. The violence is unrelenting. At one point an entire squad of white soldiers are murdered after they had surrendered. I mean, what is the point of that other than gratuitous violence? Rufus Buck was an actual outlaw that committed rape, robbery and murder. The real Buck was captured, tried and executed by hanging. That is not how he dies in this movies, or does the rest of the movie remotely resemble who Buck was.It seems like the producers have to keep upping the ante on the violence. In the final gunfight I counted, at least, 43 people being shot. At some point it just becomes comical.And, guys and gals, this is a Western, not a South Side of Chicago shootout. So, tell me, what does Rap ""music"" have to do with a Western?This movie is HIGHLY condescending and unrealistic. Come on, singing cowboys - REALLY? Watch if you must, but you will be wasting two hours of your life.",The Harder They Fall
66,abhibnlcs,"Movies are meant to be for enjoyment, and this is one hell of an enjoyable movie!!",10,5 November 2021,"People commenting on historical accuracy or too many black casting are forgetting the once fact these movies & tv shows are produced for - entertainment. The music & songs in this movie make for one hell of a enjoyable ride. The twist at the end surely does give the ""wtf"" moment.Overall, highly recommended!",The Harder They Fall
67,alandeza,Awesome western,9,7 November 2021,I was hooked from the first frame to the last. All the performances were great with Lakeith and RJ being my favorites of the film. I can't forget to mention the awesome soundtrack as well. Can't recommend it enough.,The Harder They Fall
68,frank-liesenborgs,"Don´t think, just watch!",7,4 November 2021,"This movie is really a piece of work. There are some awesome moments with a plot twist I did not see coming, which is always a very good sign. The dialogues are to the point and the acting is just marvellous. Outstanding performances from Zazie Beetz (Mary), Danielle Deadwyler (Cuffee), Regina King (Trudy), Jonathan Majors (Nat Love), LaKeith Stanfield (Cherokee Bill) and Edi Gathegi (Bill Picket). It's about two gangs of people entirely accustomed to violence and fear: one is led by Nat Love (Jonathan Majors), who bears a cross cut into his forehead by the villain who killed his mum and dad in front of him when he was just a kid, and seeking revenge. Ranged against them are the Rufus Buck gang. Rufus himself is played by an emotionless Idris Elba.Conclusion: the characters are multidimensional and the acting is convincing. From the visual design, cinematography to the directing, it all worked out very well. The only thing I found a bit disturbing were the songs. There were just too many songs and sometimes they casted a shadow over the story. Overall a 7/10 and well worth watching. And I guarantee you will love the twist at the end.",The Harder They Fall
69,heno-45762,Not Django,6,7 November 2021,"Okay now this is a Gangster Western, yes I said it has rap music as well. It's actually a lot of fun to watch but really is a little over the top,specially the background,Shops ,Stores etc. Looks like a card board cut out town with Purple and yellow colour everywhere (I actually laughed). There are no white people in this movie either, as main characters (there just extras). I just can't believe back then that African Americans could run there own towns and govern them. This film is trying to be something it's not,I think if they spent time taking it more seriously would of paid off.",The Harder They Fall
70,Rastifan,I gave it a chance.,4,4 November 2021,I am not going to give it a standing ovation just because the cast is more or less black. I shall judge it on it's own merit. The revenge plot is old and overused. The violence added nothing new. The music was horribly misplaced and some of the actors I simply didn't believe. A Tarantino wanna be that fails to deliver something original. I give it 4 for the end plot.,The Harder They Fall
71,121mcv,Ii would rather wash dishes,5,8 November 2021,I'm big fan of Idris and westerns .. Idris work is captivating unfortunately the writing is very boring. I tried to watch this several times but unfortunately the prospect of washing dirty dishes was more appealing.,The Harder They Fall
72,bbevis-47954,Some Style and Little Substance.,4,3 November 2021,"The best parts of The Harder They Fall are a few performances, one-liners and Idris Elba. The bad is practically everything else.Narratively this is a story we have seen a thousand times before. A young man seeks revenge on a ruthless outlaw who murdered his mom and dad. We don't know why the murders occurred by the outlaw but it's easy to empathize with the mans desire for revenge. Next a few Tarantino like sequences happen and the movie becomes dull. The dialogue is not exciting enough to cover the run time nor do the characters have any depth. The last ten minutes of the movie reveals a twist that should have played out one hour into the movie. If you think about the possibility of that happening and the predicament it would have put the protagonist in it's obvious to see it would have made for a much more exciting movie narratively. Some of the choices characters make to put themselves in harms way is exhaustingly stupid and needlessly prologues the movie with a boring bank heist. On top of that every few minutes obnoxiously loud-bad music plays over every scene with characters walking around looking stoically at one another. If you cut these scenes it would have saved thirty minutes easily. The Harder They Fall has the cast but forgets to have FUN!For a Western none of the cinematography stands out and everything is obviously shot in a studio. It looks cheap and it doesn't help either that there is no action in the movie until the final thirty minutes. When the action comes it's your standard Western shootout, nothing unique about how the action sequence is filmed, no unique choreography and the deaths are as predictable as they come. In the end it's the boring story and one-note characters that hurt The Harder They Fall the most. The movie had a promising opening but quickly faded into another boring Western.",The Harder They Fall
73,guskeller,Modern flavor for a stale genre,8,25 October 2021,"The Harder They Fall is a breath of fresh air. Westerns are known for character-driven storytelling but are often dismissed as boring and indistinguishable. Not here. The Harder They Fall packs a unique punch. The acting is enthusiastic, the editing is flashy, and the cinematography is active. This all contributes to a distinct vision that is genuinely refreshing, especially for a stale genre. Ultimately, The Harder They Fall delivers a modern flavor that energizes its classic setting. The music drives this home. Blending modern songs with western influences, the soundtrack bridges the gap between the contemporary style and the vintage backdrop.Some might consider The Harder They Fall style without substance, but the writing does enough to dispel that criticism. It may be a basic story of dueling gangs, but that familiar narrative eases the modern fusion. Plus, the climatic scene unites the plotlines and adds emotional weight to the overall movie. Admittedly, the script isn't special but it is just what the film needs. As a result, The Harder They Fall is a fun revival of a neglected genre that stands out for its unconventional presentation. It is definitely worth a watch.Writing: 7/10

This could have been a violent fluff piece, but tho the violence was certainly present, it did not feel gratuitous, and there were nuances throughout that just worked so well.

But the story hits so many over used tropes seen in so many other westerns that it feels like it was written with a checklist in mind. Revenge, over the top violence, bold music choices, unnecessary romance, and so many others that it feels a bit messy. The action included tried to be realistic but then you realize characters just pop out left and right just in time to save or kill another character. Such a disappointment.",The Harder They Fall

The story of a revenge in the old west by a boy whose parents were murdered is good from moment one of this Netflix film. When a western is well done it is incomparable; however, many are bad. This one keeps the viewer interest and engaged. Idris Elba and Jonathan Majors are great in this. Zazie Beets and Delroy Alonso are great. It is violent, but in a classic Western film way. Lawrence Bender, known for his work with Quentin Tarantino, is one of the producers and it shows. The music is great. The action is great.

From the Strong Massive Cast, beautiful cinematography and music and bloody gunfighting action scenes, makes this not your typical western film. Jonathan Majors, Regina King, Zazie Beetz, Danielle Deadwyler, RJ Cyler, Are STANDOUTS and the rest did a GREAT. If you love Western Films, then your definitely going to love this smooth one with heart, ruthlessness and gunfighting scenes. 2hrs can feel very long, but worth in the end. Plot And Storyline felt very cliché as a revenge type movie. But a film that is proud to be supported to the black community. Jeymes Samuel did a FANTASTIC Job On the film and bringing in that western genre feel to audiences again. Soo Glad I got to see it early.

85,Silicone54,Doesn't get very far,3,7 November 2021,"The trend these days is the typical movie has to over diversify in order to satisfy the mob. So we just accept that as the rule except when something like this is made and now we have to read between the lines. Only non-black produced films have to obey the diversity rules, got it.So you have this nonsense swimming in your head as soon as you are watching the movie and start making judgements of why this and why that. The movie becomes secondary to the politics that should have no bearing on a film.The movie is not a complete dud as there were some good gun fight scenes. The one character who I Iiked was Cuffee, she/he/them had a few scenes that were funny. But the rest of the characters were supersized but boring.The end of the final fight scene was pathetic. There was so little invested in their storylines that I know I should care at that point but I really didn't.For a western this movie was heavy on dialogue. A lot of it were silly throw away lines that were just filler. At one point I thought they were going to break into Hamlet and do some Shakespeare.I think the main character did a decent job but the script sucked and robbed him of a good performance. Idris always a great actor was ok for his part but again his presence was not enough to carry this through.",The Harder They Fall

91,strizbiz-99429,Great movie but not for everyone (you know who you are),8,5 November 2021,"Ok, first of all, from reading some of the reviews, just as I expected, some people have a problem with this movie having pretty much an all black cast. A western movie having an all white cast is fine for some but apparently for some, black people playing cowboys is like having white people play Native Americans.....one problem with that outlook though, Native American are a race of people , cowboys aren't, and in fact there actually were black cowboys.Let's be frank, this movie definitely isn't made for everyone, if you have an issue with black films , it's NOT FOR YOU.Moving on I thought it was entertaining and had a great cast. There were a couple of times it seemed to drag a little a lost my attention to other things which otherwise would have made it a ten. Sadly some people are describing this as a blaxploitation cowboy movie and they don't have a clue at all, that's not what this is supposed to be. Those people are the kind of people who think western movie should only be made by white people with an all white cast...which is really sad.

I suspect this person's perspective is one of many others that handed this film such little favor. It's the only way I can understand the disrespect.This film is fun, funny, sexy, and full of quick wit. It has a killer ending, but what makes it special is that it's not all fiction. This film is based on real people whose names have been deliberately torn out of school history books. Characters in this film are based on real lives that deserve to be acknowledged somewhere. So, let film be the place. Let the troubled days and love affairs of black gun slinging outlaws become an entertaining tale within a future neither ever lived long enough to see. Meanwhile, let's bury the title of Blaxploitation film, shall we? The term is flat out racists and hypocritical in its origin. I can't count the number of films that I've watched that has an all white cast, which was directed by a white person, and produced by all white people, proudly projecting a storyline that caters to a white audience, and never, ever in my whole life have I heard of an ethic subgenre created to define it.

The plot is basically non-existent. The sets look faker than a school stage play. The action feels more like an afterthought, but there's a lot of it.About third of the movie is basically a collection of cheesy music videos, third of it ghetto talk that feels a bit out of place and is quite crass and banal, and final third is senseless violence with no tension or rhythm, survival instincts or any gunslinger actually trying to act as if they're any good.Again, I like the general idea, but I feel like they were too much about the idea and forgot to make a good film to actually deliver the idea.

104,info-90701,"What to say, what to say . . .",2,5 November 2021,"First, the fact that some of the real black cowboys and cowgirls were brought to light should have made this a delight, had they stayed true to ANY of the actual amazing things those real people had done. Instead, they chose to make a sexist film that degraded first, the true historical figure of Stagecoach Mary (Mary Fields) and turn her into a sexy, pretty, mindless; temptress; and have her do utterly stupid things that insult the real Mary's memory, and that's just the beginning of this madness.Mary Fields was born a slave in 1832 in Tennessee, escaped and moved to Ohio before ending up in Montana later. She was six feet tall and about 200 lbs., fought like a man and would beat up people who didn't pay her when she was a laundry woman and later a stagecoach driver. She delivered the mail singlehandedly on a stage line in Montana, that forced her to fight off wolves villains, etc. And did it for years with a .38 pistol on her side and a shotgun. Mary Fields was the second woman in US history to be a mail carrier. Mary Fields was a formidable, solid, strong, serious pioneer woman who took no grief from anyone according to history. She was not a simple-minded woman who would sacrifice herself for a man first of all (not likely anyway) or do something as ridicolusly absurd as go into the den of evil and need to be saved by one. What an insult to a true-life pioneer woman!But what else can black women expect from Black men who have been raised on BET, half naked video vixens that they grew up on, who shook their behinds in the faces of fully clothed, ignorant rappers who called them ho's; while they whined 'What you gonna do for me Daddy?' and they thought that made sense in the 90's! What else indeed?Additionally, the actress playing her, is the wrong color for Mary which is important during those days and in black culture, and made Mary every bit more formidable because she was not that. Zazie Beetz and her tough sex kitten persona had absolutely nothing to do with Mary Fields! Photos of the real Mary would have made Leslie Jones far more appropriate as a choice to play her, or if you really had to push it, tall Aisha Tyler plained down, but no, that would have required some wise women, or adult men to be involved in the script, and apparently that was not the deal here! Sexist, male children wrote and produced this horror show, and that was apparent even before reading the credits. Jay-Z should be ashamed, but well, I already said it. Product of those times.Mary Fields was a fighter, closer to the personality of Trudy, the character played by the incredible Regina King (also wasted in this nightmare) without the pure evil side. And let's talk about Trudy! She might have been an historical figure, though I haven't found her yet. What, did they think she countered the absurdity they made of Stagecoach Mary? No, she didn't. She just proved there were two extremes of childishness these men-children could go to.In addition to the blatant, voyeuristic sexism (this same group of 12 year-old minded men like the thought that every woman might have lesbian tendencies and they would be allowed to watch) they put Mary in, and the gender bending role they put the other actress/character in, Cuffie, they seemed to find ways to make the few white people in the film (which was refreshing in some ways considering that I can't remember one black person being in Friends for however many seasons they ran, in NY yet, but still not historically accurate for the times) one note as well. And worse, they seemed to be out west without the more realistic possibility that there were usually black and red communities together, because they found greater safety in maintaining maroon communities together. And there were definitely about 10 all black towns, with Nicodemus being the best known, though they don't make any of this clear, and I didn't see one Indian face. Okay, a bit of a rant, but I'll get back on course.The sophomoric script, simplistic and childish as it was, was only a vehicle for massive amounts of violence that did nothing other than serve the blood lust of a shallow mind. The direction was actually quite visual, but again, only told a story with zero heart or value. The music was bold, and did much of what the music did in A Knight's Tale, and crossed genres and time periods, or incorporated a broad spectrum. That didn't bother me as much because they were trying to update as Idlewild did, which I adore! But they didn't achieve any of the heart of either of those films in this piece of mess.The worst part of this film however might be the fact that they put many historical figures together, who lived in very different times, and had them doing absurdly different things from what the actual people did! James Pierson Beckwourth as born in 1798 or so; Mary Fields was born in 1832; Bass Reeves was born in 1838; Nat Love was born in 1854; Bill Pickett was born in 1860 and died in 1932; Cherokee Bill was born in 1876; The Rufus Buck Gang was put to death, all 5 of them, in 1896, and only started their killing spree in 1895, and they were teenagers -- not grown men, and I can't find a woman (Trudy) at all. So there is no way that a 60 year old Mary Fields, was running with teenagers, etc., though she lived till 1914.Let's not even talk about how far from who they actually were, that these on-screen characters were.So to put all these people in one time frame, rearrange teens to be grown men, and all the nonsense that this did is an absolute insult to these historic figures. It is as bad as when they made James Pierson Beckwourth a visibly black man though of mixed heritage, a white man in Hondo (not sure that's the right movie) with John Wayne. Not one bit better!So what they accomplished, was to confuse more kids/people who thought they might be learning a bit of history, with nonsense written by a person who doesn't understand black history in the US and has a blood lust, and hates women. Even Regina King could not snatch sanity into the female roles of this insult to real life heroes and villains.So what did this film accomplish? Let's see . . .It contributed to the confusion of black people about their history;it made such an absurd hodgepodge mess that it didn't make white people even curious enough to do their own research about the historical figures in this;it left out all the Asian, Mexican/Hispanic and Indian people who were a more than a significant part of the west as it developed since white people arrived and before;it ignored the relationships between black people and Indians who coexisted very well during this time period;it made white people tokens, much like thousands of white films have made people of color tokens for over a century -- and why would anyone want to duplicate that insanity in 2021;it insulted women, andinsulted history in general by mixing up about 120 years worth of people by putting them all in one place and acting like that was real!This 2 rating is for the sound team, the cinematographer and team (I count camera, grips and electrics in that) and the transportation team. The actors should have just said no, like any other drug, and they are big enough to force these sad, childish producers to get a decent script for them!Yeah, that about sums it up! These. People.

105,abih-40449,A Solid Western: An Even Better movie!,10,9 November 2021,"Based upon the trailer I wasn't very enthuse about watching this movie because it hinted of pass failed westerns which came off as 60's hip cop and robbers dressed up as cowboys. Don't get me wrong I loved The Coen brothers Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, I found Tarantino's DJango Unchained to be entertaining and incredibly well acted for what it is but as I stated earlier the trailer threw me for a loop. Now to the movie...... I found The Harder They Fall this to be one of the best westerns made in the modern era I've seen. I loved the directors take on this movie and the fact that the cast for the most part were all African Americans made it all the sweeter when it came to the directors approach of the characters in the movie. The compassion shown along with the ability to show some characters to be as ruthless as they come was a nice combo you don't often see in the overdone hero addictive Hollywood. The acting was outstanding the depth of the story deep and the actions scenes were on point. I was taken back at the end of the movie which made the ending all the sweeter. Also I found the ending so engrossing that the set up for a followup movie caught me off guard. I gave this movie a 10 because it deserved it anything lower than a seven I would have to ask what movie were you watching.

As Europeans, the skin color of the protagonists is of secondary importance, this is about the achievement prince and that leads to the question: Is THE HARDER THEY FALL any good?The answer is yes and no. The protagonists are all cool, the music is determined by R&B rhythms and hip hop, the mood is desolate and hopeless, the characters taciturn and stoic.That sounds good and is also entertaining, but director Jeymes Samuels film cannot add anything groundbreaking to the western genre.

The passion and disclosed message, promising cinematography and Idris Elba (obviously), made me call this picture one of my most anticipated ones of the year. Though it doesn't dissapoint entirely, Samuel abandoned me while wanting more...The movie's screenplay, though it gives a harmonious enough plot-understanding, can be responsible for the movie's avoidable slow pace which, for movies like these, where the setting and overall story can leave even the most superlative director forsaken, isn't something feasible or convenient. As a result, it leaves a good enough editing work to feel indifferent.Though all of the actors involved proffer meritorious performances, I have to say, I could easily call Regina King's my favourite, even when her screen time didn't come even close in size to other supporting roles.Though The Harder They Fall's story presents little-to-no newness, some of its shots and takes were left unpurposed and the overall enterntainment value can fall off for the people who decide to watch this without any previous expectations, the title card that Samuel presents at the beginnign of the movie passes on a message that people will instantly understand by the end of the picture and, for that, he has to his name my full admiration.",The Harder They Fall

147,bwanabrad-1,A new and refreshing perspective on an old genre.,9,8 November 2021,"Don't be confused, this is nothing like the old Jimmy Cliff movie of the same name. So what have we got here? I found this to be a rollicking and highly entertaining ride, from go to whoa. If you are looking for a dose of reality, look elsewhere, escapism doesn't get much purer than this. Grab some popcorn, start munching and settle down to a rollicking good ride. The opening sets not only the scene but also the prevailing mood, with deaths and violence that are swift and sudden. It is a clear signpost of what is to come. At the times the violence is way over the top, to the extent where it sometimes appears cartoonish, and when viewed from that angle it isn't too over the top at all.The film has a nod towards Sergio Leone who rewrote the book on westerns, most notably l detected elements of Once Upon a Time in America, and the Trinity/My Name is Nobody series. There is also a nod or few to Tarantino, but this movie excels over his recent releases in the western genre, Django Unchained and the Hateful 8. This film is also an attempt to change the landscape of the western and it succeeds admirably, by acknowledging the presence of African Americans. Until now Hollywood has largely ignored their presence in Westerns, with the notable exception of the civil war epic, Glory. There are plenty of gritty characters, and what a memorable lot they are. Attention must be paid at the beginning to note who is who, bravado is in no short supply and trash talk abounds in the whip cracking smart script. At times some of the dialogue was a little hard to hear or decipher, but l am sure meaning would be rewarded with repeat viewings.Then there are the characters, and what a memorable lot they are. Attention must be paid at the beginning to note who is who, there is plenty of bravado and trash talk abounds. Of the main characters the one who stands out above and beyond all others is Idris Elba as Rufus Buck. A large part of the action centres around him and he is more than capable of shouldering the attention. The other stand out performance is by the redoubtable Delroy Lindo as marshall Bass Reeves. It isn't only the men who turn in memorable performances, Zazie Beetz as Stagecoach Mary is resilient in a no nonsense kind of way, but she is overshadowed on screen by the menacing presence of Regina King as the lethal Trudy Smith. These are two women among others who are every bit as powerful and dangerous as any of the male characters they share the screen with. The only actor l found who lacked the necessary gravitas was Jonathon Majors as Nat Love, who didn't generate the sort of screen presence his character needed.One other small example of this shift in the approach to the genre is through the creative use of song and music, from the opening music hall number, through to the final, lilting folk song and many stops in between. But there is also humour, as in the use of colour, and the inevitable climactic shoot out which is the main example of the cartoon style violence. Here one large gang of killers prove themselves to be totally incompetent at hitting targets, while the other side can hardly miss a kill shot. If you are looking for realism, look elsewhere, just enjoy this movie for what it is, a rip roaring 'shoot 'em up', and you won't be disappointed.",The Harder They Fall

Farcically inappropriate dialogue - did they really talk like hip-hop stars in the 1800s? The soundtrack was even worse - every possible silent space filled with mobo tracks that had no relevance to the period or the action.

I have to be honest though, this is more about ambience and characters as those are clearly this movie's strong points. I kept watching to see the various interactions between characters and was genuinely unsure who would live and die.I wouldn't consider this a spoiler (maybe you could tell from the trailers) but basically every character in this movie is a villain on some level. There is a cool factor to everything but I don't know how I feel to have an all black cast and arguably only one of them isn't an outlaw. There are black towns and white towns, which to me is a completely new perspective on the western, but mostly unlikeable characters take up the screen.In saying that, you really feel the brutality of the old west. At least from this movie, there's an assumption that people do awful things everyday and (as long as nobody catches you), you haven't broken the law. Anybody with speaking lines is shooting people left and right and you feel it; blood splatters and chunks of flesh fly across the screen. It isn't too gory but bullets have an impact. It makes you think how gray the morality is when all the main characters are stacking bodies in every other scene.There are a few likeable characters. I won't name any to avoid spoilers but Jonathan Majors (Nat Love) is a great, charistmatic actor who continues to surprise me. At this point, I feel like he can be thrown into any genre and make it work.The soundtrack, acting, camera work and characters are great (apparently they're all based on real outlaws) but the story and pacing seemed a little off. The movie was almost intentionally slow, making me wait until the next shootout. If there's ever a sequel, and maybe a higher budget, I would hope to see more action and a more evenly paced movie. Overall though, about as good as I wanted it to be.",The Harder They Fall

Watch it for what it is and just enjoy the good ole fashion Western while munching popcorn and laughing out loud and feeling feelz and jumping at certain unexpected moments. It's just a good yarn. It has plenty of swearing but not much else in the way of vices. It has an over-the-top hyper-stylized style of violence that winks at the camera like ""Yeah, we know."" It has a villain with a backstory you will NOT see coming. It has a wry, comedic self-awareness. And it's an all-black cast celebrating the presence of African-Americans present in the West, overlayed with a contemporary soundtrack.

170,jkelt,Enjoyable Western Playing With Hollywood Tropes,9,6 November 2021,"America's self-conception has been shaped by many myths and historical inaccuracies. By the end of the 20th Century, many of these myths had been shaped and warped by the Hollywood Western. Even revisionist Westerns (Little Big Man, The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) may have played against the clichés, but still played with those clichés. So, criticisms that ""The Harder They Fall"" isn't ""historically accurate"" or that its reggae infused soundtrack is ""anachronistic"" miss the point entirely. (Did BJ Thomas record ""Raindrops Keep Falling My Head"" in 1902? Did I hear an electric guitar in the theme to ""Bonanza""? Who cares?) So if somebody wants to make a Western with an all-black main cast and reggae music, it's probably the familiar Hollywood ""feel"" they pine for, not any concept of historical accuracy. This movie is about as historically accurate as most of the thousands of Westerns that went before; meaning it isn't. ""The historic accuracy"" some people yearn for in Western movies is adherence to the 1950's, not the 1880's.What the movie does is take some real historical figures from the past (there were Black cowboys, bad guys and lawmen in the old West), and put them in a totally fictional story that adheres to a bunch of Hollywood themes, tropes, and clichés - showdowns and gunfights on main street, hyperviolence ala Sam Peckinpah (Tarantino didn't invent this kids, he's also constantly tipping his hat to the past)- and have a blast with them. There is an obvious sense of humor displayed by director Jeymes Samuel when we see the ""White Town"". If he wants to make a Western with an all-black main cast after decades of prior exclusion, underrepresentation and misrepresentation of Black and Native Americans in the genre when nobody seemed to mind, who are we to cry foul?Taken on its own terms the movie is terrific. A stellar cast, beautifully shot, action packed. Sure, some of the shootout at the end is silly, with predictable deaths and heroes surviving exposure in the street that should have killed them 10x over. Just classic Hollywood stuff. Some of the characters are thinly drawn stereotypes (cocky gunslingers), but some are given deeper backstories of childhood and domestic abuse and survival.In the end, it was a good story well told through great production design, dynamic direction, and terrific actors. What more d'ya want?",The Harder They Fall

Mid-movie, the heroes give away their advantage quite nonsensically simply to complicate the plot for a more action packed ending. It was awkward.Secondly, one villain in particular had several scenes where he seemed to regret his actions or be reluctant to carry out an evil act, however, no explanation is given for this.

192,johnnyjeremymusic-56956,A Hard Film To Follow,4,5 November 2021,"What are we watching here? A waste of a talented cast on a lousy screenplay. At some point the producers should've hired another screenwriter to sort this mess out.There are no real characters in this film. Outside of Nat Love's motivation, every character's motivation comes off as either NPC or schizophrenic. That's fine if we're trying to go for a bad Italian western vibe ala Belle Star Story or Adios Sabata. But the hype around this film, and some of the ridiculous commentary on this site tells us that there are some who want this film to be more important than what it really is. This isn't even a passable story. It comes off as an exercise to give some actors and a film crew a job.Others have pointed out the bizarre use of music in the film. Yes, it is cringe for sure. It just doesn't work. I had to do all I could to continue to watch the film during the parts where the sing a longs occurred. There is absolutely no joy and no reason to sing. The characters in this film are too one dimensional to believably pass themselves off as having any desire other than murder.I am told that there is some sort of high minded social commentary to this film. The only social commentary I can find is a prideful overcompensation for an unknown history. Instead of taking the time to learn about people, their motivations, judgment, and the nuance of their character, and then writing and developing characters with a story to tell - the producers and writers here have just projected the nihilism of the 21st century on unknown ancestors who are so far removed from their experience that if they had the humility to search and find a real story, it would shock their minds. The project is laudable, but beyond the talents of the writers and producers who headed this project up.Having said all this, I admit I watched this mainly because I'm an Idris Elba fan... but after Cats, Suicide Squad, Concrete Cowboy, and now this I am seriously considering to question Elba's judgment.

The lines delivered by the actors does not seem right. The attempts at comedy seemed off.The reggae music got annoying as it did not seem to match the scenes.And where I left of it just seemed like the scenes where needlessly drawn out.As for the black/white actors topic or that they misrepresent history or misrepresent actual people that many comments, I'm assuming this was just a strategy to get a poorly developed script/movie funding and publicity to make money.

198,MacTad,I LOVED this movie!!,10,7 November 2021,"It's been far too long since there was a great Black western. People and critics keep referring to this film as the ""first"" western with a Black cast. Apparently, they're all young and/or white because The Harder They Fall is in no way a first. I'm old enough to remember Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee in Buck and the Preacher-a really good movie released in 1972 that I'd hope film students, at least, would have studied in film history class. There's also the 1974 romantic western starring Max Julien and Vonetta McGee.At least one IMDb reviewer refers to The Harder They Fall as a ""Blaxploitation"" film. The connotation is that the film is made cheaply with, at best, a mediocre. Campy, script and actors no one has ever heard of. That is far from the case with this film. Calling it ""Blaxploitation"" is an insult to the director, producers and the 5-star cast, all of whom do a bang-up job in this film. Idris Elba as villain Rufus Buck is both ruthless and sympathetic as he hides a secret only revealed in the last 10-15 minutes. Jonathan Majors is fantastic as the hero Nat Love set on revenge for the murder of his parents. There've been a number of complaints that Zazie Beetz looks nothing like the real Stagecoach Mary who was a dark-skinned woman. However, supposed colorism aside, this film allows her to display a depth of nuance I honestly didn't know she had in her.Danielle Deadwyler portrays Cuffee, Mary's sidekick, protector, friend and, maybe, lover. She's a very interesting character. At first I thought she might be nonbinary, which wasn't unheard of as some women felt more free to be themselves in the Old West. Alternatively, some non-cis women simply had hard jobs and hard lives where a more masculine appearance fit a great deal better than appearing as a weak, wilting, compliant woman. The choice to make Cuffee more masculine was both historically factual where some LGBTQ people of the era in that piece of the country and bold. She was definitely unexpected, but heartily welcome.LaKeith Stanfield was sublime as Cherokee Bill. He changed his voice and demeanor to portray Pickett as calm, authoritative and deadly. Interestingly, the historic Cherokee Bill could nearly pass for white and was 20 years old when he was hanged for murder. Stanfield is unapologetically obviously a Black man older than 20. Is this reverse colorism and ageism? 😁I absolutely could not end without mentioning the actor who nearly stole this movie from Majors and Elba: Regina King. That woman is a powerhouse and that comes through loud and clear in her portrayal of Trudy Smith, Rufus Buck's partner in life and in crime. Viewers can feel the molten lava roiling under the surface, just barely contained. When she explodes, the eruption is bloody, brutal and violent. King is one cool broad in this film.The individual who dismisses this film as ""Blaxploitation"" is decidedly wrong. The cast is first rate throughout. All are accomplished actors respected in their fields. The script, written by director Jeymes Samuels and Boaz Yakin, is fun, realistic, (even if the events are fanciful), displays the depth of research that preceded its writing and pretty darn good. To say this film is ""Blaxploitation"" is to say ANY movie with a nearly all-Black cast is ""Blaxploitation."" That's simply not true. To say such is undeservedly dismissive and reveals a complete ignorance of true American history.",The Harder They Fall

The connotation is that the film is made cheaply with, at best, a mediocre, campy script; actors no one has ever heard of, and; produced, primarily, to line the pockets of white men by exploiting the hunger in Black communities for movies that show us. That is far from the case with this film. This is a film made by Black people throughout from producers to the director to the crew and, most notably, to the cast. Calling it ""Blaxploitation"" is an insult to the all of them who, by the way, do a bang-up job in this film.Idris Elba as villain Rufus Buck is both ruthless and sympathetic as he hides a secret only revealed in the last 10-15 minutes. Jonathan Majors is fantastic as the hero Nat Love set on revenge for the murder of his parents. There have been a number of complaints on social media that Zazie Beetz looks nothing like the real Stagecoach Mary who was a dark-skinned , rough-looking, hefty woman. However, supposed colorism aside, this film allows her to display a depth of nuance I honestly didn't know she had in her.Danielle Deadwyler portrays Cuffee, Mary's sidekick, protector, friend and, maybe, lover. She's a very interesting character. At first I thought she might be nonbinary, which wasn't unheard of as some women felt more free to be themselves in the Old West. Alternatively, some gender non-conforming women simply had hard jobs and hard lives where a more masculine appearance fit a great deal better than appearing as a weak, wilting, compliant woman. The choice to make Cuffee more masculine was both historically factual regarding LGBTQ people of the era in that part of the country, and; bold. She was definitely unexpected, but heartily welcome.LaKeith Stanfield was sublime as Cherokee Bill. He changed his voice and demeanor to portray Cherokee as calm, authoritative and deadly. Interestingly, the historic Cherokee Bill could pass for white and was 20 years old when he was hanged for murder. Stanfield is unapologetically, obviously a Black man older than 20. Is this reverse colorism and ageism? 😁Delroy Lindo. My, my, my. He is one sexy man portraying a real life Bass Reeves, the first Black U. S. marshal west of the Mississippi and who many believe was the basis of the Lone Ranger character. Not surprising since Hollywood made a number of real life POC figures white. He's smooth, charismatic, confident, smart and willing to do what's necessary to get his man. I could watch him all day long.I absolutely could not end without mentioning the actor who nearly stole this movie from Majors and Elba: Regina King. That woman is a powerhouse and that comes through loud and clear in her portrayal of Trudy Smith, Rufus Buck's partner in life and in crime. Viewers can feel the molten lava roiling under the surface, just barely contained. When she explodes, the eruption is bloody, brutal and violent. King is one cool (and hot) broad in this film.The individual who dismisses this film as ""Blaxploitation"" is decidedly wrong. The cast is first rate throughout. All are accomplished actors respected in their fields. The script, written by director Jeymes Samuels and Boaz Yakin, is fun, realistic, (even if the events are fanciful), displays the depth of research that preceded its writing and pretty darn good. To say this film is ""Blaxploitation"" is to say ANY movie with a nearly all-Black cast is ""Blaxploitation."" That's simply not true. To say such is undeservedly dismissive and reveals a complete ignorance of true American history as opposed to the all-white westerns produced by Hollywood that completely erases the large contributions made by Black people to the Old West.",The Harder They Fall

It's a bit of a nothing burger, so you never really become emotionally invested in any of the characters aside from rooting for Mary during an excellent catfight.

It seems as if the criticism that is being given in harsher reviews is not even being directed at the execution of the film, but rather of the white fragility/discomfort that is felt over watching an all black cast of incredible talent, showcased over a western genre of cinema.It is a solid film, people are just mad that that western genre of cinema is being occupied by an all black cast of amazing talent.I will never understand why people are obsessed with old white supremacy, get over putting white feelings over black talent and black lives.",The Harder They Fall

It's definitely a classic western film in a lot of ways. The soundtrack gives you a African American church feel. I'll be watching it again. I could see ""others"" not liking it because it's an all black cast and when the background characters (Non-POC) are in the front, they're mostly scared or typical angry that they're interacting with black people.

Cheesy (I mean maximum levels of cheese and I love cheese) ricochet bullets in the bank robbing scene. These are weird oversights in a well made film. The acting is great. The story is well written.

211,NosCustodimus,Fun Fact: This is Fiction,9,3 November 2021,"TLDR: Visually stunning, captivating story, and stylized violence that most audiences would love if not for the obvious: people downvoting a film they haven't seen for daring to tell a story with a diverse cast. Easily one of the best soundtracks in recent memory and one of my favorite westerns of all time. A bit long, but highly recommended.----- The whole film gave me a modern ""spaghetti western"" vibe. Great cast, solid acting, and brilliant soundtrack combining western visuals and contemporary hip-hop/ remixes. The violence is beautifully overdone and stylized with vivid colors in the spatter. The style felt enjoyably familiar. In fact, had you told me this was made by a different big-named director who has made a couple westerns of his own in recent years, I would have believed you and, I believe, the film would be treated differently (it also would've had at least a dozen more expletives of the -er variety if you catch my meaning).Elba, as always, is a force that gravity bows to and Majors is quickly becoming one of my new favorites actors. Even the ""supporting"" cast has lead their own projects, helping the whole ensemble play off each other as if scenes were just conversations between old friends. Zazie is amazie (sorry, had to) and I like some of the ideas King brought to her role, but I was taken out of the moment a few times by the accent she chose for her character. It's entirely possible this was just too jarring since I have heard her regular voice for too many years.Pacing could have been better. They did very well building multiple characters, making me feel as though I understood most of them. That takes a lot of time though and I felt the second act ran a bit long, with the necessary, though humorous, side quest. A few tweaks in the middle might've shaved off 10 or even 15 mins, bringing the total runtime under the (arbitrary) 2 hours mark.8.5/10 ... Familiar, but different. Old and new. Funny, but not hilarious.----- In the first few seconds of the film, it tells you it is a work of fiction. For some reason, people are on here downvoting it for historical inaccuracy. By that logic, Unforgiven should also be a 1/10 for not being a documentary. If someone can't be trusted to pay attention in the first 10 seconds of a film, their review is meaningless. It is interesting though, isn't it? How often the ""I don't see color"" and ""why is everything about race"" crowd so aggressively attacks anything that doesn't adhere to their fragile identity politics? This is a very good movie that deserves to be talked about with the best in the genre. The fact this even needs to be debated is evidence that everything ""they"" say is false is absolutely true.",The Harder They Fall
212,prasadgollakota,1 star I'll never get back,1,4 November 2021,"Zero was unavailable.Incredible how high people have rated this movie. It is confused (vs. Confusing), lacks depth, is poorly structured (the end begins about halfway through the movie and drags on) and some of the performances are appalling (even from the better known).If the cast was entirely unknown, we wouldn't even be writing about it as the movie would never been known about, if it was even made.Perhaps the single most annoying aspect about the movie is the dialogue; too much, over the top and continuously ill timed.

217,saolivaresm,To the rhythm of the music,7,8 November 2021,"The western, by far, is one of the most entertaining genres in cinema. Some titles in this genre are already mythical, such as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962), Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood, 1992) or those westerns by Sergio Leone.That is why I always go to see a western that the industry gives me every year. Some better, some worse, and some quite entertaining, which is the case with this Netflix movie directed by Jaymes Samuel.The Harder They Fall, is pure entertainment from beginning to end, it may be that Samuel's proposal in a clear Tarantino way, manages to captivate you with his successful direction or it may also be that his masterful soundtrack is an invitation to enjoy what we are seeing to the rhythm of Hip Hop and Rap. To that we add a first-rate cast like Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba, Regina King or Zazie Beetz.The film is an absolute pastime, it is a simple story of rival gangs and a great thirst for revenge.The great virtue it possesses is that its 130 minutes fly by and that is a great sign of entertainment. We have blood in piles, we have bullets everywhere, we find the pungent humor and in turn we find outlaw dialogues worthy of a western volume and spine.Samuel's proposal ends up being effective and also gimmicky. This is because the film maintains a constant rhythm that as a spectator does not allow you to disconnect from it. It may be that it has its lowest moments and of course you have them, it is not a round film, however, its cast is so spectacularly successful that you are captivated with this western-style cast.A quite satisfactory bet by Netflix. An absolute training for those who enjoy the genre and also those who are looking for a pleasant movie to watch and have a good time. An explosive western that feeds on the classics of Sergio Leone and the dynamics of Tarantino. Samuel is not Quentin, anyway, he allows himself to offer a film with all his stamp both visually and musically so that as spectators we can have fun behind the screen.",The Harder They Fall

In the wake of a bit of a revival of both genres, Western and Blacksploitation this film does a lot of things right. Grizzly gun-slingers well cast, from that well deserved exposure for talented actors otherwise sidelined,lush period interiors, less than overused outdoor scenery. And the degree to which it pushes the almost all black cast should only make the viewer as uncomfortable as the all white cast of classic Western does make him. That said, it's not a masterpiece story-wise, it suffers from flat characters outside of the action sequences, and the female actors are both handed notably less aptly written characters, with subsequently poor delivery. The Redwood saloon is a rare exception from the otherwise strong sets, as its cheap Cotton Club look is a poor attempt at narrating African American culture via lighthouse symbolism.

I appreciate that. But Zazie's character and action has a lot of flaws.Her not being present with the gang could prevent a lot of trouble. It was her half-assed plan that got them caught and got them all in danger. What were they thinking? A ruthless outlaw is going to believe the story and send you away just like you came?The second mistake was that she wasn't paying that much of an attention to make sure her opponent died. Really?

In the rest of the movie, he's quite mild with a bit of sadness in his eyes. The story line makes sense and the movie ended very dramatically and emotionally.Characters like Chester was played VERY well by LaKeith. Initially I thought casting Jonathan to play Love was not the right choice, but was pleasantly surprised by his execution of the role.I don't think there should be a sequel as the last shot suggests, however.

African Americans are too Americans some people seem bothered but it's about time we see something new on screen as far as Westerns go. There were also Chinese cowboys so somebody should make that film as well. Anyways the film is about 2 rival cowboy gangs who have a long term and forever beef. There's a protagonist & an antagonist but it's almost as if everyone is a villain in the wild Wild West. Both gangs are cutthroat & ready for action. If you like action this movie will entice you like 7 people died the first 30 seconds lol. Overall it's worth a watch & the soundtrack is also unique using reggae which was a pleasant surprise. 8/10.,The Harder They Fall
288,treistan,Get Over Yourselves,8,6 November 2021,"So for the butthurt, people who claim they can't understand the lingo...that's just because your privilege has denied you exposure to a rich culture with the exception for the tired rap music stereotypes you hear on the radio. This is not about proper English; it's about dialect and you just haven't been in the deep end long enough to appreciate it. Get over yourselves.For the even more trifling fools who want to complain about the soundtrack (which is SENSATIONAL!!!) and the use of reggae music, I didn't hear you crying about Rick Ross rapping about 100 Black Coffins in Django Unchained. You know? Because it FIT with perfection, and the music fits here, too. My next stop is iTunes.And now for the even more butthurt people complaining about the portrayal of white folks as shiftless and unintelligent...didn't hear you complaining about the the portrayal of blacks in films as gangsters, mad African tyrants, rapists, etc...so why speak up now. Why...because you're butthurt! There were plenty of nice white folks in the movie from the sniveling bank teller to the Army officer to the bank manager who helped with a heist. Didn't you happen to notice that some of the truly bad behavior was done by the outlaws...the black outlaws? No, I guess not...because you were too busy being butthurt. Get over yourselves.This was a great film, and I enjoyed every moment of it. The introduction was insanely in your face, which was disconcerting. But the ending cinched it up and it all made perfect sense. I always enjoy a little cliche in my media to remind me that art imitates life and vice versa. Idris Elba will always be my guiding star to a film, though it pains me when he plays the heel. Still, what a wonderful heel. Jonathan Majors has stepped up into a role with real range, a far cry from his Lovecraft Country role, which I felt constrained him. It was nice to see his growth as an actor. Danielle Deadwyler was my standout with a sensitive, authentically androgynous portrayal of Cuffee. And I will be hunting down films with LaKeith Stanfield, who nailed Cherokee Bill.Please ignore some of the really bad reviews here. Yeah, it's gory, delightful so. But so was Halloween Kills, which was awful! The gore fits. This is a great film with great acting. It's a western for God's sake, it will be cliched in place. Suspend your belief and enjoy the ride!

It's a love story. It's a power-struggle story. It's a story about redemption, and I would bet 9 out of 10 of the individuals who gave this film a negative review were not of the ethnicity that this movie is filled to the brim with. Since this a movie written and cast for and by Black people, I can see why it would not be received well by white people.The cast was phenomenal. The tension between Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) and Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) was palpable, as was the respectful hate between Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Mary Fields (Zazie Beetz). I especially loved ""Cuffee"" (Danielle Deadwyler) who was the most underestimated character in the movie, but she proved to be the most loyal and powerful.The soundtrack was great, modern and appropriate.

319,ctrygalk,Monotone,2,4 November 2021,"The only scene with any energy was the opening scene and because of that it felt it wasn't a part of the same movie. I kept waiting for some sort of emotion or passion but it never came even though according to the premise it should have been there. No character building so I didn't become invested. No storyline of interest or difference. A cast of talented actors with the same personality to the point it could have been a cast of one. Halfway through I wondered why this high caliber of talent signed up to do it. I can only think of one reason and have to wonder if it was reason enough. For me there was so much wrong with this movie. I love westerns so I'm disappointed. Way to recycle one unmoving line over and over again ""please please please"".

320,eldonscott,Well...,4,6 November 2021,"Look, it's not ""great"". But it's worth watching just to see Majors and Stanfield burn up the screen, they were really good. King, who has talent, feels dimensionless throughout. At one point she has her chance with a monologue to establish something more of who the character is and it's empty and flat and felt like just a run through before filming, maybe it was. And Elba, who I expect more from, where were you, man? The stoicism didn't work especially with all of your close-ups at important moments, I guess the director should take the hit there.For anyone able to critically view the movie it's in no way a 10 and it doesn't have to be, that's not what's important. I enjoyed many aspects of the film, as I mentioned there are several very entertaining performances and that's a lot. I loved the unexpected use of reggae music. I liked how at a few choice moments the actors would sing and in particular when Majors does and the shot moves in on his vibrato and snarl, I wanted other unexpected moments like that.Something else I was distracted by was the set of the town, it looked like a set and it shouldn't. Maybe it was a intentional aesthetic choice but I don't think it works out well here.I could keep unpacking several other aspects of the film but instead I will say there's a lot of good here but as it is with many movies, too many missed opportunities.Yeah, I doubt many will find my review ""helpful"", but it's the sober truth.",The Harder They Fall

I was trying to predict myself the ending, because you really couldn't know if it would go one way or another but more than likely the good bad guys will always win.

It felt like a Quentin Tarantino fan flick with music score choices that weren't just questionable but just didn't serve the scene at all. There was too many occasions where events were just allowed to happen, it didn't feel organic and these events of been easily stopped if not for people disappearing, daydreaming or trying to look cool.

343,coolsvillesucks,Can't have it both ways,3,4 November 2021,"Right off the bat they make sure we know that while the story is fiction, black cowboys existed. I mean, sorry Mr. Director never said they didn't. Why they felt the need to hit us over the head instead of letting the movie tell us idk.If you're going to hit me in the head with a hammer that says ""these people existed""... maybe chill on the idea that there were towns full of just black people. Or alternatively, don't hit me with a hammer. You cannot have your movie both ways. Either choose to make a point, or choose to make a good western.Anyways. This movie is attempting at a stylistic revenge western based on the idea that black cowboys existed. This honestly seems great like a great concept to me! Blending in components of black culture, fun gangs, great actors, fun camera work. Cool! Fun! But it's not really that. It's ""what if we did a western but all the cowboys were black and there were only like 10 white people who were all racist villains who got killed immediately"".More stories based on black cowboys would be fun! Is anyone actually opposed to that? This movie sure treats the idea like everyone is. Did anyone hate Django just because it told the story of a black man? Did anyone hate Django because it had white people in it??? I guess maybe if they made the movie any better it would just be Django so maybe that's why it's lacking lol.It's like the ""let's do a modern day re-telling of Macbeth set in gang-land Chicago"" of westerns.

First off this isn't really the case. The movie knows what it is and not taking itself too seriously, as the messages and themes here aren't very profound. The director was clearly going more for style which he pulled off very well. I really liked this one. It felt fresh for the genre. I liked the action sequences and thought they were done really well. The banter was well done and so was the sets and costume design. My only complaint for costumes was that idris Elba looks goofy in the prisoner jump suit. But visually it is a good looking movie that makes it stand out and definitely one of the better attempts of a movie I have seen from Netflix, so bravo for that.",The Harder They Fall

The cast played their roles really well, I believed who they were trying to be. The script was intelligent and believable. There was humour and drama in equal amounts.The scenery was cleverly done; the white town was VERY white, the black towns full of colour.The violence was just enough to be hard hitting without being made ""too much"" to watch.The downside to the movie is, it's not all that original in story. It's your typical revenge western that's been done many times. It felt very much like ""magnificent seven"" (remake) in style.

The film is of a beloved genre that doesn't center their perspective or worry about them at all. I guess that's scary for some.A few things to keep in mind after watching this:Don't complain about the gore if you enjoyed Django Unchained.Don't call it derivative of Tarantino if you don't also call Tarantino derivative of Sergio LeoneDon't whine about the music if you liked the soundtrack to the newest iteration of The Great Gatsby.Don't cry that it makes caucasians into caricatures if you liked Gone With the Wind, or pretty much any film that depicts 19th century black people.Don't quack about it being ""woke"" when politics has always been reflected in art.And don't call it ""historically inaccurate"" when it's clearly & intentionally a fantastical take on certain historical figures.Not a perfect film (it's a rare film that is) but it's a damn good one.

It's up there with True Grit, Magnificent 7, and others. I have watch westerns all my life and this is one of the best. Don't listen to the critics that hate on the movie.

380,chinogrady,"Great cast and visuals, absolute unbearable slow story",2,8 November 2021,"Clear example of an ensemble that was up for something great but ends doomed by a poor story with unbelievable plans that fall short of what a toddler could come up with. Many situations that are ridiculous and obvious which make you shout at the screen ""please don't do it!"". Lack of creativity and what I consider plain mediocrity when it comes to how the storyline resolves the situations or creates them. Right after the heroes go into ""Redmond City"" without a plan and only to be pumelled right after their original ""ridiculous plan"" had failed and the hero/avenger's girlfriend ends up prisoner and almost dead. At this point I had to checke how much of it nonsense was still pending to transpire and I just could not stomach 50' more minutes of pure incoherences. I had to stop the movie and do something else, so my review goes up to that point. It was just not worth any more time to see if it could be salvaged by any new detail or a change in rythm (slow as hell too).",The Harder They Fall

The quirky filming really made me want to like it as it reminds me of a Wes Anderson film....except unlike a Wes Anderson film this is just bad. There's also numerous moments where this film just doesn't make any sense. A good example of this would be that one scene on the train involved the general sending his inexperienced son to single handedly thwart an invasion party only to be used as a hostage later...just stupid. Also, am I really supposed to believe that a general would be tasked to protect a prisoner? And with only 10 guards??? Combine this stupidity with the oddly bright and airy cinematography and I honestly couldn't tell you if this film was meant to be a joke or just obscenely bad on all fronts.

At 2h 19m the 'story' could have fit into 90 minutes.It's like a western you've never seen before and once you see it, you'll wish never to see it again. Everyone concerned should be embarrassed but you know Netflix will commission a million of these novelty 'time-wasters' in the coming years.

392,alexezeoke,Weak storyline(SPOILER),4,4 November 2021,I was quite intrigued to watch a movie with a mostly black cast then the story became very weak.

401,kmfintland,"Well, er, not sure why they made it.",3,6 November 2021,"Okay, I have nothing against a western where ALL the main characters are POC. However, a few things about this movie spoiled it for me:
First off - where could you buy a revolver in the 1880's that ejected the cartridges after you fired? (the scene in the train when they free Rufus)
Was it necessary to make the entire town of Maysville white inside and out?The town Rufus came to claim back, really? In the 1880's there were fully formed towns where the entire population was black? Possibly, but I doubt they looked like that.All that aside, the cinematography was good, the music was a bit out of character for the period but that's no biggy, and the acting was pretty good. (Would have been better if Nat Love could actually ride upright not leaning over to the left all the time).The best bit of realism in the film was it was about rival black gangs going about killing each other, bringing a bit of the 21st century to the 19th century.",The Harder They Fall

It didn't have the jive talk or the n-word which I was happy to see. I'm not sure why the rating is so Lowe but some people have obviously not seen the movie.

There were some very funny scenes (the bank robbery) but too many spots where my husband or I asked, ""why did he...?"" or ""why did she...?"" and a shootout that was three times longer than it should have been (bad guys coming out one or two at a time). Still, taken in its totality, it was a rousing western that paid homage to real Black men and women of the old west.",The Harder They Fall
441,filmreview14,Phenomenal Movie!!!,10,4 November 2021,"The only reason why this score is so low is because a few white people have a problem with an all black western cast. There were few critiques on the script, directing, or acting. Most of the low scores have comments talking about black cowboys wouldn't exist during those times but meanwhile those same people will praise fantasy and scifi movies. Maybe pick up a book or do some research on the internet so you can see that THESE PEOPLE DID EXIST! The film was bold, fun, and daring with phenomenal performances from all cast members with masterful directing, dialogue, and a very solid script. The only thing I think could have been improved was the score of the film in my own personal opinion. In reality its a 9 based off the score but I had to make it a 10 to boost the films rating up after all these soft *** white reviewers think making a western with an all black cast is a political move.

It is a new genre of western and even though I am not a fan of Westerns, I am a huge fan of this! It is smart and cool. Introducing new actors and showcasing established actors as well. Regina King shines in her roll as a slick talking,gun slinging outlaw! Her dialogue and storytelling skills are on point. She keeps you drawn in from the first scenes to the very end of dialogue. Every scene she is in is a joy to watch! Idris Elba is also an established actor that is so exciting to watch in such a roll as an American outlaw! All of the cast is spectacular in their roles!

And I love when it when Westerns are given new perspective or placed in alt settings or parodied (Tampopo/Bubba Ho-tep/No Country for Old Men/Mariachi/PeeWee walking into the biker bar) so everyone whining about no way there could be a West populated only by Blacks are either unaware of the history of Blacks in the West or are ignoring that perhaps the makers of the film made Redwood a metaphor for Harlem or Tulsa or any number of communities.That being said...
Many references to religion, evil, Devil, hypocrisy and redemption of faith/Abel vs Cain/etc.Definite use of the antihero.Kick ass independent women (although one of them has to be rescued by her prince...poor plot choice)
Familiar tropes and some twists.Lots of duels and violence...And it is the last part that makes this film a dud. Almost half of the movie involves action or violent tension and, unfortunately, most of it is about as thrilling as two day old (put your least favorite leftover here--oatmeal? Kale? Lard chunks in gravy? Who keeps leftover kale?). There is a standoff in a railcar, mimicked by a standoff in a saloon, copied by a standoff in a bank, completed with the same standoff in the street that ignites the finale. Later our hero runs down the street in slo-mo killing bad guys that are conveniently standing without cover or having their weapons raised so he can shoot a dude on the right take three steps shoot a dude on the left take three steps shoot a dude on the right repeat all the way down the street. To use the same device that this film utilizes at the start of the film...
The. Action. Scenes. Suck. That being said, there are moments of violence that are extremely effective, but none of the best ones are part of an overall action montage.Not bummed that I watched it, but will have zero motivation to ever watch any part of it again (unlike Tombstone, Last of the Mohicans, Road Warrior, Once Upon a Time in the West, Ride with the Devil, and so many more).",The Harder They Fall

It was funny, the characters embodied black culture while representing what western life would have looked like for black people as well. There were modern elements included, which was so creative. If you're looking to be entertained, slightly educated on the characters and taken on an emotional roller coaster, this is a great film. I love Jonathan Majors!

For the most part, there are no one dimensional characters and action was pretty good especially in the third act... the only problems for me were the plot twist at the end (which you could kind of see coming) and the soundtrack seemed a little forced in some areas. Outside of those two things, the movie itself was pretty good.Some of you guys need to ""exhale"". I think everyone who has a problem with a western movie that has a predominantly black cast needs to take a few steps back and revisit the history of this country. The characters were real even tho the story is fictitious. There were towns during that time that only had black ppl living in it. There's no BLM agenda in the movie, and there's no racist or overt remarks about white ppl in this movie.

As a western, it was beautifully shot and had characters that didn't need to be developed beyond their own personal one-liners and quirks. What really makes the movie standout as a winner to me is the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously. It takes the approach of the big blockbuster western with the highest production quality; but with a predominantly black cast, a fantastic challenge to the over-romanticized, cultural depiction of the wild west that were as inherently racist as their target audience, and dialog that was as quick as a Tarantino film with the hilarious one-liners of a Wayans brother comedy.

The dialogue is really good and can be pretty funny! The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is incredible- everything from the score to the soundtrack, which includes some reggae that seems like it wouldn't fit, but totally does. The set design is brilliant. Ignore the reviews saying this is ""revisionist history"" - it literally tells you at the beginning of the movie that, while the people are real, the events aren't! I have seen some criticism that they cast Zazie Beetz, a light-skinned actress, to play Mary Fields, a dark-skinned woman, and while I think Zazie did a great job, that's a completely fair criticism and definitely a general trend in casting that needs to be addressed.

The cast is so talented and each one delivers a performance that would be top tier if the story was better written. With all the historical figures and their own personal histories to pull from the characters sadly become an addition to the long list of cookie-cutter western characters. The inspiration for the story, cinematography and shoot-outs are all clear, Sergios Leone and Tarantino are the obvious, but there was nothing new brought to the table aside from the run time. Lord this film did almost everything conceivable to stretch the run time. It is almost thirty minutes too long. Excessive close ups, pointless shots on characters that stray too long and afterthought scenes abound. I personally believe a Bass Reeves biopic would have been a better direction to go and Delroy Lindo was a great casting choice for Bass Reeves. Bass Reeves also has an amazing long and storied career that is only sparsely hinted at in the film. He was a rightfully feared lawman who spoke several Native languages and dialects who was able to retire after decades of service. A feat very rare for the times. The film is good.

504,shaesmith-81391,Great Spin on a Western,10,7 November 2021,"I loved that the characters and the storyline were unapologetically Black in this movie. The mannerisms, the humor, the romantic moments, the pain and anguish, the pride of the Black man and woman, and the need to build something that Black citizens could live and thrive in was represented beautifully.",The Harder They Fall
505,varslady,Entertaining from beginning to end.,10,7 November 2021,While the story itself was fictional. The characters portrayed in this movie were real.I loved that all of the of the front runners were Black. The opening scene had me hooked. I kind predicted what would happen next but it was entertaining nonetheless. The name of the train..Man that put me back in my feels. Great homage to the one and only Chadwick A. Boseman.The ending... Didn't see that coming.Don't listen to the negative reviews. Watch it and judge for yourself. I'm gonna watch it again today.,The Harder They Fall
506,miyah-85021,Loved it!!!,10,7 November 2021,This movie is a refreshing take on having BLACK people display something other than the status quo. So go learn about ACTUAL cowboys versus COWHANDS! The acting was good and the plot had such a twist.,The Harder They Fall
507,deltaeh,Riveting movie about real life Black Westerners,10,7 November 2021,"This movie was not only entertaining in showing Western movies where there is plenty of shooting and killing, but highlights real people that are not highlighted in our history!

509,ljoybrown,Phenomenal acting and showcase of the original cowboys,9,7 November 2021,"This film is a must watch. Although some of the casting was questionable, I completely get it as I read reviews from white people. It's sad that in 2021, we are still faced with colorism and being dissected in the white gaze. Most people aren't familiar with these characters because of white washed history. Most people aren't even aware that Black cowboys came first, again white washed history. The soundtrack is perfect, the acting showcased Blackness without the need for white approval and it was perfect. If they had cast a dark skin Stagecoach Mary, we would see even more bad reviews coming from white people. I now understand why they gave us a light skin attractive Stagecoach Mary.",The Harder They Fall
510,slcarter-39845,Best Western I've EVER SEEN...,10,7 November 2021,"This was by far the best movie I've seen in my entire life. From start to finish this All Star Cast didn't disappoint. The acting was absolutely superb, the American Violence was reflective of the country we've built and the monsters we've birthed. Killing, Rapping, Violence is the DNA of this country and this movie brought out all the demons from the seeds we planted post slavery.",The Harder They Fall
511,cassandramduncan,Start to Finish intriguing.,10,7 November 2021,"Thoroughly enjoyed this modern take on western characters. Each character was played well by a top notch cast. Would have loved to see someone who actually embodied the real Stage Coach Mary, but the actress played her role. The violence in the film is on the level of the ""Inglorious Basterds"" or ""Olympus Has Fallen"". Storyline based on revenge that ends with a twist and hopefully a sequel. Would make a good Netfilx series if it expounded and explored many more of the little known Black cowboys and cowgirls. Revenge Fantasy done right on so many levels.",The Harder They Fall

I was enthralled by the trailer alone, even though I typically despise trailers. Give this movie all the flowers! Your attention is captured rapidly within the first 8 minutes.

The cast was filled with beautiful individuals who are each masters of the craft, especially Regina King, Jonathan Majors, and Delroy Lindo. The costuming and music were awesome. It was wonderful to see a story about the Black and Indigenous cowboys, they absolutely existed at the time but you don't often see it in the media.

But it was very entertaining, it seriously gave me true Western vibes. I loved the impromptu comical moments with Jim and Bill. Almost every actor did a great job in their performance (I seriously was marveling over the fact that I was rooting for Regina King to fail, something I have never ever did). The newcomers did a really great job and held their own against heavyweights like Idris, Regina, and Delroy. And I always love watching Jonathan Majors and LaKeith Stansfield on screen. Breakout star to me was RJ Cyler. Jim stole every scene that he was in. Honorable mention was Danielle Deadwyler. I am recommending this movie to everyone!",The Harder They Fall
521,IKeepItReal,Don't listen to the low ratings.,9,7 November 2021,"Fantastic movie, im really pleased with the actors chosen to be in this film. Their roles were really fitting. But I noticed alot of the low ratings on this movie is more or so just about it being a all black cast. Makes me think their ratings are more about being upset the cast didnt have many white cowboys than the actual movie it's self. Even reading the critics reviews the color of their skin is always mentioned..... just sad. All im saying is give it a try your self.",The Harder They Fall

531,wendellhatcher-69548,Amazing movie based on truth characters and towns!,10,7 November 2021,This movie was a breath of fresh air due to the history we get which we all know is false and based on blatant racism. There were black towns even the town redwood was based on a real town. The very term cowboy was based on real black cowboys and people. This is what you get when people get false history based on racism in the reviews.,The Harder They Fall

I actually went into this film with no expectations. I only had a desire to see ""us"" on the big screen and it did NOT disappoint. I real movie lover can appreciate the start studded cast, loosely based off the images of real live black people that lives during this period of time. I loved it and damn anyone that has a problem with it.",The Harder They Fall
538,ricsiboc,The title says it all.,2,7 November 2021,"First i'd like to point out the excelent work of the crew. The scenery and the efects were great i'd definately like to see more of these guys work.The screenplay was also fairly good, but not even Henry Cavill or Momoa would have saved this monstrocity.The easiest way to tell the quality of a movie is to just listen to it. If it has a lot of music, then it's a bad movie, simple as that. Just playing random music, simply can't woke emotions. We all have heard how professionally composed sound effects can increase the tension at the right moment...well you won't experience any of that in this film.The plot is flat from the begining to the end. These modern boastful, big-mouthed characters, have nothing to do in any film, especially western. What's next 50cent gonna be the new sheriff and he will rap to the prisoners?The characters are cliché, but anyway they just randomly droping their background story trying to fill up the big hole in the non-existing story.The climax of the film the shooting sceen that everyone was waiting for.. maybe the worst i've ever seen. Without any spoiler we all know the scene from literally every western where the good guys sieging the town with hundreds of bad guys in every window and the good guys have to find a clever way to eliminate them.. But why the careful planing and preparations when you can just walk into the middle of the mainroad with a six-shots and bang-bang.",The Harder They Fall
539,jaidedfocus,That Plot Twist Tho,10,7 November 2021,"I'll be brief. It was a Netflix movie produced by Jay-Z. I was NOT expecting much. But I was happily wrong. Everything from the music that to me perfectly enhanced the movie, to the character development.The characters were well written and everyone had purpose. Not one character was there just taking up screen time. Each character drove one scene to the next. There were some slow moments but this was really action packed and well written.",The Harder They Fall

Nah!,10,8 November 2021,"I BEEN watching Westerns-""Ponderosa,"" ""Gunsmoke,"" ""Maverick,"" ""Branded,"" ""Rawhide,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Tombstone,"" ""Django,"" ""Buck and the Preacher,"" ""Silverado,"" Magnificent Seven""...it's my genre. Rarely have I seen a movie, let alone a Western, that hits all cylinders--including Easter Eggs like The Harder They Fall Does!Jeymes Samuel does the dang thing with style and pace and plot and casting and soundtrack. In all honesty, this flick is better than I expected. I mean, Regina King ALWAYS delivers. But, I have never seen an actor do what she did with an apple and a knife and a confession evrrrr. Not surprisingly, The Harder They Fall is much better than a host of Whyte folks can stand. Something about Black excellence really grates brittle nerves.This Western even gets bonus points for making overt racists and de facto racists self-identify in the User Reviews. Maybe they don't know about Black cowboys and how Black folks, in general, won the West. But as they say, ""Ignorance is no excuse."" Especially in the age of Google. BTW: I'm old enough to remember the 1951 film ""Tomahawk,"" where Beckwourth was played by popular actor Jack Oakie,but there was one problem-Oakie was white/Beckwourth was black.Perhaps that is part of the purpose of the film. To make people inquire as to who the characters portrayed really were. As always, too many default to willful ignorance and rest in the comfort of Black people never did, or will accomplish anything.Yeah. Okay-",The Harder They Fall
541,HippiePeaceChic,Black Cowboy Western,10,8 November 2021,"All star line up. Never a lull in the action. Word of caution, quite a bit of violence but history was not without controversy.

543,matthewstaquilla,And let those be mad,10,8 November 2021,"A lot of white people are mad about this one 😂 ol well. It was a really great movie. I was not expecting the ending to be what it was. Me and my son stayed up and watched it. It's over 2 hours long. I'm not really a big movie person, I do t really watch too many movies. But this one had me stuck from the beginning. There were no racial slurs which the REAL colorless are really mad about. And that's okay. There will be a lot more movies like this to come. A new day and a new age. Things are slowly shifting focus off of what white people in Hollywood would consider ""normal"" and I believe that so many negative comments is due to those people not wanting and not really ready for the big shift that is coming. I loved the fact that the black characters didn't use any slurs towards each other either. They did away with any slurs period and that made it feel..... refreshing. I'm not into westerns too much. There are only two that I like that star a black actor. I'm glad they didn't try to white wash this movie and that's really the main focus point. Again ALOT of negative feed back. But if you don't see color ""like most whites claim they don't"" then you'll enjoy this movie too. Besides who cares what they say on here, let the box office do the numbers. That alone will tell you how good the movie really is. Definitely adding this movie to my favorites collections.",The Harder They Fall

547,kkhemet,Still Looking for the films Depicting Black Unity,6,8 November 2021,"The movie is a movie. It's not a documentary, so historical accuracy is not required. In fact, they seem to thumb their nose at historical accuracy by naming the town Redwood, while Nat Love is known to be associated with Deadwood, South Dakota. Bass Reeves was a Marshall in the West, in Oklahoma territory, not South Dakota. Mary Fields became famous in Montana, while Bill Pickett was a Texas cowhand. This movie places all of them in a fictional Black town, like one of the many that were formed before, during and after the Civil War. The story is a total fiction. The nature of the characters, for the most part, does not match their character in real life.The beauty of the story is that it represents another chink in the armor that has represented cowboy movies ever since the 1st one was filmed. The music, the language, cinematography give us a whole different idea of what life could have been like, for Black folks, in the Wild, Wild, West.",The Harder They Fall

I'm so glad that it didn't stick to the old Western storytelling tropes, but instead it set out to break boundaries in every sense of the word.

Which is a character in the movie The Cherokee Kid starring Sinbad, Ernie Hudson, Burt Reynolds, to name a few. Some of characters in The Harder They Fall are also in The Cherokee Kid as well as the scene when Nat Love gets shot in the chest...in the movie the Cherokee Kid, Nat Love gave the Cherokee kid a shirt to wear that had a bullet hole in the shirt. Although The Harder They Fall makes no correlation to the Cherokee Kid - I enjoyed this movie. The action was non-stop. There was a good mix of sadness and humor. Although the language was a bit raw I got past that and really enjoyed all of the characters.

Besides the way most of the actors were behaving (why is it necessary to act like a street thug from New York in a western movie) I was especially taken back from the choice of music. There was not one piece of music that sounded like it was made or chosen for this movie.

574,insanityrone,Stylized Vision of a Classic Western Tale,6,5 November 2021,"It's not monumental. It is quite good though. Original in its scope and portrayal. Great acting, and some bad; good writing, and some bad; cool aesthetic. The West was never this clean, but I get it, and I dig it. Production design is excellent. Haters of the music, ugh, catch up, one of the few things young Hollywood is doing well - and yes much like most of this film it's stolen from Tarantino. That's okay. I love Tarantino. If you're a fan of this and not Tarantino then you probably like Family Guy and not The Simpsons, so to speak.As an overall original film piece this movie crushes it. Highly entertaining. Written well in what it was trying to do, shaky towards the end. Likely the most proofread script of the last year. Every word has meaning. Conceptually it's historical fiction, an awesome and often misunderstood genre. Solid supporting acting. The music is superb. Costume design superb. Production. A bit weak in cinematography and directing, film school like, yet the little nuances the director added in the first hour and a pinch later carried it through.Idris adds a lot to the whole film. LaKeith Stanfield steals every scene he's in - can you say Val Kilmer. Boom! Great performance. Worth watching for him. The supporting stereotypical roles are well filled by RJ Cyler, Damon Wayans Jr and definitely Danielle Deadwiler. Give a pat on the back to comic Deon Cole, his little false soliloquy to camera was almost stirring.Sadly, the pacing really falls apart after the first act. Director Jeymes Samuel lost it in the editing room somehow - about an hour+ into the film it becomes The Harder to Follow. Trying to pull off an Unforgiven by going super deep drama act II, missed it. About 30 minutes of poor storytelling before it picks back up with the classic revenge thriller. Some cool ideas executed less than perfectly cinematically, again pacing and editing, a few seconds here and there, add a John Woo homage for a true post-Tarantino feel, and voila maybe a cult classic.Final thoughts. Zazie Beats is bad in this. Delroy Lindo is perfect. Jonathan Majors had a lot on his shoulders, and he did well. Taking nothing away from him. He was fifty-fifty. Felt like he tried too hard at times, or just couldn't pull it off.On par with the likes of the Quick and the Dead, Lone Ranger, Posse, 3:10 to Yuma or Silverado. You can tell everyone had fun making this film. It's entertaining, fresh and has a ton of charisma. I want to watch it again.John David Washington would have annihilated the lead in this.",The Harder They Fall

577,xfk-223-299961,"Ignore the 1 star reviews, they don't get it...",9,9 November 2021,"Firstly, it amazes me the kind of racist comments that IMDb allows on to it's platform (go read the 1 star reviews for this film) then go check out the reviews for Django Unchained, a film that can draw heavy comparisons with The Harder They Fall. Clearly 2 stars is the difference between a majority white cast and a majority black cast.I am not a western or a 70s movie fan, I have played Red Dead Redemption 2 and I can totally see where this film gets ALL if it's inspiration. The fact of the matter is, it's very well written and very well executed with a great cast that shines a light on modern day America and it's all too recent history. The subtle and not so subtle call backs in it are inspired and a lot of work has gone in to making this and extremely entertaining and interesting movie. It's near 2.5h run time is perfect and it's held together by great script that is skilful headed up by Elba, Majors & King.Hats off to Netflix for being bold and pushing back. I look forward to more like this. I just hope people aren't put off by the relatively mediocre score on here. It deserves more... has IMDb got moderators?",The Harder They Fall

579,MarjorieHMorgan,These. People. Existed.,10,4 November 2021,"The Harder They Fall (2021) Jeymes Samuel.This film is marketed as a western, but it is more than that; to me 'The Harder They Fall' defies true genre definition. It is a hero's journey, a family story set across multiple towns, and an intimate portrayal of love. This is the film, dressed as a western, that I needed. The work of Jeymes Samuel as writer, director, and producer is genius.The script, soundtrack, cinematography, costume, scenery. All of it is a work of genius.The Rufus Buck Gang, led by the acting giant Idris Elba, appears to have the upper hand over the Nat Love Gang, and The Crimson Hood Gang however films with a western sensibility are all about rapid shifts in power at the end of a bullet. Rufus Buck is a man on mission, to be an example for others to follow by living large and free in plain sight in the promised land, his own Redwood City. This is therefore a thank you letter to Jeymes Samuel et al., I've waited a long time for this story.The actors, one and all, were a pleasure to see on screen. The casting was spot on. I won't detail all the cast, however I will mention a few:Regina King as Trudy Smith was outstanding, as usual. One of a number of strong female characters that made my heart sing in recognition of those who have gone before us. Direct, purposeful, answerable to herself. So much of King's power is shred through subtle movements of her eyes, a slight incline of her head, a pointed finger: she has an assured presence that is enhanced by her silence and sparse gestures.Zazie Beetz was the perfect female foil to King's character with her representation as Stagecoach Mary Fields - they recognise the power and status in each other. Mary Fields is an entrepreneur and a self motivated leader, she say to The Nat Love Gang, ""What y'all waiting around for? You think destiny is comin' to you?"" She writes her own future, no one owns her, she is the only one who gives herself permission to act.Delroy Lindo is Delroy Lindo who adds a certain gravitas and authenticity to anything he chooses to appear in. When he says, ""I've seen the Devil, and Rufus Buck ain't him. Devil's white"", you know he's speaking as Marshal Bass Reeves, Delroy Lindo, and a multitude of people who have faced what he has.LaKeith Stanfield, who I'm not usually a fan of, seemed to shine in this role as Cherokee Bill, as if he's been waiting for it to appear: it fit him like a glove. In my opinion, it is his finest performance yet as he delivered his dialogue with pristine aplomb.Deon Cole also surprised me with the emotional range he brought to his character - more breadth than I've seen in his many previous appearances on screen.The characters were all strong. Every one of the main characters had their own history, their own dreams, and their own demons yet this did not prevent great moments of humour where I laughed out loud.For example, the contrast of the strong, vibrant colourfulness the Redwood City, and also of Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) and Cuffee (Danielle Deadwyler) as they ride into Maysville (It's a White Town) where the images that arrest you are the uniform blandness of the town that is stocked with crates of white ivory soap, The Diablo saloon, and the Latin motto on the bank door that invites a show of strength to gain rewards: 'he who has rules makes gold'.The soundtrack was surprising and phenomenal: every individual track added to the texture and depth of the story, bringing in threads of different histories through each beat to make a beautiful audio tapestry. Many of my favourite moments of recognition included the musical nods to Black Panther (2018) and specify to Chadwick A. Boseman in particularly tense moments. The soundtrack feels like a warm blanket on a cold day, and then there's the whistling ... that addition deserves an essay to itself.I'm one of those cinema goers who stays to the end of all the credits, and then rise slowly and thoughtfully, however, when the last beat and the last frame appeared I did not switch off, instead I rewound the film and started all over again. It is gripping and satisfying. It deserves multiple viewings.I feel sated.I'm looking forward to more, especially featuring Regina King, as indicated by the last pre-credits frame.The Harder They FallThese. People.

580,tony857,Stupidest Western Ever Made,3,8 November 2021,"The Stupidest Western ever made. It was more like a Horror movie with how the movie used the characters Stupid decisions to drive the story. The Director also uses Iconography instead of common sense plot elements to tell the story. In one scene the Train engineer of a 100 Ton locomotive stops the train because Regina King is on the Tracks with a 1 Ton horse. Why would you stop a Train in the Wild West, Train Robbers, Angry Indigenous people, risk of derailing the Train for a woman on a Horse? Stupid decision. Regina King straddling the train tracks makes a good Icon, but a terrible plot element. The entire movie goes from one Bad decision to the next.Plus the gigantic plot holes. Idris Elba wants to build a Utopian town with Regina King, but he's a psychotic Mass Murderer and he extorts and murders the town people???",The Harder They Fall

Lakeith Stanfield As Cherokee Bill was another great standout and Regina King and Idris are always exceptional in whatever they do.Great western story. The music was awesome and fit the scenes and the vibe perfectly. The camera work was great as was the directing. I have only good things to say about this film.All the white people in here with their panties in a twist about how it's not ""historical"" 🙄 the entire main cast and most of the supporting characters are all based on real people. Despite what your whitewashed version of history taught you, black people did exist in the western states during this period. And they had wealth and some even had property. There was a whole world between reconstruction and Jim Crow that people know nothing about there's also whole swatches of influential black peoples throughout all periods that have been erased. Btw I'm a white people and I don't feel a pathological need to see only white faces on screen. Great to see an all black cast being exceptionally good at what they do. Entertaining, gripping, visually pleasing and an all around great movie with great performances. I found it refreshing and not a tired old western that's been played out over and over. Loved that the train Idris was on was called the C. A. Boseman! A lovely tribute and the twist at the end was great. Well executed, well acted well done!

589,tslape8321,"Highly Stylized, Fun, and a Love Letter to Westerns and Directors Like Tarantino",10,7 November 2021,"So, let's start here: the acting, the setting, the aesthetics, the directorial choices? TOP NOTCH. I mean, talk about cinema. Can't wait to see more from the entire crew of this movie. The dialogue was just about my favorite part of the whole experience. Witty? Check. Self aware? Check, check. Fast-paced? Triple check.It's a highly stylized western that uses music to punctuate the scenes and even drive the viewpoint, AND it was just plain fun to watch. It had depth, but didn't shy away from western tropes. Instead they were unashamedly there and totally working. I loved all the characters and their very typical cowboy names and obsessions with being the ""fastest draw in the west.""Now, if you came here to watch a realistic movie about life in the ole' west-maybe stop a moment ask yourself why the heck you decided to watch a flipping fictional movie about cowboys in the first place. Sorry to burst your bubble, but they never claimed to be realistic.To the people whining about ""where's the dust"" or ""how come it's so colorful"" or ""but the women never sweat,"" remember that this isn't the first movie made where unrealistic things happen and it won't be the last, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it anyway. Suspension of disbelief, my friends. It's a wonderful thing. Try it out next time you watch a movie and you might actually enjoy yourself for once.Every bad review I've seen for this either starts with ""I'm not mad that that whole cast is black BUT"" or goes all ""but historical realism"" blah, blah. I can't even begin to describe everything inherently wrong with the statement: ""why is the whole cast black."" So I won't.What I will say is: grow up.If you want realism, go watch a documentary. This is a movie. A fictional movie. And it doesn't owe you ANYTHING. So watch it or don't, but seriously watch it because everyone needs a little entertainment in their life now and again. And this is just darn entertaining.",The Harder They Fall

To keep it short, the writing was amazing each line was delivered as if it was the characters own thought, nothing seemed forced. The timing of certain gestures and responses were on point, not a single point was missed. Who ever casted this movie needs to be recognized at the highest regards. As a viewer I have to imagine the chemistry on set was something magical because they way the characters interacted with one another seemed so normal. The story line from the begging was so captivating, and whoever says otherwise is a big time hater!! Critics need to stop taking this movie as fact no where in the opening or ending credits does it say this movie is 100% fact, yes, these characters were real but this, much like a lot of cinematic masterpieces, is dramatized!

I'm an avid movie watcher and I've been able to pretty much accurately guess what most characters are going to say in almost every movie I've watched recently before they even say it... And those films that manage to have a bit of different script, it's been simply uninspiring.But I can honestly say that I could not tell what anyone in The Harder They Fall was going to say next. I was on the edge of my seat, eager and excited to see and hear what was coming next! I have not experienced that in YEARS! I cannot tell you how refreshing that was.Not to mention the music. So electrifying and unique! It was absolutely perfect in every single scene. There was actually a part where the music made me shout out loud from sheer joy and excitement!!Every single actor was exceptional, except for, unfortunately (for me), Jonathan Majors. He wasn't convincing enough and at times his acting felt a little wooden...But other than that, this is an incredible, INCREDIBLE piece of art! A must see.",The Harder They Fall

Check your local library or Amazon for books about Nat Love (Deadwood Dick), Jim Beckwourth, ""Stagecoach"" Mary Fields, Rufus Buck, Cathay Williams, Bill Pickett, Gertrude ""Trudy"" Smith, Cherokee Bill, and Bass Reeves -- the inspiration for television's Lone Ranger character.The Harder They Fall is a great depiction of quintessential American history that has been systematically erased.Unfortunately, in a nation imbued with white supremacist ideology, the thought that 1 of every 4 cowboys was a free or formerly enslaved African-American is much too much for folks of a certain mindset to bear.Briefly scan the ""It's too Black / where are the whites / this movie was unrealistic"" commentary throughout the reviews. Now filter those statements through a ""This movie is not about me or someone who looks like me, and I don't like that!"" lens.Stream The Harder They Fall on Netflix and determine for yourself how you feel about the film.",The Harder They Fall
619,spanayiotou,Exciting for about 20 minutes,5,8 November 2021,"The movie started off giving me a feeling of excitement. Finally, it was a long time since watched a great western. Interesting dialogues and great casting and acting (especially from Lakeith Stanfield). But after those minutes the movie seemed to be just going through the motions. Characters behaved in an illogical way, following actions with no meaning. Didn't see the point of some characters who were just like pointless garniture on a promising cake.",The Harder They Fall
620,f-schoellhammer,The worst Western i have seen so far,3,7 November 2021,"Boring and over dramatized. Predictable and drawn out. Often you think the actors don't take themselves seriously. The music is completely jumbled and rarely good. I had to struggle to watch the film to the end. The German synchro is so bad that I switched to the English version halfway through. Save yourself the 2 hours, there are enough good westerns.",The Harder They Fall
621,cjwsjw-00334,Historical exploitation,1,6 November 2021,"If you want to make a shoot'em up, fine, but why would you use historic figures who had no association in time, place, or occupation to do it?Moreover, several of these historic figures were highly respected and contributed greatly to their era. Bill Pickett was a champion rodeo performer and rancher, Mary Fields was a famous mail carrier in 1890's Montana, and Bass Reeves was one of the greatest lawmen of the old west. This film reduces all of them to caricatures and demeans their roles in their time.I love westerns and I love history. The two rarely are compatible, but this film is really a disappointment. Don't waste your time.",The Harder They Fall
622,sharonb1sb,Best movie of 2021,9,7 November 2021,"What a nice movie to watch, really was a long time since I enjoyed a movie this much!All the elements were there, love comedy excitement family revenge everything!Too bad I couldn't watch it in the cinema, this movie deserves that!",The Harder They Fall
623,nickworkalternative,Not controversial. Just not good.,3,7 November 2021,"When they made this kind of rubbish in the 70's at least it had some 70's style, it was on film so it looked good, and generally had enough redeeming features to make it watchable years later. Then as things progressed westerns went to new places, got grittier, more realistic or at least tried to move the genre on. Deadwood (based on the brilliant McCabe & Mrs. Miller) set the bar pretty high. Justified was a good modern take, and of course Tarantino did his thing. Then came this awful rot. It looks cheap, the music choices are awful, the direction blows... it's pretty much on par with Wild Wild West. There was so much fuss about it featuring black actors. What? Why? It shouldn't make a lick of difference. The only real questions this movie raises, is why'd they make it, and how'd they manage to make it so bad with such a good cast?",The Harder They Fall
624,robfromsc,10/10 instant classic,10,6 November 2021,"Very refreshing and different. This is one we'll include with other classics in ""our"" genre. Regina King kills her role. The entire cast did a great job. I would if this was a mini series.",The Harder They Fall

Something between
Idris Elba doing good as usual
But this Eegina and some young actors are so terrible and annoying
Faking emotions and reactions
Good luck next time..",The Harder They Fall
627,roxyslay,Makes me want more Black Westerns,9,8 November 2021,"I was apprehensive that this Western would fall into cliche ridiculousness, but it was written quite well. The dialogue and banter at times was comedic. It was sexualized as a filler. The plot was excellently crafted and played out well. The action wasn't dark and gruesome though bloody. I have watched it a couple times already. Can watch again.",The Harder They Fall
628,rthomash,Great Western,7,6 November 2021,The soundtrack is exhilarating. Comedic timing is on point. Stagecoach Mary casting and storyline is the only disappointment. Regina King kills it as always.,The Harder They Fall
629,damonmcarpenter,Excellent movie. Quite a few holes but easily overlooked because of how entertaining it is.,9,4 November 2021,"Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, Delroy Lindo, Regina King, Lakeith Stanfield, Jonathan Majors, RJ Cyler Edi Gathegi, Deon Cole and Danielle Deadwyler stand out.",The Harder They Fall
630,beautifulyhuman,HANDS DOWN BEST MOVIE IN 2022,10,6 November 2021,"The people who don't like this are probably racist white folk. Acting, phenomenal. Story, superb! The sound track PURE GOLD. The cinematography, absolutely beautiful. You can't compare a treasure like to other directors... you know who. Anywho. Stop being racist.",The Harder They Fall
631,katiekaradimos,Added to the collection,10,5 November 2021,"The music, the dialogue, the action. There is a reason why it's number 1 right now. A nice change from the original 'westerns', a modern spin that makes it very enjoyable.",The Harder They Fall
632,jonathanedwall,A decent western influenced by the classics,7,7 November 2021,"The first few minutes in this film are a bit static and slow, but starting with the unique title sequence, I was enveloped within the film. If you liked the Westerns from the 1950-70s, you will recognize some of the tropes the genre. With this film, they do take some interesting choices which sometimes pays off and other times, it misses the mark. There are some slow parts that could have been edited out for time, like the camera sequence in the climax. There is your typical showdown at the end, which is action packed and a bit disjointed. At the end of this film, I felt like Netflix has started to receive better results in their film content, like this movie for example. If they keep this up, they will be a force to be reckoned with in terms of film.To conclude, the film has a life of its own and is not a serviceable entry to the Netflix platform. Give the film a watch if you enjoy westerns.",The Harder They Fall
633,riteorong,Some good some bad and some ugly,6,7 November 2021,"The director may have missed one or two cliches but that would be all. The dialog can't make up its mind what century it's supposed to be. The characters swing between cartoonish and less cartoonish. The actors often seem to be pretending to be wild west folk heroes instead of acting. The director, whom I believe is british, seems to know next to nothing about the western genre and it shows in every predictable way. The soundtrack is so out of place you pray for silence first, dialogue second. If John Ford, and Sam Peckinpah had a child and at four years old the child was hired by Disney to make a western film this would be the final cut. The one saving grace is the occasional pause from haming it up when these very good actors settle down into thier roles and display the quality performances that they are famous for. With a better script and better direction this could have been a ground breaking movie, but alas it tries to be too much with to little behind the camera. The story of just one of these real life legends of the west that have been ignored by this backward nation of ours could stand alone as a film. Hence my final opinion that this movie was both way too much and not enough. Disappointing.",The Harder They Fall
634,susannaday,Unintelligible,6,7 November 2021,"Very beautiful film, great sound track, lovely costumes, stunning sets. Absolutely no idea what happened thanks to dialogue being unintelligible due to use of language and dreadful volume level management making it super quiet vs the rest of the sound. We all complained at how standard this experience is nowadays and how it's now normal to have to use subtitles to understand what is being said - bonkers. Film makers need to change their approach so their work can be heard and understood.",The Harder They Fall
635,drstelly,Great Black Western!!!,7,6 November 2021,"The acting is simply superb, from the great Delroy Lindo, idris Elba, Lakeith Stanfield and Regina King and newcomers Johnathan Majors, RJ Cyler and. Andria Langston you are captivated from the beginning. Those chills you feel while watching this movie is from the great acting with an amazing script about actual black cowboys of Olde. It's a new day in filmmaking. John Wayne who???",The Harder They Fall
636,bryantga,Modern Cinema Western,10,8 November 2021,All star cast with a talented director and a great script made an amazing movie. Theater trained actors putting their skills on display that make you question who are the bad guys. Violence and gore for added impact and not gratuitous. See it for yourself.,The Harder They Fall
637,Mr_Cheers,Epic Cowboy Western,9,3 November 2021,"Being a fan of the Wild Wild West, I enjoyed watching cowboys that resemble my skin color. Most history books and a vast majority of Hollywood Westerns never displayed Black Cowboys and without knowing a little history, anyone of color wouldn't know they existed. But besides the obvious, the characters were also depicted by an award winning ensemble cast which was portrayed by some of my favorite actors/actresses. Although this movie was the typical revenge plot, the cinema movie magic, musical accompaniment, action-packed sequences, and plot twist at the end made it all worth the ride. It was very much a taste of old school Cowboy with modern day swag... I smell a sequel.",The Harder They Fall
638,vadazenobia,Great movie,7,4 November 2021,"The most entertaining movie I've seen all year. It has a solid plot. Everything flowed. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it didn't have enough of the character's physiological depth, that I personally crave. . But it definitely hit in every category. And definitely kept my attention. I watched it twice and will watch it again. The low reviews are from people that are too dumb to understand different categories of film genre.",The Harder They Fall
639,brunobertoni,"I'm glad I watched this movie, despite the bad ratings.",7,6 November 2021,"A very enjoyable modern western. Not your usual bang bang movie, but an entertaining and worth watching flick, for sure. A fair amount of action with a well passed rhythm.",The Harder They Fall

All of the characters in this movie are in fact Black/Native American or even full Native American in real life And there is no (black washing in this movie and all.)

643,mmoyersju,Haters not wanted here! Take it for what it is...,7,5 November 2021,"There should be no hating on this wonderful cast of black actors. Jonathon majors is wonderful in a western role.Yes the reggae soundtrack is odd. It doesn't take away from the film at all in my opinion. Big fans of classic westerns might not enjoy the odd soul style to it.The acting is the big takeaway from this movie. The storyline and plot may be thin, but the rag tag shootem up western is a delight especially coming from Netflix who cares more about quantity than quality.",The Harder They Fall
644,Tamekar1,Much Needed Modern Western,10,7 November 2021,"This movie was phenomenal! Idris Elba and Jonathan Majors easily fit into those roles as if they were made just for them.

Absolutely shocking.Cast, visuals, story & soundtrack were absolutely on point.My only slight criticism is it was a little longer than necessary, but that's not enough to warrant these low scores.Anyone calling this a wanna be Tarantino is an uneducated fool. This is clearly a spike Lee/ Tarantino homage. Also a thousand times better than the hateful eight so jog on.",The Harder They Fall
