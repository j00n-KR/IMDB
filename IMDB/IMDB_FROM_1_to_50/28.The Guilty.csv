0,MartinHafer,"If it wasn't a remake, I'd have scored it a 9.",8,2 October 2021,"""The Guilty"" is yet another very unusual film starring Jake Gyllenhaal...an actor who generally chooses unusual film projects. While he occasionally stars in mainstream pictures (such as a Spiderman film), often he picks strange, off-beat movies...and ""The Guilty"" is incredibly odd...but in a good way. It is, however, a remake of a Danish film...and now I really want to see the original.Joe (Gyllenhaal) is a cop who is in some sort of trouble, though you don't know exactly why until very late in the film. Suffice to say, what he did was serious enough that he was taken off street duty and assigned to 911 calls until his hearing.During his shift, Joe gets a most unusual phone call from a woman who claims to have been abducted. He has to work hard to try to figure out who she is, where she is and the status of her children. Joe clearly is NOT a detached worker but takes the case very seriously...too seriously at times. While it's admirable that he spends so much time on this and related calls, he also is an angry man whose anger generally colors what he does...and this is no exception. And, when he calls California Highway Patrol and other authorities, his anger sometimes gets the best of him as he pushes these people to do more to save the woman and her children. I could say A LOT more about the plot but won't as I don't want to give away the twists....and there are quite a few.The film is most unusual because it all taks place in a dispatch room. In other words, you hear people talking to Joe but you only see Joe and, occasionally, his co-workers. It's a very different sort of film and while it sounds like it would be boring to keep the focus ALWAYS on Joe, it's never dull...but tense and hard to stop watching. Exceptionally well made and Gyllenhaal is incredible here. My only reservations are that it's a remake (which I already mentioned) and there's a vomiting scene at the end which is just too explicit...a VERY common thing in recent films that I just cannot understand. I can know people are puking without having to watch them puke!!",The Guilty
1,SnoopyStyle,Hollywood remake,6,25 September 2021,"L. A. is facing wild fires. Police officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) has been put on desk duty awaiting resolution to an incident. He is bitter being reassigned to the 911 call center. He takes a dismissive tone to his callers. He gets a strange one from a woman named Emily. She has apparently been kidnapped.This is a Hollywood remake of a Danish film. Aside from being a copy, this film loses a bit of reality due Gyllenhaal's aggressive portrayal. I don't see how any supervisor would allow him to continue like that. Director Antoine Fuqua probably thought that the material needed some more flashiness and used all the Gyllenhaal acting power available to him. It's overkill. It's still pretty good and the fire adds a nice element to the story. Maybe they could have used some pursuit footage with the fire in the background.",The Guilty
2,nogodnomasters,Snakes in his stomach?,5,23 September 2021,"Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a policeman awaiting trial or a hearing and has been placed on 911 duty in LA. We see him handle the first few calls where he appears to blame the victim. He is also stressed by his separated family life. He gets a call from Emily who is stressed and claims she is abducted. He does everything he can to save here and her family. Then comes the devilish twist.I have discovered I like Jake Gyllenhaal films more when I have no idea what is going on with the plot. This was basically a one man play. Jake does a convincing job, I just didn't get into it.Guide: f-word. No sex or nudity. I really thought the LA 911 call center would be more busy and how does one keep getting the same 911 operator from a different cell tower?",The Guilty
3,kosmasp,More than decent remake - guilty as charged,7,28 October 2021,"And the main ""culprit"" for my statement above is Jake Gyllenhall. His performance is amazing. And if I didn't know they shot this during lockdown ... I probably wouldn't have guessed it. For those not familiar with the original, this may be easier to watch - being in English. On the other hand, in Germany they dub movies so that shouldn't be a ""problem"".Those who have not seen the original may like this even better, but whatever the case, the movie is really good. You probably only have to watch one of the two version, I would advice to see the original, but there is nothing wrong with watching this powerhouse performance by Jacke either.",The Guilty
4,classicsoncall,"""We protect people who need help.""",8,7 October 2021,"This is a tense thriller that takes you inside the mind of a stressed out police officer assigned to call desk duty until he's potentially cleared of an unspecified violation that we only learn about near the story's finale. Officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotional conflict as he tries desperately to save a woman he believes has been kidnapped by her estranged husband, while her two young children have been left at home to wait out the ordeal. Involving not only highway patrol, but fellow officers and a former sergeant, Baylor appears about to crack under the strain of not only the assumed kidnapping, but a six month old divorce that's still weighing heavily on his psyche. To say that things are not always as they seem in the picture would be quite an understatement, and the film's turning point hinges on a late phone conversation Baylor has with the unseen Emily (voiced by Riley Keough), which abruptly contradicts his original assumptions about a kidnapping. Gillenhaal brings all the intensity to his character that we've seen previously in his portrayal of Louis Bloom in ""Nightcrawler"". His performance here leaves you almost as emotionally drained as Joe Baylor, eventually willing to admit that the hearing he faces the next day must of necessity be handled with the utmost integrity.",The Guilty
5,blanche-2,Broken people save broken people,10,8 October 2021,"""The Guilty"" is a remake of a Danish film of the same name. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Riley Keogh, and Peter Saarsgard.I didn't see the Danish film, so I have to go by what I saw in this film.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Joe, a 911 operator who seems to be in a bad mood. He's asthmatic, he has occasionally loud ringing in his ears, and as time goes on, we learn his story. He is not with his wife and misses his little girl. He is a police officer on 911 duty pending a hearing. We know federal officers have been to the home of his ex-partner. We find out more details at the end of the film.Joe receives a call from a woman, Emily (Keogh - Elvis' granddaughter) and from the phone call, Joe discerns that she has been abducted, possibly by her husband - this all comes out gradually.The city is in the midst of the California wildfires, so a lot of calls go back and forth as a very tense and involvedJoe tries to get someone to look for her - even though he doesn't have enough information.He also talks to Emily's daughter Abby, who is alone with her brother Oliver. He sends the police there, and when they arrive, they see that the baby, Oliver, has been hurt, and Abby has blood all over her.Thanks to the technology, Joe is able to come up with the address of Emily's husband - he wants someone to go over there and break down the door and look for info as to where he's taken Emily. Joe is clearly unhinged by this situation, going deeper and deeper into an abyss, with a court case pending and his own home situation affecting his emotional state.This film is a tour de force for Jake Gyllenhaal, who again proves what a magnificent talent he is. The tension in ""The Guilty"" is enough to send you climbing the walls, and it's his show all the way. Keogh and Saarsgard (Gyllenhaal's real-life brother in-law) are the voices of Emily and her husband Henry, and they give knockout performances. However, we never see them.Because of the emotion and anger Joe puts into this case, he finally realizes that he needs to make an important decision if he is ever to heal from his own drama.I won't say anymore, except that some people should not be 911 operators (I'm one of them). Joe doesn't have the necessary detachment.I'm sure the original was great, but I do also believe it's possible for an American remake to shine. This one did, thanks to a powerful performance.And by the way, due to COVID, the director directed the entire film from a van and was not on the soundstage.",The Guilty
6,bevo-13678,Fire,10,21 October 2021,Wow great movie. Right from the big fire scene at the start then the bit with the asthma puffer I knew this would be non stop action. But then I fell asleep.,The Guilty
7,Calicodreamin,Bit of a snooze,5,16 October 2021,"A bit of a snooze throughout, with a nasty main character and a half hearted attempt at a Hollywood ending. Decent voice acting work that felt authentic.",The Guilty
8,ferguson-6,Denmark nuance v USA directness,7,30 September 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's start with this disclosure: the original Danish film from Gustav Moller was one of my top 5 favorite films of 2018. Even then, I fully expected an Americanized version to happen at some point. The surprise is having director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY, 2001) handle the remake. He's known more for bombast and action, than the nuanced suspense delivered by the original. To offset this, Mr. Fuqua wisely chose the dependable Jake Gyllenhaal as his lead, and the talented Nic Pizzolatto (creator and lead writer of HBO's ""True Detective"") to adapt the screenplay.Gyllenhaal never cheats the audience, and he dives into the role with his typical full force commitment. Except for a few blurry visuals of cars on the highway and the dramatic opening shots of the raging California fires, Gyllenhaal's Joe Baylor is on screen for the entire run. He's a detective on desk duty at the 911 call center pending his court case on charges that only become clear towards the end. Joe is also separated from his wife and daughter; a crucial element in how his shift plays out in front of us.As we listen in on his first few calls, it becomes obvious how Joe's time on the streets have fine-tuned his quick-to-judge persona. He's not shy about telling callers their own choices are responsible for their current predicament. Just as he's about to dismiss his latest caller Emily, his instincts kick in, and he discerns that she's been abducted by her husband in a white van, and fears for her safety. This initial call between Joe and Emily is a work of art, and kicks off the nearly unbearable tension for the rest of the movie and Joe's shift.Fuqua and Pizzolatto infuse commentary unique to modern day America. The fires are always in the background impacting emergency resources, as well as the air being breathed. Police collusion and abuse of power are also an underlying aspect of what unfolds in front of us. Yet somehow, the film (perhaps accidentally) speaks to the immense pressure faced by law enforcement and how instincts and quick judgments are crucial to assistance and survival. Joe bounces from calm demeanor to explosive overreaction in the blink of an eye - or the beep of an incoming call. We witness how preconceived notions can lead one astray, even if they've worked in the past.In addition to Gyllenhaal's commendable performance, the film includes terrific voice work (via phone) from such actors as Riley Keough (as Emily), Peter Sarsgaard, Ethan Hawke, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Christiana Montoya, and Paul Dano. Adrian Martinez and Christina Vidal appear alongside Gyllenhaal in the call center, although the single setting contributes to this being mostly a one-man show.We understand that Joe Baylor is seeking personal redemption in his all-out pursuit to save Emily, and one line in the film speaks directly to this: ""Broken people save broken people."" If you haven't seen the original, you are likely to get caught up in the tension, and ask yourself many of the same questions Joe is asking himself at the end. Gyllenhaal previously teamed with director Fuqua in SOUTHPAW (2015), but this crime thriller is something different for both. If you are up to the challenge, watch this version and the original, so that you can compare the contrasting approaches.Streaming on Netflix beginning October 1, 2021.",The Guilty
9,bombersflyup,A cop out.,2,14 September 2021,"The Guilty fails to come together, with a weak and empty story.Gyllenhaal no doubt commands the screen, but if you want to do a film about police brutality... Do a film about police brutality.",The Guilty
10,FeastMode,riveting,7,12 October 2021,"Awesome single-location movie, keeps you glued to the screen and emotionally invested throughout.

11,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Fuqua delivers a highly worthwhile American remake (for once),9,4 October 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningL. A. Police officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllengaal) has been demoted to working in an emergency call centre after an incident that created a scandal for the department. A seething ball of stress and frustration, with internalised demons knawing away at him, things take a turn when he answers an emergency call from Emily (Riley Keough) who says her and her son are trapped in a vehicle with Henry (Peter Saarsgard), her partner who's suffering a psychotic episode. Joe seems to have been offered a shot at redemption, but things may not be as they seem...We've already had the release of the Candyman remake in theatres in recent times, launching Nia Da Costa on to becoming the female director with the highest grossing film of all time under her belt, and now Netflix have released this highly publicised remake of a superb Danish film from just a couple of years ago, with Hollywood star Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead. American remake of foreign language film doesn't make for a promising outcome in general, but with a reliable, assured cast and crew at hand, The Guilty is a rare exception.Established director Antoine Fuqua is no amateur, and doesn't allow his vision of the original film to become 'Americanised' in any way, taking great care not to overblow or sensationalise anything as so many are prone to, and instead faithfully recreating the isolated atmosphere and feeling of claustrophobia in the continuous ninety minutes of real time we spend in the remote but high pressure and highly stressful environment of the 911 call centre. Gyllenhaal, in the lead, projects a compressed intensity, occasionally spoiled by a lack of restraint with some explosive outbursts, while in roles where we only hear their voices, Keough and Saarsgard capture a sense of vulnerability and desperation.It can't escape its trappings as a remake of a great film, still fresh itself in everyone's mind, but it's highly faithful and unpretentious, still managing to be as suspenseful and human as the original, even if it's not quite as good. ****",The Guilty
12,Cineanalyst,Guilty of Wasting My Time,3,5 October 2021,"I don't know why I bothered; I figured this would be a pointless Anglophone remake of the tense 2018 Danish thriller. I also don't know why this Nic Pizzolatto guy has his own screenwriting credit here when most of it's lifted straight from the original. I guess he's taking credit for the rearrangement of a scene that results in unnecessarily dragging out the resolution so that we may see Jake Gyllenhaal's puke in a toilet, or for adding that 2am phone call to the ex that just makes Gyllenhaal's Joe all the more unbearable, and let's not forget that time Joe gets up to get a cup of joe, and he's displeased there's not enough already made for him. What I've seen from director Antoine Fuqua, too, gives the impression of a hacky filmmaker. The Denzel Washington movies are entertaining enough, because Denzel Washington, but the rest of them.... ""Southpaw"" (2015), also starring Gyllenhaal, is an overrated melodrama. I have yet to see ""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016) remake, but I'm not looking forward to it.This seems to be sheer incompetence to me, as if they had no idea what worked in the original, and, Instead of adding a novel interpretation, just watered it down with generics. Gustav Möller's picture was a one-man variation on ""12 Angry Men"" (1957) with an emphasis on sound in the emergency phone calls. An intensely claustrophobic utilization of the artifice of cinema. So, of course, for the remake they begin with a Bible verse and helicopter shots to needlessly attempt thematic grandeur and paint the background with California wildfires. Also unnecessary dramatic scoring to blow the intensity and subtlety of the sound design. Gyllenhaal spends the first part in an enormous glass-filled tomb to International Style architecture with a series of big screen TVs for the wildfire background and multiple monitors for each dispatcher like we're watching a high-tech hacker or spy movie. Saving the spectator the hassle of having to use their own imagination by the movie visualizing what Joe sees in his mind listening to a couple calls is especially inept.Oh, and Gyllenhaal can't help himself with the histrionics. It's bad enough they gave him an asthma inhaler to work with. I really miss the beads of sweat rolling down Jakob Cedergren's brow during his pregnant pauses compared to Gyllenhaal's spray-on sweat and crocodile tears as he shouts belligerently and pounds on glass windows. There's nothing that quite lowers one's estimation of an actor than to see him do so much more poorly in the same role performed by another just a couple years ago. Ditto the other filmmakers. At least Washington seemed to realize what he got himself into with with Fuqua in ""Training Day"" (2001) and ""The Equalizer"" (2014) and so turned up the acting even more over-the-top than usual to deliver us a bounty of ham.I would think that an easy bar for whether a remake should exist would be that it improves on or differs from the original in at least one interesting way. Yet, this one is nonetheless guilty of failing that test. Oh well, at least it got me to watch the Danish original.",The Guilty
13,A_Different_Drummer,breaks the #1 rule of storytelling,6,14 October 2021,30 minutes in and you realize that you do not care about either the main character or the problem he is trying to solve. Jake does his best but that is not enough.,The Guilty
14,zkonedog,Solid--Though Not Spectacular--Quarantine Era Thriller,7,10 October 2021,"With Hollywood largely shuttered for most of 2020 due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, it was a disaster for the film industry. Yet, in the midst of that uncertain period, there still existed some creative ways to provide content for avid movie-watchers (""Malcolm & Marie"" immediately springs to mind as a great example). ""The Guilty"" is birthed from that vein, what with it essentially being a one-man show set in a single location (i.e. Easy to film without risk of contagion).For a very basic overview, ""The Guilty"" tells the story of Joe (Jake Gyllenhaal), a disgraced street cop now working the emergency phone lines as he awaits his trial. One night, Joe gets a call from a woman (voiced by Riley Keough) who has found herself in a great deal of trouble. In trying to help this woman, viewers are given a glimpse into Joe's personal issues--as well as his redeeming qualities.Strictly in terms of plot and execution, this is probably more of a 6/10 star effort. It does a lot of things right (especially a game-changing narrative twist about half way through), but is certainly far from classic status. The ending, in particular, left me a bit disappointed (I believe this to be a film that ""peaked too early"", in a sense).That being said, there are two standout qualities to ""The Guilty"" that push it up to 7/10 stars:-The creativity/inventiveness of the production limitations. I'm always intrigued by smaller films like this that don't require large set pieces or numerous star actors to make them work. Due to the pandemic protocols, this is exactly what had to happen just to get the film made. As a result, it requires all the ""little things"" (sound, editing, camera work) to be on point, and they are.-Gyllenhaal's performance. I'm not sure there are too many actors who can pull off the whole ""one-man band"" thing that Jake is doing here, but he is certainly one of them. His intense and emotional acting style is perfectly suited to this film's needs. For long stretches, his facial expressions and vocal outburst are the only conduit for emotions, and he carries it all with aplomb.Overall, I don't think that ""The Guilty"" will show up on many awards or best-of lists. But it was a solid-enough watch, and memorable in the fact that it was produced during one of the most unique times in the history of motion pictures.",The Guilty
15,eddie_baggins,Pales in comparison to the original,5,7 October 2021,"Before you spend (waste) anymore time here reading this review, my strong suggestion is that if you haven't already go track down a copy of the 2018 award winning Denmark original of which this Hollywood remake is derived from, as when you compare the two efforts that are quite similar yet somehow very different in effectiveness, the original tale of a disgraced police officer handling a very tricky call over a dispatch line his been posted too is far and away the more gripping thriller.Re-teaming with his Southpaw director Antoine Fuqua and working off a script that includes work done by True Detective screenwriter Nic Pizzolatto, Hollywood star Jake Gyllenhaal is front and center here as the under duress and demoted Joe Baylor, who during a late shift on the phone lines in the midst of a citywide fire emergency takes a call from a distressed citizen who has been kidnapped by her violent ex-partner, with Joe racing the clock (and his own thoughts) too try and figure out how he can uncover the truth and whereabouts of the in danger caller.Set entirely within the confines of Joe's police office building, just as the original film was confined to a sole location, The Guilty is going to bore those who grow easily tired of dialogue driven thrillers and features that live and die entirely off the performance of one key actor and sadly unlike the original Denmark feature Gyllenhaal's significant talents and Fuqua's pedestrian direction (that was delivered via remote functions due to Covid-19 protocols) aren't enough to carry the film through its rough patches as we begin to understand more about the crime being committed and Baylor's troubled past.Not seen as regularly as he once was during in incredible decade stretch of films that included key performances in the likes of Brokeback Mountain, Jarhead, Nightcrawler, Prisoners and Zodiac, it's good to see the likable Gyllenhaal back in a leading role but when weighed up against his best turns, his performance here as the twitchy and tormented Baylor isn't one of his finest pieces of work, with his inability to avoid overacting in key moments taking us away from a story that at its core is gripping and engrossing but is here delivered without the heart and soul that would've made it an above average Netflix original.Delivered in lots of manners like for like to the 2018 Denmark film, The Guilty goes to show once more that good film's can't be remade as easily as placing some new actors and talent in the mix to recreate the magic and while this is far from a terrible film, there's little in this feature to write home about as it's likely to get lost in the impending release avalanche heading our way at the end of 2021.Final Say -Lacking the spark of the original and the taut delivery that made it such a white knuckle watch, The Guilty can't be saved by the usually reliable Jake Gyllenhaal who tries his best but fails to hit the mark in this talk driven thriller.2 1/2 inhalers out of 5.",The Guilty
16,imseeg,"Not bad at all, but lacking greatness in drama. The original movie (it was based upon) actually was better at acting and in drama...",6,5 October 2021,"The bad: nothing in particular, BUT the execution of this story simply does not reach the highs I was wishing for...The original movie (this movie was based upon) had a better suspenseful dramatic arch.More bad: however decent Jake Gylenhaal is in his acting performance, he simply does not convince completely, for instance, crying without any tears, does look a bit superficial. And there are several scenes in which Jake Gylenhaal does not completely convince.Simply put this is a drama lacking in real intense drama.Not any good? Well yes, there is a suspenseful story, with an intrigueing substory. This movie deals with life and death conversations at a 911 telephone center. But even then, there is still the feeling that the drama doesnt really hurt...Better watch the European original movie, which hit me like a hammer.",The Guilty
17,jtindahouse,Proof that all you need for a good movie is a tight script,9,14 September 2021,"'The Guilty' is a remake of the 2018 Danish film of the same name. I have been meaning to get around to seeing the original for a while and never have. It's probably a good thing. When I watch originals of films and then watch the American remake I almost never like it as much. On this occasion I was able to enjoy the story completely fresh and get each twist and turn as it came to be. I really enjoyed this film.It blows my mind how exciting a film can be with absolutely zero action scenes of any kind and the camera just focused on one person sitting at a computer screen for 90 minutes. It shows just how well put together this script is. The pacing is electric and the dialogue is exquisitely written. Also Jake Gyllenhaal is superb in the role. As are all the guest stars (some big names too) who play voice roles along the way.People will likely hate on this film simply for existing as a remake. It happens with every one of them unfortunately, whether they are well made or not. I would suggest to ignore the reviews on films like this and make up your own mind.

19,alindsay-al,A Great Tension Filled Film,8,5 October 2021,"This film has had big advertisement on Netflix and I have now watched The Guilty and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a police officer on Dispatch faced with a dilemma when a woman calls him claiming she has been abducted.Main Character
Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors operating and he is brilliant in this film, the different ranges of emotion is displayed perfectly and I felt the stress that his character was meant to this entire night. He gives everything and in his hands he creates a film that you can sink your teeth into and remain invested in.Supporting Characters
There are plenty of supporting characters here but they are mostly voices on the phone so I won't spoil who these people are as there are some pretty big names here. Everyone plays there role effectively and it makes every call feel believable and not like some pantomime.Story
The story is really effective, it builds the tension expertly and you really sympathise with the situation that Gyllenhaal is put into. Though it ramps it up really well and it is pretty much all between this guy and these people that are on the phone. But I do have some issues, mainly that the actual storytelling becomes a bit convoluted and there are some elements of the plot that are underdeveloped and rushed.Script
The script is really good, it is a really serious film and it does those scenes really well but there are small sprinklings of humour that actually made me laugh and I think it is a really well written film.Style
The film is shot really well, and by using camerawork and sound it makes the situation even worse then it is. It is only 90 mins and that is good but it does slow down a bit at times and maybe could have been even better if it was even a little bit shorter or cut one or two elements out of its story.Overall
Overall, The Guilty is a Great film. I have seen some real negative reviews but I am not sure what film they watched as it is really well acted and pretty much kept me invested throughout.",The Guilty

24,dierregi,Cleanest toilets ever,2,12 October 2021,"Gyllenhaal is Joe Baylor, a cop with anger management issues, answering 911 calls. Joe is not the guy you want to answer your call if you are in distress, because besides being angry for reasons that will be disclosed along way, he's also going through a bad divorce, can't see his daughter and is mean to everybody.The first act works quite smoothly, with Joe answering calls in an open space environment and some colleagues around. Then he gets a call from a woman named Emily who claims she's been kidnapped and for unknown reasons Joe decides Emily's for real, despite her sounding weird on the phone.The downfall starts in the second act, when Joe moves into a separate office and every other presence is cut off. We learn that Joe is in trouble for having killed someone and his partner is ready to lie to save him. In the meantime, Emily and her estranged husband take turns talking to Joe, who discovers that things are not quite as they seem. Gyllenhaal overacts wildly, alternating grimaces and sad expressions, shouting and stammering on the phone.The third act is a sort of bad joke. The happy ending of some sort of the Emily situation sends Joe rushing to the toilets, where everything is sparkling clean. You could perform surgery in those toilets so sterile and sanitised they look. Joe is so emotionally incontinent that he vomits in a shiny cubicle and then decides to sit on the floor without flushing, to make a couple of phone calls enjoying the smell of his puke.It's impossible to understand why Joe has a change of heart and decides to tell the truth at his hearing.

25,valleyjohn,Watch the original Danish version instead.,5,9 October 2021,"My first thoughts after watching The Guilty is this was definitely made during lockdown because of the lack of people on show , but the problem is , after eighteen months of Covid restrictions, a film that as isolated and claustrophobic as this , is the last thing I want to see.The film takes place over the course of a single morning in a 911 dispatch call center. Call operator Joe Baylor (Gyllenhaal) tries to save a caller in grave danger-but he soon discovers that nothing is as it seems, and facing the truth is the only way out.There is no doubting Jake Gyllenhael's acting ability but I have to say this is the first time I've ever thought he's over acting . It doesn't help that his character is unlikable and always angry which only added to my frustration in watching him .It's amazing how a renowned director like Antoine Fuqua who made one of the greatest films ever made in Training day can produce a film that feels as rushed as this , but I suppose you can't always make masterpieces and that's probably the reason this is found on Netflix and not on cinema released.The original 2018 Danish film of the same name is much , much better .Disappointing.",The Guilty
26,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Guilty,8,12 October 2021,"2021's The Guilty is my latest write-up. The film's title doesn't exactly come to fruition until the end. Most of the way I figured I was watching 911: The Movie.So yeah, ""Guilty"" is one of this year's best. A lot of people contribute but it's a bruising character study for actor Jake Gyllenhaal, a one-man show if you will. As 911 operator Joe Baylor, Gyllenhaal lets us feel his nerve endings with every close-up by director Antoine Fuqua. Abraded tour de force, well that's an understatement.The Guilty I guess, represents something along the lines of 2013's Locke (a flick I have yet to see but have seen clips of) and 2018's Searching (a flick I have seen and enjoyed immensely). ""Guilty"" is also COVID-19 ready as it was shot solely in the eye of the pandemic (November 2020). The actors of which there are few of, become socially distanced whereby they're never really near each other. Helmer Fuqua instead opts for the proverbial ""violence of the mind"". It's what you don't see but discern that really creeps you out.Harboring a cast of rattled voices on the other end of a telephone line (Ethan Hawke, Peter Sarsgaard, Paul Dano) and filmed primarily in one location (an intricately detailed 911 call center), ""Guilty"" chronicles LAPD officer turned demoted 911 operator Joe Baylor (Gyllenhaal). Baylor is being demoted because he's awaiting trial for a manslaughter charge while on duty. Throughout ""Guilty"", Joe has to navigate a disturbing call concerning the abduction of a wife by a distraught husband.The Guilty has a twist I didn't see coming, a mean-spirited/downtrodden approach, an involved attention to detail, and tension that's 10 inches thick. Antoine Fuqua feels right at home with ""Guilty's"" camouflaged LA vibe and well, that's his old stomping ground (remember Training Day?). Basically if you don't check out The Guilty you'll feel ""guilty"" for not doing so. Natch.",The Guilty
27,elliotjeory,Well that was cheerful,3,3 October 2021,When you invest your time in a movie you expect a little more than one set and one actor talking on a phone. Firstly the main character is really rude and obnoxious and therefore really unlikeable.You can't expect the viewer to relate to such a horrible character.Also the story is just horrible and depressing and the whole thing feels unrealistic therefore I rate this abysmal lockdown film 3/10.,The Guilty
28,Luigi Di Pilla,Great Jake Gyllienhaal,5,4 October 2021,Really oscarworthy performance of Jake Gyllienhaal. In my opinion he delivered one of his best performances. The story itself is not so hot but if you have nothing other to watch it works for a solid entertaining evening.Give it a a chance. If you don't expect too much you will enjoy it. 5/10.,The Guilty
29,arungeorge13,I'd pick the 2018 film over this one any day! [+54%],5,1 October 2021,"Not sure if we need remakes of any kind any more, considering how international films are now digitally available (in HD) with subtitles. The Guilty, starring Jake Gyllenhaal is a scene-by-scene remake of Gustav Moller's Danish film of the same name. The original film had its moments of thrill, stirring emotions, and a solid twist to boot. Antoine Fuqua's version also authentically captures most of it, however, since the 2018 film is still fresh in my memory, it struggled a bit to keep me as invested. Yeah, I understand that even remakes have to be independently looked at, but the original definitely has an edge over this one - not just in its storytelling or performances - the subtlety is lost on you. It's a bit all over the place. There are just way too many things going on - the abduction in progress, the protagonist's inner turmoil and asthmatic issues, the ongoing fires, and lots more. The original was comparatively more restrained and convincing. Even the remake is worth a watch solely for its leading man, of course.",The Guilty
30,mjw2305,Works as a stand alone film,7,11 October 2021,"Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant throughout! I didn't realise this was a remake when I saw it and judged it based on it's own merits.It is intriguing, tense, brilliantly acted and entertaining. It isn't the best movie in the world, but it's definately worth a look.7/10.",The Guilty
31,wisewebwoman,Tolerable,6,19 October 2021,"But it really, really falls short of the Danish original which was gripping. My sympathy was with the protagonist as he was so beautifully played.This remake, while tolerable, has its weakest link in Jake Gyllenhaal who plays the part loudly and irritatingly. As a co-worker, with his demands and rudeness and lack of consideration for fellow equally busy workers on the 911 lines he shows no consideration for them when leaving a just about empty coffee pot.So how can one sympathize with one so entitled and contemptuous. Small point but.....as they say if you need to see the character of someone just watch how they treat wait staff and servers.Marching off on his own to a back room, screeching at his supervisor all falls quite flat and I was unmoved. And unsympathetic as he broke all the rules and inveigled close friends into breaking the law for him.No tension, which there was in spades in the original. I wish Hollywood would find their own original material and stop this sad copy-catting of brilliant originals.6/10 for the high-tech visuals.",The Guilty

34,IonicBreezeMachine,"While it doesn't quite match the impact of the Danish original, Antoine Fuqua's direction and an intense committed performance by Jake Gyllenhaal make The Guilty worthwhile",7,1 October 2021,"Suspended officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is serving as a 9-1-1 operator pending a court case that will determine whether or not he's allowed to return to duty. Dealing with resource scarcity from ongoing wildfires as well as calls that are either inane or untruthful, Baylor comes across a call from Emily Lighton (Riley Keough) who has seemingly been kidnapped by her ex husband Henry (Peter Sarsgaard) as Baylor tries to save Emily he soon finds that he only has part of the story which only gets more disturbing with each revelation.Released in 2018, The Guilty became a massive critical success due to its minimalist aesthetic, dark intelligent story, and strong performance from Jakob Cedergren. The rights to a remake were soon purchased by Gyllenhaal's production company Nine Stories with director Fuqua and writer Nic Pizzolatto soon becoming attached with Netflix acquiring worldwide rights for a staggering $30 million. The movie was shot during the COVD-19 pandemic in November 2020 with extras and actors limited and spaced per protocols and much of the voice done from inside the cast homes. The sheer dedication and tenacity in making a film like this has to be admired. The movie does a mostly successful job adapting the Danish story to Los Angeles, even if admittedly it adheres pretty closely with the original narrative.The reason to see this movie is for Jake Gyllenhaal as torn police officer Joe Baylor. Gyllenhaal caries what is essentially a one man show in the same vein as something like Buried with Ryan Reynolds or Phone Booth with Colin Ferrell. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is so strong here it would not surprise me if he ends up getting a Best Actor nomination, and deservedly so. The movie's very much a chamber piece with few in-person interactions and Gyllenhaal's facial expressions, vocal inflections, and body language help sell the character of Baylor and the inner turmoil his character is experiencing. The voice work of the rest of the cast is equally on point with Riley Keough convincing as the supposedly abducted woman and Peter Sarsgaard as her ex-husband.The biggest issue with the movie is in its adherence to the structure of the original narrative. While the movie is still strong thanks to its performances and some of the flourishes or asides added by director Fuqua or writer Pizzolatto, the overall narrative is pretty similar to the original following the plot points and twists in a similar manner. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as having seen both movies they do take slightly different approaches to the same material, but the material itself is identical and if you have seen the Danish original it's maybe 60-70% similar, but for me I felt there was enough uniqueness in the deliveries of both acting and direction to justify itself.The Guilty doesn't quite pack the same punch as its Danish predecessor, but thanks to tight direction, a decent adaptation, and a fantastic turn by Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead The Guilty does make itself worth viewing. Even if you've seen the Danish original, I think this remake carries enough strong elements to make its familiarity forgivable because it still resonates in all the right ways.",The Guilty

36,DukeEman,Perfect transformation to the American culture...,8,3 October 2021,"Based on a Danish film but slotted perfectly into the American police culture. It has plenty to say about the current diabolical situation of white hot headed officers and their gung-ho actions. The character in this USA version, Joe Baylor, creates a dire situation due to his stubbornness, based on an emotional motive. At the same time he does make a difference, but at what cost? This also leads to the slow and well crafted revelation of Baylor's background that deals with police brutality.Gyllenhaal plays it to the full conviction. So much that I wanted to slap him around a few times and tell him to cool the hell down! But that was the whole point, to show his arrogance and how it got him into trouble the first place.Director, Antoine Fuqua, manages to capture the anxiety of Officer Baylor and his subsequent downfall in human connection, showing the plight and reason for the recent crimes by police.What Gyllenhaal saw in the original version was a thought provoking film that also had plenty to say about the sad state of affairs in his own country.",The Guilty
37,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Good acting performance by Jake Gyllenhaal,7,4 October 2021,"Good acting performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and an interesting thriller. I could have done without the man baby tantrums inside the 911 dispatch center, but I am positive Gyllenhaal might get Oscar nominations for his performance. Now that I know this film is based on a Danish film, I will want to watch the original before showering this one with accolades because there were parts about the film screenplay I didn't like and I suspect studio interference with the original script. Perhaps the one good thing about American remakes is that we become aware they are remakes through sites like IMDb and can seek out the originals since foreign films rarely hit our theaters in the U. S. To those who point out when an American film is a remake of a foreign film, please keep informing the rest of us about the originals. I actually appreciate knowing that kind of FYI.",The Guilty

39,kjproulx,A Solid Thriller with Not Enough Substance,6,3 October 2021,"Movies that take place in one room for the entire duration are hit or miss with me. I either admire and love how the film keeps me on my feet or feel disappointed when a premise feels wasted or too boring. In the case of The Guilty, it was a bit of both for me. I actually had no prior knowledge of the foreign film that this film is a remake of, so I can't exactly comment on the comparison of the two. Here's why I believe if you're scrolling through Netflix, you can choose a lot worse than The Guilty.After being demoted from officer to working at a call center, Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes personally involved when a woman is kidnapped. Doing everything he can with what little power he has left as an officer, his goal is simply to make sure she stays alive. The phone calls are very engaging and that's what held my attention, but I honestly felt like the film didn't have enough substance surrounding the story overall. Yes, the film is effective, but I also didn't feel any emotion when the characters did. This film didn't win me over in that area and it was clearly trying to.What that said, what saved the aspects that didn't work for me was the great central performance by Gyllenhaal. He's always giving his all, but his talent is on full display here as basically the only one with real screen time. Although I didn't buy into the drama, his performance still sold it well. If for nothing else, he makes this film so much better than it is. There are also a few surprise voice cameos over the phone that I didn't realize until after my viewing.Director Antoine Fuqua is at the helm as director here and with a screenplay penned by Nic Pizzolatto, that pairing had me eager to see this. From True Detective to even his solid work on The Magnificent Seven, I've always admired his ability to write great or at least fun dialogue. It was the gripping dialogue during phone calls that really got me engaged and that's very much due to his writing skills. I just wish the film had more to say than what it presented as the end result.Overall, The Guilty isn't a great movie by any means, but I had a good time watching it and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Honestly, that's very commendable for a film like this, because I believe that's all it was trying to do. Again, Jake Gyllenhaal sells all of the dialogue very well and the script only helped him out. If you're looking through Netflix, I'd say give this one a shot, but it's not a necessary viewing. The Guilty is now streaming and it's a well-made little one-location thriller.",The Guilty
40,kuarinofu,"Thank you, Mr. Gyllenhaal",8,23 October 2021,"Surely, Gyllenhaal carried this hard.Yet overall the film is a perfect combination of people behind it. Everyone is in the right place, a director that can do a good thriller given a good script, good source material, and the writer of TD series, thus we get a good film that leaves an impression, and it doesn't really matter if it's a remake or not.It's not often you see a character you can root for going through a relatable arc. The voice acting was done so well you didn't even need to see what was going on, you could just feel it.A good yet emotionally heavy film that leaves a mark. A recommendation.A solid 8/10, clearly underrated on IMDB. Reading some of the 1-3 reviews made me lose a fraction of hope I had for humanity.",The Guilty
41,Movi3DO,Alright alright alright,7,2 October 2021,"Guilty as charged.Jake Gyllenhaal returns with another mystery thriller. A troubled police detective demoted to 911 operator duty scrambles to save a distressed caller during a harrowing day of revelations -- and reckonings.What I liked besides Jake, who was unsurprisingly great at his role, was the thriller. The first half was intense and gripping. Thrillers that take place over the phone or any communication platform are usually intriguing and easy to create suspense. Unrelated to this movie, but there's a show on Apple TV+ earlier this year, called Calls, that took place entirely over the phone. This movie reminded me a bit of the show, but the level of intensity from the movie was definitely not on par with the show. The revelation wasn't as shocking and hard-hitting as I wanted.This led me to the problem with the movie. It tried very hard to somehow relate the Jake's character's backstory to the main situation. And that didn't turn out well. The backstory was underdeveloped and had almost no place in this movie. I get that it was being kept a secret throughout the movie to make audiences wonder and speculate, but it would have been smarter to gave out bits of clues about his pasts. Also, what's more out of place was the main theme, which only became clear in the last couple minutes. This felt forced and again had nothing to do with the story.Overall, a decent thriller despite a weak attempt at making a message. 7/10.",The Guilty
42,JohnRayPeterson,"Powerful acting performance, gripping story.",8,21 October 2021,"In addition to the IMDb storyline, it should be mentioned that Jake Gyllenhaal, as officer Joe Baylor is really the only actual performance we watch, being that we see and hear him throughout the whole movie, with some supporting actors we barely see and then there are the voices over the 911 line. Voice acting is as gripping in this movie as any customary drama acting, perhaps more, if you have a fertile imagination. The two most moving voices were by Riley Keough as Emily, mother of six year old Abby whose voice we also hear by young Christiana Montoya. Joe just gets totally emotionally involved with Abby and Emily's plight; we conclude that it's due to him having a six year old of his own, which because of separation or divorce he doesn't get to see or hear enough of. That little girl does a fine job, totally believable and she will get you emotionally involved as well, if you weren't already by the mother.This has to be my favourite Jake Gyllenhaal performance of all the ones I've seen. When you consider the action all takes place in a 911 call centre and with only one of the call officers (not sure what their titles are) who is the focus of the movie, it takes more than just a good performance to make that a movie worth watching. The script had to be rich, the caller voices compelling and the directing top notch; they all were. The twist in the principal call case throws us a surprise we couldn't possibly see coming, and I did appreciate that. The drama of this movie, in my opinion, comes from the combination of the aforementioned twist and Joe's own personal crisis. There is a line in the movie, by Joe's supervisor Sgt. Wade, played by Christina Vidal, when she summarized in a very brief sentence what the whole movie was about, one short brilliant line. You'll have to watch the movie to know what that line is; and, hopefully you'll agree with me how brilliant that part of the script was.",The Guilty
43,Neptune165,This movie is ridiculous don't waste your time,4,20 October 2021,"This movie starts out good but suddenly becomes dull and boring, just Gyllenhaal acting weird all through.

If I was in a movie theater, I would have walked out. Just awful! The worst policeman in the world, absolutely unprofessional and he just made me aggressive with his stupidity. Ugh don't waste your time on this. Yes, Jake Gyllenhaal is an amazing actor, yes this movie is suspenseful. But it's suspenseful in a cheap-tricks kind of way.

Being an official remake of the critically applauded Danish film (with the same title); the anticipations and the accountabilities were pretty big. Unfortunately, even with much greater resources in hand; Hollywood has failed to deliver, yet again!The quality was indeed there, repressed somewhere underneath, the same expression applies for their intents as well as their incentives. Problems do arise though when it boils down to the core writing and the specific way in which these characters have been set up. Although, looking at how sluggish the whole execution has been in general; it's no surprise. Truth be told, this was bound to happen!As luck would have it; at the very least, Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't disappoint. Ah! Thank goodness. Frankly speaking, without him in it; my experience could have been way worse. It's his performance that massively helps the Screenplay to stay put and also kept my interests up.Albeit, the writing was already on the wall; he alone couldn't have possibly saved the day.",The Guilty

Having an actor as good as him as the main character can literally make a film.I'm seeing a lot of people saying it's not as good as the original version. People are literally saying that just to be controversial. If people really think the danish version is better then shut up. You'll be glad to know if you're one of them people I down voted every one I saw. It's also a recurring thing for people to give Netflix films bad reviews and ratings again to be controversial, I just don't get it personally.For a film that is just one room and a phone it's really entertaining.

46,MrDHWong,"A decent, watchable remake that follows the original way too closely",7,7 October 2021,"""The Guilty"" is an American remake of the 2018 Danish crime thriller of the same name. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role and directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer), it is a decent, watchable remake that follows the original way too closely.During the 2020 California wildfires, LAPD officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is working overnight in a 911 dispatch call centre. Sometime into his shift, Joe receives a call from Emily (Riley Keough), a young woman who tells him she has been abducted by her ex-husband, Henry (Peter Sarsgaard). Before she can provide him with further information, Emily abruptly hangs up, leaving Joe with limited details to track her exact location. Determined to ensure Emily's safety, Joe works urgently to gather as many resources as possible to figure out where she is and where she is being taken.I think Americanised remakes often get a bad rap overall. Sure, there are some truly terrible ones like 2017's adaptation of ""Death Note"" and 1998's ""Godzilla"", but we are also overlooking some excellent ones as well, like the 2006 Best Picture Oscar winner ""The Departed"", which is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"". What made ""The Departed"" such a great remake was that while it still followed the original's basic plotline, it successfully found ways to deviate from the source material by incorporating enough artistic liberties and visual flair to distinguish itself as a standalone work. With this 2021 remake of Denmark's ""The Guilty"", rather than doing what ""The Departed"" did, it instead copies and pastes the original's screenplay nearly word-for-word, meaning that there's little reason for it to even exist.Though one could argue that there's no use in fixing what isn't broken, I couldn't help but notice some unutilised potential during my viewing. For instance, this remake is set during the chaos of the wildfires that devastated California in 2020, as opposed to a normal night in the original. A backdrop like this must have been included here to show how 911 dispatch were inundated with desperate calls from those affected by the disaster, leaving Joe no choice but to handle his unrelated situation by himself. However, despite this new addition to the story, the film does nothing noteworthy with it, rather dismissing it as a minor background inconvenience. It was a missed opportunity to offer some commentary on how dispatch workers could have prioritised certain calls over others due to the heavy amount of people pleading for help during the fires. Instead, the film follows the original's plotline with no notable changes whatsoever.My favourite thing about the original film was how it made excellent use of its minimalistic setting. Taking place over the course of one night in only two office rooms and featuring just three onscreen actors, with everyone else being disembodied voices on the phone, it still successfully provided all of the necessary requirements for an effective crime thriller. The remake more or less does the same thing, and for the most part it succeeds, albeit, by following an exact template already created by another filmmaker. There are very few risks taken with the established premise, almost as though the film is being used as a way to advertise the original to those who weren't aware of its existence rather than add anything new for those who have already seen it. At best, director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Nic Pizzolatto are simply acting as conductors for someone else's symphony. All of the situations, character reactions, and tense atmosphere play out near identically to the 2018 film. Praising them here feels fraudulent, as I have seen them all before shot-for-shot in the original. In terms of similarities, I'd say this remake is about 98% the same, leaving little reason for those who have seen the original to want to watch this one as well.If there were one thing this film has that is better than the original, it would be Jake Gyllenhaal's performance in the main role. While I did like Jakob Cedergren in the 2018 film, at times he seemed a bit too stoic in some circumstances, although this may be something to do with the way Danish people are better at handling serious situations in a more professional manner. Here, Gyllenhaal plays Joe as someone who often lets his emotions get in the way of his work, putting him more at odds with those unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of his anger. He does a great job of holding our attention throughout the film, even if he is essentially playing the same character as Cedergren. Without giving away spoilers, there is one particular scene that actually isn't in the original where Joe is mentally processing everything that has happened during the night. A moment like this stands out as one of the film's strongest scenes and if there were any other excuse to watch it, it would be for that part alone.Taken completely on its own, the 2021 remake of ""The Guilty"" is a fine crime thriller that's well worth 90 minutes of your time on Netflix. If you haven't seen the original film, then this one provides a solid amount of entertainment for those needing their fix. However, anyone who has seen the 2018 film expecting something different this time around will be sorely disappointed. Though considering there aren't too many casual audiences out there familiar with Danish cinema, I assume this number will be fairly low. With that said, I can only really recommend this if you haven't seen the original or if you're a hardcore fan of Jake Gyllenhaal.I rate it 6.5/10.",The Guilty

It feels like they had a start and end point, but didn't know what to fill the middle with. I also enjoyed the fact they didn't spell out the character's backstory, but gave you enough to catch on.It becomes pretty obvious where the story is heading and I don't feel like it ends up being as satisfying as it desires.

51,phenomynouss,Guy's a bit of a dick,6,16 October 2021,"This was a neat, tight, compelling film, which did what I felt was the right thing by being completely isolated in the 911 dispatch office place for cops, rather than showing us any of the outside action directly.Some cop guy is working as a 911 dispatcher and gets a very compelling and cryptic call from a woman who is apparently being taken hostage and communicating largely through 'yes' and 'no's while pretending to be on the phone with her daughter. Cop guy Joe does his best with what limited information he can pry, should let the cops handle it.But he doesn't; he gets emotionally invested in it, and starts going out of his way to get more information and try to handle the situation while cops are largely overworked due to a forest fire.It's a neat, tight, compelling film, with a backstory of the cop apparently facing a trial date the next day and has apparently been relegated to dispatch duty as a result.Whether this is a real thing done with cops or not is beyond me, but if it is a real thing, it absolutely should not be.This is because Joe is a dick. He absoolutely does not have the patience or compassion to handle people in a panic, which is what a 911 dispatcher is doing all the time. There's literally a call he gets in the middle of the main conflict with some angry guy in the middle of a shootout who basically tells Joe to eff himself since he isn't helping, and Joe loses it and starts cursing him out in turn. It'd be funny if it weren't already keeping in character with how bad Joe is at this.Even before the conflict starts, he seems to be a troublemaker, constantly getting scorned by the overseeing officer for talking on his private phone and yelling at other dispatchers and officers on the phone. Sometimes the frustration is legitimate, but most of the time he comes across as a dick and it's hard to keep seriously enough invested when every phone call he makes with other police officers ends with someone angrily hanging up, or when he dismisses a minor but genuine 911 emergency with ""Don't bike drunk, a-hole""",The Guilty
52,danielmanson,Pleasantly surprised.,7,2 October 2021,"So immediately I see people complaining about it being a remake of a Danish film. Do people not understand that most don't tend to watch foreign films? So many pretentious people out there. ""You mean you haven't seen the Danish version?"" ""Oh sorry, let me get out my extensive DVD set of Danish films""...Rant over. I'll get on with it. So, in a nutshell it's a pretty good film. A little sloppy here and there, but overall it's an interesting watch.So the character 'Joe'. He was kind of hit and miss with me in all honesty. I've never seen a character so unlikeable, yet likeable at the same time.The plot itself was actually really really good! Has a fantastic twist involved and it keeps the suspense unbelievably well. Considering this is a film that's filmed with one character, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat the whole time.Something I wasn't too keen on was the side plots it had going on. So at the beginning he's ringing what I believe to be his ex wife maybe and soon after they have a conversation about something. The plot of this kind of sods off as the film gets going. I know that it needs to mix things up a bit, but more details would have been nice to say the least.But yeah, overall it's a nice little watch and I recommend if you haven't seen!",The Guilty

And boy, how predictable my bet was. I really wanted to like it. I love Jake Gyllenhaall and the plot, if nicely done, could develop into another twist and a different approach. But no... Here is a copy of the original but much worse.The brutality (baby plotline, for example) is cowardly gone here and the darkness of the original movie is disappeared here in an ending so lame and so ""good guys paying the price of his faults"" that it feels forced. Besides, that need of adding shots of the streets and POV of police cars sometimes breaks the claustrophobia of the ""one scenary show"" lowering the tensionAlso, Gyllenhaall goes berseck too quickly and he doesn't follow a gradual descent into the final breakdown like the original did so well.

There is nothing to draw you in except the actor and his acting. Granted, Jake does a decent job but the story is flat and all the help in the world can't make this work. Maybe if they tried this as a podcast it might be better.By the end of the movie you'll hear the word ""Emily"" so many times that you'll never want to hear it again.

Only in Hollywood people.I was actually looking forward to this remake. I watched the original and rated it a 7/10 thinking it was good but could have been better. In my mind, if you bother to remake a movie the goal should be to make it better but I guess not.To be perfectly honest Jake G is not one of my favorite actors but what really bothered me in this movie was how unstable and erratic his character was. This guy shouldn't be working anywhere near people, let alone as a cop or as a 911 operator. I also find it very hard to believe this movie reflects how 911 operators really work. If so, we are all doomed. If there are fires all over and so many people are calling for help shouldn't there be more operators? And why is only one guy taking care of an emergency like that? Shouldn't there be more people working on it?And it wasn't just the main character, the way all the characters communicated with each other was so awful and unprofessional it just didn't seem real. At least I seriously hope this is in no way a reflection of how 911 works.If you never watch the movie ""The Call"" (2013) with Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin, you really should. It's a movie with a similar concept but a much better one! It's a real shame. I had high hopes for this remake. Thumbs down!",The Guilty

The story unfolds from there and the whole film is set in a the one location of the dispatch call center, which becomes really boring quickly.

He puts in a sufficiently intense performance, and although it makes 90% of acting performances look like Sesame Street stuff, it still somehow feels kind of PHONED IN as far as Gyllenhaal's work goes. New queen Riley Keough, the always frightening Peter Saarsgard, and Paul Dano all put in fantastic voice acting - but it's not enough to bring this tired-feeling plot and method of telling the story to a place worth watching.

You have on one hand a great performance and on the other a story that should be a lot lot better.I was sold on seeing this film even before knowing what it is about...........Jake Gyllenhaal is one of his generations best and never puts in a sub par performance, this film is yet another example of that. He is just simply great, the entire film follows him from second one of the film to the last. I don't know what else to say then he was great and I'm not surprised by that. His performance alone is worth watching this film just to see a great actor at work.However if only the rest of the film was a good as Jake's acting. I like the concept of the film, not showing any other point of view and just seeing the events unfold with Jake's character. Makes you feel as if you are in the room with ""Joe"" as situations are unveiling themselves. Sadly though I do feel that does make the film a little dull in places and the novelty of that concept wears off quiet quickly. I would like to see some other main characters or perspectives. The story in itself has its ups and downs, twists and turns which are good when revealed but its just surface level thriller material and nothing more to it than that.I think I criticise the story more due to the fact of the talent behind the film whether that be Pizzolatto writing and Fuqua directing. Surely they could have added more depth to the story and expanded it a bit more? These are experienced guys that have produced great work in the past, sadly didn't work this time for whatever reason.Overall though I did enjoy the film I thought it was good 70% out 100, I wast expecting much other than a good performance from Gyllenhaal, which I got. Sadly its going to be one of those cases of a film with a lot of potential, one great aspect but the rest of the film not hitting the higher levels of quality that everyone hopes for...........which is a shame.Then again this is definitely not the worst thriller or film in the world. 100% watchable !!!!",The Guilty

I assume that we are supposed to believe that he behaves in the incredibly unprofessional way he does as a 911 operator due to some extreme personal pressure. At least I hope that's the writers' or director's intention for his near mentally deranged behavior at times.

107,PaxtonMalloy,Don't compare eventhough it is hard,7,4 October 2021,"So this one of these ""oh it is totally not like the original"" deals. Naturally, if you watched the original first it is very hard to not compare it. I have no solution for that. But I haven't seen the original....yet. So I can tell you that in a vacuum this is a very good movie, very gripping. I was mostly at the edge of my seat. Gyllenhaal gives it his all. It is just him sitting at a desk and he is so good at pulling you into his world, you feel what he feels. He is one of the best actors we have and he makes this a gripping thriller/drama.",The Guilty

109,Filmdokter,Decent remake with an always excellent Gyllenhaal,7,15 October 2021,"The Guilty is a well made thriller (the concept off course not original, since it is a remake of a 2018 Danish film). Gyllenhaal gives quite a strong performance here. In the recent years I have become quite impressed with his work. He always seems to deliver. Main criticism: the mix of the thriller plot (a scared woman calls 991 operator Joe) and the personal aspect (Joe is struggling with private issues) doesn't gel well and feels forced. It would have been much better if they just focused on the thriller part. Also a shame the director sometimes feels the urge to show some brief bits outside the 911 control center (unnecessary) since it takes the claustrophobic tension away. Fine entertainment for a random evening but nothing mesmerizing or memorable.",The Guilty

I haven't seen the Danish film but I have seen something very similar although forget what and when.Jake G. Puts on a powerful and somewhat over dramatic performance. I say over dramatic because there is a huge mismatch between his acting and eveyone else's and it shows. The gap was far to wide to ignore. From yelling at more senior and experienced staff to throwing expensive equipment around and no one challenged him on it except for a feeble demand for respect from his sergeant, and I do mean feeble and it didn't last long.This really was a one man show and boy did he put on a show. Unfortunately everything else was just filler to drive it along for another Joe moment.

113,BijeshNagesh,A Worthy Suspense,7,17 September 2021,"Antoine Fuqua's direction kept this story relevant and structured from start to finish. There was little to no plot-lag in ""The Guilty"" on Netflix. Due credit for this also goes to the original screenplay writers, Gustav Möller and Emil Nygaard Albertsen, whose work inspired this film, which was re-written for the screen by Nic Pizzolatto.Jake Gyllenhaal (as Joe Baylor) did an excellent job in this movie. His skill at holding viewers' attentions and keeping them never ceases to impress. A demoted policeman assigned dispatch-desk duty, Jake brought such a sense of gravitas to his character. I could almost see the wheels of his mind working aggressively to help save the kidnapped woman who called his number. If you thought your job was high pressure...Anyway... The woman in question was Emily Lighton, voiced by Riley Keough who did an amazing job communicating distress and panic.Maz Makhani's cinematography held a swift sense of urgency and desperation. He choose all the right angles to capture several notable sequences in Netflix's ""The Guilty"" movie.All other crew and cast, especially the voice-only performers - several A-listers number among them, from Ethan Hawke (as Sgt. Bill Miller) and Paul Dano (as Matthew Fontenot) to Peter Sarsgaard (as Henry Fisher) and David Castañeda (as Tim Gerachi) - brought depth and wonder to this script and needs to be heard/seen to be appreciated.""The Guilty"" 2021 on Netflix was, for me, one of the most realistic and engaging thrillers of the year. It's certainly not going to win any originality awards (it's based on another film anyway), but the movie serves as a potent reminder that great acting and even better directing can carry any story, no matter how simple, to a global audience.That suspenseful twist in the last half hour of the movie!

We can feel the main character's agony, listen to the calls and sending police officers to help, but unable to be there too.

I don't specifically know how emergency calls are handled in LA, but I do know that in most places the responders who take those calls are carefully screened and extensively trained. They are expected to remain calm and unflappable. They are trained to counsel distressed callers in a wide range of situations. They are there to be reassuring and comforting to victims of violence and to talk reasonably and responsibly to people who may be unhinged, hysterical and a risk to themselves and others. Also, ALL of their calls are recorded. Sometimes they are also monitored by supervisors. So everything they do is subject to minute analysis and review, and any deviation from protocols and procedures are quickly corrected. Serious violations would cost them their jobs. And rudeness and abuse of callers would simply not be tolerated. The character played by Gyllenhaal in The Guilty would quite simply never be allowed through the door of real emergency call centre, and the kind of ranting and reckless behaviour he indulges in would have him quickly escorted from the building by security. But, hey, if you'd rather live in a world where police responders are allowed to behave like Gyllenhaal's character, go right ahead and ""enjoy"" The Guilty.",The Guilty

He plays this role, Joe Baylor, a 911 phone operator with such intensity has he battles inner struggles alongside the torment of an abduction. For me the film isn't as entertaining as it is without Gyllenhaal in the lead role. Others may disagree but this reminded me slightly of his performance in 'Prisoners' in which he plays a detective battling similar demons.I really enjoy films that take place in one location as it immerses you more into the narrative and I think director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer) does a very good job in keeping the tension centred around Gyllenhaal's character.I don't think the writing is anything spectacular, it's really Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as well as some stellar voice acting via the phone calls that carry the film.It's an enjoyable watch that I had a good time, albeit it wasn't a great film, but it had a great performance from a great actor.Great.",The Guilty

The plot has a timeline of one night . A LAPD cop Jake Gyllenhaal on duty at the 911 desk gets more and more involved in saving the life of a kidnapped lady and her two infant children. The movie is experimental in nature in the sense the camera doesn't move out of the 911 office and all action is interpreted through sound effects like we used to hear crime stories over a radio. ( Another aspect of its experimental nature is that it has been remotely directed by director from a van with monitors and away from the sound stage since he was Covid positive ). The movie relies heavily on sound effects to create drama and Jake has to emote though the innumerable close ups. He also has breathing problems which makes it worse for him. When his shift is over and the problems are far from getting solved, Jake moves into the privacy of an adjoining room to further track the events. The tension and suspense is skilfully interwoven in the movie by the director all through the use of sound.Jake Gallenhall is good as usual in the role of a harassed cop emotionally involved in saving lives of people he never met and also battling the demons of his private life not to speak of his breathing problems.",The Guilty

Honestly, this guy is one of America's greatest contemporary actors. Without him, this movie would have been much worse.The Bad: To accomplish this task, the film stretches beyond the realm of believability. Gyllenhaal gets away with way too much and it gets incredibly stupid by the end of it. You can't have realism and so BLATANTLY break the laws of reality at the same time. The movie is also quite visually flat, which doesn't help with a confined location.The Ugly: Another film of the COVID era (streaming, simple location, no frills).

128,arod_85,Lackluster script but excellent acting,6,10 October 2021,"Jake G's acting is on point as always. He manages to carry an entire movie that introduces minimal characters on screen. He has to rely solely on his acting to maintain the suspense, drama and thrilling moments, because you literally see nothing else but him speaking on the phone from start to finish. The viewer didn't actually have to view anything at all all and could get through the movie completely blindfolded because everything that happens is only heard. So the movie gets strong points for uniqueness and Jake G's authentic acting abilities. However, the elements that make this movie unique and interesting are also it's limitations. The fact that the movie relies solely on auditory input made it a little underwhelming and a tad boring.

However one desperate call gets Gyllenhaal's attention and he feels helpless as a potentially deadly situation unfolds.Right from the word go we know Joe, Jake Gyllenhaal's character, is flawed and something has happened to take him off the streets, so psychologically he is not functioning on all cylinders and this ultimately affects the way he deals with the incoming dramatic events.The premise is simple, compelling and you immediately get drawn into the drama which is mainly in your head because we only get to hear glimpses of what is happening on the other end of the call which means our imagination works over time in trying to piece it all together.Made for Netflix this American remake of the 2018 Dutch film of the same name stays close to the original source material.

There's no story to go with it. That basically left the movie being rather pointless and no understanding of what's going on with the character.The whole movie is based on an exchange of dialogue through a phone, so much shouting which is unrealistic. There's really no beginning, middle or end or even a climax. So much opportunity missed in this to make it a decent thriller.

160,brentn,Just as good as the original,7,25 September 2021,"I saw this last week and was pleasantly surprised. When they do remakes or foreign movies they always drop the ball hence Cold Pursuit. But I felt that this was on par with the Nordic version I saw a couple years ago. Gyllenhaal is always a good watch and having him team up with Fuqua again, I knew this would be a least a half decent outing. Now, some will say that this film also resembles the Halle Berry movie The Call but this film had more of an air of mystery to it all while there are other happenings that are hindering the investigation and also the protagonists own issues getting in the way. I enjoyed the pacing and the tension that was created throughout the back and forth calling and even the voice acting over the phone from some well known actors carried this movie even further. The twist at the end was not unforeseeable but was executed well and that makes for great presentation. 7/10.",The Guilty

163,r-fronimides,Poor remake of an EXCELLENT Danish film!,6,9 October 2021,"The movie is an almost perfect ""copy-paste"" story/screenplay of a remarkable Danish filme of 2013. The 95% of eny remake films, are failing to reach the quality of the original movies.The Danish original film was very pure, very authentic, very realistic. Also, the story flowed dramatically much better. Here, in this remake, Gylanhaal was WAY TOO aggresive and was acting almost like a mad, so it was totally unrealist that his SUPERVISOR OFFICER (the black woman) didn't removed him from duty from almost the fist 20 minutes of the film!!!I'm wondering, if you have an officer ACTING LIKE THIS in the call center (when they should be ULTRA CALM for all those calling for help), what's the point for the people calling to ask help?Gylanhaal is a very good actor, but he failed to respond to this specific (and difficult) role. All these films been shot in a single interior place (whithout any outdoor shots, no other scenes, all in a single room) they need EXTREMELLY ACTING from the actors - AND EXTREME DIRECTION from the directors.Personally I found it a very poor ""copy-paste"" of the original Danish film.Go ahead and watch this instead of this here.",The Guilty
164,Instant_Palmer,Gripping Spotlight Tour-de-Force Performance by Gyllenhaal,9,2 October 2021,"Antoine Fuqua directs Jake Gyllenhaal in the thriller 'The Guilty'. The film grabs your immediate attention, and steadily tightens its grip throughout the film, unfolding story layers one by one, increasing tension and anticipation with each layer exposed.Despite only being 90 minutes, the experience is satisfyingly exhausting, and by the end of the film, I was compelled to say simply ""WOW!""Riley Keough, Ethan Hawk, Paul Dano, Peter Sarsgaard, David Castaneda, Bill Burr, Gillian Zinser, Aileen Burdock and Christiana Montoya provide some of the distinctive voices on the other end of the phone calls.This film is a remake of the acclaimed 2018 Danish film of the same title.Hard to predict Oscar nominations these days, but Jake deserves the nod for certain.Great performances by the entire cast whether seen or just heard. A SAG ensemble nod would be fitting as well.Best to NOT read detailed plot/story-line summaries and reviews, or view lengthy trailers that may give away too much of the story. The unfolding of the story is one of the key elements to the film's success.If you like tense thrillers with the acting as the catalyst, this is one to simply jump into and watch.👍👍",The Guilty
165,nlgthunder,Good but incomplete,8,30 October 2021,"This film had the potential to be astounding, fantastic, and great. But it needed more. Coming in at 90 minutes wasn't enough time. I felt that more back story was needed or more development. I was dropped into the middle of this man's situation and didn't feel I was given adequate world building for him.With that said, Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic. The intensity of this film is palpable and the twist is a real guy punch. This film is a great introduction to the idea of making mental health front and center in society. We are on the edge of starting to really take it seriously, and this movie does that. Albeit very on the nose.I enjoyed the style of this, coming across much like a okay. It was immersive it just needed more.",The Guilty

With films like OXYGENE and THE HUMAN VOICE, the studios probably went looking for one-person-show scripts laying around during the pandemic, and this one is a gem.

171,pigsrings,Love Jake,4,2 October 2021,I love Jake and that's the only reason I started watching and the only reason I gave it 4 stars. But as an ex cop I couldn't last longer than 20 minutes. It's SO ludicrous that someone would get put on hold while speaking to a 911 operator. Or maybe that's how the yanks do it. But here in Australia no one calling 000 would be put on hold while the operator called the cops direct.Imagine being raped (or kidnapped in this case) and having the operator put you on hold. My eyes hurt from rolling back in my head so much.Writers need to do at least a little amount of research. Unless they classify this movie as fantasy?,The Guilty

The two stars is because Jake's in the movie, other than that, it should be in a padded room in one of those I LOVE ME jackets that fastens from behind.",The Guilty
173,Toph-22,Remake without new ideas,8,4 November 2021,"Remakes often have a hard time. They are inevitably compared to the underlying original. With 'The Guilty' it's actually the case that I find both movies equally good. The US version from 2021 is in no way inferior to the Danish original from 2018.This is simply due to the fact that the complete plot with all its twists and events is almost 1 to 1 identical. There are here and there some differing marginal details like the prevailing forest fire or that the family situation is a bit more present. Such things. Things that have nothing to do with the plot itself.This movie doesn't do anything different or better at all. However, you can't reproach the movie for that.For me, it's more a question of principle. Why remake a 3 year old movie and then do everything exactly the same? The main goal of a remake should be to give a basis for inspiration, to set new impulses or to prepare a movie for a new generation.This version will of course appeal to significantly more viewers due to the lead actor and the fact that it is an American movie. However, I had the feeling I was watching the same movie with different actors and location. That's not good enough for me.Now, of course, you still have to say that the movie is good and the plot and staging are refreshing. You don't see these kinds of movies every day. Acting-wise, Jake Gyllenhall performs on a high level as usual. Even if he acts close to overacting in my opinion. But that's complaining on a high niveau.In summary, I can say. Whether it's this version or the original Danish version, it's definitely worth watching. The story is really something new. Much takes place in facial expressions, gestures and one's own imagination.",The Guilty
174,antide-42376,Annoying,4,4 October 2021,"This is a movie to show off the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal can really act. He gives it everything he's got for sure but there is one problem. His character is as annoying as hell and Jake also overdoes it.. That isn't the only issue with this overwrought movie. The woman he speaks to on the phone is annoying, her husband is annoying and their daughter is annoying. You get where I am going with this review?This is one annoying movie.",The Guilty

In a roundabout way to ease his sense of right and wrong eating away at him, he goes above and beyond 'THE CALL' of duty... to the point of sheer madness.Jake Gyllenhaal's moment to shine came and shine he did! He displays an amazing array of faces, gestures, and voice inflections that together convey gigabytes of visual information. Not very many actors can pull this off as convincingly as he did. Of course, he has a knack for portraying grimy suspect characters; even so, I enjoyed it immensely. I can't imagine a film like this getting a warm reception from the ultra conservative crowd, especially in today's climate of police corruption concerning POCs. This is probably why they had Antoine Fuqua direct it.By the end of the film, you can't help but wonder how many other cops likewise fit the bill.",The Guilty

186,guskeller,The best kind of riveting,9,27 September 2021,"The Guilty is the best kind of riveting. Because the film is so restricted (mainly focusing on one character in a single, innocuous location), it grabs its audience with emotion and storytelling. It sounds monotonous to have an entire movie revolve around a man in a chair, but there is great ambition in this degree of restraint. Furthermore, this narrative device gives space for the camerawork, dialogue, and acting to carry the experience. A feat that all three fronts accomplish in spades.The script is a satisfying mystery laced with high levels of tension, passion, and payoff. The direction is masterful because every aspect of this film drives the pressurized tone, compelling viewers to the edge of their seats. Yet, it is the knockout performance of Jake Gyllenhaal that is the crown jewel of this experience. Gyllenhaal acts up a storm as he nails a wide range of emotions and displays the intricate layers of his tortured character. It is not often that a film so stripped down can be so deeply impactful, but The Guilty is perfectly executed. Knowing exactly what was needed to connect, The Guilty delivers in full force.Writing: 10/10

Ninety-one minutes of a punished police officer receiving calls while trying to support one particular case. He is pushed to the limit because there is a pang of inner guilt eating him alive. This story would be incredible for a book. When watching a movie, you expect to ""watch something"" this is where it lacks, there's no action just perspective. It effectively tells a story from a different lens while focusing on emotion through voices. So get ready to use your imagination.Verdict: If you get bored quickly watching movies, then this isn't for you. It's slow-paced, and the entire film focuses on one person.

I had to convince myself that this is just a movie and it's okay if the director got multiple facts wrong, but it kept putting me off. Jake Gyllenhaal put up a noteworthy performance, his act was convincing but character unlikable.Since the story lets the viewers imagine most parts, create personas, and construct each situation, I wish they went in-depth, helped build a more defined picture, like a novel. For a movie shot in 11 days with one character delivering the whole plot solely through dialogues, it is great, but for a movie you would spend 90 minutes on, it's just not that great anymore.",The Guilty

Gyllenhaal bears the full weight of this film on his shoulders, and he truly delivers.The dialogue is mostly fast-paced and compelling, though many of the conversations get repetitive, and the middle half-hour drags considerably because of this.There really is nothing visually interesting going on here; this could have been a narrative podcast and it might have even been better. But the final 15 minutes or so gives Gyllenhaal the chance to give some emotional weight to the film that was lacking throughout and the ending does really hit all the right beats.This script did not deserve this performance, but it was exactly what it needed.

The film immediately falls foul of outrageously unrealistic scenes, when Jake's character answers a 911 call then abuses the caller, takes a person call and walks away from his desk without being adequately challenged by a superior. It's clear they didn't bother consulting anyone or chose to ignore the reslities. The film bumbles along like a bad copycat of a classy original and Jake's overacting does nothing to redeem it.

The character that is slowly spiraling out of control from the weight of his own guilt and the weight of the caller he gets on his 911 line.Jake Gyllenhaal is just brilliant in the role of the police detective who has been demoted to 911 call duty for some major infraction that he has a court appearance for the very next day. We do not know what the infraction is until the last 30 mins of the movie. He is struggling, angry with the separation from his daughter and his wife (perhaps, his wife was just the conduit to his daughter only).He gets a call from a woman who has been kidnapped by her seemingly abusive husband, then a call from the woman's 6 year old daughter who is home with her baby brother, alone. Thusly setting in motion spinning plates that eventually have to come crashing down. We just don't know how each of those plates are going crash into the plot. Mr. Gyllenhaal has to play off of voices over the phone, not actual actors, each played by top rated actors - Ethan Hank, Riley Keough, Peter Sarsgaard, among others, while that helps his pain, anger, frustration, still has to be real, he must convince us, carry us into his reality!. He does a absolutely beautiful job of it. For the last third of the movie he is in total command and the last 20 minutes has all our questions answered as we sit transfixed in the brilliance of his acting.A superb movie filled with tension, mystery, sadness, and even some relief. Fuqua directs seamlessly allowing his actor to carry the whole load and he carries it perfectly! The photographer keeps a claustrophobic feel, even though the set is open that portrays the leads inner turmoil and the sense of loss of control of his life. Highly recommended.",The Guilty
218,tkdlifemagazine,This one os 100% Gyllenhaal,5,4 October 2021,"This is a remake of a 2018 foreign film about a police officer, in trouble, who ends up as a 911 Operator. The lead role, played masterfully by Jake Gyllenhaal, becomes overly entangled in an abduction call from a woman who appears to have been kidnapped by her boyfriend. The film is good, but Gyllenhaal is great-this is his film, for sure. He is very compelling as a sort of broken, anti-hero in this role. The film has twists and is engaging, which is laudable as the cast is so limited. I have no idea how a real 911 dispatch center works but I would guess not like it does in this film. You need to suspend belief as it relates to many issues when you watch this but it is still worth watching.",The Guilty

It is the classic 'edge of your seat' thriller that will haunt you for a while. It's also an emotional roller coaster. I think Antoine Fuqua (a very successful Hollywood director) learned something from Gustav Möller. Simplicity. There is no need to use hard wired action sequences and CGI to make a movie tense.

I don't consider myself to be highly sensitive to the BLM movement, but this, like I said, right at the very end of an otherwise gripping, even tear-jerking film - betrayed (or redefined) its core message: if you're a cop who kills a kid (and I must admit I assumed it was a black kid - and if I'm wrong, then ignore this whole critique, please!), and you probably have a heart of gold and you've probably got a cute little kid of your own and you're separated but you still love your ex, and yet, just when everybody thinks they have the full measure of you, you show your true, liberal, egalitarian, near-superhuman colours.

He's first instinct in any interaction is to take charge, regardless of rank or department, but when that fails, he pauses temporarily and come up with soft manipulative approach and tries again. It blows my mind how this movie captures the psychological details of a personality type that makes up of roughly 10% of our population.

Among thousands of calls you get one from a woman Emily (Riley Keough's Voice) , who seems to be kidnapped by her ex-husband Henry (Peter Sarsgaard's voice).This operator is Joe Baylor, played by the brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal. Being the decade-defining actor that he is, Gyllenhaal absolutely shines his best in The Guilty.And then Emily's six-year-old daughter Abby (Christiana Montoya's voice) calls, providing clues for Joe to track down Henry. And the one long night of an intense ride begins.It's not just about the kidnapping. Joe is not your average hero you see on thrillers. He needs to deal with his own problems and is a pretty irritable guy. It's really not easy to handle this character as well as Gyllenhaal did, you know. One thing that's also not easy to do well is the voice actings, which the film nails them.The Guilty is a remake of a 2018 Danish film with the same name. This remake is directed by Antoine Fuqua, who also did Southpaw, The Equalizer. Fuqua's direction, tension-creating and the editing by Jason Ballantine is perhaps as brilliant as Gyllenhaal's performance.On a screenplay aspect The Guilty may not be that original, but it's a generally well-made film with some of the best tension in modern films.",The Guilty

Joe was so unlikeable and horrible to just about every one of his colleagues, his being a 911 dispatcher just didn't make a lot of sense.

236,Silicone54,Boooring,2,12 October 2021,"I watched the Danish original version years ago and didn't think it was that good either. But maybe Jake can tailor it to American tastes?Nope this movie sucked. Joe Baylor is desk jobbed into the 911 call center pending his trial for allegedly murdering a young man. Seriously, I know nothing of police HQ policies but I highly doubt that he would be assigned to a position that he is speaking to the public in any fashion. His judgement is already called into question and he's dealing with high stress response calls? Nah no way!So the backdrop is that there is a massive wildfire burning in the outskirts of LA. So massive is this fire you can see it in every window reflection of the police station. There is not enough police or emergency personnel to keep order in the streets and evacuate.Joe gets a 911 call from a frantic woman who claims she's been kidnapped by her ex-husband. He's trying to figure out her location as she's locked in the back of a moving van. He attempts to elicit help from highway police or anyone else he can rope in. He tracks down her home address and sends police there to find her 2 young children, one of whom is disemboweled. All signs point to the father and thus the reason for the kidnapping.Ultimately, the clues and admissions are revealed that indeed Emily the mother is crazy was the child's attacker and the ex-husband was driving her to the psych clinic to ""lock her up"".So where does this movie fail?Firstly, there must be a thousand voice actors Jake could have interviewed for these roles. Peter Sarsgaard and Riley Keough were the voices of the conflicted couple. They were both absolutely HORRIBLE! The dialogue was torturous by all parties including the main character.Second, the father Henry supposedly finds his 5 year old son disemboweled and his first course of action is to leave both young children alone in the house. He will spend what might be an hour or more driving the mother to psych hospital and getting her admitted. His son is dead or dying and the little girl was told by the father to stay out of the boy's room.Third, the main plot is Joe Baylor is going to trial in the morning to face charges of murder. His partner who is going to testify on his behalf is drinking and partying this whole time. He is supposed to lie for Joe to refute the charges. This does not jive with anyone with any sensible knowledge of the law or the workplace.

237,muratmihcioglu,Broken people save broken people,7,18 October 2021,"Jake Gyllenhaal is such a talented and devoted actor that he can carry a movie on his shoulders almost alone. And the screenplay for this one was ideal to leave the stage to him.Though not the first movie to focus on the psyche of a 911 operator, ""The Guilty"" is more significant as a notable work on police brutality that ricochets.True that the hardest hit victims are those whose lose their lives as a result of blue rage, but in the end, the guilty side also pay a price, within the labyrinths of their souls if not in the courtrooms.I was able to predict the twist to the crime-in-progress with which Joe was dealing via multiple calls in the least professional manner. Still, the way his own psyche and story merged with it was striking.Fuqua is such a master of his art that, even with no mention of a murdered teen being black, he makes us get the message.Cinema is way more powerful when it manages to take the reverse angle while addressing hot topics. Any decent writer and director can make alright movies that depict racial profiling and police brutality. But it takes a refined, calm and deep attitude to show us the dark side of the moon without pointing the finger directly in the sky.I haven't seen the Danish movie on which this was based, so I cannot comment on what aspect was hand crafted for Hollywood, and what was borrowed.It does not sound realistic that a cop on trial would be put on a 911 line right before his trial. I doubt even the worst management of human resources would allow such a dangerous neglection.But the pressure of such a situation has definitely helped deliver a notable outcome within the margins of this film's make-believe world.",The Guilty

246,Darvener,Dull and silly rewriting of the original screenplay to English but in a worse way,4,16 October 2021,"The Guilty is a 2021 Netflix movie about a man named Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a police line operator on 911. One day before trial because of his incident with a 19 years old child will call 911 crying woman Emily Lighton and tell him that she was abducted.The director of this movie was Antoine Fuqua who was director of The Equalizer, The Magnificent Seven, Southpaw and Brooklyn's Finest. The style of directing was quite well done but there were some problems with the directing and visual style of this movie. Antoine Fuqua failed for a few actors because he wasn't able to bring better performances of some actors. This is a type of movie where a very good director and style is important, but Antoine Fuqua brought to this movie many styles of camera so it wasn't as good as it was expected. After these little details there are two big and important details. The first detail is that in one scene where police arrived at the white van because they thought it was the van which they were looking for. One policeman said that there was dust and smoke and this was the reason why they couldn't see the color of the van. The director did this scene so bad, that the viewer sees that there is a little amount of the dust and smoke and he can see the color of the van, but the policeman was saying that there is such a big amount of the dust and smoke that they can't see the color. This is the worst executed scene I have ever seen in this movie. The second detail is not a detail anymore. This is a very important element which is missing in this movie, the element is the atmosphere of the movie.Screenplay was written by Nic Pizzolato who has done a very successful HBO Original series 'True Detective'. After some complexity of True Detective I was expecting a better version of the original movie Den skyldige, but I was wrong. This movie is a dull and silly rewriting of the original screenplay to English but in a worse way. Some dialogs in this movie were weird, the whole sequence of the events was poorly done and in the original movie it was done better. The sense of this movie is that the viewer sees and hears what sees and hears the main character, in this case it is Joe Baylor and this was violated and this is a one of the reason why this movie hasn't any atmosphere because it was violated by a few scenes that viewer sees and the main character don't. Whole situations were weirdly done because he was at the police 911 line and when he had a phone call for example with his wife Jess Baylor anyone wasn't calling him to 911 and after the phone call someone called to him. There was one logic problem in the script and it is that the mother of the two children Emily Lighton did something wrong to her son. She ripped open his stomach and ""she took out snakes from his stomach"". At the end of the movie we learned that the baby who was lying on the bed with an open body for many hours and with no crying or something else, is alive in the hospital. This violated the atmosphere of the movie too, because this isn't here the good feeling that he has a woman who is a monster because she killed her own child. This movie is one of the worst remakes of the past ten years because of the bad execution of the screenplay.Jake Gyllenhaal in his main role of Joe Baylor did a very good and energetic performance. There is no problem with that. On the contrary this was the best element of the movie. Riley Keough who had the role of the maniac did a very good job too. But the almost not known actors did here a very bad job because they didn't feel their roles and the director was not able to get out from them better performance, this is a very important thing for movie like this where you are hearing only words and emotions, in these actors was problem with the emotions, they weren't able to bring natural and convincing emotions and feelings.Soundtrack for this movie was good but not good for some scenes of this movie. The tension and beats of the music was good but as I said the music doesn't fit the feelings and emotions of the movie. In some cases the music was so loud that it violated the atmosphere which was not there at all.They bring to this movie two styles of the camera which they intertwined. The one style is perfect for this style of the movie, but the second style was something that does not belong there. In comparison the second style was so different from the first style that I don't believe that they have done this.This movie is good if you watch it without the audio, but with the audio it is not that good at all. The screenplay ruined the whole movie because of recklessness.40%",The Guilty

It's basically a one actor film, similar to Phonebooth, although I preferred Phonebooth.The film is suspenceful and leaves a lot to the imagination. The story is interesting.The film starts solidly and deteriorates about 2/3 of the way through. The twist was predictable, the hypocrisy of the main character was odd. The last 5 minutes were forgettable.There's a fine line between great acting and overacting. This film went dangerously close to overacting. A film such as this can also become too preachy, which it struggled with.I'd consider this one of Jake's worst performances. It's still mostly decent.",The Guilty

His portrayal of a 911 phone responder was TERRIBlE! No 911 operator would have made it 10 min with how he was handling calls.

Good acting. Everyone complains comparing its original version, I didn't know there was one, so with a blank expectation, this movie was a good one to watch. Thrilling elements are hard to add without visual effects... we got used to much of visual treats for years now from movies... so in that aspect, this movie lags behind - we are left with our own imagination of what's going on.

278,redcanofevil,Phone Calls: The movie,7,20 October 2021,"THE GUILTY (2021):The Guilty is a very specific type of genre film that I always look forward to. Shot on a meagre budget, handful of cast in the entire movie and takes place on a single location. I have special admiration, respect and love for films that follow this formula but it is actually hard to make a feature length film solely focusing on one character and one location. You need a very strong actor to carry the whole movie and who better to than Jake Gyllenhaal?Interesting premise, solid performance, tight script and a neat plot twist near the end. It has it all, while not the best of its genre it certainly is a thrilling ride one which takes time unfolding. The one thing I'd say lets it really down is the dumbness of the people around but that can't be helped based on the movie location. Being a very paper thin movie there isn't much to fault even tho some of the tropes felt a bit played out by now. Guess I'll have to give the Original Swedish movie its based on a go as that might not have Gyllenhaal but it definitely would have smarter peoples in the movie.Might be a bit biased as movies like this is my favorite type of films and if I ever got an opportunity to direct or write a film I most definitely would have the same formula as The Guilty, which basically takes place all over phone calls. Films like this really brings out the true talent of actor, director and writers.RATING: 7.5/10.",The Guilty

But this film left me asking, but what about? Too many times.The father finds that the mother has hstmed their little boy, and he takes her where? Why are they in a van on the freeway and the wife is calling 911? Why are they not at an emergency room with their child, trying to save his life?Why does the little girl not know that her brother has been harmed? And, what is it about this whole experience that leads Joe, the cop working the 911 call, to change his mind about lying about how and why he killed someone while on duty. He and his partner, Rick, have their story ready for the trial the next day. But after the the ordeal of the mother and father and children that's the core of the story, after all that why does he decide to admit that he is guilty of killing a young man.A lot here does not make sense. If the husband wife situation is not a hostage situation, then, what is it. It makes no sense.And, at the end, did Emily, the wacko mother jump off the bridge. She says, before hanging up, that she is going to the little boy, who she thinks is dead. But a female cop, reporting back to the dispatchers, congratulates Gyllenhall on doing a good job: ""Yeah.

289,wlevyiii,Great acting but movie is a turn off,4,14 October 2021,"Jake can act. There is no doubt about that. But his character in this movie is SO unlikeable in this moving I couldn't watch it - especially without a backstory as to why he's such a mess. He's a physical mess, angry, rude, and helpful. When all it takes is for him to say ""yes, transfer the call over"", he has to scream and get angry. It doesn't even make sense. And the plot hole where NO ONE helps him on this major incident without a bunch of back-channeling is also lame. And what's with the fire even being part of the movie? It plays zero part other than to say the cops are all busy.It took me 5 hours to finish from the time I started it because I kept turning it off to do whatever. I didn't like a single character in the movie (not that you see anyone but Jake). I suppose there are many who say this is a 'great thriller', but I recommend you skip it and find something else. Definitely not one of his better movies and nothing I'd watch again or recommend to my movie buddies.",The Guilty

An actor who single handedly carried out the entire movie sitting on a chair and making calls and to be honest you didn't need to see anything more. Jake literally told the entire story, made the suspense, and thrill, all through his emotions. I cannot imagine it to be have been a easy job. One of the most talented actors alive, I'll again say.",The Guilty

That is the bane of modern society. We are unable to take creative action in the face of an unusual situation that is an emergency. Everyone is just a statistic. Modern society says: Stick to your job and follow the rules, even under extraordinary circumstances.Display of strong emotion in the face of an emergency situation is treated as completely unacceptable, against everything that makes us human. Fish and reptiles feel very little emotions. Robots feel zero emotions. But for some reason our society thinks that displaying no emotions is the epitome of being human. When in fact, strong and complicated emotions are a trait of only the most intelligent of species and should be something to be recognized as a fact, if not embraced as a very human trait. I would WANT someone to feel strong emotions in the face of the situation that happened in this movie.I took a point off for perpetuating the myth that ""crazy"" people are violent.

I had issues with it and ....they became clearer after watching this. So I thought I watched this. And Jake would be a good actor to pull this one off.Well surprisingly , despite that the movie depends a lot on the main actor. I liked that one better. I haven't rated that one and I won't. Not to say that Jake did a bad job. The issue is the story and what it wants us to believe.The other thing it depends on is the story. And I find that one a real hard pill to swallow. They placed it in an American background. One that has been eyed on by the whole world.So were it fails is that while in the other movie it is clear where the protagonist of the story reflects on his own doings. This is not clear at all in this movie. Jake manages to make himself such a big *%£* in this story that a dark part of me doesn't want him to succeed in his job. And I really don't care what goes on his trial.A job that frankly can't be given to him because of his anger issues. Yet everyone seem to be okay with it....If you go further it is like epstein and R kelly.... a lot of people knew what they were doing but because they had power they were allowed to. Since it is 2021 epstein could have been there. Probably to late to add R kelly in it. But you could go even further and add some other people that misused their power. No they had to target the police...Finally they have fallen but for the protagonist to fall by his own actions and everything should be allright and we should have sympathy for him now.... well I don't.So I just watched 90 minutes mostly to a character that I despise. And what is more there aren't actually new insights that it offers.It is just the story of a man and his family and the family of the people he is trying to ""save"".And what the movie wants you to believe is that by doing so he saves himself. Well he should try to get a psychological evaluation.*I know I am pretty harsh on this movie , but really if you want to see a movie with someone on a call check out Locke""In conclusion to what allready was a questionable story. With an aha-moment for the protagonist became in this remake even a more questionable story. And instead of putting some money into the 2018 movie to have solid distribution. People in power decided to do a remake.I ll think twice before i watch another remake made by this director.",The Guilty

When he get caught up in a kidnapping of a young mother, he does everything in his power to save the woman, while dealing with his personal situation at the same time.The movie starts really strong with a couple of harrowing and frightening phone calls, which made me to believe I was in for a good movie experience. The switching between calls and the realization how much information you can obtain from one Call is done pretty realistically. And, as always, Gyllenhaal performs excellently.But with many of the one location movies, the scenes and the movements between areas in the building seem a bit forced. And it is pretty obvious that the director did not know how to maintain the tension. There are some minor inconsistencies with the time frame (the time on the phone is hurting the timeline the most). Furthermore, the short cuts to the car are breaking the concept of one location movies entirely, there is just no purpose to it.Unfortunately the twist, which I will not spoil, comes out of nowhere upon first viewing. It is an interesting twist, but is not build up well enough to be believable at all. And the ending scene, quiet literally explains what the movie is all about, in a lazy way.Performances are good, there are some suspenseful scenes, but overall a quiet dull movie that have some really obvious inconsistencies.

Further adding to that is the fact that Fuqua never seems entirely comfortable with the one-location setting. He's an action filmmaker, and he will occasionally cut away from the call center to show blurry shots of cars on highways.Gyllenhaal is the center of everything here and rivets viewer attention as his character desperately, with decreasing success, tries to cover his tracks.In the end, The Guilty is not a pleasant sit but it does move with force and speed and accomplishes what it sets out to do with a sense of style and purpose.",The Guilty

Just unbelievable that a 911 call centre would let it's staff behave that way.Yet another showing of how gynocentric (female focussed) people are.The callers that the main character Joe was an unprofessional ass to were men.When we thought there was a dead baby, Joe just assumes it was the father. Because he thinks the father killed the baby, he threatens him, says he deserves execution, and a brick to the face from the mother.When he realises it was actually the mother that was the 'killer', he's sympathetic to her.Does absolutely nothing to try to stop her bricking the father because even though Joe now knows the father is innocent, he still doesn't seem to give a flying feck about him, I guess coz he's a man.Joe then really doesn't want the mother to die for murdering her baby, but was totally onboard for the father dying for murdering his baby.Turns out that a) the baby didn't actually die (which just seems ridiculous considering how long after the assault that it took to get the baby help, and that it's a tiny human & would have bled out super quick after being cut open and some guts 'snakes' pulled out, as well as both its parents believing it was dead).And b) Joe shot a guy previously.",The Guilty

An unique idea for a film although I understand it is a remake of a film of the same title from 2018. Very disappointing film which basically tried to creatively advance the narrative that police are incompetent, lawless and generally bad people. We see rude dispatchers, rude 911 operators, and our protagonist's attempt to help a supposedly kidnapped woman is overshadowed by his evil deed, which we don't know specifically what it is until the end but know that his fellow officers are planning to lie for him in court the next day. Systemic corruption in the police force, what a novel plot line! We have no idea why he is separated from his wife and why she won't let him speak with his daughter. The 911 caller, Riley Keogh, is gratingly annoying and completely unbelievable as the character she is ultimately revealed to be. There was an element of suspense and edge of your seat moments but these were unfortunately broken with boring and relatively irrelevant interludes.",The Guilty

But, apart from his great acting, this movie wasn't engaging at all and it's all Netflix's fault for making this movie with zero budget I guess!!

The synopsis said it all and I was waiting for car scenes and running and gunshots and all. But none of that apparently.The story wasn't anything out of the unusual, somehow predictable by the mid part. I believe Jake Gyllenhaal was the main essence of this movie and his acting was brilliant, nothing compared to how he did things when he was younger. This is a one man movie but still he was able to manifest an environment as if all other characters were there on screen.I think that alone is a good enough reason to watch this movie.

Just awesome.2. I got carried away by the same agony he was facing. The script was very well written and executed. Excellent atmosphere- this claustrophobic tech environment, where power and lack of freedom to physically act, produced a very intense vibe.3. Loved the lack-of-sufficient-oxygen crisis, due to asthma.4. Was an eye-wink to an older 2002 film ""Phonebooth"", starring Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland. I got the same adrenaline-toping.5.

347,Chronic_Cuntlyf,High tension achieved in a singular setting... again.,7,4 October 2021,"This gave me flashbacks to the Tom Hardy film, Locke. Both films only feature one setting, lots of phone calls and are carried by intense acting and rising stakes. It works very well, although some moments of The Guilty did take away from my immersion when the writing seems more interested in getting its messages across than maintaining realism.It did reach a point where I thought the protagonist's behaviour was a bit over-the-top for someone working in his field, but as his personal issues are slowly revealed the viewer does get a solid reason for why he behaves the way he does. One line delivered to the protagonist by his superior near the end of the film did almost have me rolling my eyes, though.It's worth watching for Jake Gyllenhaal's performance and the edge-of-your-seat plot developments, but it's far from Gyllenhaal's best role and it won't be making a ""Best Movies of the Year"" list for me.I did like this movie's ending more than the ending for Locke, and if this film succeeded at anything, it succeeded in showing me that I'd never have what it takes to work as an emergency call-taker.7/10.",The Guilty
348,icanbeaghost,Gyllenhaal Commands the Screen as Always,7,5 October 2021,"Jake Gyllenhaal has been my favorite actor for a very long time and nothing he does is disappointing. Prince of Persia might actually bring that statement into question but we don't need to open up old wounds, right?I just came here to say that this was a poignant, thought provoking film. Yes, it'a a bit slow and there's not much physical substance to it, as it takes place almost entirely in a 911 call center, centered around one man's personal crisis. Yet the story that unfolds is equally entertaining and heartbreaking. I did see the twist a mile away, considering the synopsis, however that did not take away from the appeal.I cannot speak to the original as I have not seen it, but I don't know why it matters, as it is my opinion that different versions of the same idea should be critiqued individually and not judged based on predecessors. Brothers, another Gyllenhaal remake, immediately comes to mind.All in all, I was thoroughly engrossed the whole time. I wish it would have delved a little deeper into the main character's troubled past but it did give enough to satiate the palate. Same goes for the stellar supporting cast, whom you only know by voice. A larger backstory would have solidified the desperation but I do understand why it was not offered.I give it a 7/10 considering the challenges they had while producing it, among other things. I would also love to see further collaboration between Gyllenhaal and Fuqua.",The Guilty

362,jamie-50817,Watched this one first,7,3 October 2021,"I watched the Netflix film first, and then thanks to the reviews here, discovered the Danish original and watched that too.The Netflix film is a taught and effective thriller, with a great central performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. It's mostly word-for-word the same as the Danish version. And it's free if you have Netflix!The Danish version is £2.99 on Amazon. It's less stylish and less melodramatic, but much more believable and affecting. I cared more for all the characters, and despite knowing exactly how it was going to play out, I was hooked throughout. At times I couldn't look away.The Netflix film adds an unneccesary personal arc, some wildfire-related melodrama, and a set more like a James Bond MI5 office than a 911 (or 112) call centre - all of which reduced the impact and made the film less engaging.If you're definitely not going to watch the Danish version, the Netflix one is a good bet. If you're ok to watch either, choose the original - it's a lot more suspensful and completely captivating. (Ideally, unlike me, don't watch both!)",The Guilty

We have seen a number of other movies which rotate around a phone call in a single room and similar situations like in this movie but getting right expressions is something. How many times hollywood will make n remake Spiderman, Batman n Superman origin movies but every time people call them ""marvelous"" because every new remake is a new artistic decisions of a new person. Yeah i liked this movie based on JG acting based on the gravity of various situations that he dealt with while helping someone on phone, which not only changed the lives of people he interacted with but also his own.

The story progressed well and tied in Jakes own inner demons quite effortlessly. The twist in the film was a nice surprise too.Some segments i felt the movie maybe was losing me or some of the voice actors over the phone became annoying (we know who) but was quickly resurrected by Jake's top notch acting once again.All in all guilty was a decent which had some real riveting scenes and some not so much.

380,twonests-36799,Apparently the writers forgot that 911 calls are recorded.,7,19 October 2021,"Basically this entire review is a spoiler except this sentence.In short: the big flaw that ruins his dramatic ""decision"" is the fact that- as we all know, 911 calls are recorded. Duh?The other reviews will cover most of the rest of it: Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor; has matured from a pretty good child actor into being something special. No doubt it's in part due to the fact that his sister is similarly fantastic.The plot twist that the wife is the abusive crazy murderous one was brilliant- I'm going to admit I normally see twists coming but that one got me. The music for that moment was also very well done.But there's a big gaping technical flaw in the dramatic conclusion that I think most people missed:He's on the phone with her and he confesses to her about abusing his policeman power by killing someone ""because I could"", and then the big conclusion of the film is him breaking down in the bathroom stall and deciding to confess.Well, guess what- 911 calls are recorded. Duh. He didn't even have that conversation with her on his cell phone; it was on the 911 headset. Calls get reviewed by management, especially ones that are as profound as this (not some ""drunk guy on his bike who hurt his knee"", an example demonstrated in the film.) The management are obviously closely connected with law enforcement (hell they *are* law enforcement), so they'd immediately know what to do about it.So technically he already confessed.So the big bold profound move of his confession was.... redundant.If I could've rewritten the ending, I would've had the phone call in the stall with his partner be him telling him that he'd just confessed, and so he's calling because he didn't want his loyal partner (who's on his way to court to testify), to purger himself. In other words: as a moral man, he'd be tying up the last loose end. That's still a proper ""conclusion"". He'd been up until 3am at that point, past his shift, exhausted , and now he can sleep with, at least, a good conscience.The dialogue would actually be mostly the same ""but now you won't see you daughter for years"", etc, and we'd still see Gyllenhaal's (well acted) reaction.Redundant confession,
7/10 because Gyllenhaal made it riveting, in spite of it being very repetitive and tedious his voice and face held it up.",The Guilty

Movies like this make me really angry I really don't know how to explain it.. Anyway I thought to myself I'll check the time and see whats left on the movie.. it was 1 HOUR in and he was still sitting at the damn desk..

Gyllenhaal handles his character well and is able to keep us interested throughout. It is not meant to he a happy movie, nor is it meant to give you a sappy ending.

Jake is the lead in a few of my favorite movies and this looked like it could be a new favorite. It started at about an 8 for me and as the movie kept going I kept wondering ""am I going to have to give this film a 10?"". I was really into it. So I looked at reviews and saw people saying the original was better and this movie was nonsensical. For starters, I didn't even know this was a remake and so far everything was pretty coherent. I got back to watching and it was at that point it started going downhill. I haven't seen the original yet so I can't compare but I will say that after about half the movie things just stopped make sense for me and it didn't feel real anymore. In the end, all I could think was man this was disappointing. I could probably give this movie a lower score but I really enjoyed the first half and Jake was of coarse solid throughout the film. If you have seen the original and not a big Jake fan I'd say pass. Otherwise , it's a pretty good movie with some unfortunate problems. Cheers.",The Guilty

I rate Jake very highly and he was the main draw card for me here, but I can't believe his already highly stressed character could still be at work, never mind in a 911 call center.

You just want someone to walk up to him and punch him in the face. Then there's all the phone calls which are executed so poorly. All the whimpering, all the whispering, all the crying. It is just so absolutely horrible. It's like a long series of 4 a.m. Drunken phone calls from your ex.Then the plot...it just completely goes off the rails at the end of the movie. I can't express to you enough, dear reader, just how stupid, predictable, and lame this movie is.

458,itsjairusjames,A story of bad people making good choices,7,9 October 2021,"Just watched The Guilty. Jake Gyllenhaal has range, no surprise. My takeaway was he was trying to atone for one sin by amending another, but he realized he needed to face the consequences of what he did. There was a slight moment of relief when he realized both people were saved. But then a dawning realization that his guilt wasn't absolved. At the end of the movie I don't feel bad for him and I think that was the movie's point. In any case I thought it was also a parallel of his struggle with mental illness and Emily's. But maybe it was guilt all along and when he literally vomited the truth, he felt clarity in knowing what he had to do. It was a story of bad people making good choices. That's my take on it, loved the direction & pacing.",The Guilty

463,colette-97863,Why did they make Jake Gyllenhaal such a jerk?,4,3 October 2021,"The problem with what is essentially a one-man show is if that man is not likable, the show falls flat. This is not about Jake Gyllenhaal's acting (unless this was just his interpretation) but how his character was written. He is such a complete ass that not only is it difficult to sympathize with him but it defies credulity.When we meet Joe, we find him working a 911 emergency phone line in Los Angeles after being put on desk duty for the LAPD for some incident seven months before. We soon learn that he is scheduled to have a hearing of some sort the next day and expects to be back on the streets after that.How is it that after working this job and knowing his colleagues for seven months he can still be so belligerent? I actually found it to be the least believable aspect of the film and it kind of ruined it for me.Then I discovered it was a remake of a 2019 Danish film, and so I watched that on Hulu (with subtitles). Oh my gosh it is SO much better!Perhaps I noticed this more because I had also use closed captions on the American version, but I was amazed how they used the majority of the script from Denmark almost verbatim! Some of the changes made a lot of sense, such as adding the complication of the wildfires because the LAPD has far more resources available than would the Copenhagen PD. The wildfires were a clever way to get around the use of helicopters, etc. Like how filmmakers always have to give a reason characters can't use a mobile phone.Other changes just didn't make sense, and they were all about the character of Joe (Asger). They made him into a misanthropic brute from the beginning, which may have been to add credibility to the rest of the plot but was overdone, and the original proves it wasn't needed at all. The added interaction with his wife only made him seem like more of a jerk. Also, why did they give him asthma? Was that supposed to make him more sympathetic? No one I know with asthma would behave the way he does.I would recommend that you watch the original from Denmark instead of this remake, but if you decide to watch both, be sure to watch that one second or you'll find the Jake Gyllenhaal version even more insufferable.",The Guilty

He is horrifyingly bad at the job, and realistically he would have gotten pulled out immediately.When he got the license plate number he does not hand it over to dispatch.

Fuqua does the same with his address quite correct and well treated.In this American version, we find small changes that try to mark their own stamp of which the vast majority result and in others they fail to overcome the maximum tension that the Danish film offered us. The exposure of some situations that his script takes, is what remains a bit, because we have a bit of the tension that is being achieved for moments. In turn, the constant presence of Joe's personality ends up saturating a bit as a viewer, although it cannot be denied that the interpretation of Jake Gyllenhaal is what gives The Guilty the absolute presence on screen.A good adaptation is the one that is achieved in a film that fulfills to entertain and keep you connected with what we are seeing, at times we manage to enter into the tension that is generated, especially due to the great work of its cast both on screen and in voice .Antoine Fuqua, once again demonstrates how interesting a director he is, and that he handles these types of films perfectly, where tension is the main protagonist of him.Netflix gets it right with this adaptation of a huge Danish hit.",The Guilty

Perfectly...,9,7 October 2021,"I have nothing else to say about the quality of this film.The rest of my comment is for the person who gave it a 1 complaining about police procedures and dispatch routines and tech not being accurate.I understand you know a lot about this or maybe even work as an officer. I genuinely and respectfully thank you for the hard work you and your colleagues do for us all, it can not be easy to live with that day in day out...That said, this IS a fiction. Although some realism can be in place I believe it's not a must. The purpose of a film is to tell a story to deliver emotions. And thus storytellers do make artistic choices that might not always reflect reality to tell their story.Have you never seen a thriller where the bad guy stays down after being hit on the head with a baseball bat? Or a fight scene where two people can fight for 15 minutes inflicting incredible damage to eachother and still talk sensibly and walk out of it standing?Car chase scenes that last 20 min that wreck a whole lot and the driver /heros survive...?Dragons, and spaceships... People who don't leave the house when they knooow there's a ghost there?These are all settings to create the stage to tell a story... Hopefully with some excitement and suspense... And well, that's why we choose to watch these types of films.So I do understand you had a bad film experience because of your knowledge but if filmmakers have to keep everything realistic we wouldn't be watching fiction films / thrillers / horror etc. Because they would be boring and end in 5 minutes with the first crash or stab or laser blast...Anyway...

Calls don't follow you around. They drop in like any other call center. When you recall 911 you can and most likely will get a different operator. My head spins at the potential lawsuits involved with his refusing to help and hanging up on an overdose and an accident victim.Police would definitely respond and do all possible to help an abduction victim with even just a vehicle description and general location. They would also definitely respond to a 6 year old and infant left home alone. No argument, no hoops to jump through. Done and done.I have also never seen a dispatch center without a terminal messaging system. They don't run around telling other operators they have a call for them. They handle the call and message the other operator if need be because they are most likely now on a different call.The lack of knowledge on police and dispatch procedures is laughable, lazy, and insulting.

It was literally a one man show! He played a very troubled character called Joe Baylor who is working a night shift at a 911 call center. After a couple of minutes of showing what is job entails and how current events might make it hard for him to do his job, we go straight into the suspense with a distressing phone call. After that its just stressful scene after stressful scene while in the meanwhile, underlaying plots develop as well slowly giving you an image of who this man truly is.Now that also brings me a problem: What is the message of this movie? I wont go into spoilers but at the end it makes you wonder what the point of it really was. And Im struggling to find that point.But that doesnt take away that this movie did a very good job of entertaining me! The suspense was really good and I dont think I looked at the time once!

The added drama of the wildfires is not necessary and is in some ways distracting from the actual plot.

I hate how they change the end to be more american friendly with a happy ending with the kid saved, It does not have the same impact at how they explain the dead of the baby and how he was open.I honestly hate all the decision made, is a movie with not emotion and a copy paste of the original.",The Guilty

Secondly, I never understood the asthma plot device. I have asthma... how is that riveting? And the extreme behavior- he would have been kicked out or throat punched within 5 minutes. The call dialogues were unnatural and undramatic (crying, screaming, sniveling, whispering, etc.= noise. Excellent script writing= drama). If I could sympathize with the MC, I might have suspended belief a little more, but I just kept scratching my head about his unrelenting fury. It was way too distracting. Lastly, the heart to heart with the partner at the end... errr what? Somehow the a-hole grew a conscience while helping a psychotic child killer (well, attempted killer), but couldn't manage to squeeze out a few tears for realism. Could no one on set be bothered to sprinkle some water drops on his fevered face? Visine anyone? Like most other reviewers noted, Halle Berry pulled this off much better almost 20 years ago.

The dialogue-particularly the phone calls-sounds completely unnatural. The film is full of ridiculous one-liners. At one point, a woman with no real part in the film exits a room with the line ""broken people fix broken people."" Not only is that line completely ridiculous (broken people often destroy each other), but nobody speaks like that. It was an obvious attempt at profundity and depth that missed brutally.Worst of all, the film is about a murderous cop who killed somebody because he was angry. He then proceeds to completely overstep his job description and push an already dangerous situation completely off the rails. We're supposed to root for this guy? Come on.

Victims of police brutality aren't free without truth and justice ... but the officers involved aren't free without it either. The film humanizes the crooked cop, even as it shows that it is this very humanity that suffers when justice is not served for their misdeeds. Lack of truth and justice hurts the perpetrator too. The opening Scripture quote frames this timely message - ""the truth will set you free,"" John 8:32 (understandably taken out of context - Jesus was saying HE is the truth that sets us free ... but telling the truth can't hurt either).AND if that wasn't already enough for a gripping thriller ... how about a voice cameo from Bill Burr?

Turns out the trailer was just a great cut and it has nothing to do with this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is ok in this but his character is a trainwreck in a bad way. The whole concept and ambiance is suppose to be very intimate but extreme closeups of lead actors face don't make it so. Neither does him yelling in the air and cursing out loud especially to his co-workers. Also the cursing just doesn't fit somehow. It's over the top and I would say overacting but knowing Gyllenhaals work most likely it's the script and/or the director demanding it. The rest of the cast seem to be separate and from a totally different movie. Bad acting with bad lines just make it so. Too bad. Too many things just don't work here.,The Guilty

If they can pull off the emotion without seeing them and without over acting then they did well and most did great.My problem with this movie is a societal one and how men and women are treated. When he thought the husband abducted her and killed their son he talked down to him, treated him terribly and told him he deserved to be executed for what he had done! As soon as the truth came out and he found out in fact it was the woman/mother who possibly killed her son he spoke to her with respect and very caring. Didnt tell her she deserved to be in jail in fact he wanted to get her help. Never once cared if the father had mental issues and maybe needed help! Nope, instantly wanted him to pay for his crimes. Yet the wife he wanted to help her and didnt want her to do any harm to herself.Proving once again there is no help, care or understanding for men at all. Its sad.

Is that just forgiven because he cried about it? The cure for police brutality isn't to stop killing people, especially people of color, the cure is more white tears?

671,rd2922,Not worth the time,2,12 October 2021,"From the beginning I tried to understand what the circumstances were behind Jake Gyllenhaal's character's meltdown. It seems to be a trend and fascination with directors recently to force the audience to slowly watch a character fall apart on screen. Do they enjoy filming pain or do they get some kick out of taking an honorable character and then slowly making the audience dislike them over the course of the film? Rhetorical question because the end result is the same.I also had an issue with his confession for killing the ""boy"" as he stated in the movie. The character stated ""I guess I killed him because I could"". So you are telling me the same character that got all bent out of shape over these 911 calls and stares at the picture of his daughter just whipped out his gun and shot a kid because he could. I think instead of letting the character play out naturally, someone decided to once again insert their politics. Just disappointed the director waited until the end to insert the political garbage. What a dumb ending. As if the media is the great vindicator of all your crimes. Horrible movie from a horrible biased Outlook on police and dispatchers.",The Guilty

There is no other locale throughout the entire movie. There is no other activity, other than voices on his headset and the occasional GPS screen depicting the victim's location.

Further, he acts like a lunatic and is obviously unstable; very unlikable character.Another thing is the story itself is not convincing.

The setup is just brilliant, it gave me major audiobook vibes. The voice acting is pretty solid
The emotion carry perfectly with a solid voice cast
The last 30 minutes are pretty raw and emotional. I gasped, got tensed and felt a sense of relief along with Joe Baylor in the movie
The premise was pretty average and age-old, though an attempt is made to present it differently, except the last 30 minutes much of the proceedings felt pretty bland
I mean in a 90 minutes flick, I was waiting for the movie to take off. But the majority of the movie was spent on random phone calls and the main character is a horrible person
I mean I don't understand how terrible a person can be, oh cmon! When someone calls him that he met with an accident. His reaction is ""Dont drink and drive?""
I get that the lead character has some mental health issues and is in a fix at that time. But That's not the way to respond to a person in an urgent need
I understand that it's the job of the protagonist, but in 90 minutes I felt the narrative was a bit bloated in the first 45 minutes
I had to spend a whole movie with such an ill-behaved person(God save me!)
Only after that first 45 minutes, I realised "" Oh, this film has a plot too""(Fantastic!)
Due to which the ending/realized felt a bit unearned and rushed

I'm just tired of Hollywood remaking foreign films as if everything has been done and there's a shortage of good scripts and writers.

You have to admire how a story unfolds with Jake on screen and all other actors pretty much on the end of a phone line so only getting atmosphere from voice. HOWEVER, with that being said, the kidnapped character Emily starts to become a bit annoying with her constant whimpering and distressed voice, (yes I know she's been kidnapped) but it becomes tedious.The sub plot with what's going on in Jakes personal life tees up his emotions perfectly and there is a great connection to his own turmoil and what's happening on the phone line, so it's a subtle way of him atoning for his own downfalls and transgressions of recent.I found his connections with emotional scenes to be absolutely spot on and his acting was as always top drawer!On a plus side the twist is pretty decent and as I said Jakes performance is solid from start to finish.

I would have liked to see everything heard in another format, acted and not just listening to the voices.The objective was good but it did not reached my expectations, especially the end, which for me is little explained to me for what I was waiting for.The idea of doing everything in one place without varying the scenes and making the characters hear each other over the phone is interesting, but in the case of this movie it is a little bit boring and monotonous, even though the story has been interesting.",The Guilty

It became a testament on his impulsiveness and his terrible sense of judgement that could potentially harm others with fatal outcomes.This realization lead him to take responsibility for his sins and they're consequences. Guilt and remorse is a stench you can't hide with perfume. This feeling is what separates a good person who made a mistake from a psychopath.Jake Gyllenhall's acting was not bad. He did nothing extraordinary. The scene inside the bathroom stall while taking to his partner on the phone, that heavy feeling of personal resolve and admission of guilt required a tear.

The ""twist"" could be seen from miles away, and that's even without knowing there was a twist.2. It's exhausting to find out that nothing bad really happened to anyone. Everyone survived and lived happily ever after, with the exception of JG who instead becomes the pinnacle of morality. Am I suppose to rejoice in the fact that Oliver survived? Makes me feel like a child being presented a fairy tale rather than a drama.3. Again, might be the remake, but I found it hard to sympathize with Emily after the twist. We think she just killed her baby, and we are suppose to cry together with JG at the idea that she's not picking up her phone. Don't get me wrong, I'm sympathetic to mental illness but the movie really did not do the presentation justice. Simply stating ""she was institutionalized"" is a really cheap way to get it across.I like JG's acting but it's hard to take serious after being dragged through 20 minutes of the above problems.",The Guilty

If done well (like this one was), it can create a feeling of fantastic suspense and anxiety as you feel the central character's desire and squirming to be where the action actually is taking place. Jake's acting was spot-on and gut-wrenching the whole way through. The reasons I take off 1 star are that:1 the two coworkers at the call center are kinda meh. They didn't say anything I was interested in. And it's not that they were awful; they simply weren't on Jake's level of acting and the contrast was irritating.2 I found it a little too convenient for the plot that the cop coworker called with the info that the female caller was previously in a mental hospital... just after Gyllenhaal found out she was crazy. The timing was annoyingly perfect.But those two gripes are minor. This is a fantastic movie. One of my top 5 this year for sure.",The Guilty

This is a Netflix remake of a Danish thriller with the same name, I haven't seen that one yet.The entire movie takes place in a single building, we learn the different difficulties people are going through only through phone calls as the outside world is burning. Despite there being not much movement, I guarantee you will be at the edge of your seat from start to finish.We see the protagonist Joe Baylor (played by the excellent Jake Gyllenhaal) as tries to stop a kidnapping and peace a mystery by phone calls with allies and strangers while going through inner conflicts.As the story progresses, we only see events getting darker and more desperate with seemingly no way out. It is a heavy, brilliant, emotional rollercoaster with ominous music, great visuals and enhanced by the stunning and humane acting by Gyllenhaal.",The Guilty

Unlike others, I didn't find the dialogues annoying or a torture to the ears, on the contrary I thought the sound was very well dealt with and appropriate to the film style. I equally liked the setting, not being able to see anything beyond the room Gyllenhaal was in, wondering what was going on at the other end of the line and the whole premise. There was a point, towards the last 20 minutes of the film when I started losing interest and got baffled by the main character's reactions. I didn't get the reason why all of a sudden Gyllenhaal got so emotional and I certainly missed the point of his change of plea. There was no background to his actions prior to the 911 call that lead to his trial and even when some snippets were revealed I failed to see how his success at preventing a mentally unstable person from killing herself (and the child she injured from dying) made him feel more guilty about his own crime (?) than before the call.

Hollywood needs to put music to everything.The ending of the original is different. Hollywood has to have a happy ending and changes things because it cannot let the public tolerate something cruel to a baby. Happy endings everywhere.In the original version, you can feel the tension of the situation. In this remake it seems that he only highlights the bad performance of Jake Gyllenhaal that his fans will love. A good actor shouldn't stand out like that. An emergency operator cannot cause a nuisance in that work zone, upsetting all other operators, such as air traffic controllers, they have to remain calm and concentrate on their work.

The scenes with him crying were very funny to my friend and I. Also, in reality, if some shmuck acted like that in any workplace, he or she would be shunned by his/her peers and fired immediately.I do however admire the directors & DOPs ability to make it all seem so dramatic: the lighting, the music, the camera angles were great given the script they had to work with.Another saving grace for this movie was the fact that I did not have to leave my house, drive to a movie theatre, pay for a movie ticket, pay for popcorn and a drink and sit in a room with a bunch of strangers and watch someone dramatically WFH.",The Guilty

The Danish original is an edge-of-your seat, gripping narrative filmed in the most economical and efficient means imaginable - close to the one-room drama of something like Hitchcock's Rope. And that technique adds incredible tension to the turgid and captivating voice and character acting. It makes you very attuned to the psychological time dilations and the ticking away of real time as the sense of urgency that rises from the story slowly rises to a full boil.As per the usual, this American remake, a lazy cinematic translation to American English and American cinematic idioms, so directly emulates the original, that you end up noticing its weaknesses and flaws - all the little ways it fails to live up to the masterful film it is aping.Sure, using a couple good Hollywood stars with the right acting skills makes this absolutely watchable - and perhaps those American viewers who, in this day and age of Netflix and streaming international productions, STILL balk at the idea of subtitles, will be none the wiser for having completely passed over the original. (Many will never have even heard that there was an original Danish version since American multiplexes are unwilling to screen foreign films in countless regions!) What a shame that they'll never know what they're missing.Do yourself a favor and just watch the original. Don't waste your time with this, Gyllenhaal or not.And if you are in the states, support cinemas who screen foreign films. These Hollywood remakes are patronizing you and insulting your intelligence. You CAN enjoy a great movie in another language. Don't let Hollywood tell you otherwise.",The Guilty

I've never left a review on imdb before but this movie has made me so mad that I had to.I'm nitpicking, I know, but the repeated lines are making me angry. Everyone is constantly repeating the same lines over and over and OVER. He's also so angry since the beginning and we don't get any context for it. They make it like I'm supposed to care about his life outside of the job but they don't show us why. The fact that he doesn't alert anyone about what's happening is dumb.

817,terry-20264,The original version was better???,8,6 October 2021,"How so? There's multiple reviews stating the original Danish version was sooooo much better, but my opinion is for the opposite. The Danish version about put me to sleep. In the American remake, Jake Gyllenhaal takes it to another level. As he always does when real tension is in the essence of the character and plot. Not to mention the visuals from the fires in near Los Angeles projected on the emergency center screens. It escalates said tension and gives the viewer something else to white knuckle through while the story unfolds. Both versions are very well made, but the newer version is fantastic. Not a ten, but definitely close. Another nod for Jake and his intense intensity. That's his jam.",The Guilty

Kickoff off offdcnxhxhxhdkzxixjzjzkzixxbvndlsThis is a tense thriller that takes you inside the mind of a stressed out police officer assigned to call desk duty until he's potentially cleared of an unspecified violation that we only learn about near the story's finale. Officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotional conflict as he tries desperately to save a woman he believes has been kidnapped by her estranged husband, while her two young children have been left at home to wait out the ordeal. Involving not only highway patrol, but fellow officers and a former sergeant, Baylor appears about to crack under the strain of not only the assumed kidnapping, but a six month old divorce that's still weighing heavily on his psyche. To say that things are not always as they seem in the picture would be quite an understatement, and the film's turning point hinges on a late phone conversation Baylor has with the unseen Emily (voiced by Riley Keough), which abruptly obscures his original assumptions about a kidnapping. Gillenhaal brings all the intensity to his character that we've seen previously in his portrayal of Louis Bloom in ""Nightcrawler"". His performance here leaves you almost as emotionally drained as Joe Baylor, eventually willing to admit that the hearing he the next day must of necessity be handled w utmost integrity.l.",The Guilty

The problem is that at the same time the movie at some moments become dense and repetitive.

His performance is of a fantastic level. Nothing to take away from the other actors, of course. They are also very good. In short, I recommend this film to you.

A well written main character that can't help but try and help to the point you question whether sometimes this may have an adverse affect. Voice acting is really good and conveys a deep and gripping storyline despite not seeing more than 3/4 faces in the entire movie.

Camara and sound I liked, partially also the acting.After less than an hour everyone can smell/sense the ""twist"" which is expected otherwise... yeah no reason to continue.Lots of things for make sense, the fire, the background of Joe, the repetitive sentences, involving friends or no idea who it was, the appointment for the court, the relationship to his wife/ex, why Henry doesn't say something, the coworker he wanted to drink a beer...why?The child was very annoying after a while when she said for 1 million times she wants to be with her mum. The mum was then even worse. She said 999 million times she doesn't wanna die. I really had no empathy or sympathy for any of these characters.For me most of these doesn't align... I haven't seen the original yet. It just can be better.At all a very disappointing and unsatisfying movie which might raise tamper.The baby was alive and Emily didn't kill herself yippee, maybe Henry got hurt but that's fine and the audience is happy...

Instead it got labeled a thriller due to the thrill the of pure rage the audience feels as they watch Joe pick one poor choice of words after another.The acting was pretty good and the story was new to me.

You'll pretty much roll your eyes the entire movie at the unreasonable actions of the characters. (And the aha!!

This psychological thriller will make you think, evaluate and validate your beliefs of right and wrong & experience how empathy is at the mercy of how much information you have, first-hand.I watched this out of boredom and man, was I in for an emotional rollercoaster! I loved Jake's performance in Southpaw but this one was absolutely phenomenal.It's shocking to see it got a 6.5 on imDb. Possibly because it touched on SO many law enforcement related and societal taboos all at once; like mental illnesses, lack of societal empathy towards convicts, unlawful but situationally virtuous actions of the police, mental health of law enforcement officials, the state of trust people have in the system, the sheer human short-falls of people the serve and protect us; the list goes on.Please remember it wasn't a seasoned 911 operative who was portrayed in the movie, it was a human being burdened by responsibility, torn between right and wrong and under attack by his demons who was put in a room handling the worst humanity has to offer.It's disappointing to see the negative reviews being ignorantly bashful and myopic. Possibly because it made people uncomfortable - and that's exactly what true art is supposed to make people feel.Every little detail like the light coming on and off on the headset when a call is connected/disconnected, the actual visible call screen when Jake makes phone calls, the little breathing sounds & wimpers in the background on calls, the lights, the heartbeat sounds that slip to your subconscious, BGM - pure directive brilliance!10/10 will be definitely recommending to a lot of my pals.Tip: Watch this by yourself or with people who relate to this genre.",The Guilty

Watch the trailer and then select another movie. Why? This is an equivalent of listening to the radio while looking at a picture of Jake Gyllenhaal. This is due to the simple fact there is absolutely no visual stimulation in this movie, sad but true. In short, just like in the movie trailer all you see is a man on the phone, a few puffs from an inhaler, and puking in a toilet...sadly this not sarcasm but an accurate description of the movie visuals.For me, visuals define the difference between a MOVIE in comparison to other alternatives such as RADIO or BOOKS.Unfortunately this film leaves all visuals to your imagination, making this better suited as a short story for you to READ.",The Guilty

A couple of moments drop out where I was screaming at the screen for an alternative, or where the narrative was a bit forced forward, but overall what a great performance and concept.I think people should watch this and take away what they can, because there is so much to take away.

One good thing though is that I am sure this movie was filmed during the pandemic, due to it being shot in 1/2 rooms with a small budget. Considering this, it does well in the cinematography category. Other than this, I don't really see any saving grace. Boring story with a predictable 'plot twist' ending.

This movie is definitely not perfect; being a Hollywood remake there are, of course, some classic Hollywood clichés, however ,in my opinion, they by no means highjack the film or the atmosphere of the film.This movie is a solid watch; I do not believe all the reviews stating the original as being better is a legitimate reason for giving bad ratings; I believe a film should be judged based off only itself.

While his acting is undeniably fantastic, the overall performance is dwarfed by the monotonous sets. I think there are only 3 sets in the whole film: the desk with computers, the coffee station, and the bathroom. It gets old. Really fast. Even with gorgeous and talented Jake to stare at, the film comes across as somewhat boring and slow-moving. And by the end, you will know exactly how many pores that man has on his face...and honestly that's probably the biggest takeaway from the whole production.

1021,dimitriosm,A very good remake of the original 2018 Danish movie,7,22 September 2021,"The Danish original is better of course, actually nearly perfect but since this American ""edition"" keeps exactly the same storyline without Hollywood's dramatic exaggerations and amplifications so it is fair to say that it is a very good movie.Some may argue that we did not need another remake and that is quite understandable but in my opinion if there is no alternative at least try to make the copy as good as it can be. In this particular case the new version is quite watchable.Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is very good and far more emotional than
Jakob Cedergren's which was somewhat more rigid and detached.Don't get me wrong the Swedish actor was quite good but when he realized that the caller - mother due to her mental illness has killed her own child should have shed one more tear.Although at this exact instance Gyllenhaal's performance is better I don't know who exactly - don't want to believe writer Nic Pizzolatto or director Antoine Fuqua but rather the producers - decide to diminish the tragedy by informing the protagonist and us that the little child had survived I guess just to soften the impact for the American audience and by doing so spoils the drama a little.Anyway there is another but significant difference in favor of the original and that is the director Gustav Möller's decision to follow his protagonist's face closely, always in the foreground, emphasizing his mental breakdown and leave the background blurred or completely hidden.Fuqua seems to be a little unease to shoot so close and ""freeze the frame"" onto Gyllenhaal's very emotional acting.Seems to me that if Gyllenhaal's acting was directed by Gustav Möller we would have a certain success.",The Guilty
