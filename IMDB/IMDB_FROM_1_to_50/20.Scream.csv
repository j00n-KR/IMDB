0,TheLittleSongbird,A true scream of a horror classic,10,15 July 2011,"What can I say? Scream is a wonderful film, a classic of its genre and a real scream from start to finish. The production values are excellent with atmospheric photography and settings, Wes Craven's direction is to date one of his best directing jobs, the music is haunting and the sound effects unsettling. The acting from Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette is top notch, and GhostFace as a character is iconic. What struck me as truly impressive about Scream was its originality, the story is fresh and while there are some funny lines, there are some genuinely scary, jump-out-of-your-seat moments too. Overall, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Scream
1,bkoganbing,Who's Doing All The Slashing?,6,9 April 2012,"In the case of Scream my review should be taken with a grain of salt as I'm not really into these slasher flicks. But for its kind and the fact that it was directed by Wes Craven who does get the best out of them, it's as good as it will get.The film opens up with Drew Barrymore and her boyfriend being sliced and diced by some guy in a black cape and ghost mask. That's just to get the audience in the mood. It seems as though this slashing is connected to a case a year ago when Neve Campbell's mother was killed in the same grisly manner. This gives Neve a rooting interest to find out who is doing these killings.Two other people are interested in the story, TV reporter Courtney Cox and her then husband David Arquette playing a sheriff's deputy on the cases. But the killings go on and someone is after a lot of the town's teen population.Wes Craven borrowed a gambit from Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None for his story involving the real killer. If you know that film or the book Ten Little Indians from whence it comes, then you might just figure out who's doing all the slashing.Scream and its successors aren't exactly my cup of tea, but you might like this if that is your taste.",Scream
2,Leofwine_draca,The undisputed king of the '90s slasher,9,11 December 2016,"Single-handedly breathing life into the dead teen genre (read that as you will), SCREAM was a box office hit to be reckoned with. Rave reviews at the time meant that it was the 1990s' most popular horror film, but it's easy to get caught up in the hype of something. On my first viewing I agreed that it was an excellent film. Now, a few years later when we're all a little older and a little wiser, it's time for a second look. Especially after the glut of teen slashers following in SCREAM's wake diluted the originality and freshness of it.Happily, SCREAM is still enjoyable the second or third time around, although I have my doubts as to the long-term appeal of the film. Much of the interest lies in the murder mystery side of the film, and of course after you've seen it once you know who the killers are. Aside from this niggle, SCREAM has everything you could want from a slasher film: great colourful photography, lots of blood, plenty of plot twists, bizarre gory deaths, and some likable characters. Add on top of that the (now clichéd) self-referential twist which had the then-new idea of characters in a horror film actually talking about characters in previous horror films with plenty of in-jokes, and this is a delightful viewing experience.The characters here are well drawn and a talented young cast do very well with their respective roles. Neve Campbell is young and cute here, likable as the film's heroine, and a long way from the hollowed-out zombie she had turned into four years later (watching this again, it's amazing how much she changed in so little a time). David Arquette is still irritating as the dumb sheriff, yet Courteney Cox provides tough charm in the showy role of a television reporter. Drew Barrymore, whose familial links to the horror film go back to the 1920s, has a brilliant cameo and is convincingly terrified at the beginning of the film, in the now legendary telephone sequence which sees her a) menaced by a prank caller, b) take part in a horror trivia game and lose, c) see her boyfriend gutted, d) get stalked through her house by the killer, and finally e) get stabbed repeatedly, gutted, and hanged from a tree. Now there's something you don't see everyday.Elsewhere, Matthew Lillard walks a fine line between being annoying and amusing, falling just on the right side of amusing, while Skeet Ulrich lends quite a powerful presence to things in his Jack Nicholson-wannabe performance. Cameos from people like Henry Winkler to Linda Blair just serve to spice things up. Visually speaking, the white-masked, black-cloaked killer is startling and spooky in equal measures, and certainly one of the best-looking masked villains in movie history. Liberal use is made of blood and gore in some very-painful looking stabbings, while other weird deaths add to the fun.Yet the film really comes into its own during a party where HALLOWEEN plays on television. Randy, a character who himself is a horror movie addict, spells out the ""rules"" of the genre to his fellow party-goers and the audience at the same time, and the rest of the film is happy to break these ""rules"" as many times as possible. As well as all this, there are a few genuinely suspenseful stalking sequences and a delightful 'Grand Guignol' style finale which has blood spilling everywhere. All this serves to make SCREAM the undisputed king of the '90s slasher.",Scream
3,SnoopyStyle,Really smart horror,7,13 June 2014,"Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) is alone at home and receives crank calls from a creep. Ghostface ends up killing her boyfriend Steve and Casey. It's a great start reminiscent of Psycho where the obvious lead is killed off. This is a horror that knows the history of horror and references it.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is a virgin despite the efforts of boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). Sidney's mother had been killed a year earlier and she's alone with her father. Sidney put Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) in prison for the crime but he claims to be innocent. The next day, the sheriff with deputy Dewey (David Arquette) start interviewing the students. News reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is on the case. Sidney and Billy gather with Tatum (Rose McGowan), Stuart (Matthew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) to discuss the murders. Then Ghostface calls Sidney.There is no doubt that Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have come up with an interesting take on the slasher movie. It's not just about being more gruesome and bloodier. It's about being smarter. It's not the first one to be self-referencing. It is the one that built a movie around it. The teens are smart and aware. The beauty of this is that this movie is smart for a smart audience with smart characters. The only problem I have is the twisty nature of the reveals and the misdirections. There are quite a few of them and that part seems over-written. Of course, that is commented up by one of the characters and he's exactly right. The movie kind of lost me in that aspect.",Scream
4,Hitchcoc,More Than I Expected,8,25 March 2010,"I decided to see this because it has become a cultural icon. Having seen so many slasher movies, I decided long ago they just weren't very interesting. This is mainly because of the predictability that is presented in this film. Yes, that does make it gimmicky, but then it also makes it clever. Nothing is left out when it comes to violence. It's all there. Of course, there's about ten ""jump out"" scares and all the stereotypes. Still, it kept me going. There is layer upon layer of surprises and we actually do care somewhat about the people in the film. The mask must have been quite the thing when this first appeared. I still see them when I answer the door on Halloween. One nice thing is that, for the most part, now that I've seen all the classics of this form, and have seen this movie as well, I don't need to watch any more.",Scream
5,kosmasp,Scary Movie,8,16 October 2011,"Of course Scary Movie was the working title of this Wes Craven vehicle, which got hijacked by the Wayans to make their spoof of this (and other Horror movies of that time). Craven also had made the latest (til then that is) Nightmare movie, called ""New Nightmare"". It was the first one that got into the whole ""we are aware this is a movie, while we're doing it"", but wasn't as successful as the Scream movies became. Even though it was a success in America it did take almost a year to come out in Germany for example.And while the movie ""plays"" with rules and has fun with it, it is also pretty scary. Of course friends of mine didn't like the fact, that it tried to be funny and scary. Some people like their horror movies to be straight and not fourth-wall breaking. But this one is really a great example how to do it. It also helped Kevin Williamson to become famous (at least for awhile, he worked with Robert Rodriguez - Faculty) and Wes Craven to be ""hot"" once again.As you can see, I have not really written anything about the movie yet. I won't really tell you what it is about, but I will dare you to watch it, if you dig horror comedies. Hopefully before you watch the spoof that is called ""Scary Movie"" ...",Scream
6,Sleepin_Dragon,A legend is born.,10,31 July 2021,"A killer in a ghost mask starts a killing spree, a group of friends try their best to unmask the killer, and stop the bloodshed.My favourite 90's movie, this film managed to do what Halloween did twenty years previously, bring a genre to life. Many films followed this one, some were good, most were poor, none of them managed to pack the punch this one did, I know what you did last Summer being the best of the efforts.It's slick, stylish, sexy, it's iconic. Many years later I still get the same buzz watching this as I did watching it as new at sixteen.The ghost mask is iconic, this film is pretty much successful in every department, I can think of no fault or flaw.A great cast was assembled, no wonder Drew Barrymore was miffed at being written out after one single scene.There's something almost Agatha Christie about the plot, one by one the numbers dwindle, and the film's main objective, is to tell us whodunnit.Several follow ups followed, and a series, but none come close to this, the original, and best. It even inspired a spoof.A classic, watching this in the cinema felt special, to this day I regard it as a favourite film, 10/10.",Scream
7,classicsoncall,"""...it's like right out of a horror movie or something.""",7,13 June 2018,"Considering Drew Barrymore is top billed in the picture, she didn't last very long, did she? Maybe she had another gig that interfered and could only take a bit part. For it's genre, not a bad horror flick, though it does cater to a teenage and young adult audience. The picture reminded me that Courteney Cox and David Arquette were hooking up for real around this time or shortly after. I could never see the attraction between the two but what do I know? The picture has it's fair share of misdirection and has some fun referencing other horror flicks along with taking pot shots at itself for inferring that it's a movie in it's own right. Some of that was pretty clever but director Wes Craven probably over did it at a certain point. Still, there was enough clever stuff going on to keep one guessing about the real killer. If O.J. Simpson's murder case occurred after this movie came out he might have come up with a dual killer angle himself. If you think about it, the picture does it's best job by illustrating the absurd by being absurd. Case in point, I would refer to the dumbest line in the movie. After getting stabbed three times and going head over heels down the stairs, Billy (Skeet Ulrich) is asked by his girlfriend Sidney (Neve Campbell): ""Are you okay?""
Seriously?",Scream
8,gavin6942,Wes Craven's Phenomenal Comeback,8,21 May 2015,"A group of teens are pitted against a masked murderer that tests their knowledge of horror movies.Can we admit that Neve Campbell is a terrible actress? She managed to get in all four ""Scream"" films, and ""The Craft"", and ""Wild Things"" and ""Party of Five"". She was a dominant force of the 1990s. But really, just admit it, she was the Kristen Stewart of the 1990s -- very wooden, not much range, and considered more appealing by studio executives than by actual viewers.But that criticism aside, this is a great film, and definitely among Wes Craven's best. He has had his great films and his less-than-great films. Some, frankly, we might want to forget. But this was so powerful, really added some wit to the slasher film, and for that we must respect the man. Wes Craven is the all-time greatest horror director.",Scream
9,lee_eisenberg,"Oh, that Wes Craven!",10,30 September 2005,"By now, you've probably heard what ""Scream"" is about (or seen it). So, I'll just discuss a few aspects of it. It was filmed partly in Santa Rosa, California. Another movie filmed there was Alfred Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"", and ""Peanuts"" creator Charles Schulz lived there. What a trio! Also, who would have predicted that we'd see Fonzie get butchered?! Yep, Henry Winkler appears as the principal. But probably the best scene has the characters discussing the rules for surviving a slasher movie: 1) you can never have sex; 2) you can never drink or use drugs (an extension of #1); 3) the most important is that you can never say ""I'll be right back."" Overall, this is one cool movie. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette and the rest of the cast have a great time with the material.",Scream
10,jboothmillard,Scream,10,17 March 2005,"If you like scary movies, then you'll love this homage to them from director Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes (original), A Nightmare on Elm Street). It begins with the great opening with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) having a phone call from an unknown caller (voiced by Roger Jackson) that grips you with the words ""What's your favourite scary movie"", and of course ""I wanna know who I'm looking at"", and ends with her being gutted from the tree swing. Then it moves to the key story in the town of Woodsboro where young Sidney Precott (Neve Campbell) is. A year ago, in a day's time, her mother Maureen was raped and murdered, and after getting a call from the killer herself she is under close watch by her suspicious boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), news reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and young police Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette). It soon turns into a curfew as the cops search for the killer, ""Ghostface"", and the final scenes take place at a house party with more victims taken out, and deadly revelations. Also starring the humorous Jamie Kennedy as Randy, Liev Schreiber as a brief Cotton Weary, Henry Winkler as Principal Arthur Himbry and look out for The Exorcist's Linda Blair and Craven himself. What makes this a great horror film is not only the comedy elements, but the inter-textual references, i.e. the characters talking about horror films, and they are in one. To be honest, I only knew of and wanted to see it because I saw the spoof in Scary Movie before it, and turned out to be a brilliant horror comedy. It was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!",Scream
11,rmax304823,Retch.,5,15 May 2012,"I guess you could say that this is well done for what it is. The problem is that what it is, is disgusting garbage.Maybe that's a bit harsh. It has some redeeming qualities. There are, for instance, some wisecracks expressive of keen wit. ""Jesus, bring the camera!"" ""My name isn't Jesus."" (The old ones are the best, even if they creak a little at the joints.) Also, the pretty Neve Campbell gets to have sex and lose her virginity and yet she still survives the movie. This is an improvement over those slasher flicks in which only the whores gets disarticulated.Also, we can't NOT mention the parody of Edvard Munch's ""The Scream,"" which, for Munch, meant something other than laughs. In this movie, one or more maniacs rush around town ""gutting people"" and draping their bodies across various facilities. There are a lot of sexual jokes but no nudity. We can't have the teen-aged audience looking at bare bodies, although no one objects to watching them slaughter each other while bathed in blood.It's a self-conscious slasher movie, meaning that Kevin Williamson, the writer, had the bright idea of building a slasher movie filled with clichés around a group of school kids who know that they're in a slasher movie filled with clichés. Whether or not it was intended as self parody, that's how it turns out.The ending involves a couple of maniacs who have decided to follow the dictates of the typical slasher movie, and a hand full of relatively normal people. Every tactic that generates suspense is put to use. A woman gets her hands on a pistol, for instance, but when she tries to shoot the lunatics it doesn't work because the safety is on. The gun is whipped out of her hand and she is belted into unconsciousness, only to rise later, bloodier but smarter.You have never seen so much blood, so many murders, or heard so many screams. There's so much of it that it becomes desemanticized and after a while your involvement becomes more mechanical than emotional. You can't help hoping that Neve Campbell doesn't get the knife stuck through her neck, and that the deranged duo get their just desserts, but it doesn't go beyond wishing for a happy ending. Or any kind of ending at all.",Scream
12,Tweekums,Wes Craven's knowing slasher movie,8,8 November 2016,"As this film opens a teenager played by Drew Barrymore is alone at her home when the phone rings; at first it looks like a wrong number but the caller keeps calling and starts to threaten her. He starts asking her questions about well-known horror movies before we see the masked killer murdering her. The next day everybody at her school is talking about the murder; the film concentrates on Sidney Prescott, a girl whose mother was murdered a year previously; her boyfriend Billy Loomis; and their friends Tatum Riley and Stu Macher. It isn't long before the killer starts targeting Sidney; early suspicion falls on Billy but another attack while he is in police custody leads to his release. The friends talk about the events as though they are the plot to a horror movie like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' and somewhat inevitably the ongoing murders follow the 'rules' established by such films.By the time 'Scream' was released in 1996 it seemed that the slasher genre had long past its peak but this brought it back into vogue this time with a more knowing slant. The opening was a great hook; Drew Barrymore was well enough known for the viewer to assume that she was going to be playing the protagonist of course by now there can be few viewers don't know what happens to her; even so the opening is impressively scary. The way the film plays with the genre is a lot of fun as it turns clichés into 'rules'. There are plenty of possible suspects for the person behind the creepy mask including Sidney's friends and even her father who is meant to be away on business but can't be contacted; the eventually revelation includes a twist that I won't spoil. Throughout the film there are plenty of scares and a good sense of threat; there are also plenty of gruesome deaths. The cast is pretty good; especially Neve Campbell, as Sidney; Courteney Cox, as tabloid TV journalist Gal Weathers, and David Arquette, as out of his depth Deputy Dewey Riley. Overall this is a fine film if you are looking for plenty of scares, some decent laughs and plenty on knowing references to earlier horror films.",Scream
13,BA_Harrison,Post-modernism has never been so scary.,9,24 October 2009,"It's easy to become prejudiced against Scream: after all, it's the film that launched the career of Kevin Williamson, who has since been responsible for pathetic teen soap Dawson's Creek and rubbish werewolf pic Cursed, plus it provided the inspiration for countless dreadful imitators and the godawful Scary Movie slasher spoofs.But the fact is, when judged purely on its own merits, Scream proves to be excellent entertainment—an extremely well written and expertly directed horror that brilliantly integrates witty, post-modernist self parody with genuinely effective scares.An awesome opening sees arguably the film's biggest star, Drew Barrymore, being terrorised and brutally murdered by a killer wearing a mask fashioned after the famous Edvard Munch painting The Scream, after which director Wes Craven quickly introduces his main cast: Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, a virginal teen traumatised by the murder of her slutty mother a year earlier; Johnny Depp-alike Skeet Ulrich as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis; nipple-icious Rose McGowan, crazy Matthew Lillard, and nerdy Jamie Kennedy as close pals Tatum, Stuart and Randy; Courteney Cox as ambitious TV newswoman Gail Weathers; and David Arquette as dorky police deputy 'Dewey' Riley.Having established his array of characters, Craven then proceeds to scare the pants off his audience with a series of well orchestrated murders, interspersed by thrilling/amusing scenes in which people almost get murdered and wax lyrical about the 'rules of horror'. There's not a whole lot of gore to speak of, but the tension is kept high, and there's always the 'in-jokes' to keep viewers happy between kills.Along the way, Craven cleverly interweaves several plot threads, offers several possible candidates as the killer, and shows once again why he is a true 'Master of Horror'.",Scream
14,moonspinner55,Flabby and depressing comedic slasher flick,1,23 May 2004,"Fifth-rate screenplay about teenagers terrorized by an all-too-clever serial killer is rampant with unpleasantness and TV-movie styled craftsmanship. It is one of director Wes Craven's worst efforts, but of course he's laughing all the way to the bank at critics who fail to chuckle at such nihilistic and exploitive aspects (such as Drew Barrymore happily gutted like a fish and left hanging for all to see). Most of the acting is vacuous, and the cruddy color and clanging technical set-ups just reek of bad taste. It shows the filmmaker to be without much talent or joy for making movies, and yet it's all so smug and 'unreal'. * from ****",Scream
15,dbdumonteil,Wes Craven's magnum opus,9,13 May 2007,"With ""Scream"", Wes Craven who before this had left a chain of horror flicks gave to the horror genre one of its proudest kingpins and a valuable reference which gave a new lease of life to the slasher genre which thrived in the eighties. But also a film which involuntarily became an accursed one since it prompted many fragile teenagers to kill their families or friends dressed in the killer's outfit.Wes Craven exploits the indispensable ingredients pertaining to the serial killer story like a female teenager all alone in her house who is about to watch a horror flick and receives ominous phone calls or teenagers all gathered in a house watching horror flicks and they're all killed one after the other and the filmmaker follows the rules of the game while poring over them. During 110 minutes, Craven mixes the slasher movie and a studied reflection about the genre and its premises. Hence its indisputable strength. Flicks like the ""Freddy"" or ""Friday the 13th"" endless saga contributed to the fame of the genre and were based on rules that the viewer knows very well. Craven takes them again for himself to reveal the tricks of the trade and to dynamite the clichés. Thus it gives both a highly terrific and terrifying piece of work in which Craven involves the viewer at all levels. One should note down all the witty lines the film shelters and the black humor of a formidable efficiency which lacked in so called gore masterworks like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" (1978). I dig the ""test"" in the first sequence the killer asks to Drew Barrymore about horror flicks. Painstakingly built, full of ideas, nods or allusions to gore films which secured the popularity and the trademark of the slasher genre. Craven's film has also the ability to make us shiver and to be jubilant thanks to what has been said before and also thanks to a taut scenario in which the murders aren't only the worthwhile moments as it's often the case in many mediocre horror films. Craven also doesn't fear to delay sequences as much as he can to stretch terror and treat, notably the first one and all that happens in the big isolated house where the students party while very bad things occur near them.This is a film to cherish and to ponder about provided you have nerves of steel and if you keep in mind that it's just pure cinema. And one of the characters says: ""there has to be one or several sequels to a film of this kind"". It was judicious from Craven to have included this cue for there will be two sequels. But the pernicious charm that wraps ""Scream"" will be absent in its two heirs.",Scream
16,Quinoa1984,Like wine,9,10 July 2000,"Like wine, this horror film has grown better with age.  But to see if it is still fresh and delictable is to be seen.  If it is your first time watching this movie you will love the comedy and thrills.  If it is not, it might seem like something you've seen before.  Still, this is a good horror effort by Director Wes Craven (who gives one of his best films yet) in telling the story of a killer going after some teens, specifically Sydney Campbell (Neve Campbell is very convincing) who's mother was murdered exactly one year before the killings.  Very good, very chilling, very repetitive.  Drew Barrymore highlights this film in a overglamourous cameo as the first victim.  A",Scream

It is always one of the movies that comes to my mind when I think of classics from the 90's.The movie has a great cast, we know the names of most of the actors very well, It is even amazing how young they were. Courtney Cox was filming it while she was also doing Friends. Drew Barrymore was only 21. They all fit very well in their roles.It has some amazing scenes that are real classics. One is definitely the Drew Barrymore one in the beginning. The scene of Tatum is also memorable. And the scene at the end where it all becomes clear is great and pretty unique. The rest of the movie also keeps one on the edge.One thing that is also great about this movie is a bit of humor when they refer to other horror movies and make fun of the genre by mentioning horror movie ""rules"".

There is basically no other way to put it.It started off pretty well as 2 young teenagers are bludgeoned to death. The true horror was yet to come.The movie really goes down in quality once the bodies start to pile up as it becomes a mass murdering picture.No one is really exempt from this including the school principal Henry Winkler. Imagine, Henry Winkler as a school principal. He still uses a 4 letter word before he falls victim to the murderer as well.This film was supposed to be clever. The killer(s) are worse than out of their minds.

19,Coventry,Scream and scream again and again!,7,13 October 2009,"It's been more than a decade since I last watched ""Scream"" – probably right after it got released in theaters or something – and honestly have to admit I never was a big fan of this much-hyped blockbuster. To me personally (admittedly I was just an over-enthusiast horror fanatic who just started to find his way around the genre) it was simply a mockery against really unsettling movies and the one film that suddenly turned everyone into a horror buff overnight. Also, and maybe even most importantly, ""Scream"" was single-handedly responsible for a massive overload of inferior and sometimes even downright retarded knock-offs, imitations, zero-budgeted amateur trash slasher flicks. Suddenly and thanks to the simplistic concept of this movie, everyone considered him/herself capable of making a horror movie and sadly enough most of them even found ways of distribution as well. This was my personal blunt opinion on ""Scream"" more than ten years ago. By now, I still think it's a vastly overrated movie and definitely not the best horror film of the nineties (my vote for that either goes to ""Braindead"" or ""Candyman""), but my opinions regarding the actual film's quality surely have changed. ""Scream"", and particularly Kevin Williamson's screenplay, is very clever and witty in its observations on the contemporary teen pop culture and it covers a pretty impressive range of old horror trivia. Wes Craven, who in his career alternatively tackled some hits (""The Hills have Eyes"", ""Deadly Blessing"", ""Nightmare on Elm Streeet"") and some misses (""Shocker"", ""Vampire in Brooklyn"") was the ideal choice of director for a film that simultaneously spoofs and pays tribute to a popular film genre that thrives on clichés, stereotypes and gratuitous scares. Last but certainly not least, the actual story offers a handful of genuinely uncanny moments as well as some neat unpredictable twists. Simply the opening sequence starring Drew Barrymore already – which I suppose everybody knows about by now – is enough indication that anything can happen to any disposable character in this film. The premise is rudimentary and ancient, with a spooky masked killer terrorizing a small high school and particularly one girl whose mum got massacred one year earlier, but that's all there is necessary. Good performances, tight direction, classy photography, dazzling soundtrack and a truckload of nauseating murder set pieces do the rest. Recommended for all type of horror-appreciating audiences.",Scream

22,hitchcockthelegend,Say a prayer for the youth of America.,9,15 October 2009,"Sidney Prescott becomes the next target of a maniacal killer who has already killed two kids from her school. As tabloid babe Gale Weathers gets involved, and starts to dig deeper, it becomes apparent that the killer may be connected to the man who raped and killed Sidney's mother. Could it be that the wrong man is in in prison for the crime? If so? Just who is responsible for this new rein of terror?Scream opens with what has now become 10/12 minutes of classic horror folklore, where director Wes Carpenter sets out the marker for the reinvigoration of the genre synonymous with his name. What follows is a full blooded exciting picture that is laced with genre references and bona fide pinging humour. Teaming up with hipster screenwriter Kevin Williamson, Craven has assembled a roll call of stock teen-slasher characters, filled the roles out with a cast list reading like the young, pretty and the restless, and embraced the genre he loves while also subverting it. Clever clever stuff indeed.Retaining its ""mystery who done it"" core throughout, red herrings and misdirections come and go, Scream is also a truly scary {and violent} picture. As it makes the knowing genre faithful laugh, it also makes them jump, squirm and shout at the screen. Particularly during the last, excellently constructed quarter when the terror ups on poor Sidney and the reveal induces cries of ""what the hell"". Subsequent revisits to Scream has you spotting all the little pointers in the story that you missed on the first viewing, but even knowing the reveal fails to dim Scream's lasting appeal. Also of note is that the cast get a chance to act, something that is a rarity in the sub-genre that Scream is the flag bearer for. Neve Campbell, Jamie Kennedy and Courtney Cox benefiting the most from the sly and adroitly written script. Craven's film spawned two sequels, the first is equally dazzling and watchable, the second not so. While it was also responsible for a cascade of imitators and comedy spoofs that would follow. None however have captured the essence, the nous or the style of Scream. It remains the daddy and the bench mark in an often maligned and rarely realised teen-slasher genre. 9/10",Scream
23,preppy-3,A horror classic,10,19 October 2014,"A maniac is killing off teenagers in the small town of Woodsboro. A bunch of teens (among them Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard) try to figure out who's doing it and why. Meanwhile reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is trying to get the story from the town deputy (David Arquette).This came out in winter 1996. By then horror films were all but dead. However this one was a big hit with critics and audiences and started off a new wave of horror films. Why? Because it has a clever script with MANY references to older horror films; established the rules on how to survive a horror film; had smart, intelligent and likable teenagers and basically played with the genre and reinvented it. Also there is a good sense of humor in this but there's also some very graphic gore (especially at the end). This got an NC-17 from the ratings board until director Wes Craven agreed to tone down on the violence. The acting is good all around, it moves at a fast pace and I was constantly entertained by it. Also the opening 15 minutes with Drew Barrymore is terrifying. The only debit is Lillard. He overacts to a downright embarrassing degree and gets very annoying...especially at the end. Still, him aside, this is a great horror film. Highly recommended.",Scream
24,LeonLouisRicci,Overrated Overacted Overwritten,6,12 January 2014,"The Contrast between the Male Teens and the Female Teens in this Movie is as Obvious as the rather Clunky Horror Movie References. All the Girls in the Movie are Drop Dead Gorgeous and all the Dudes are Ugly, Irritating, or both.Pointing out two from each Gender should make the Point and You can Discover the others on Your own. Because You are going to watch or have already watched this famous Movie that, in no Particular Order...Spawned Sequels that are up to 4 led to numerous Imitators, Rejuvenate the tired Slasher Genre, Blah, Blah, Blah.Oh Yea, the Character's contrast, or is it ""Actors"". Well, there is Cute as a paper cut, Neve Campbell with those Freckles and whispery, Sexy Voice and Rose Mcgowan, Wow. Then there's the Boys. Stu, who Contorts His face, sticks out His tongue, and way Overacts in every scene to the point of ""Fingernails On the Blackboard"" Overacting. The Geeky Guy who is the ""Expert"", tries to out Mug Stu by doing a Jerry Lewis imitation, but no need, He Mugs just fine on His own.But Enough of that. The Film is Highly Overrated. It is Shot with a pristine Fondness and Looks Great, but the Script, what a Letdown. One could guess that about half of the Fanboys who watch this type of Stuff could have come up with so much Better. But Their too Content to lap this up and give it a ""He's talking to Me"", as Craven and Company Stroke Their Egos.Overall, it is a Very Good Movie, but Hardly Great Cinema. It is more Mad Magazine than National Lampoon. No need to point out that Mad outsold Lampoon by about a Trillion to One.",Scream
25,poolandrews,"""So, how does it feel to be almost brutally butchered?"" A classic already.",8,3 September 2005,"Scream starts with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) receiving a phone call which she puts down to a wrong number, however the caller keeps ringing her back each time becoming increasingly hostile & threatening. It's not long before Casey finds out that her boyfriend Steven Orth (Kevin Patrick Walls) has been gutted & she is next... The news of the double murder quickly spreads through the small American town of Woodsboro as Sheriff Burke (Joseph Whipp) concentrates his investigations at the local high school questioning all the pupils, including Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) whose Mother was brutally raped & murdered a year earlier. Later that night as Sidney waits for her friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) to pick her up she too receives a phone call from the ghost masked killer & is attacked but her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) conveniently shows up just in time. Reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) sense a big story & starts to hassle Sidney while Tatum's Brother Deputy 'Dewey' (David Arquette) takes it upon himself to look out for Sidney. As the mystery deepens with Sidney's Father going missing & Sidney unsure of who to trust Tatum's boyfriend Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard) organises a party with lots of potential teenage victims for the serial killer...Directed by Wes Craven who also has a small cameo as the Freddy Krueger inspired janitor, Scream is the horror film that made the genre popular again, the film which so many have tried to copy since. A fine film it is too. The script by Kevin Williamson plays around with all the slasher film clichés in a witty self referential sort of way. Scream is bursting at the seams with all the horror film in-jokes & homages, most people could probably watch Scream two or three times & still not spot them all. Like the horror film lover character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who knows all the traditional slasher rules & plays them to the hilt like if your a virgin in a horror film you die. The dialogue also pokes fun at the genre in an affectionate way like when the killer mentions going outside by oneself to investigate a strange noise as being stupid! It's great fun for horror fans, like myself, to try & spot all the references & mentions other classic horrors get. I thought the mystery element was great, Scream has plenty of red herrings & I was never sure who the killer was right up until the final effective reveal which is quite clever although the motive behind the murders is somewhat shallow & hardly surprising. I thought Scream dragged a little from after Casey was murdered for the next 40 odd minutes as no one dies at all, this witty & hip dialogue is all well & good to entertain up to a point but I would have liked a little more action as well. Technically Scream is as good as one could hope for on a relatively small $15,000,000 budget, director Craven creates some good set pieces & effective sequences especially the opening, the cinematography is very good, the music incorporates horror themes into itself particularly Halloween (1978) & as a whole Scream has that Hollywood polish about it. The violence & gore is restrained, a few stabbings & shootings plus Steven's guts spilling out at the start is about it, a little disappointing actually. The young attractive cast do a good job, Campbell makes for a likable enough 'scream queen' for the 90's & Ulrich is great & has a cold emotionless look on occasion that coupled with is boyish good looks you are never quite sure if he's telling the truth or not, Arquette makes for a suitably goofy deputy & Cox is perfectly cast as the bitchy reporter, in reality after meeting each other on Scream Arquette & Cox later married. The sequel Sream 2 (1997) reunites all the surviving cast members & is also well worth watching if you enjoyed this. Overall Scream is a great horror film that has to some extent reinvented the genre & just about deserves it's already classic status although I have slight reservations about it's slow pace at times which is my only complaint with it as a whole. An absolute must for horror fans & definitely worth a watch for more general audiences too although some of the horror film humour may pass you by. Still, highly recommend!",Scream

27,Boba_Fett1138,The slasher reborn.,9,14 April 2011,"It's quite amazing how this one movie marked the rebirth of the slasher genre and how it redefined it and set the standards for basically all later genre movies.Foremost thing ""Scream"" does extremely well is that it's actually sort of making fun of its own genre and acknowledges all of its genre rules and clichés but yet the movie really is not a parody of the genre. You could even call it an homage to the golden era of the slasher genre, during the beginning of the '80's. But actually the movie is also being still much more than that. It's a really good genre movie on its own, that plays by the rules and does everything absolutely right. No big surprises, since it had genre expert Wes Craven at the helm, even though he in the last years probably had more misses than hits during his career. But he still is someone that is really at home within the genre and understand what's needed to make a great movie. He already did this lots of times successfully in the past, of which the first and original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is the best and also best known example.It already gets obvious from the opening sequence on that this is going to be a great genre movie. Also everything that comes after that does not disappointed and ""Scream"" manages to be a great genre movie throughout, from start to finish. It constantly build up some good tension and the movie actually does also still surprises a lot. You really never know who will get killed next or how and the movie also is being a whodunit, which also really adds to the mystery and tension of the movie. The movie constantly drops hints throughout the movie and manages to make lots of the characters seem out as potential suspects. It makes the surprises of the movie also really stand out but even when you have already seen this movie a couple of times and know who the killer(s) is, this still remains such a great movie to watch. Out of all the classic genre movies, this is the one that I know by heart, so that also should say something about the quality of it and its re-watchable value.You also just know that this movie is a classic when the look of its killer has already become an horror icon, in such a short period. Every knows Jason's hockey-mask and Michael Myers his white mask but everybody also knows Ghostface, from the Scream movies. It's the mark of not just a great killer and villain but also that of a great movie. The mask (obviously based on Edvard Munch's painting 'the scream') actually a really popular object and got sold all over the world. And yes, even I still own one.But also all of the other characters are really good ones and cast extremely well. Normally teenagers in an horror and slasher film in particular are being extremely annoying and perfect looking sexy characters, you just never really feel for. But most characters in this movie are really been given some depth and are being made very distinctive with all of their various personalities. It makes them interesting and someone you can easily relate with and feel for. And like I said, everyone also got casted really well and everyone within this movie seems to suit their role, as if it got written just for them, so this also obviously helps the movie. The actors also really seem to feel this way, since they keep popping up in all of its sequels, while in other genre sequels you often see most big name and semi big name actors drop out after one sequel already. Even Liev Schreiber, who has like a 5 seconds role in this movie.If you have to say something negative about this movie it would be that it made the slasher genre and also just horror genre in particular extremely popular again, with as a result lots of bad and mediocre. new slashers and remakes of classics got made but till this date still none of them ever in any way comes remotely close to the level of excellence of this movie. After the huge success of this movie they of course quickly made some cash-in sequels. But this year part 4 of the series gets released, 11 years after the previous entry. It means that they really took their time this time to come up with something good and original again and it actually seems ""Scream 4"", also directed by Wes Craven again, as all sequels were, will be a good movie, since it's already getting some real positive buzz and reviews.We'll see how it turns out but for now ""Scream"" still remains the best slasher since the first and original John Carpenter movie ""Halloween"".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scream

With Scream, it was rejuvenated somewhat(at least for a few years), whether that was the intent or not. Love or hate that it had that effect... a respectful parody is such a rarity that it really ought to be commended, even if one doesn't care for the genre(which is not to say that I don't, I may have only seen a few of the older ones, but I do seek out these films). This is half-way a parody of aforementioned sub-genre of horror, and equal parts an entry into it. The clichés are all here, intentionally so, and the film manages to entertain with both halves, and these mesh remarkably and admirably well. The nods, both the obvious and the subtle ones, are all good. The casting is impeccable. The music, both the score and the songs used, all top-notch. The acting is spot-on. The direction is excellent... character introduction, building of suspense, plot exposition and development, high marks, all the way. The script is well-done. The gore isn't as bad as it could be, not sure I'd really call it excessive, but the amount of blood is massive(necessary for the spoofing). I've yet to see a recent movie of this kind which surpasses this one. Now, I'm surely not the first to point this out, but... why, exactly, were two full-on spoofs done after this, mainly using this for inspiration? Never mind that neither are that good, and that that they hold no respect of the films they make fun of, but why do a send-up of a parody? Wayans', come on, you can do... uh... well, still, don't do it again. ""Shriek"" team... well, you guys I don't know. But I digress. Frequently. I recommend this to any fan of parodies, horror films, and this particular kind of, well, both. 8/10",Scream
30,view_and_review,Much Needed Horror Movie,7,6 October 2020,"""Scream"" came along at a much needed time in Hollywood. The horror movie genre was reeling. Franchises such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm St.,"" and ""Child's Play"" had run their course. They were big in the 80's, but nothing had replaced them. ""Scream"" was the horror movie that made fun of horror movies. They openly talked about scary movie rules while breaking them.In the opening scene Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) gets harassing phone calls much like the movies ""When a Stranger Calls"" or ""Black Christmas"" (1974). It's not long before she and her boyfriend are gutted corpses.The movie takes place in the city of Woodsboro, CA and it centers around highschooler Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). She has a boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), who wants to go all they way, but she is reluctant due to how her mother died. When she's targeted by The Scream mask wearing killer the whole town goes on lockdown. This killer is very active and everywhere at once.As much as ""Scream"" set itself apart, it did fall into some of the cliches it ridiculed. The main cliche was the killers, Billy and Stuart (Matthew Lillard) revealing their grand scheme before killing Sidney. Not only did they reveal their whole plan, but they wounded themselves before killing her which obviously made them less potent as killers. That was all enough to give Sidney the time needed to turn the tables on the killers; which she did.That glaring cliche withstanding, ""Scream"" was a good movie.",Scream

The characters are written into an ominous slasher atmosphere only they know the rules to horror films. Students are shocked at the news of two grisly murders. Neve Campbell stars as Sidney whose mother was murdered the year before. She is placed under police protection after an attack in which her boyfriend is arrested. Very clever with everyone looking guilty yet the film relies too much on graphic violence. Wes Craven directs with skill and insight using the creative impulses that worked well on A Nightmare On Elm Street. Neve Campbell delivers a strong performance as a teenager targeted for murder and not sure who is friend or foe although her discoveries in the third act deliver a great plot twist. Courtney Cox as reporter Gale Weathers arrives on the scene only to be punched in the face by Sidney. She further investigates until the over the top violence in the third act surface. Skeet Ulrich is the accused boyfriend struggling to reconnect with Sidney. Matthew Lillard plays a horror fanatic in what is a pivotal role. Drew Barrymore makes an effective cameo in the film's opening. Intriguing look at unhealthy media influence and the disruption of an unstable mind. Score: 8 / 10",Scream
32,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Thoroughly overrated, watchable slasher non-parody",8,17 January 2013,"Realizing they're being targeted by a vicious killer that seems to know the rules and conventions of Horror films, a teen and her friends try to stay one-step-ahead of the masked psychopath that seems to have ulterior motives for the rampage.This here is a pretty overrated but still enjoyable enough entry. One of the biggest issues here is the fact that, despite initially being targeted to be a commentary on the clichéd nature of horror, Slasher films in general, it seems to be more about offering a chance to utilize those clichés rather than poke fun at them. Far too often it expends a great deal of time to warn about a particular situation familiar in horror, such as running up the stairs to escape the killer or that he's not dead at all and comes back for one more scare despite being the subject of inhuman torture, then decides to play off a sequence that allows for such a moment to transpire. As well, many of the claims about this being funny are incredibly inaccurate as there's absolutely nothing in here that's really funny material, and the stuff that's here which is being called funny is reprehensible, deplorable and quite a stretch for anyone to call funny stuff. As such, it's the shining example that a reputation is far more damaging to a film than anything. That said, it does have some good stuff in some particularly chilling chases and stalking scenes including the rousing opening, some incredibly brutal, gory deaths and some fine moments of real suspense that are far more developed than expected. Overall, though, it's a victim of it's false-reputation and can't overcome that.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, underage drug use and drinking and continuous sexual dialog.",Scream
33,Wuchakk,Strange parody/horror mix with obnoxious characters,4,11 November 2015,"Released in 1996, Wes Craven's ""Scream"" chronicles the murders of various people linked to a high school in a California town by someone dressed in a ghost-face Halloween costume. Neve Campbell plays the protagonist, Rose McGowan her best friend, Skeet Ulrich her boyfriend, Matthew Lillard his best friend, David Arquette the deputy, Courteney Cox an annoying reporter, Joseph Whipp the sheriff and Jamie Kennedy a dude that works at a video store.People keep hailing ""Scream"" as some kind of stand-out slasher flick, but it's not IMHO. It tries to walk the balance beam between serious slasher and amusing parody, which creates an odd vibe throughout. At no time was I able to buy what was going on as reality. The camp and contrivances kept screaming ""This is all a joke,"" like Henry Winkler's weird principal. As such, the movie's never scary despite some shocking elements and gore.Another negative is the host of unlikable, obnoxious or annoying characters. Campbell is serviceable as the heroine and McGowan is awesome just because she's so alluring. Drew Barrymore is also good, but her presence is limited to a glorified cameo in the prologue. I realize that the rest of the characters are so distasteful because this is a whodunit and most of them are potential suspects, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they make for an unpleasant viewing experience. Before you say, ""But this is a horror flick and therefore it's supposed to be unpleasant,"" I get that; I'm talking about how most of the main characters are so repugnant it's impossible to care about them. Let 'em all get slashed to death for all I care, lol. Then there's the ridiculously over-the-top last act, which is so contrived, cartoony and drenched in fake blood you'll just roll your eyes in disbelief. All this is compounded by the clumsy and weak killer, which I suppose makes sense when you later discover who the killer is.Thankfully, there's some good beyond the three girls noted above (especially McGowan, who's a pleasure to watch), like the numerous references to horror flick lore and the whodunit factor, but none of these redeem it from being a joke of a slasher. It's worth seeing if you like slasher movies, if for no other reason than to see if it matches the over-hype, but you'll probably be disappointed because of the disagreeable characters and the odd horror/parody fusion, not to mention the cartooniness and contrivances.The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in Santa Rosa, Tomales, Glen Ellen, Healdsburg and Sonoma, California.GRADE: C-",Scream
34,trashgang,the flick that started a new era,9,13 September 2016,"For years horror was a not done in Hollywood until this flick suddenly hit the screen. Why it started a new era was rather simple. Wes Craven, the director was done with all those horrors full with CGI and almost no gore. After the end in the mid eighties of the slashers it was time to go back and restart it he thought so Scream came out full of red stuff and gory moments.What also did work was the fact that it was full of questions towards the old school horror. The killer on the phone did ask who was the killer in certain flicks so horror buffs did like the trivia throughout Scream. But it just all fits together, the acting, the story, the gore, the killings. Wes Craven was back and how. Suddenly horror was back on the list in Hollywood and even as Scream created a franchise it also spawned a lot of new horror flicks until this writing. Horror was back and made money, even today.A must see for all geeks out there because it's full of horror and not that much of blah blah like we've seen in the I Know franchise.

35,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Scream (DVD 1996),8,18 December 2005,"It actually took me 9 years to finally watch this slasher flick classic, and I'm now kicking my rear that I should've watched it when it premiered in local theatres back then. Credited as sparking off a slew of copycat slasher films in the late 90s, and reintroducing Wes Craven to a whole new generation, Scream will remain an important milestone for the horror-slasher genre.Starring a relatively young and unknown (then) cast, Drew Barrymore opens in what is probably the most recognizable start to a horror movie, with her demise after being caught in a cat-and-mouse telephone call with the primary killer in the movie, a psychopath who dons the Halloween ""Scream"" costume.That famous opening aside, Neve Campbell plays the main lead Sydney, a student who's now the new target of the killer. Given her complicated background of having her mom killed about a year ago, she is spooked by the fact that she could have sentenced the wrong killer to prison, and the real one is still out there, stalking her.As with slasher movies, her group of friends become suspects and cannon fodder for the killer. What works is that although the cast is huge, and almost everyone is a suspect! The film doesn't let off throwing at you the red herrings, making you wonder what could be, and if it is.Looking at the film, the killer is not the invulnerable being that always gets his prey. Here, he does get hit and attacked, which adds a totally new, believable dimension towards the instinct for survival. Also, there are tons of movie references which will keep every movie buff totally happy and jumping with glee at identifying them. I'd like the part where one of the characters laid down the 3 rules of horror films: Never have sex because only virgins survive, never smoke or drink, and never say ""I'll be back"", because you won't. Sort of summarizes every horror movie out there, doesn't it? And the ending totally rocks. The script is intelligent (for a horror-slasher movie), and will catch you off guard, if you haven't been reading anything to spoil the movie, after 9 long years.Sadly, this Code 3 DVD contains no extras besides the norm of scene selection and subtitles. Pity.",Scream
36,Mr-Fusion,Shockingly obnoxious,5,4 August 2017,"I've gotta plead ignorance on ""Scream""; I didn't get it. It started with that Drew Barrymore opening, the stuff of icons; it was after all the centerpiece of the marketing, the movies lasting image, and what all the girls in math class were raving about in '96 (even I remember that). But my god, is it grating.And things never improve from there. The horror clichés are the point, but these characters are just there to rattle off references. With Craven at the helm and a veritable who's who cast, this was no lightweight movie. But even at an age where I get the horror movie callbacks, this did nothing for me.5/10",Scream
37,christopher-underwood,intelligent and knowing without trying to be too clever,8,26 March 2021,"Hadn't seen this for a long while, probably not since seeing it upon its theatrical release and found it stands up well. It is intelligent and knowing without trying to be too clever and manages to work as a love letter to horror films whilst poking a little fun and having a laugh as well. The opening sequence, thanks very much in part to Drew Barrymore, is a gem and sets the tone by mixes gross and gory horror with a light touch and plenty of suspenseful elements and nods to the genre. Neve Campbell was an inspired choice and she manages to convey a fine mix of vulnerability and feisty action. I think maybe Courtney Cox overdoes it a bit but she may well be intentionally annoying and if the ending seems rather drawn out thats nothing to adding at least three more sequels and numerous imitators. So Wes Craven must have done something right and just might be his best film, although I feel myself needing to duck for cover as I write the words.",Scream
38,StevePulaski,Still holds up on it's wit and scares,8,8 April 2011,"I would like to point out that the version of Scream I watched was the ""Director's Cut"" of the film. To my knowledge, it hasn't been released on DVD to this date. I bought it at Comic Con about a year ago for $5 since I bought a complete series of a show that was around $30. I got $10 off. Some would like to know what the differences are from the theatrical cut to the director's cut. Thanks to the DVD cover that says what the film has different from the original I can say.Here is what it says word for word; ""The Director's Cut version includes additional GORE!! Close up of Steve's intestines as they fall from his stomach. Casey as she hangs from the tree at normal speed. Longer scene of Tatum's head being crushed by the garage door. Kenny looking up at the killer after his throat is cut. Billy going berserk as he stabs Stuart. Stuart's hand dripping blood into a puddle (after the double stab)."" I wouldn't go nuts looking for the a bootleg copy on Ebay or iOffer. The director's cut maintains the same one hundred and eleven minute runtime and the shots are quick seconds shots that are hardly noticeable. Though I will say the close up of the intestines was one of the many great things on the disc.But what can you say about Scream? It's one of the defining horror films of the nineties. It pokes fun at the clichés in horror films and even goes as far as almost mocking them. Director Wes Craven knew what he was doing precisely when making Scream. He wanted the characters to be extremely self aware they were in a horror film and make them reference other eighties classics.In the eighties, slasher films got their break. So many horror movies made by so many defunct companies were released at hyper speed. Literally one every weekend. Some like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street went on to be the poster children of the genre. While others like Don't Answer the Phone, Happy Birthday to Me, and Maniac chilled on the sidelines to get recognized years later by cult fans of the genre.I'm not going to take time explaining the plot because I feel it's unnecessary. Many have seen it and a synopsis isn't really vital. I have a lot to say about this and don't need to extend a review with a plot most people would know. Is that okay? Scream now or forever hold your pieces.Scream knows when to be scary and went to be witty. Frequent references to Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street (another Craven film) are made sporadically. The references never feel forced and are easy to catch.Once more the film followed with sequels which makes some sort of sense. The film runs for only an hour and fifty one minutes. There is so much more that could be incorporated. Wes Craven went on direct all three (and the upcoming forth film) so decreasing in quality doesn't sound like something that will happen. I hope not at least.Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Matthew Lillard are all great and it's no doubt why this film sort of formed all of their great careers. It's a thrill that Campbell, Arquette, and Cox will be returning in Scream 4 making me sort of an easy sale.I look forward to watching the sequels at the same time I'm not. I sort of know I'll like them, but they will most likely lack in quality when compared to the first film. It hit hard when it first came out. Lets hope the sequels continue to refresh and keep the formula alive.Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Roger L. Jackson, and Drew Barrymore. Directed by: Wes Craven.",Scream

41,KineticSeoul,Original classic horror/slasher flick from the 90's,8,16 April 2011,"This is a pretty thrilling slasher movie, that was a big hit in the 90's. And for the most part I can understand why, the movie isn't like other slasher at that time. And adds a lot of quick exchange of dialogue and the direction was more entertaining than watching just one person die after another. Well it does happen, but it adds elements that make it more entertaining to watch. Which makes Ghostface, one of the new slasher icon of the 90's. Yeah the characters in this movie is pretty stupid for the most part and the character actions don't make much sense sometimes. So basically this movie has slasher movie elements, but the movie makes references to those slasher movies and adds other sharp elements sometimes. And even if the movies comes off as a bit silly at times, it still has some tension and other aspects that manages to make this film from being another generic slasher flick. It will even make some audiences make them shout or think ""the killer is right behind you!"" and such. Another aspect I liked is how most of the characters didn't just seem like cardboard just waiting to get killed, they actually stood out for the most part. Overall this movie was pretty original for it's time for a slasher flick and doesn't rely on huge amount of blood and gore for scares or to get the audience to be entertained. One of the main flaw that stood out was how it bashes on other past horror flicks and insulting characters from those movies, but the movie itself has similar flaws.

42,OllieSuave-007,The movie that defines a slasher film.,7,7 March 2014,"This is the movie that defines a slasher film, where a serial killers dressed in black with a ghost-face mask stalks teenager Sidney (Neve Campbell) one year after the death of her mother. Soon, Sidney's classmates begin to fall victim to the slasher, and Sidney must find out with the killer is and if these incidents have anything connected with her mother's death.Filmed in a high school setting, the actors did provide a believable and serious performance nonetheless, providing enough drama and suspense to make the horror film watchable. The scenes with the killer's voice over the phone, the killer chasing the victims and the victims hiding and trying to escape from the unseen killer will send chills down your spine and cover your ears to prevent you from being creeped out at those jumping-out-at-you moments.Campbell's character was overly dramatic at times and appeared too angry at the role; Drew Barrymorre would have made a better lead actor, but her smaller role in the movie was memorable to say the least. Overall, not a bad horror film.Grade B-",Scream
43,thesar-2,I'll be right back!,8,22 October 2009,"Rule number one: If you have not watched any of the 'Scary Movie' or 'Scream' series, watch 'Scream' first. Rule number two: Watch 'Scream 2' and maybe even 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' then you may safely move onto 'Scary Movie.' I've seen 'Scream' multiple times, but 'Scary Movie' ('Scream's spoof) many more times. It's hard not to laugh throughout this viewing of 'Scream' remembering the hilarious scene-by-scene, line-by-line mock-ups in 'Scary Movie.' That being said, I do remember my first reaction to this movie 13 years ago at its premiere. What a fantastic movie and though it's an homage to previous slasher films (there has to be six dozen references, names, scenes, innuendos in 'Scream') it really reinvented the genre, leading itself into multiple and extremely poor quality rip-offs. In fact, as this brought back the slasher horror and gave it more intelligence, it also brought it back crashing down, harder than before with the horrid carbon copies following. The movie starts with a bang, and the horror references begin early. You think you're watching a Drew Barrymore film, but quickly it shifts to main character Sidney and her group of friends who get picked off one-by-one while everyone's a suspect. Director Craven (loved him as the janitor) has definitely hits/misses (even see part 3 of this series) but his two most influential films – of my generation, that is – is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Scream.' While this one's not perfect, it's a real gem, with great comedy, homage, great acting, horror; 'Scream' was an excellent balance of all the right elements to horror-comedy and a perfect teen-night-out. Sure, it's now dated, and teens now probably need a little more (thanks, 'Saw' and other torture porn) but anyone growing up in the genre should appreciate this.",Scream
44,sol-kay,We all go a little mad sometimes,7,4 May 2010,"***SPOILERS*** Director Wes Cravens, who plays Fred the janitor at Woodsboro High School, craven attempt to make the ultimate teenage slasher film hits the bullseye with his 1996 smash hit ""Scream"" that has all the elements of every slasher movie known to man, or the movie audience, in it.Played along the lines of the 1978 horror thriller ""Halloween"" which is seen on TV all throughout the movie ""Scream"" has this masked psycho tearing up all of Woodsboro in pursuit of Sidney Prescott who for some reason he has it in for. The cues to the psychos maniacal hatred towards Sidney are many with the most obvious being that her deceased mom was up to something no good when she was brutally murdered a year ago. But as the movie goes on it becomes evident that all the movie, and Wes Craven, is trying to do is out do every teenage slasher film that proceeded it and does an excellent, and gory, job in doing it.We have such a diverse cast from a wild eyed Linda Blair paying an obnoxious and shrieking reporter as well as Henry ' The Fonz"" Winkler as the strict disciplinarian principle Arthur Himbry, of Woodsboro High. It's in fact principle Himbry, together with about two dozen other Woodboro residents, who ends up being one of the Psycho's many victims in the movie. Himbry is attacked murdered as well as, thank God off screen, gutted and hung from the high school's football goalpost for sticking his nose where it shouldn't belong! The psycho killers business! The killing goes on at such a fast pace that you eventually don't seem to care anymore for those who get offed by the masked psycho in that they, like in almost every other teenage slasher films, are made to look, by their wild sex and drug parties, like they more then deserve what's coming to them.The ending sequence that takes some 15 minutes is so off the wall and ridicules that by then you get the feeling that you've been had by Director Wes Craven's attempt to out do the teenage slasher genre to the point where the film, despite the massive blood letting in it, is more of a comedy then a horror movie. All you have to really do in finding out who's to be killed or not to be killed in the film is to see who's either naughty, besides the psycho killer, or nice in it. With those being naughty, fooling around and getting high on booze or drugs, making up almost 98% of the, movie's cast members!",Scream

46,lost-in-limbo,Let's have a joke on horror's behalf.,7,2 May 2006,"Sidney Prescott is a high school girl still coming to terms of her mother's murder over a year ago. But things get worst in Woodsboro when a couple of high school students are knocked off and even more so for Sid when a masked killer who loves their scary movies sets their sights on her with some threatening phone calls. Sidney survives the first attempt at her life with the police deciding to keep an eye on her and looking at the many possible suspects. Which range from her out-of-town father to her sex depraved boyfriend. Also the media circus has arrived, led Gail Weathers, which she and Sid don't have too much of a good relationship.The horror boom of the mid 90s is thanks largely to Craven's memorably, refreshing, but post-modern slasher flick ""Scream"". I notice this film really divides the horror fans. People either loathe it or like it, well I fit in the latter half. I'm a fan of the flick since it added something new to the dying sub-genre. Although, most of it imitators were painful, but ""Scream"" is miles ahead of those inferior rehashes. What sets it out from most of the artificial slashers is that it's exciting and it has brains. Kevin Williamson's cerebral script parodies the whole slasher set-up remarkably well in a self-aware attitude by exploring the rules that flood these type of films. The way he works in the inventive twists around the usual horror devices only enhances the film's originality and engrossing interplay. While, the gallant script might be cluttered with plenty of in-jokes and horror references. The character's also come to the party with rich details and strong persona's that seem real, which makes you really wanna see them get through. Humour wise it hits it off, but that's not discarding the highly suspenseful thrills. Like that of the well-staged opening that actually frightens and horrifies. Craven not only delivers some hacked up teens, but just like in he did in his ""New Nightmare (1994)"" film he plays around with plenty of horror techniques and themes in such a convincing fashion that it's unpredictably intense. Clues and hints are displayed with flair and the alarming amount of red herrings make the mystery even more enjoyable. The characters just seem more rational in their actions since they themselves know the vital rules of slasher flicks, which gives the film more of an urgency and this makes it harder to figure just who'll get out and who will not. The actors on board all put in solid performances with some being more exceptional than others, but at least there was a dynamic chemistry between them all. Neve Campbell nails down her role as the emotional wreak Sidney Prescott. Courtney Cox goes against the grain as the venomous TV reporter Gail Weathers. David Arquette manages to raise some chuckles as the dopey Deputy Dewey. But more so the buoyant Jamie Kennedy gets the laughs with the most interesting character - the horror movie geek Randy Meeks. Mathew Lillard generates a lot fun, Skeet Ulrich is perfect as the shady boyfriend and Rose McGowan gives the film the bite with her cunning remarks. There's also some small amusing roles from Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler. If you looking for some blood you shouldn't be disappointed as there's a fine build up and a good quota of it. Working with that element is the fitting sound effects which are crisply effective, like that of the knife swishing through the air. An atmospherically, suspenseful score by Marco Beltrami pierces the flick and the mellow soundtrack is rather well assembled in depicting the mood. Especially that of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' haunting tune ""Red Right Hand"". Another factor to set itself out was that of Mark Irwin's well displayed camera-work that lifted off the screen with many prominent shots. Craven keeps it fast moving and Williamson's script makes sure that it delivers a successful outing that works to it's strengths with flying colours.""Scream"" is a nice gruesome mix of irony and violence that started up the craze for mainstream horror again and turned horror conventions upside down.",Scream
47,Robert_duder,The brilliant second coming of the slasher flicks,8,9 April 2010,"There is no doubt that Wes Craven's Scream gave a solid re-birth to the slasher genre. In an age when Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels had left even the most avid fans like myself kind of drained Scream came along and somehow added its own special twist. Sure it had a lot of the same ingredients but instead it took to poking fun of the generic slasher while still creating a very real one and leaving the pieces everyone loved in tact. Another thing Scream does is that it adds a human element to the horror slasher genre. The killer isn't supernatural in any way and is in fact a serial killer with a motive, and a mystery to be unraveled with a ""everybody's a suspect"" type game being played. Despite the lack of supernatural ""Ghostface"" easily became synonymous with other legendary hacker greats. Scream also doesn't particularly go out of its way to showcase unique and strange deaths like say Friday the 13th where there has been so many that they need to have smart deaths, Scream is about ""Ghostface"" stabbing his way through everyone in his way. One thing was for sure...Scream was only the beginning.Neve Campbell was in the height of her Party of Five days and was easily the next ""It"" girl although that never truly happened. Scream could also be nailed for bringing together a hot young Hollywood A-List or future A-List cast. Campbell is really the perfect scream queen lead role. She IS the embodiment of what Jamie Lee Curtis was for Halloween or Heather Langenkamp was for Nightmare on Elm Street. Sweet, smart, disturbed, haunted, a twisted past of sorts, Campbell is perfect. She is the girl next door but has a hero inside too. Courtney Cox Arquette (before she was Arquette) plays sleazy ambulance chasing reporter Gail Weathers, that really does have a heart of gold. This is almost a more serious role for Cox although her clumsy silly side shows through a little bit. David Arquette (her now husband) plays lovable loser Dewey. This is a great role for Arquette...defining in many ways. He is an everyman's hero, and despite his nerd like exterior, gets the girl, the bad guy, and goes out guns blazing. This is easily his best role but that isn't saying much really. Jamie Kennedy takes a step back from slapstick to play the smart, level headed movie buff Randy who pines for Sydney. I love Kennedy's character in this film and subsequent Scream films and I only wish he had a bigger role in the first installment. He is comedic relief but in a subtle way and a hero in other ways. Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich I put together as sort of second string supporting characters. Neither of them really have a lead role but their presence is well known in the cast. Both are decent although I felt like Lillard's character lost some credibility at his sort of silly outbursts towards the end. He was one comedian in the film that seemed to be unable to let go of his slapstick antics. Also worth mentioning is a great cameo however brief by Henry Winkler, and the iconic opening scene featuring Drew Barrymore who does an outstanding job being terrorized. They also introduce Liev Schrieber in a small role that will become far more significant in the future.Wes Craven really single handedly brought the slasher genre back to reality. He put together an incredible cast with incredible chemistry that would hold together through 3 (soon to be 4? films.) The first Scream feels like an introduction to a bigger picture which as we know by the end of the trilogy is exactly true. Essentially especially for Campbell, Arquette and Cox Arquette he gave them what would be defining roles for them. Scream also coined defining iconic moments like Ghostface and ""Do you like Scary Movies?"" and ""Hello Sydney."" For horror buffs this is classic at its best. It is easily a must see film and is sure to delight, fright and even make you smile. 8.5/10",Scream
48,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Wes Craven revitalised the slasher genre for the second time with this wittily meta and wickedly entertaining horror flick.,8,24 October 2017,"From its immediately and unexpectedly ballsy tone-and-stakes-setting opening to its fantastically frenzied and excitingly squishy finale, this fast-paced slasher constantly plays with its audience in an extremely entertaining way and represents the second time that director Wes Craven revitalised the long-standing genre (after 'A Nightmare On Elm-Street (1984)'). That's alongside his own career, this time by - along with writer Kevin Williamson - introducing a devilishly meta-textual element that isn't always subtle but is always accurate and consistent while also being enjoyably playful - even during some of the flick's more genuinely intense sequences. 'Scream (1996)' plays with conventions and tropes so often seen within the wider horror genre, which - no matter how eclectic it may seem - does share a spookily similar set of conventions across the board. The picture itself is no stranger to those conventions; it doesn't subvert them all so much as 'hang a lantern' on most. The other major thing that Craven brings to the film is his penchant for proper visceral nastiness. The scarier sequences don't hold back on either the suspense or the gore, which creatively contrasts with the colourful sets and almost comedic quiet moments to make the flick feel even further from reality and give it a bizarre tone that's cohesive yet slightly odd. It's almost like the whole thing is supposed to look like a movie, which - given the constant meta references - is a nice touch that helps solidify its themes. The piece is just brilliant; it's a landmark entry in its genre. In fact, it's perhaps one of the few reasons that the slasher is even still around today. 8/10.",Scream
49,bowmanblue,The slasher film that started it all (again),10,8 December 2014,"The 'slasher' film, i.e. a killer stalking a selection of dippy American teenagers, had kind of gone out of fashion in the late eighties. Therefore, the early nineties were a barren place for masked nutjobs wielding knives. Then Scream came along.It's about a young girl, seemingly destined to spend the entire film being stalked by a masked killer who despatches her peers in many different knife-related ways. Nothing particularly unusual there, but don't let the basic nature of the plot put you off. There is definitely more to this than meets the eye.It not only revitalised the 'slasher genre' but it also was the first of such films to poke fun at the whole genre in itself. If you've ever found yourself yelling at the 'dumb blonde' on the screen to run the right way and not straight back into the serial killer's clutches then this is the film for you. It uses the horror clichés to the max and takes great pleasure in, not only pointing them out, but dispelling them.However, Scream wasn't just hugely successful because it poked fun at the genre. It was also a damn good mystery. With other similar films, the killer was normally quite obvious, i.e. the big disfigured bloke in a mask, wielding a chainsaw. But in Scream, pretty much every character is a suspect. The only time you can really rule them out is when they end up the wrong end of the killer's knife.If you love horror then you've probably already seen it. If you haven't... watch it now. The only downside you might find is that it was so successful that there were almost an infinite number of (nowhere near as good) copies. However, Scream is the original and BEST. It's fun, gory, well-written with great characters. What more could you want if you like scary movies?",Scream
50,ThomasDrufke,Brilliant Horror Satire,8,1 November 2017,"Just as Deadpool is the superhero film that made fun of and reinvented the genre, Scream was that for Horror in the 90's. Constantly making commentary on the state and tropes of the genre, Scream is a horror film for horror fans. Albeit not as frightening as some of the great slasher films of the mid-late 20th century, Scream benefits from Wes Craven's meta direction, and memorable performances from actors who were just starting to gain fame in 1996.This film is notable for killing off a character, played by a very well-known actress (even at the time), within the first few scenes of the film. And although I knew it was coming, it was not any less effective, and proved to be a great way to introduce the ""ghostface"" persona. As I've said in many reviews for horror films, the film can win me over with creativity. Scream is very much an homage to the entire slasher genre, but yet it manages to feel fresh and different because of Ghostface's way of killing. The mystery surrounding his/her identity is an intriguing plot point of course, but I was more interested to hear what famous horror film Ghostface would comment on next.It's very much a horror satire, with it succeeding in executing horror trope after horror trope without ever seeming to over do it, Scream is almost like a parody of horror. Leave it to Wes Craven I guess. The only thing I got frustrated with was just how clumsy Ghostface can be, and really, every character. Perhaps done on purpose, there are far too many characters who just don't seem to have a clue how to act in a horrific situation. Again, this was probably just Craven playing with all of us, but there was just one too many trips and falls for my liking.However, with all of the memorable performances and creative horror commentary by Craven, Scream will no doubt go down as one of the more important horror films of the last few decades. 8.2/10",Scream
51,Cineanalyst,Demasking the Slasher Film,8,31 July 2021,"In retrospect, it seems obvious that ""Scream"" would become iconic, a classic--infinitely parodied and imitated to this day. Indeed, I re-watched it due to the blatant copycatting in the ""Fear Street"" trilogy (2021), particularly the first entry in the series. Perhaps only ""Psycho"" (1960) and ""Halloween"" (1978) among Hollywood slashers have been as consequential. I suspect this is because the genre deconstruction fits so well the appeal of the slasher subgenre of horror, especially to teenage or young audiences. The deconstruction sets a low bar of accessibility to be in on the joke, readily apparent and easily digested. Some critics have suggested that ""Scream"" requires a high degree of knowledge of the genre, but I'd argue it offers the opposite by explaining what it is so thoroughly and without subtlety that it promised and earned a broader appeal to even those not as familiar or more casually so with such gory teen romps. Moreover, unlike some other cheeky meta constructions before it--say, the Western in ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974)--the genre and its own narrative is still treated with a reverence that encourages the usual dramatic tricks of character identification and enough superficial sincerity to not risk coming across as patronizing. Hard to pull off a madman in an Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" mask (the so-called ""Ghostface"") doing pratfalls chasing shrieking girls as both ridiculously amusing on one level and tension-building on another, but just that, at least to an extent, is accomplished here.A familiarity with ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween"" is about all that seems strongly recommended to grasp the mechanics and inversions of the genre going on here. Other titles mentioned in the numerous scenes mentioning other films tend to be largely reworkings of those two--the likes of ""Halloween"" meets ""Psycho"" in the woods of ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) or the ""Halloween"" plus disco of ""Prom Night"" (1980), and Wes Craven is just tooting his own horn referencing ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984). ""Halloween,"" too, was consciously a continuation of its film legacy, although more subtly reflexive about it, as it's about the cinematic gaze rather than genre deconstruction. The principle connection was made by casting Jamie Lee Curtis as the screaming heroine, as she's the daughter of Janet Leigh, of ""Psycho"" fame. Whereas Curtis played the goody-two-shoes virgin, explaining her ultimate triumph, she was still initially stalked and punished as if for the sins of her mother's character, and Michael Myers continuing the legacy of Norman Bates peeping thereof as an extension of his incestuous psychopathy.This is the importance of the backstory in ""Scream,"" of the one-year anniversary of the rape and murder of the mother of Neve Campbell's character. This mother, too, was sexually promiscuous, a cheater, or at least that's the rumor. Campbell's Sidney also begins as the virgin type, as she rebukes her boyfriend's advances, in the mold of Curtis's Laurie. Craven tries to subvert the moralism of this trope, though, by making Sidney more of her own person, including punching the tabloid TV reporter and, ultimately, sex. Nevertheless, the plot is largely an elaboration of ""Halloween."" Knife-wielding masked madman an' all, except now he also carries a mobile phone--back when that was still a novel invention.Besides Sidney and if not for the whodunit aspect of the plot, the only other two figures of interest here are the reporter played by Courtney Cox and the video-store clerk as by Jamie Kennedy. Both do a lot of the work in propping up the postmodern edifice: her a writer of a book within the film that tells the film's backstory and a reporter who tells the present unfolding narrative for the camera, and him the curator of horror cinema that helps guide the characters within the film and the audience without it to how these movies work.Yet, special mention should also be made to Drew Barrymore's role, which is a neat misdirect in the tradition of Leigh as initially playing the apparent protagonist in ""Psycho,"" as well as establishing the game of self-aware slasher-flick trivia being played here. It's a great two-fold opening scene in this respect. There's the self-reference on the surface made obvious because they're talking about it on the phone, and there's the implied sort that rewards reflection on it by comparison with Leigh's part in ""Psycho"" and Barrymore being a big-enough, known star to pull it off--indeed, an actress with an even more extensive actorly heritage than Curtis.The same two-fold reflexivity continues in the end. There's the obviousness of ""Halloween"" playing on the TV as a similar scenario is enacted outside that frame and within another one that is the film. The film-within-the-film device that's so blatant it's as though it's hitting us over the head with the TV. Amusingly, it literally does just that to a character (talk about a pun of breaking the fourth wall). But, those familiar with that prior slasher film might recall that it, too, featured films-within-the-film on the TV that reflected the themes of the outer story. A clever layering here, then, of reflexivity, which itself is already layered by the multiple films and their acknowledgement. Too bad its copycats tend to miss that.",Scream

I notice this more as I am a writer and this is one of my fave horror/thrillers.I advise you not to watch this for the pumped up scares (to a very loud soundtrack) but for how a typical 'who's the killer?' plot line can be a little better than it is believed to be.Some of the characters can be really annoying. In fact the only one that doesn't enrage me is Dewey. His idiotness makes me laugh and diverts my attention from the other characters in the very slow 'character building scenes'. The direction and photography are very bland. Wes Craven did a much better job of a real horror film with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Here it just seems as if he aiming at the teen/popcorn market. You'll notice that, with these kind of movies, most of the characters (not actors) are teenagers and the tone of the film is mostly 'safe'. In the Scream 'sub-genre' there is never any REAL edge. After this movie was made, many, increasing bad, movies that were all exactly the same rolled off a conveyor belt in Hollywood. They were easy moneymakers. Craven knew this beforehand but deep, intelligent movies do not sit well with mass audiences. The blander the style of film is, the more popular it will be with the majority of audiences.

Directed by Wes Craven (who became famous with the franchise ""Nightmare on Elm Street""), has a script by Kevin Williamson and includes Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette in the lead roles, playing respectively the young Casey, the protagonist Sidney, an ambitious reporter called Gale Weathers and the sheriff's deputy, Dewey.As audience, we are in doubt about what really is this film: if it is a mere horror movie then we are facing one of the worst: although some situational scares, the film does not scare anyone, on the contrary: the killer is bumbling, fumbling and spends at least half of the film playing with the phone and stumble around the stage.

The slasher genre is the most procedural of them all. Expendable characters meeting their untimely demise where the virgin individual survives and prepares for the sequel. Scream knows this. Craven's innovation and genre competence enables this slasher to be self-referential, providing both humour and thrills. A small town experiences a serial killer dressed in a Halloween costume, as they slaughter several students from a school. Its deconstruction is the composition of the story's construction. The outstandingly memorable opening sequence with Barrymore sets the narrative's tone instantaneously. The serial killer toys with her psychologically by playing a game of movie trivia, a quiz I would like to participate in if I were to be brutally murdered. This referential humour complements the violent stabbing and intestine pulling rather well. Craven, clearly a fan of horror films, shows his adoration for the genre by understanding it. He acknowledges specific tropes and utilises them to their full potential. Various characters are one-dimensional, but that's the point. Does it necessarily make a good film? Yes and no. Exposing weaknesses in a genre and yet still using them shows that you are still conforming to the set rules, as opposed to making it that little bit more fresh. Don't get me wrong, this is enjoyably innovative, but tries so hard that specific twists in the story are underwhelming. The constant use of horror references nearly made my ears bleed. 'Carrie', 'Friday the 13th' and even Craven's own film! It was like a tsunami, and I wish it was just a wave instead. Also the musical score was overwhelming occasionally, although excellent use of 'Halloween' in the background. Still, an entertainingly unconventional thriller that relishes in its meta nature. Keep an eye out for that severe weather warning though, because Gale Weathers rapidly approaches and she owns the film, taking no prisoners.",Scream
62,BaronBl00d,A Classic?,7,23 December 2004,"Director Wes Craven almost singlehandedly resurrected the horror genre in the mid 90's with this film. Prior to Scream the 90's and the entire 80's had been decades with tireless and tiresome retreads of once popular horror films. These films adhered to the same formula, had little or no innovative or imaginative ideas, and were filled with empty-headed teens big on looks and almost totally void of any real talent. Craven adheres to many of these notions as well in Scream, but he is always using them in a self-mocking way. Scream has much going for it as a horror film: one of the best opening sequences of any horror film with the subtraction of star Drew Barrymore very quickly, some genuine thrills and chills as well as some genuine laughs, and a constant homage to the genre with references such as Wes Carpenter as a popular director of the day and the rules that one should learn having watched horror films. Craven even manages to insert a clip of Whale's Frankenstein for good measure. BUT...and you might have guessed this was coming...I get real disheartened when so many people say this is a classic, one of the greatest horror films ever made(if not the greatest itself), or even Craven's finest film. It just isn't so. I would not even imagine any scenario where I would put Scream on my top ten...top twenty...top thirty... greatest horror film list. Great horror films have great scripts. Scream does not. Aside from the roller coaster introduction with Barrymore, the film never manages to reach those same heights. There are a lot of good plot twists, but let's face it - the story is pretty preposterous. Great horror films usually have great actors giving great performances. Scream does not have any great performances. The cast does a nice job smiling through much of the film - even in the face of impending death. As an audience we are never asked to take anyone seriously. And as an audience we don't. Great horror films have great, memorable scenes that linger with the viewer. Scream DOES have some of these. the opening is very effective. Craven deserves a lot of credit for it, but it is never rivaled again in the film. Don't get me wrong - I liked Scream. It was a fun movie. It gave me a few reasons to jump from my seat. It made me laugh here and there. But it never left any long-lasting impression on me that I had just sat through a masterpiece like when I first saw Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, or Carpenter's Halloween. Craven is a good director and has made many good films. I like his 70's work best: Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes(films that may well repulse many viewers but left a lasting impression on me, though most of it was pure shock!). Those films are really better than this film. Craven plays up to a modern audience whom he is making fun of indirectly in the film. He laces the film with all kinds of genre references that most of his younger, hip audience will have no understanding of at all. He tells us that those people in horror films that have sex or drink or take drugs will die. He shows his audience exactly what they want to see and then pokes fun at it. Surely this hip approach has a lot to do with the wide accolades the film has received from its loyal audience over the years. I think Scream, though not a great film, deservedly is due recognition for making horror popular again and mainstream. This mainstream approach has led to many new, innovative horror films since its release and has made the horror genre certainly one of the more profitable genres to produce a film for. Yes, we still have the umpteenth sequels and unnecessary remakes, but there have also been some new films that I believe are direct descendants of the legacy of Scream.",Scream

64,insomniac_rod,Genre defining movie.,8,3 August 2004,"""Scream"" came in 1996 when ""teen flicks"" were the most popular movies and raised millions of dollars. Wes Craven thought it was time to bring back the Slasher genre and adapt it with the mid 90's craziness. His winning formula was mixing 90's teen ""idols"" and situations taken from ""teen"" flicks with 80's Slasher movie elements. ""Scream"" is a combination of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Friday the 13th"".Most of this movie's fans didn't even watch ANY Slasher movie before watching ""Scream"" from the 80's and that's the reason why ""Scream"" became a tremendous hit. Those teens watched something that worked in the 80's for the first time in a mid 90's movie, I'm talking about the Slasher genre.On the other hand, die hard fans of the genre were insulted with Craven's movie. Craven is responsible for Horror defining movies like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""Last House On The Left"", and ""The Hills Have Eyes""; movies that somehow changed the genre. ""Scream"" doesn't offer anything new and it's filled with every 80's horror clichés (characters, killings, music, make up, etc.). Of course anyone that didn't watch a Slasher movie before would be ""impressed"" by this movie!What's so good about ""Scream""?. In my opinion, adapting the Slasher clichés with the 90's clichés. Compare ""Scream"" with ""Friday the 13th"", ""Black Christmas"", ""When A Stranger Calls"", ""Happy Birthday To Me"", etc. and you will feel cheated. ""Scream"" made millions of dollars for copying 80's horror movies' elements.Don't give credit to this movie because it doesn't deserves it.At least Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, and Courteney Cox are beautiful and can act. The goofy Ghostface ""killer"" is dull, but it managed to generate a huge cult. Recommended for slasher lovers.",Scream

67,jzappa,"A ""Wes Carpenter"" Flick",8,19 May 2010,"The characters in Wes Craven's meta-fest are in a horror film, and since they've seen so many horror films, they know what to do, and what not to do. ""Don't say 'I'll be right back,'"" Jamie Kennedy cautions a friend, ""because whenever anybody says that, he's never right back."" In a way, this movie was unavoidable. A lot of modern film criticism concerns plot deconstruction. Kevin Williamson's script does this to itself, using conventional slasher procedure with an ironic combination of genuine scares with dialogue that satirizes slasher film customs: Rather than leaving it to the audience to expect the horror banalities, the characters discuss them candidly. ""Horror movies are always about some big-breasted blonde who runs upstairs so the slasher can corner her,"" says a character in this reference-happy film. ""I hate it when characters are that stupid."" The movie starts with Drew Barrymore at home alone, naturally. She gets an abusive phone call. All in all, she gets the Janet Leigh Treatment. It's a dry run.Then, we meet another young woman. Her father has left for the weekend. Her mother was murdered . . . why, precisely a year ago tomorrow! Her boyfriend climbs in through the window. At high school, grapevine of cult killings spreads. The killer masquerades in a creepy Halloween costume. There are more phone calls, more attacks. The suspects include the boyfriend, the father, and a lot of other people. The Fonz as the high school principal is a likable little dash.All of that is the plot. This revitalizing tongue-in-cheek genre piece is not about the plot. It is about itself. That is to say, it is about characters who are aware they are in a plot. These characters read Fangoria magazine. They even use movie-style dialogue: ""It's called subtlety! You should look it up!"" or ""I was attacked and nearly filleted last night."" or ""Life is like a movie. Only, you can't pick your genre."" The heroine has been declining her boyfriend's advances, and as another character brings up, virgins are never victims in horror films. Just bad boys and girls get slashed to pieces. Understanding they're among the thick of a slasher plot, the characters talk about who could play them, Tori Spelling, a young Meg Ryan. The movie itself, for all of its unexpected in-jokes, also works as a horror movie, a bloody and gruesome one, that employs as many clichés as it parodies, usually the same ones. That is it's wittiest charm: By exposing the conventions of the genre, the audience expect something else to happen, but the film then plays by those very same conventions.One old linchpin is the scene where someone abruptly enters the frame, scaring the heroine, while a menacing musical chord stings. These scenes are ripe for parody, because the chord carries a theme of emergency, but in fact the surprising person is always an innocent friend, and although we can't see the newcomer because the framing is so tight, in the real world the scared person would naturally be able to see the newcomer all the time. Williamson is also educated about the way TV reporters are depicted in horror movies. The reporter this time, played by Courteney Cox, canvases delightful inquiries, such as ""How does it feel to be almost brutally butchered? People have a right to know!"" As dogged and crafty as she is, she still touts to a local deputy that they shouldn't drive to a remote country house when it's a nice night to walk down an unoccupied rural trail in the dark while a slasher is loose.As a cinephile, I liked it. I liked the in-jokes and the behavior-conscious characters. At the same time, I'm disappointed in how many audiences have been duped into taking it seriously. It is truly ironic that it indeed resuscitated the entire horror genre and spawned countless take-me-seriously imitations. Even fellow filmmakers made a franchise out of spoofing it, when it's already a spoof. It's the violence and the gore, which are plentiful and sometimes intense, that deliver on the same note as it would if it were a normal cash-in slasher. The key is that the graphic violence and gore are disarmed by the ironic way the film utilizes and annotates it. Craven and Williamson have their cake and eat it too.",Scream
68,gwnightscream,One Of Craven's Best!,7,19 March 2012,"Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Jamie Kennedy and Drew Barrymore star in Wes Craven's 1996 horror film. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is a teenage girl who lives in Woodsboro, California with her father and is trying to get over the death of her mother murdered a year before. She also has a boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Ulrich) and friends, Randy Meeks (Kennedy), Tatum Riley (McGowan) and Stu Macher (Lillard) who's also Tatum's boyfriend. When 2 classmates, Casey Becker (Barrymore) and her boyfriend, Steve Orth are brutally murdered by a psychotic killer obsessed with scary movies, Sidney and her friends become targeted.

Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, and many other stars have put some magic into this movie. It starts off with some horror questions, then the scare factor builds the rush for the victims. I liked the part where Matthew Lillard's character said, ""I'll be right back!"" Even though he was one of the culprits. Sydney(Neve Campbell) let it all out in the seduction scene with the killer as well. Altogether, I think everyone in the movie are all suspects, but when the smoke clears, it's all over. And this movie wasn't a wasted effort whatsoever. I've enjoyed every bit of it.

70,FiendishDramaturgy,Above average for the slasher sub-genre,9,2 October 2003,"This is NOT your average, mindless slasher flick. Scream: a real psychological breakthrough in the genre of slasher movies.This movie demonstrates a most excellent advancement in the genre of slasher flicks. Let me begin by saying this is NOT a flick; a flick being a fluffy little piece of nothing designed to make money and nothing more, OR a movie which is so low budget (or the acting is so bad) that it can't do anything but make you laugh, regardless of the subject matter. This is a quality production. The direction was wonderful and the acting was believable. The key to this movie, in my opinion, is three-fold.(1) The characters seem to realize they are in a horror movie. They quote movies, site movies and refer to movies all throughout the dialog. This, to me, adds to this production, and establishes it as an homage to the horror genre in general. This is a serious parody; not meant to be amusing, but rather, thought-provoking. Randy points out to his friends (and the audience) all the basic rules of surviving a horror movie, as if he knows the now-famous quote by John Lennon that ""Nothing is Real.""Randy's rules for Surviving a Horror Movie.1. You can never have sex.2. You can neither drink nor do drugs. It's a sin; an extension of Rule #1.3. Never EVER under any circumstances say, ""I'll be right back,"" because you won't be back. You'll be dead.(2) The citing of actual movies and events by the characters lends a total reality to this production that lacks in others where they actually make UP movies to site and critique rather than being bold enough to work real movies into the script. (""You can only hear that Richard Gere/gerbil story so many times before you start to believe it."" Tatum) Perhaps they are afraid of being accused of endorsing certain movies, while slighting other directors'/actors' work.Regardless of the reasoning behind it, this movie grabs the bull by the horns and makes you believe the characters are real. You have the uncanny feeling that you are watching actual live footage of these people, rather than characters on a screen, that's how realistically these characters are portrayed.(3) The characters are SENTIENT. They realize there are consequences. They aren't mindless victims/killers. In a very poignant scene, the killer asks of the victim, ""Did you really call the police? My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me!"" in a tear-filled, pathetically whiny voice. It lends to the scene a certain reality that it would have otherwise lacked. The whole movie is blessed with these ""reality checks,"" helping to make it more and more believable.Neve Campbell is completely believable; her character (Sidney Prescott) seems real and is so beautifully portrayed by Ms. Campbell that she has fully established her gift as a thespian. I do sincerely hope that she is not type-cast in horror movies for the duration of her career. Her talents could well be used in any leading role, in any genre. Her list of credits is already quite impressive, all things considered.Her character is not one of those horror movie heroines who falls down while running from the killer, who can't keep her head straight in a real crisis, or who proves inept and incapable of fending off an attacker. Her character is brave, and strong, and capable. I LOVE that!!The character development was so rich and deep, further lending credibility and reality to this production. Above the feeling of watching live footage, you feel as if you personally know the characters and care about what happens to them. This is key in ANY good movie.Henry Winkler was amazing in his role as the principal of Woodsboro high school. This is the first serious role in which I have admired his abilities. I hope it is not the last. He demonstrated a quality in this movie that I have never before seen in his performances. Even Wes Craven makes an appearance as ""Fred the Janitor"" in Winkler's most poignant scenes.As this story unfolds, you will be blown away. This is one of the best movies of the genre of ""slasher,"" and also rates with ""The Game,"" ""Fallen,"" ""Psycho,"" and a much later movie, ""Identity,"" in the psychological thriller Hall of Fame.A most excellent movie; totally awe-inspiring soundtrack that works with the movie SO WELL. It is endearing to see a director take so much care with every little detail of a work; so much so that this is a true work of art. It is believable, watchable (if from behind a pillow, your half-closed hands, or your knees), and downright SCARY. Truly, I find those movies which tap into the category of ""that which could actually happen"" to be the scariest. This is definitely one of those movies. I have the whole trilogy right next to ""Halloween,"" ""Halloween 2,"" and ""Halloween H20"" in my collection. I honestly think this movie tops ""Halloween,"" if only by a small bit.The twists are so amazing they will leave you sitting there with your mouth wide open.It gets a full 8.89/10 from...the Fiend :.",Scream

Although other movie shave done it obviously, no movie has done it this well. And then by making it so that there were two killers it covered up for any one being able to say that that person couldn't have killed them because he was here or he couldn't have killed him because he's not strong enough. One thing I would have liked to see them do is in the credits tell us who was meant to have killed who because that has always bugged me who killed Drew Barrymore's character because she looked at him and I would like to know who she was looking at. More movies should be done in this format where you've got to guess the killer/s.",Scream
72,freemantle_uk,What is your favourite scary movie?,9,1 July 2011,"By the 1990s the Slasher genre was becoming stale, filled with clichés, countless sequels and very predictable and uninventive. Likely two men was able to play on this, Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven was able to play on this and made a really excellent take on Slashers.In the small town of Woodsboro two teenagers (Drew Barrymore and Kevin Patrick Walls) are shockingly murdered, a year after a woman was raped and murdered in the town centre. Very quickly the town is thrown into turmoil, with the media reporting on it, but the teens do not seem to be worried. The killer, known as Ghost-face soon targets another Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the daughter of a victim, who luckily escapes. But Ghost-face is going to rest and goes on a mission to take down Sidney and anyone who stands in his way.Scream works because it is set in a world where horror movies do exist and teenagers know clichés. It is a self-aware horror film and has a lot of references to classic horror films like Halloween. Scream is forced to be inventive and Craven who is a master of the horror genre, so knew what he was doing with this film.Even if Scream was not made with a post-modern, self-aware horror with a comic edge, it still would have been an excellent horror film and one of the best slashers around. Craven and Williamson made sure their characters were fully developed, likable or at least normal. Sidney is a character with a lot of a baggage because of her mother's death and afraid to get close to people. She is a likable because is a friendly, smart, decent girl who is also tough. Sidney's friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) was tough no-nonsense girl who could have easily been the clichéd slut role, but that was avoided because she was a good friend and competent. Courteney Cox plays a unpleasant journalist who cares more ratings and book sales more then safety of people and emotional harm. She is not a journalist who is looking to report the truth or for the public interest. But she does come good at the end. The characters of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Stuart (Matthew Lillard) offer a lot of comic relief particular because of their knowledge of horror films. And David Arquettte is solid as a competent police officer who has a typical brother-sister relationship with Tatum.Cavern made sure Scream was exciting with a lot of action, violence and creative deaths. I particular like his technique of using the camera to follow the victims and move it around the house, adding excitement and intrigue. He knows how to build suspects and he does keep you guessing. I don't get scared watching horror films but you do care for Sidney and the idea of being home alone at night can make you more tense.I do have a criticism. They does not seem to be much of a reaction at the school hearing about two of their peers being brutally murdered. Most people seem to be very causal about it and saw it as something fun, not worried about a serial killer being on the loose or just saw it as an excuse for a party. Come on, if they was a murder in a small town there would be more sadden, grief and worry. Personally I would have focused on this collective reaction, but I am a more serious person and possibly would have a thriller/a social piece.Overall, Scream is certainly a worthy horror film, no manner what generation of horror fan you are.",Scream
73,dee.reid,"""Scream"" - 15 years later, it's still the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slasher movies!",10,21 October 2011,"OK, here it is, finally, the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slashers: ""Scream"" is the popular 1996 slasher epic that single-handedly signaled the return of the slasher movie, and also single-handedly revitalized the sagging horror genre. But there was a twist: a large part of ""Scream's"" massive success had to deal with its open acknowledgment of its source material, lending the movie a level of self-awareness that had never been done before in horror (or at the very least, done very successfully).The closest horror movies I can probably think of before then might have been ""The Lost Boys"" (1987), or maybe even ""An American Werewolf in London"" (1981). (And yes, I do realize there is a possibility that I could be wrong, but those are the only two I can immediately think of.)The movie also represented a marriage of old and new: horror maestro Wes Craven (""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""The Last House on the Left,"" ""Shocker,"" - to name a few), the man behind the camera of this wildly inventive slasher, was a seasoned professional in the horror genre at the time, yet his career at the point up until ""Scream"" seemed seriously lagging - despite the mild success of the reality-bending ""New Nightmare"" in 1994. Enter into the picture newbie screenwriter Kevin Williamson, whose inspired script for ""Scream"" took the lessons of past slasher flicks and injected a hip, knowing, mid-1990s cynicism and self-consciousness into the material that didn't ride the fine line into camp territory: the kids in this movie spoke and acted like they *knew* they were in a horror film. Together, these two gave us horror movie heaven - ""Scream.""Despite the over-riding sense of self-knowing and movie-referencing humor, ""Scream"" is still edge-of-your-seat entertainment of the first order. It's a ludicrous premise that in theory should not work, but it does: the movie is still pretty damn scary (in addition to being gruesomely bloody and gory), even though all the characters are keenly aware of the ""facts"" of horror movies yet still knowingly break the rules established by the three godfathers of the slasher genre - the aforementioned ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (my personal favorite slasher movie), ""Halloween"" (1978), and ""Friday the 13th"" (1980).The film's plot is deceptively simple: Somebody is taking their love of scary movies too far, and they're making a killing (pun intended). The classic opening double-murder sequence (featuring Drew Barrymore) sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and that is a non-stop roller coaster ride of thrills, chills, and laughs. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, whose performance here officially ushered her into being the MTV generation's scream queen) leads an all-star cast of a slasher movie that also doubles as a brilliantly thrilling whodunit.So whodunit? It obviously wasn't the ultra-feisty reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), nor was it Sidney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) or Tatum's bumbling older brother, Deputy Dewey (David Arquette). Or was it one of them? Either way, other suspects include Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich, whose character's name is an obvious reference to the late Donald Pleasance's Dr. Sam Loomis from ye old ""Halloween""), Tatum's mentally deficient boy-toy Stu (Matthew Lillard), or was it the movie-loving uber-geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy)?I've seen ""Scream"" countless times over the years, several of those times were in a high school graphic design class my sophomore year. I got into it around '99 or 2000, three or four years after the fact, but I loved it from the opening moments. Upon a refresher viewing today to mark the 15th anniversary of the film's release, I realize ""Scream"" has not lost of any its impact. But because ""Scream"" was the movie that revitalized the horror and slasher genres in a single dose, it didn't take long for imitators to follow its self-knowing, movie-referencing satirical formula, and some of those imitators include its three sequels (released in 1997, 2000 and 2011, respectively). (And how about those slasher movie parodies in the ""Scary Movie"" series? Isn't it ironic that ""Scream"" was initially titled ""Scary Movie""?) It was a formula that worked once and only once.Most famously, perhaps, ""Scream"" firmly established once and for all, the ""rules"" for surviving horror movies. Drum roll, Randy:1) Sex = death,2) No drinking or doing drugs, and3) Never say, ""I'll be right back"" because you won't be.15 years later, ""Scream"" is just as thrilling, entertaining, and funny as it was when I first saw it as an impressionable teenager in 1999 or 2000. Wes Craven has always had a way for directing scary movies with lively and three-dimensional characters, but ""Scream"" carried the revered horror master and his chief screenwriter into mainstream blockbuster territory, three more times, even.(Yes, I loved - that's right, I said I loved ""Scream 4""; it's the best and funniest since the original.)10/10",Scream

76,runamokprods,"For me an inventive mixed bag, but there's more good than not",7,15 October 2014,"I've gone back and forth in my feelings about ""Scream"" both times I've seen it, almost 20 years ago when it opened, and just now There are times when its meta-parody- but–still-scary approach to teen slasher films works quite well, especially the ending which manages to be funny, scary, over the top, and socially witty all at the same time. Other times it's too self conscious to actually be scary, but not surprising enough in its humor to really be as much fun as it could be. It's also a hard film to criticize, because the answer to almost every complaint (e.g. the actors playing high school kids all look like they're well into in their 20s) can always be 'but that's the whole point, it's always that way in these movies'. But one thing that does annoy me that isn't so easily shrugged off is that the cast seem to be in a number of different movies. Skeet Ulrich, for example, brings a surprising amount of realism and depth to his character, while Courtney Cox as an 'I'll do anything for a story' reporter plays a cartoon of a cartoon. This isn't of issue of 'good' versus 'bad' acting, but it does make figuring out just what the tone of the film is, more muddy than it needs to be. Probably the best thing about 'Scream' is it knows when to BE best. The opening and closing 15 minutes are the two strongest sections of the film, so if the middle is a little all over the place and sometimes repetitive, and a little more obvious in it's humor, that's not what you walk away remembering.",Scream

There's little doubt that Craven, working from Kevin Williamson's screenplay, does a superb job of grabbing the viewer's attention right from the get-go, as the movie opens with a striking and thoroughly captivating stand-alone sequence revolving around the pursuit and murder of a high school er (Drew Barrymore's Casey). I really enjoyed Drew Barrymore I would not have minded if she was one of the 'Final Girls' her limited scene time It's an engrossing scene that was one of the best aspects of this film.This film has great wit . Not necessarily laugh out loud funny, more so that it was quite self-aware, coming from Wes Craven, and there were quite a few moments where the dialogue caused moments that seemed to force the actors to look at the camera and wink. For example, Rose McGowan is trying to calm down Sidney because she is ""starting to sound like a Wes Carpenter"" ....WINK! See what she did? She combined Wes Craven with John Carpenter, two huge names in the horror movie industry. Or when the principal, played by Henry Winkler, startles the school janitor, dressed in a fedora and a green and red striped sweater and calls him Freddy...WINK! Get it? Because Freddy Krueger was a janitor? Oh, and Linda Blair was in this as a reporter, so there's that.The actors are a well assorted and written bunch that does an impeccable job of reminiscing the sub-genre while juggling with a complex underlying mystery the movie heavily relies on.
The jump scares are deserved; written and directed with ideal pacing, dialogue, acting and a production value rarely matched by similar movies. The intricate script throws you in all directions with plenty of misdirection to keep you engaged.Writer, Williamson does a nice job of blending the traditional (yet consistently compelling) narrative with self-referential bursts of dialogue (ie Jamie Kennedy's scene-stealing character outlines the three rules one needs to obey to survive a horror flick). Scream stimulates you mentally, proving that a good movie, disregarding its classification, can only spawn from a good story. Adding to the agreeable atmosphere are the tense kill sequences and uniformly engaging performances, with the end result a fun, well-paced 'meta slasher' that remains one of the best modern examples of its kind. 8/10",Scream
78,MaxBorg89,"Clever, scary and funny - a must-see for horror fans",8,13 April 2007,"Making a brilliant, original horror film is pretty hard these days, since practically everything has already been told, and more than once. Using that premise, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with Scream, whose cleverness derives from the fact that it knows every single stereotype of the genre and satirizes them.Take the opening sequence, for example: a young girl (Drew Barrymore) is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend when she suddenly receives a phone call. Normally, this would be a huge clichè, only this time the killer decides to play a little game (horror film quiz, naturally) with his victim. In fact, the only reason why he kills her is that she gave the wrong answer to one of his questions (those who haven't seen Friday 13th might want to skip that bit, as it spoils said movie's ending). That scene is both very scary (the murder is quite graphic and disturbing) and at the same time funny (it tests the characters', and the audience's, knowledge of the horror genre), and the rest of the film continues in the same vein: after the first killing, the masked psychopath starts disposing of other teenagers in the town of Woodsboro using the same technique. One of the targets is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother was raped and killed the year before. This implies the killer might be the same, but who could it be? Sidney's distant father? Her mother's lover (Liev Schreiber)? Or some random guy, with no motive at all?Fortunately, it is not the last category: this murderer has a motive and a plausible identity as well. But it isn't the payoff that makes Scream interesting; it's how Craven and Williamson get to it, by outlining the genre's conventions (some of which were actually invented by the director himself) and using them in a clever, if self-referential, way. The point of the movie is, the more you know of this kind of films (pay attention to the rules, stated by geeky film buff Randy), the more chances you have to survive (although you must take into account that the killer has seen the same movies). The in-jokes that would ruin other films are the very cause of Scream's success, with memorable scenes such as the villain mimicking the movie his victims are watching or Craven's unmissable cameo as a janitor wearing Freddy Krueger's outfit (not to mention priceless lines like ""Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative!"").In other words, Scream is a smart, effective horror film, which manages to amuse and scare in equal measures. Definitely worth watching, even if the two sequels (especially Scream 3) don't really match the original's intelligence and, forgive the expression, originality.",Scream

81,drownnnsoda,Destined To Become A Genre Classic.,10,22 March 2005,"""Scream"" is an above-average slasher film from Wes Craven, who some consider ""the modern master of horror"", and deservedly so - he's accomplished quite a bit. The film centers around Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl who is trying to survive high-school, while balancing all of her problems, including her boyfriend and the memories of the savage murder of her mother a year earlier. After a student and her boyfriend are found brutally stabbed to death late one night, the entire town goes into a frenzy, with zany news reporters questioning everybody, and a frantic police department trying to solve the murders. Sidney seems to be all caught up in the middle of it, and as people begin to die all around her, her boyfriend (among others) becomes a suspect.Probably the best slasher film of the '90s, ""Scream"" is nothing short of a horror classic. I've always liked Wes Craven's work (particularly his earlier stuff), and while this film is much more light-hearted (for lack of a better term) than ""Last House On The Left"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes"", it's very stylish and thrilling. The engaging storyline never lets up and keeps the viewer's attention the whole way through. Dashed with lots of dark humor and countless references to other horror classics (even some references to Craven's films himself), this makes for some fun for seasoned fans of the genre. At times the film almost seems as if it's poking fun at some common elements in the genre, but manages to be taken seriously at the same time. Suspense is pushed quite a bit, and there are some spectacularly scary scenes. The opening scene will more than likely go down as one of the most memorable openings in horror history - very well acted by Drew Barrymore (surprising to see her in this film), and just plain scary to boot. Watch the film and you'll understand what I'm talking about.Our cast is led by the wonderful Neve Campbell, the innocent protagonist who is caught up in the middle of a town in hysteria. David Arquette plays a quirky police deputy, and Rose McGowan as his popular sister. And Courtney Cox plays a nosy reporter who will do anything to get a good story. I liked the fact that this film really focused on the actual community and it's reaction to the murders, and how the town became a hysteric mess over what was happening. I also liked the fact that the killer wasn't superhuman - those who find themselves in the track of the killer fight back and give the villain quite a beating, and the villain actually runs (the alternative being taking a slowly-paced stroll while trying to pursue a victim, something that has always kind of bothered me about many slasher films).There's plenty of gore, mostly brutal stabbings and such, so all those gore hounds will be pleased. But besides that, this film has a good story going for it led by a very good cast. The ending was a shocker, and was half of what I was expecting, so I was pleasantly surprised.Bottom line is, ""Scream"" is one of the superior modern slashers of the 1990s, and can't be missed by horror fans. While the two sequels that it spawned were good, they were nothing like the original, as in most cases. Craven really hit the mark on this one, and it's destined to become a classic of the genre. 10/10.",Scream
82,kluseba,No shocker and not even a leg shaker,5,26 April 2011,"When a good friend of mine introduced me this flick as a ""classic"" of the horror genre I thought he was actually joking. I had never watched this movie because it seemed rather bad and stereotypical to me and when my friend convinced me to give it a try and when I heard that a new fourth part has come out I opened my mind and watched the whole trilogy. The first movie was actually about as bad as I expected.I mean there are tons of great horror movies out there to get discovered like the classics ""Nosferatu"", ""The mummy"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" to only mention a few or even more recent stuff like ""Jeepers Creepers"", ""My little eye"" ""5150 Elm Street"" or the more exotic stuff like ""Marebito"", ""Infection"" or ""Two sisters"" without talking about legendary and eerie series like ""Twin Peaks"", ""X Files"" or ""Millenium"". But the Scream trilogy is amongst the worst stuff I have ever seen. Even other overrated and popular stuff like ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Final destination"" or ""Resident Evil"" is fairly better executed. I really don't know why this fairly overrated American slasher crap and fast food cinema is actually so popular. Even the parodies of this movie in the ""Scary Movie"" series are more intriguing than the original.Well, the movie is at least very entertaining and you tend to watch it until the end to know who is the murderer. I must admit that I bet on the wrong guy and that the ending quite surprised me but when I thought that I finally found a positive point, the final conclusion is so superficial and ridiculous that the surprise factor is already erased once again. This movie is simply made to entertain and switch your brain off and from that point of view, you get an average junk food flick but I really ask myself why there are already three follow ups of this mediocre movie until now.I know that the movie itself parodies some horror movie flicks and doesn't take itself too serious and I really laughed a few times but the path between humour and ridiculous dumbness is very small in this movie. The dialogues are horrible, the acting is mostly wooden and distant, the scarface killer rushes into every opened door like a retarded fool and is simply embarrassing, the killing scenes are quite predictable and as soon as an intriguing and suspenseful atmosphere is established, a stupid comedy scene scraps it all. The movie doesn't seem to know if it rather tends to be a parody, a suspense or a horror flick and tries desperately to be all of this at the same time. That creates a potpourri that seems at least interesting and fresh for the first third of the movie but the originality factor is simply used after a while and neither the characters nor the scenario nor the overall atmosphere are able to grip me and keep me hanging on for the last two thirds.This movie is simply made to be watched as a teenager with a couple of friends and some beers. It's a fast food party movie but for any horror movie or suspense flick maniac, this movie may be of a very low interest.",Scream
83,davispittman,2 and 4 are better in my opinion,7,29 March 2017,"Scream is a pretty entertaining slasher film, but I think that scream 2 and 4 are better. The whole feel of this film is fairly fresh. Fresh meaning that it's not completely forgettable like a whole of past slasher horror movies. This movie is not comedic, but it is slightly satirical at times, it knows the horror movie clichés, and it plays off them and kind of makes fun of them. There are lines of dialogue among high school teens about the rules of ""surviving a horror movie"", and of course they're all the obvious cheesy things that teens in old slashers do. It is neat to see a movie that does poke a little fun at itself, but not in an outright comedic way, it still is very much a serious horror. The cast did a fine job with their roles. Neve Campbell does a good job with the starring role of Sidney. Sidney is a pretty tortured teenage girl who has recently lost her mother. And Courtney Cox (Friends) is a journalist/reporter who is writing a book on the murder case of Sidney's mother and is also trying to interview Sidney everywhere she goes. The plot isn't too complicated, crazy killer on the loose and you don't know who it is and people are dropping like flies. The goriness in the movie is in some scenes necessary and in others not so much. The ending is pretty thrilling and I enjoyed that, I also really liked the very beginning scene, Drew Barrymore does well with her 5 minutes of recognition lol. It was a good scene to open the whole thing with. Set the tone.",Scream

Which Craven certainly knows his way with horror movies without making it too jokey. Then first-time screenwriter Kevin Williamson (Scream 2, The Faculty, I Know What You Did Last Summer) wrote an first-rate script.

Still ""Scream"" went on to be a classic with horror fans and some major film critics as well. But my favorite of the three movies is ""Scream 2"", which i think it's superior but that's my opinion.

The ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series did nothing for me, though perhaps that was because they took themselves too seriously. Craven not only scares us to death in ""Scream"", he sends himself and other horror films up brilliantly. Maybe a horror film cannot succeed without some comic element or a degree of self-parody. It's a theory.The cast do a great job as they work with Craven to tease us through this clever tale. Neve Campbell is the ideal victim, and Skeet Ulrich the perfect brooding boyfriend who is one of the early suspects, much to his chagrin. Courtney Cox plays the scheming journo super-bitch, and others such as Henry Winkler and Drew Barrymore drop by to add flavour to the proceedings.All credit though to Craven, who has reached the pinnacle of his genre with this effort.

This is a great movie, a great spin on the horror/slasher genre that is self aware and clever all while delivering legit tension and an incredible ending.The only downside, and it's kind of a big one, is the dialogue. We're dealing with high school kids here and seemingly every one of them is a horror movie expert. It makes sense for one character, but I do not buy that there are that many teenagers with this level of in depth horror film knowledge and knowledge of film theory.

You can literally see them as they are pulling it off all the way through. It's like knowing who Kaiser Sosay (I have no idea had to spell that) is at the end of The Usual Suspects or that Bruce Willis was dead all that time in Sixth Sense. You just can't help seeing it with a different perspective.I do seem to remember that I had no idea who the serial killer was when I first watched it. There were so many people to choose from - The Principal, Her Dad, Billy, Randy, Gail, Dewie, Her Dead Mum, The Cameraman, The Sheriff, Her Best Friend, Shaggy Doo or evening Sidney herself having special episodes? It could literally have been any of them or none of them at all and you could see motives for all of them to want to kill. So it was definitely a clever film for a first time view.As someone who is not a fan of scary films, I actually find this one really accessible for some reason. I don't know if it is the tongue in cheek way it doesn't take it self too seriously or because actually the characters are all kind of obnoxious and you don't really care who gets killed off, because you have no bond formed with them, but it just works really well.You can keep your Saw and your Human Centipede and even your Freddy Krueger et al, I'll stick with a simple story and the curiosity to know who did it.",Scream

93,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"A Classic, Modern Slasher",10,22 June 2019,"I remember when I first saw this film. I was still needing a babysitter and my mother rented this on VHS. I watched it and I was hooked. I've been a horror fan for as long sa I can remember, but I hadn't gone into the slasher genre yet. This started me down the path that I am on now. The official synopsis for this film is a year after the murder of her mother, a teenage girl is terrorized by a new killer, who targets the girl and her friends by using horror films as part of a deadly game.I have to say that this film was one that broke the mold. It took what happened in past horror films and poked fun at it. It also explained the rules and things that were done in them without the classics even realizing it. This one is great in that it has so many references to those same classic horror films.To expand on this notion above, it not only references them, but it makes you aware that despite what the characters say, they end up doing what they said they wouldn't. An example is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) says that the big breasted, blonde girl should run out the front door and not up the stairs. The killer then comes after her and she does exactly what she said not to, because her front door is locked. This meta-approach breathed life back into horror, even though it is something that now is a little bit overplayed.Something that I want to caveat here is that not everything that is established is correct. During one of the more iconic scenes where Randy (Jamie Kennedy) is stating the rules, he isn't fully correct. He claims the final girl cannot drink or do drugs, cannot have sex and to never say that 'you'll be right back'. Of course, just off the top of my head, Laurie from Halloween smokes weed and I'm sure there are other cases as well. This plays into the story of the movie so I understand why this is used.What I will say though is that the first time you watch this, I think the mystery is great. It had me guessing until the end. What also makes this film great is that it is good enough to be re-watched and it is fun to try to see how the killer did all these things after you know who it is. Not many films have the same type of rewatchability, but that is something that makes this one great. Even after seeing this movie as much as I have, I like to look for different things.I did want to say that Randy is a personal favorite in this film as he is me in my friend's group. I'm not as nerdy as he is, but I'm the one who loves horror. I love that his knowledge of horror actually has him point out who the killer is and he gives a motive for everyone. The reveal at the end also has something to do with the genre and I like what they did there. It pokes fun at the idea that was presented in courts around this time. The logic used here is interesting for sure.That isn't to say there are some issues with logic or some liberties taken. We get some things that are a bit too convenient. An example here is a bathroom scene with Sydney. There would need to be a lot of things that line up for it to work the way that it did. That's not to say this is ruined by it, but with how many times I've seen this movie, I'm able to nitpick some things as well.Moving away from the story, I'll go next to the pacing which I think is great. The film runs close to two hours, but it doesn't feel like it. You are sucked in with the characters and the mystery of the film, even after you know who the killer is. There is enough action, deaths and building of the story that it moves along at a great pace. Director Wes Craven nails it here for sure. Even the comedy in the film doesn't hurt it but adds to the film. It all culminates in an excellent ending.The acting is something I touched on, but I must commend the actors. We have a bunch of people who are relatively unknown aside from their television work at the time. Drew Barrymore was a star and she is gives the film the Alfred Hitchcock Psycho cold open. Campbell is great as the heroine. She is broken by what happened to her mother, but it also makes her strong. Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis is great. He seems like a good guy, but he has the creepy undertone from the beginning. Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers the sleazy tabloid reporter who as a history with Sidney is good as well. Rose McGowan, David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and Kennedy are all great for their distinct characters as well. There is nothing negative I can say about the acting.Next should be the effects and cinematography which are great as well. This was at the height of early CGI that doesn't seem to hold up. This film goes away from that by going practical. Since they took a more realistic approach, it looks good. The stabbings and cuts in the film seem like they are real. Even though Tatum's (McGowan) death wouldn't work, it still looks good. I have nothing negative to say here. The movie is shot every well which helps for sure.This film's score is also good. It has such a 90's feel to it, but it doesn't hurt anything. All the song choices are perfect. I did find it funny that decided to go early in the film with a cover of 'Don't Fear the Reaper'. It is acoustic and for the scene, it works. This is something I noticed within my last two viewings. There are some iconic songs that when I see the scene, I know exactly what the song is.Now with that said, this film is iconic. The 1990's are a rough era for horror fans as the quality took a dip, but I don't necessarily think that is the case. There are some iconic films from the era. This is one of them. This film helped breathe some life back in the genre. There is a great story here that even after you know the reveal, it is fun to go back to watch it to see how it could play out. It is coupled with great acting and the pacing as well. The effects and the soundtrack are also good. It help start up the meta look at horror that is still popular today. If you haven't seen this film, I recommend checking it out, as I think it is great and worth a viewing. It is even worth a rewatch if you haven't seen it in awhile.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10My Rating: 9.5 out of 10.",Scream
94,a_chinn,The original self-referential horror film is still the best,8,2 January 2018,"21 years later (wow, I can't believe it's been that long) ""Scream"" still holds up. Neve Campell plays a teen who's mom was murdered a year earlier by Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) and she and her friends are now being stalked by a new killer wearing a ghostface mask inspired by Edvard Munch's The Scream. What made this film stand out at the time was it's self referential humor that called out the many over-used tropes of 70s and 80s horror films. Jamie Kennedy's video store clerk character actually names some of them at one point in the film when the group is watching John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" stating that in order to survive a horror movie you must 1.) never have sex, 2.) never drink or do drugs, and 3.) never say ""I'll be right back."" ""Scream"" came out at a time when horror films were getting pretty tired and formulaic, so a film that called out the formula while also being scary and exciting in it's own right deservedly became a major hit, spawning three sequels and a TV series. Most horror films at this time were the likes of bad Chucky, Freddy, Jason, Howling, Omen, Amityville, Leprechaun, and too many other unwanted sequels to mention, so something original was very welcome (okay, the early 90s also had some good horror films too; Misery, Night of the Living Dead, Nightbreed, Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Tremors, Body Parts, Candyman, Lord of Illusions, In the Mouth of Madness, and The Frighteners, but far more of this era were garbage). This film does get credit and/or blame for spawning a spate of imitators that were equally self referential and winking at the audience, which itself got very tired and thankfully ended when more straight-faced of horror films took over again following Eli Roth's intense ""Hostel"" in 2005. ""Scream"" was directed by Wes Craven, who actually gets credit for helping establish the formulas Kevin Williamson's script mocks. Although the script is clearly making fun of these well worn horror formulas and cliches, it also has an affection for them, gleefully embracing the horror topes of everyone's-a-suspect, the-final-girl, or the-killers-not-dead to name just a few. The film also features a terrific cast, who were great at the time and is even better now, including Neve Campbell as the final-girl, Courteney Cox as a pushy reporter, David Arquette as a dopey cop, Henry Winkler as the principal, Linda Blair in a cameo as another obnoxious reporter, director Wes Craven as Fred the Janitor, and various teens include Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and Rose McGowan. There's also voice artist Roger Jackson as the memorable scary voice on the phone and Drew Barrymore is great in a Marion Crane-like cameo for the opening sequence of the film. Looking through the film's other credits, it was edited by Patrick Lussier, who'd go on to direct the underrated ""Drive Angry"" and co-write the surprisingly good ""Terminator Genisys."" The film was shot by Mark Irwin (who also photographed my kids' current favorite movie ""Descendants 2""), brining sharp fluid photogrpahy to the picture, along with a nicely consistent color scheme that's vibrant and also muted in a way that recalls the VHS horror films of the 70s and 80s. My main complaint about the film is that I personally do not like films that are so overly self referential and break the third wall. I prefer my horror film to be straight-faced, but this is forgivable given state of horror films at this time and also how sharp Williamson's script is at times. Overall, ""Scream"" is a suspenseful, clever, and witty mystery with a strong cast and loads of fun gory scares along with way.",Scream

I realize that for the premise of the movie-some violence needs to be there but cmon-after awhile, it was a bit much, scream was more violent then many regualr horror films! I think the movie's best moments were diologe driven-the showy emphasis on all the gore was overdone and done for effect and ditracted from the whole movie in general. I also felt the ending was a bit ridiculous and unlike the plot in general there was nothing brillient about it, it seemed thrown together. I'm trying to do as honest a review as possible because so many either loved or hated this and I'm in between-I definetly did not love it, but moderatly enjoyed it and am glad I saw it. I think they could have stopped with one though.",Scream
96,raulfaust,At the top of your lungs,8,26 September 2013,"Seventeen years passed since ""Scream"" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like ""Prom Night"", among others. It's important to remember that even thought ""Scream"" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change the way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Urban Legend"". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great ""Scary Movie"" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit ""Scream"" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.",Scream

98,Sandcooler,"It's cool, it's fast, it's loud",8,27 September 2008,"First of all, ""Scream"" is in fact a good movie, but is that really why it was so successful? I mean I'm pretty sure not even half of the audience picked up that this was supposed to be a satire of a bunch of movies they never saw. Really all they fell for was the old slasher formula, slightly updated. Hell it's not a bad formula. As a scary movie this doesn't work, since the killer is not menacing at all so there never seems to be any danger. Because there are just some characters that are not supposed to die, the killer at times becomes unrealistically weak or dumb, and that's something I could have gone without. But it's just so brilliant to have these people waking up in their own slasher movie having to follow a bunch of movie rules to survive, I could appreciate that. This is probably the nerdiest movie to ever make 100 million dollars. And also it's just good entertainment, does that garage door scene ever get old? The big downside to this, obviously, was the whole new wave of slasher. There's only a number of times I can see a bunch of ""Dawson's Creek""-rejects run for their lives while it's obvious who lives and who dies two minutes in. But this, I like.",Scream
99,gangstahippie,One of the best horror movies of all time! Wes Craven is a genius!,9,23 May 2009,"Scream was released in 1996. This was when horror films were losing popularity.Wes Craven, director of classics such as Nightmare On Elm Street 1 and New Nightmare, decided to make a semi-spoof horror film.Do not think of it as ""Scary Movie""(which was a spoof of this and other horrors), because it is not much of a stupid comedy.It's an actual horror film, but also an intelligent spoof of crappy horror films of the 1980's.The characters are self-aware of this and make fun of them.In one scene, a character lists what not to do during a horror film.Another character talks about the nightmare on elm street series, saying the first one was good but the rest sucked! These comedic elements are interesting in contrast to the rest of the film which is a decent slasher flick.The main plot is about a teen girl who'se mother was raped and murdered about a year ago.The case re-opens as another killer is on the loose.People are trying to find out who it was.The ending is definitely shocking, you will not expect it! The film was meant to kill off the horror genre, but instead made it popular again.Films such as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" were released, this one even spawned two sequels.Overall, I think it's one of the best horror movies of all time and you owe it to yourself to check it out.",Scream
100,slayrrr666,"Pretty good, but very overrated",9,27 September 2004,"'Scream' is at once a great horror movie and also one of the most hated films in the genre.**SPOILERS**A young teenager (Drew Barrymore) is viciously slaughtered, and shakes up her high-school. A group of friends, Sidney (Neve Campbell) her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) his friend Stu (Matthew Lillard) and his girlfriend Casey (Rose McGowen) start talking about how terrible it was and decide to throw a party to get the tension out. However, the kill has attracted big city news reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox, before she was Cox-Arquette) to town who immediately buts heads with town deputy Dewey (David Arquette). After Sid is attacked, Gail and Dewey decide to try to get along so they can help uncover the murderer. This proves very hard, as the killer arrives at the party being held and starts bumping off more teens, finally leaving Sid, Billy, Gail, Dewey, Stu, and local horror freak Randy (Jaime Kennedy) to stay alive in the killer's path. The killer reveals that s/he is also responsible for a back-story involving Sid a little over a year before.The Good News: Although it seems as though nothing more went on, that is it, and Kevin Williamson did a fantastic job with only those few scenes. He manages to get jumps and laughs coming pretty regularly in the short span, which is spread out over an hour and forty minutes. By sending up the genre, he gives himself more room to wriggle with than by simply parodying it. I feel this wouldn't have been as big if the film was like 'Airplane,' where it parodied the genre. The film does have some pretty scary moments, including my favorite when Sid is in the bathroom and she checks under the stalls for a person in the stalls, then sees the killer's boots and finally a long black drape come down to hide themselves, and she is forced to make the decision of either risking her life to get out or risk her life in a confrontation with the killer. A great moment and one of few really scary scenes in the film. I also love the whole ending, with Randy commenting on the movie he is watching while the killer is creating the same scene behind him, not to his knowledge, to the whole truth about the killings being revealed, to the final outcome. The whole party scene is great, with several deaths, a few false deaths, and a ton of blood. I do have to say that, while I am very good at guessing the killer the first time I watch one of these movies, it took a while for everything to click and I knew who the killer was. Some friends who also do that as well figured it out right about the same time I did, so it could through you off as well. It was also a nice creative twist to have a back-story that happened off-camera instead of being shown as the prologue to a film. Gutsy move and well worth it.The Bad News: I strongly believe this film is responsible for about 90% of the truly terrible 'horror' films out there right now. By poking fun of the genre within the genre confines is, at once a creative move, and the other a terrible idea because now you have the whole subgenre of horror films where everyone comments on the situation at hand by referencing it with another horror movie. It was nice the first time out, but now every horror film since has at least one person who will reference the situation with a famous horror film. It is very tiresome, irritating, and no one cares anymore. I blame 'Scream' for this trend, and for that I will not rate it above a '9' for that reason.The Final Verdict: Even though it spawned a whole annoying subgenre of the horror film, this is still a pretty scary film and at least deserves a look for anybody seriously interested in horror films.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence",Scream
101,vengeance20,Classic Slasher From The 90's!,7,12 October 2021,"Have seen the masks briefly when I was a kid & got into the Franchise since seeing Scream 4 in cinemas over 10 years ago, but this one was the first I saw after seeing Scream 4 & have to say it was & still is a good film.The film follows Sidney Prescott who having recently lost her mother Maureen Prescott to a rape & killing is trying to navigate life. But when a series of Ghostface killings start to emerge, Sidney becomes the prime target in this whodunit series as she, Deputy ""Dewey"" Dwight Riley & Reporter Gale Weathers try to figure out who is causing this killing spree.I found the film to be pretty good. It's unique in story, concept & characters & mimics/pi$$ takes typical horror film cliches seen in previous horrors before. While gory & features some impressive eye candy, it does lack a decent body count with only 5 dying in the 1 hour 39 minute film. It does have a good pacing & keeps you guessing till the end.It's overall a classic slasher of the 90's that all horror fans should love & enjoy.7/10.",Scream

The way screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven handles the various characters and where they're located with respect to each other while all hell breaks loose is like seeing a magical balancing act that could crash and burn at any time. After all, it's hard for anyone to die in a slasher if everyone sticks together in a big group, and it seems like having the third act take place at a big party is setting up the film for failure. But Williamson and Craven somehow finds reasonable avenues to break the characters away from each other instead of having them split up that's typical of these movies. Overall, it's easy to hate on SCREAM while watching it in today's climate, but the film is handled with a lot of class, intellect, and reverence that's still absent in many of today's horror flicks. Because of that, SCREAM remains, to this day, a cut above the rest.",Scream
103,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A genre-defining classic, 1996's ""Scream"" still holds up even now, 20 years later! Fiendishly entertaining, often hilarious and genuinely eerie when it needs to be!",10,14 May 2016,"It's hard to believe that 1996's ""Scream"", a genre-defining horror and satire, is 20 years old. Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson's masterpiece of self-aware thrills and chills was a landmark upon release, and redefined the world of cinema in a big- bad way inspiring not only its own legacy of three sequels and a recent popular spin-off television series, but also ushering in a new wave of horror films taking influence from its style and tonality as well as re-igniting interest in the genre as a whole after a decidedly dead period in the early 90's.But does the film, an undeniable phenomenon of its decade, still hold up all these years later? The answer is a resounding ""yes""!Following tragic lead Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the film follows a plot involving a psychopathic murderer tormenting a small American town. Seemingly obsessed with horror films, the killer first calls and torments his victims, often referencing popular horror and slasher films, before striking. High School Student Sidney, who is still reeling from her mother's murder one year prior, is having her own personal troubles, which are only made all the worse when it comes to be clear that she is seemingly one of the prime targets of the killer. And so, during a massive high-school party, the stage is set for a bloody, brutal (and hilarious) final battle against the mysterious figures that have been rampaging through town!The real reason the film is such a hit is the expert writing, Craven's direction and the absolute charm of the cast. In particular, I have to give high praise to Williamson's script, which is expertly refined and finds a pitch-perfect balance between self- aware comedy and fiendish horror thrills. The characters in the film have all seen the slasher flicks the killers are trying to emulate, leading to a lot of wonderful moments. Including a laugh- out-loud scene where Sidney explains the common rules of horror film bimbo's doing things like ""running up the stairs"" when they should be running out of the door only to see her ironically forced into the same situation. Or the iconic scene where supporting character Randy (Jamie Kennedy in what is perhaps his most well-known role) literally explains the rules of surviving a horror movie to his drunken party-going classmates while they hoot and holler and intentionally break the rules.Craven's direction perfectly compliments the wonderful screen writing. Craven, an icon who will be sorely missed after his recent unfortunate passing, was an authority in horror three decades in a row, he helped to define the direction the horror genre was heading, between ""Last House on the Left"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and this film. His sense of visual storytelling had a sense of class and his guidance in his cast and crew helped translate Williamson's fantastic writing to the screen almost flawlessly.And then there's the cast. Good lord is this a great assembly of performers. Neve Campbell is endlessly likable and identifiable as out troubled heroin. Supporting roles played by the likes of Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and Mathew Lillard are all great additions and give great justice to their roles. (Yes, even Kennedy and Lillard- who can be disliked in some circles, are excellent here.) And the film even introduced relative newcomers Courtney Cox and David Arquette to a wider audience with their scene-stealing roles as reporter Gale Weathers and Deputy Dewey Riley. Wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL cast!Heck, even the sort-of pink-elephant element of the film being ""so 90's"" (one of the reasons why some younger people I know are hesitant to give it a shot) lends to its charm, because it's such a refreshing time-capsule of nostalgia. This is one of those films where, despite the carnage, it'll give audiences who were alive in that decade a fuzzy sense of years-long-past. And it gives the film a further layer for re-watching and re-visiting, especially when analyzing and comparing it to other horror films over the years.It's without doubt a classic. Nearly without flaw. Still relevant to this day thanks to its wonderful observations on genre. And still fiendishly haunting and uproariously hilarious.""Scream"" is easily a 10 out of 10. And still very much well-worth watching for not only fans of horror, but fans of film as a whole.",Scream

Jackson. (R)High school student Campbell and her friends become the targets of a motivated mass murderer slicing up the small town of Woodsboro; the twist here is that these savvy teens have seen enough horror movies to know the ""rules"" for how to survive (no guarantee that any of them will consistently remember to follow them, however...). Hip, blood-soaked contemporary horror film revitalized the slasher genre, updating it for a new generation haphazardly defined by glib irony. Kevin Williamson's self-aware script and Craven's veteran directorial skill serve the material well; it's an imperfect concoction, to be sure, with the occasional cheap scare tactic, head-shaking implausibility, and a tendency toward overkill during the final reel, but it's overall a sharp, funny and sporadically suspenseful venture into genre cross-breeding. Though later rehashes and self-parody has diminished the impact, its opening sequence still ranks as a true virtuoso of horror filmmaking.

106,m-47826,Still great after all these years.,8,12 August 2020,"The Scream franchise couldn't escape the curse of badly handled sequels. It even makes it lean towards soap opera territory. And the first movie is, and will always be the best slasher movie to date. Yeah, I said it. Better than Psycho or even Halloween. Pop culture references aged a lot. But the rest hasn't. So it would be a shame not acknowledging that. It is still relevant, even the technology and fashion have a charming 90s feel, that is back in style lately. Kevin Williamson's script is very good. As well as Wes Craven's directing. Characters are three dimensional, and the cast is the best any Scream movie's ever had. The opening sequence is perfectly paced. And to the point. So the rest of the movie is too good to have your run of the mill slasher clichés. The fact that Fonzey himself played the principal, was a genius move. And adds to that retro-ness you sense all along. The humor is so self aware and subtle. You realize it was already a spoof, and didn't need one. Third act is necessary, but not my favorite part of the movie. It delivers and don't disappoint, but is also full of illogicalities. Neve Campbell gives her best to the Sidney Prescott character. That shot of « her » watching a picture of her and her mother, is both heartbreaking and haunting. Marco Beltrami's refined score enhances that. I'm doing a Scream movies marathon, and it is without a doubt the one that caught my attention the most.",Scream

108,sme_no_densetsu,A modern horror classic,8,4 November 2012,"By the time ""Scream"" was released in 1996, writer/director Wes Craven already had a couple of landmark horror films under his belt in the form of ""The Last House on the Left"" & ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". With ""Scream"", he teamed with screenwriter Kevin Williamson for a reflexive take on the slasher genre. The result was both a critical and commercial success.In a nutshell, the story revolves around a costumed serial killer who is murdering teens while eluding the police and creating a media frenzy. Not a particularly novel concept but that's the point. The screenplay plays up the conventions of slasher movies, offering a clever commentary on the sub-genre that's appealing even to those who sneer at the formulaic nature of such movies.The acting talent on board isn't half bad for a horror flick. The memorable opening features Drew Barrymore and there are recognizable faces everywhere you look, including Neve Campbell (naturally), Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan & Henry Winkler, among others. One note regarding the casting: Skeet Ulrich is such a dead ringer (sorry) for a young Johnny Depp that I have to assume that his casting was an unspoken nod to Depp's presence in the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"".As for the direction, Craven knows his way around a horror movie, so its no surprise that he supplies the movie with the requisite suspense. The movie also looks attractive and has a decent soundtrack to boot.Ultimately, ""Scream"" succeeds both as a slasher movie and as a satire of slasher movies. It's also pretty accessible, being not especially gory, at least in comparison to contemporary fare. Of the sequels, I've only seen the first two, neither of which rose to the level of the original.",Scream

Innovative, scary, funny, clever, smart, etc. Its definitely a movie that's one of a kind and a magic that will never be replicated. Taking all of our beloved slasher cliches and flipping them on their head redefined the horror genre in 1996 and no one saw it coming. Although I desperately was waiting for the films release not too many people were. It arrived that December with very little buzz and only a selection of mixed reviews. Made for $15 million and opening with only a little over $6 million it looked like a flop. But as the weeks went on and word of mouth spread and critics started seeing it. The reviews shot up and so did the box office. Ultimately making over $173 million worldwide. I'm happy to say that I got to experience the phenomenon first hand working at a movie theater. To this day the movie is still fantastic. It's truly a perfect storm from the fluid, accomplished direction from Wes Craven to the brilliant screenplay by My personal idol Kevin Williamson and a perfectly cast of actors giving inspired performances. Neve Campbell was without a doubt one of the strongest scream queens to grace our genre and of course we can't forget the charasmatic Courtney Cox or lovably dopey David Arquette that followed her through the excellent franchise. And of course memorable work by Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and more. Of course no one can forget the amazing cameo by Drew Barrymore.

110,Screen_Blitz,A clever and original slasher-horror flick that reinvented the horror genre,9,5 September 2015,"In the 1970s and 80s, Hollywood treated us with amazing slasher- horror flicks such as The Last House on The Left (1973), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and other lesser noticed slasher films. At the dawn of the 90s, the slasher genre was dying as Hollywood was failing to come up with anything new and was repeatedly recycling the same formula of the genre. This was until Wes Craven resurrected the genre with this unique, self-aware, teen- horror slasher film that parodies its genre with new elements, new twists, and new scares that many horror fans were not expecting. This film stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Scott, a 17-year old high school girl traumatized by the murder of her mother, who begins being stalked by a masked killer who begins taking the lives of her fellow school mates. Sound familiar? Just wait! The teenagers learn to survive against the killer's onslaught by using advice from horror movies by learning how characters in the movies become victims.Featuring a cast of Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Drew Barrymore, this movie drifts away from the typical slasher-horror clichés and comes up with new elements. Instead of having the characters make unwise decisions by failing to run out the door to safety while being chased it a killer, this film creates characters who are aware of their mistakes that characters from other horror films make and realize why the killer is after them. Like many horror fans, they also manage to point out every cliché that happens in a slasher movie like characters who are virgins end up surviving or how characters die because they fail to run out the front door instead of random places in the house. Basically, this movie is about teenagers who get killed from making a whole new set of unwise decisions. Neve Campbell does the great job as the main character. Then there is Skeet Ulrich who plays Billy Loomis, her clingy boyfriend, and Jamie Kennedy who plays Randy Meeks who is a huge move buff and is well educated on what goes on in horror movies. Many scenes where he makes references to other horror movies and establishes a set of rules in order to survive against a masked killer. These rules include: do not have sex, do not drink or do drugs, and do not ""I'll be right back"" before leaving somewhere. He is one of those characters who is really smart and has knowledge on how to survive a horror movie. Then there is the rest of the cast who demonstrate some great acting skills. Scream is one of the most original and clever horror movies. Like many slashers, it has the blood and gore that many gore fans come to appreciate. Overall, this movie succeeds at avoiding most (if not all) of the clichés that many horror films are known for. This is probably the best movie by Wes Craven in his career.",Scream

After seeing Scream a few times, it's not that scary anymore. I still think they are fun to watch but you know what's going to happen. I still really liked it though because like my favorite scary film Halloween, it could be real. These people don't get shot in the face and wake up. When that does happen, it is meant as a joke. If you think about it, the Scream trilogy is a bit of a joke because they sort of make fun of other scary films. Like, saying""I'll be right back"" is never a good thing to say because victims in movies usually go missing after that. They kind of make fun of that in this film. It's kind of funny.

112,baumer,And a genre is born.,10,14 July 1999,""" I want you to go down to the McKenzies house and call the police. "" Laurie Strode, from Halloween, Casey's mom, from Scream.As I have said in my various reviews of horror flicks, I grew up loving horror movies. Everything from the great ones like Halloween, Nightmare 1 and the early Fridays, to even the stupid quirky flicks like The Prey or Sleepaway Camp. There is just something sinister yet fun about an unseen force that tries to kill you for no apparent reason except that you are on his turf. I think Kevin Williamson watched the same films as I did and similarly appreciated them. Because what he has done here is write a film that is an homage to all the great horror films of the last 25 years. He treats all of us fans to great memories of films of years past and he assumes that he has an intelligent audience. There are so many horror movie references here that even I don't quite get all of them, and believe me I have seen a lot of horror films. But not only is the script entertaining, funny and witty, the film is scary. Not as scary as some of the films that it tries to pay homage to, but that's okay. Because you will have so much fun trying to pick out references to your faves that the scare factor is just a bonus. One of the most brilliant parts in the movie is when Randy pauses Halloween and explains the rules of surviving a horror movie if you are a character in it. Not only is it funny, but it so honest and sharp that when you listen to what he says, you realize that he is so right. And that is one of the great pleasures of the film.I admire a film like this. It is not afraid to take chances and it tries to give all of us former teens that made the genre so popular in the 80's, something to enjoy. I'm not saying that if you are under the age of 25 you cannot enjoy this, but believe me you can enjoy it a whole lot more if you are about 25-30. Because it is us who rented those films way back when. And to understand the references and the homages to films like Halloween ( 1978 ) the original Nightmare (84), the Friday's (80-84) you have to appreciate the films for what they are. And what they were and what they did was entertain and scare the hell out of us 15 and 16 year olds. And to remember that feeling by watching this film is reward enough to me. But then to have the film be so well done is an added bonus.Wes Craven is the perfect director for this film. I wonder is Williamson ever pitched this to Cunningham or Miner or Carpenter before going to Craven? I guess I am glad that he didn't because I think Craven adds some nice touches to the film. The cast is also brilliant. We all know the major one's involved here but I want to call attention to Mathew Lilliard. His portrayal of Stu is so amazing. He honestly should of received a nomination for best supporting actor. He took his character and added his own twist to him. And because of his tiny idiosyncrasies, he adds so much to the film. A subtle use of the tongue, the facade of hurt just by one of his expressions, a triumphant thrust of the arms, his laugh. They are all forever imprinted in my head as a great character study.This film started a whole genre on it's own, made a name for Lilliard and most everyone else involved, revitalized Craven's career, made Williamson a millionaire, made horror movies popular again and gave me hours of viewing enjoyment. Not just from this one and its sequel, but it made me go back and watch all the older films that I liked so much.You should do the same. And try to rediscover what was so fun about horror movie from the 70's and 80's. I have figured it out on a personal level, but have you figured it out on your own level? That is what makes horror films so much fun. Because they mean something different to everyone. Actually that is what makes film in general so profound.",Scream

The culprit was not apprehended. A lot of the attention of the film flows to Sidney, her boyfriend Billy, plus their friends Stuart and Tatum. Deputy Dewey knows Sidney from the year before.We see the same MO working against Sidney the next night. The perpetrator tells Sidney that her mother did not want to die. Billy gets arrested for it. Sidney gets to thinking about the two murder incidents, and the cops have a costume that looks like the one the perpetrator used.Gail Weathers and her hapless, overweight cameraman Kenny try to get the story first. Sidney cold cocks her, but apologizes the next morning. Gale, on the other hand, insists that Sidney's mother was a slut, and that Sidney identified the wrong man at the trial.Her classmates are more than a bit crude and insensitive. Two of the boys wear a Halloween costume that resembles the one used by the killer. Some of the girls speculate whether Sidney did the murders, and whether is was a pathetic cover up. The killer finds her in the girls' room at school, and Sidney gets away via some good scrambling.As the story progresses, the principal gets killed, Sidney's friend Tatum is killed, her boyfriend Billy gets knifed twice in the gut, Kenny gets his throat slit, and a couple more people get killed.When the guilty are revealed, it makes sense from the earlier parts of the film.

115,hnt_dnl,The teen slasher genre is re-born!,10,30 June 2009,"It's proved very difficult to re-boot long gone genres that defined early Hollywood (the Western, the musical, gangster films). There has been limited success of each case, but in actuality, only one genre has been (for better or worse) re-booted to extreme success in the last decade and that is the horror/slasher film. That success can be directly attributed to SCREAM (1996)! And not just the teen variety (URBAN LEGEND, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, CRY WOLF, etc.), but also films like SAW, HOSTEL, and a host of other horror films. Just base on influence alone, SCREAM deserves a place in the history of film.While SCREAM essentially references all the old 70s-80s slasher flicks (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Friday THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN), make no mistake, the film itself is a highly original, involving experience with a witty script, a solid story, and excellent performances. The film starts with former teen icon/idol Drew Barrymore (perfect in her small role as Casey Becker, her real last chance to play a ""teenager"" before time just plain takes over!) getting a ""wrong number"" phone call from a mysterious weirdo, who quizzes her about those famed slasher flicks and their villains (Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers). But this is no ordinary quiz: the caller has kidnapped and tortured Casey's boyfriend. If Casey doesn't answer the questions correctly, her boyfriend is dead and so is she. This opening scene is both terrifying and tongue-in-cheek.Cut to our story's heroine Sydney Prescott (a perfectly cast Neve Campbell from PARTY OF FIVE TV show fame). Sydney's mom was murdered a year before (the killer is in jail) and she lives with her father. Her boyfriend Billy Loomis (excellently played by Skeet Ulrich) is sensitive to her situation but wants to consummate their relationship. Their best friends are Tatum, Stuart, and Randy (Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, and Jamie Kennedy in solid performances). They soon find out about Casey Becker's demise and postulate who the killer might be and the motive. Of course, they reference every slasher flick known to man while doing it! Separately investigating the crime is Tatum's brother Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley and up-and-coming investigative reporter Gale Weathers (real-life couple David Arquette and Courtney Cox rounding out the perfect cast). Eventually, all parties collide at the climactic teen weekend party where the real culprit is revealed.SCREAM, while having a memorable beginning and end, also has an extremely solid middle act and that is vital. It is fun thinking along with the characters trying to figure out what is really going on. And the final reveal is a humdinger! But even knowing the ending, it is so memorable and well-executed that you want to watch over and over again. The modern day slasher flick all starts here with SCREAM!",Scream

118,Stampsfightclub,Sharp reflection of the concept of horror flicks will keep you screaming till the end,9,22 April 2009,"After the murder of her classmate, Sidney (Campbell) is stalked by an unidentifiable lunatic in a white mask one year from her mother's shocking death.Wes Craven's horror reflects on the past releases of classic horror to manipulate the genre into a highly creative slasher movie that will make you guess and gasp right until the gob smacking climax.Named as the film which spurned the continuous parody releases in modern times such as Scary Movies and Epic Movie etc the 1996 shocker has perhaps been shunted aside as it resembles an easy target for such ridiculous parody releases. But the important thing to see is a sharp and witty film that showcases horror in a thrilling fashion.Opening with an anonymous caller and a horrible murder and we are plunged head first into a story about survival against the insane. There are twists, shocks, jumpy moments, horrible deaths and some gory sequences that will make your stomach turn. So what you might ask is different from every other horror film? For starters Scream is set out to be a lighter version of horror. Throughout the 111minutes we see humorous references to other ""scary movies"" including Nightmare on Elm Street, The Exorcist and Halloween, all established classics in the horror market. All finely executed with that degree of teen subtlety that makes charming and acceptable viewing. I have never watched any of the titles mentioned but this was thankfully not necessary as brilliantly, this film is all about the sheer concept of horror.As Jamie Kennedy's character clearly identifies, there are certain rules to survive a horror film. What follows are references to this humorous theory and the intertextuality from the other releases are used exquisitely to emphasize the point made.Performances wise Neve Campbell is perhaps the star, very quiet but also aggressive. Her anger scene with Courtney Cox was brilliantly funny.Where Scream fits the horror genre easily, there is a high degree of drama. The fact the murders are happening a year from Sidney's death makes everything more fragile. The romantic inclusions add to the intensity and the sustained threat places Scream into the thriller genre also. Cracking mysteries likewise as we are guessing right till the very end.Craven's direction serves up waves of screaming action and his creation of the masked murderer is now a legendary icon. His picture really is a scream.",Scream

120,Bob-45,SCREAM? BARF!,4,7 June 2001,"WARNING:  The following is slippery with dripping sarcasm and MAY contain spoilers:Thriller Movies 101:Rule 1. If a major movie actor is listed following `and ' you can be         pretty confident she WON'T be in the sequels. Rule 2. If someone in the top three billings is the second person to be attacked, you can be pretty certain that person will get away and WILL be in the sequels. Rule 3. If the person getting top billing plays a peripheral character, you can be pretty confident he will figure prominently in the climax. Rule 4. If you are going to kill someone in an especially gruesome way, make sure it looks real.   The disembowelment of Drew Barrymore's boyfriend looks especially phony (guts are blue and don't appear attached to the OUTSIDE skin); and, although Drew's corpse looks real, she does NOT appear to have been eviscerated, though the dialogue tells us she was. Drew's sweater would have been shredded and soaked with blood and body fluid..   NOTE TO WES CRAVEN:  Play your movie side by side with any of          the especially `juicy' `X Files' episodes, preferably one involving autopsies or chest popping aliens.  THAT'S how to do it RIGHT, Mr. Craven.A few points to ponder:1. People who live in isolated areas generally have guns and know how to use them, unlike spoiled, snotty, Hollywood actors who can afford bodyguards and abusive boyfriends.2. Would ANYONE, even one with the IQ of a Hollywood actor, race out on a front porch to challenge a threatening stranger without some kind of weapon, ESPECIALLY after two acquaintances have been killed horribly?
3. These days people generally have screened-in windows, even on the second floor, ESPECIALLY fathers with nubile teenage daughters.4. A smart person who manages to get an armed assailant to the ground will kick him in the HEAD (preferably the BACK of the head) as well as in the groin.  Just about anybody kicked ANYWHERE in the head more than once is not likely to get up.  Of course, had our intrepid actors done that, we wouldn't have a movie; and in SCREAM, everyone behaves just as stupidly as he or she would in any other dumb ""splatter"" movie.
NOTE TO DREW BARRYMORE:  In ""Scream,"" for once, your hair looks great; you should return to that color, style AND hairdresser.  Just as important, you were BORN to wear tight sweaters.  Please do it more often.",Scream
121,khanbaliq2,Scream single-handedly resuscitated the teen slasher genre for the media-saturated 1990s.,9,2 September 2010,"In Scream a cine-literate serial killer stalks and murders a series of teenage girls. The film revitalized the slasher film genre in the late 1990s, similar to the impact Halloween (1978) had on late 1970s film, by using a standard concept with a tongue-in-cheek approach that combined straightforward scares with dialogue that satirized slasher film conventions.Scream is a 'meta' slasher film, and one which certainly knows whereof it shrieks, functioning as a superior example of the genre it's spoofing.

Though I still do think Scream 2 is better, this is good too, even though this is the second time I watched this one.

124,ivo-cobra8,The best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's my all time personal favorite in the horror genre,10,18 February 2018,"Scream is the best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's and it is my all time personal favorite film in the horror genre. I love this film I always did and I love to death! It was really the first movie that introduced me in to ""horror"" genre slasher films. It was directed from my favorite horror master Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It is a horror mystery like was Friday the 13th and April Fool's Day. Scream deserve legendary status. The movie spawned three sequels and the TV series that I did like. Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan work for me. It is about a high school teenage student in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer known as Ghostface who kills teens and who uses his obsession with scary movies. The first one is the best in the series and it is still one of the best horror films of all time. Wes Craven borrowed and used Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street mostly scenes for this movie. It mentions a lot of cult classic horror movies and till it's day it is still praised by fans. I enjoy this film I always do. This is my movie and my personal opinion! Scream follows the teenage girl Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who becomes targeted by a psychotic killer dressed in a ghostface mask who uses his obsession with scary movies. David Arquette plays police deputy, Dewey Riley who helps protect Sidney and Courtney Cox plays tabloid reporter, Gale Weathers. This is one of Craven's best along with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" that redefined the genre and Ghostface has become another popular slasher since. ""What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?"" Ghostface is one of the most popular and really scary character. The mask is so scary before new year on Halloween day I saw the mask putted on a front seat in the car and i was so scared, I thought it was the killer waiting on me but it was only a mask but a scary one. The Story begins after two high school students are murdered by the serial killer. Sidney Prescott becomes next victim of intelligent serial killer, Gale Weathers reporter and journalist is shure that serial killer is the same person who murdered Sidney's mother one year ago and now he's terrorizing Sidney her self. Deputy Sheriff Dewey wants to investigate the murders by himself, but attractive Gale seduced and confused him, so it's up to Sidney to find the killer, before he kills again to find the truth, she will must kill. I love also the characters: Matthew Lillard as Stu Macher, Rose McGowan as Tatum Riley and Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks. Great story and great soundtracks. I watch this movie thirty times and is still the best, I watch with my mom as a teen good times. I love the script the dialogues in this movie, I love Drew Barrymore as Casey Becker in here.10/10 Scream deserves a legendary status it is my personal favorite horror slasher film from Wes Craven in the franchise. I have the whole collection on Blu-ray discs and I have the first three movies on VHS tapes. I love this film to death I love it!",Scream
125,The_Movie_Cat,"""If this were a scary movie I'd be the prime suspect.""",7,12 November 2000,"In the later stages of Scream Neve Campbell lambastes the heroines of horror movies, claiming it's always ""some big-breasted girl who can't act."" Well, Drew Barrymore might fill part of that quota, but she certainly can't be accused of not acting in the best twelve minutes of the whole trilogy. This is Scream as it should be: self-referential in its dialogue, yet genuinely scary too. This ""lone girl in the house"" trick is pulled off twice, and works both times, though thereafter the film degenerates into self-satisfied smugdom of the highest order.There's perhaps a little more bad natured humour than might at first be evident, too. I remember laughing with friends at the humble reference Barrymore makes to Craven's back catalogue, when talking about Nightmare on Elm Street being scary. ""Well,"" she replies, ""the first one was, but the rest sucked."" However, closer inspection shows that Craven had little input with many of the sequels - he wrote and executive produced the third, but had no involvement with any of the others. What would seem to the majority of the viewing audience to be a modest slice of self-mockery is actually a bitter filmmaker venting his spleen.But the major praise heaped upon Scream is that it's what film students call ""recursive"". It's a horror movie about horror movies. It acknowledges that some horror movies aren't real, so therefore maybe it could be, blah de blah... Of course, all this could be quite fun were the point not made with sledgehammer subtlety. How many times does the word ""movie"" occur in this mov- film, anyway? Every two seconds someone's asking someone else who would play him or her in a movie, or claiming ""this isn't a movie"" only to be met with ""Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie, it's all one great big movie."" Errrrr... is it a movie?From the second half, beginning with the irritating video store scene, things start to get awry. No longer is the film scary, just roaming around it's own backside. For the last hour the film serves not to scare with occasional reference, but to show us all how ""clever"" and ""ironic"" it is - or thinks it is. The whole idea of satirical endeavours is that they're finely tuned and discrete, Mr.Williamson. Carving a script that goes ""ha ha ha we're in a movie, it's just a movie, it's like an old horror movie don't you know ha ha ha is this a movie I think it's a movie it's like a movie"" does not make you a candidate for Jonathan Swift's line of ascendants.I probably enjoyed this more when I saw it on release. At the time Scream was probably one of the few horror films I'd ever seen, and so 90% of the references were lost on me. But now I've learnt a little more their gratuitous crow-barring into the dialogue really grates. You can almost imagine film nerds sitting there with a mental checklist, ticking them off one by one million. Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Oh, my sides! His surname is the same as the Doctor's in Halloween, and Halloween features in the film, too! And it's also the name of a character in Psycho, and we reference that too! And he looks a lot like Johnny Depp, who was in Nightmare on Elm Street; Wes Craven's other horror-revitalising movie. What a rib-tickler!!) enters, to be slated by another character ""what's leatherface doing here?"" Wait a minute - tee-hee-hee, snigger, chuckle! - wasn't Leatherface a character in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Well, I say! That really is superb!! What devastating wit! Ha ha ha! Oh, let's cap it all off by tossing in a reference to Carrie, and maybe you could talk about Jamie Lee Curtis being a scream queen. Oh, this is marvellous stuff!Next, we get the much-touted ""rules of horror films"" sequence. If you have sex you die, if you drink you die... etc., etc., etc. The lovely Courteney Cox is watching all this backslapping goo on a hidden camera and concludes with ""Uh... boring!"" I quite agree Courteney. The problem with this ""rules"" scene is that the ""rules"" it exposes are nowhere near as clever or as revolutionary as they would like to assume they are, merely blatantly obvious. Only a pea-brained idiot would comfortably sit there going ""Oh, how clever! I never realised that before!"" Craven, who holds a Master's Degree in Philosophy, justifies the whole genre towards the end with: ""movies don't create psychos. Movies make psychos more inventive."" Is that the best you can do? Don't get me wrong, the genre has been unfairly derided, particularly in England, and Wes is a good spokesman for its plusses. But is that really all he could think of to say? Perhaps he was too busy, and hey, lest we forget, he didn't write the script, but this rollercoaster of smug inanity trundles on with a ""can you guess how this movie is going to end?"" bore-a-thon. Wes did try his hand at writing similar stuff two years prior, with New Nightmare. While this seems to be destined to be regarded as a ""proto-Scream"", it's actually the better film, and showed that Wes didn't need Kevin Williamson half as much as Williamson needed him.Linda Blair does a cameo; a character peers into a mirror while saying, ""after you branded him the Candyman?"" It really does get very, very tiresome. As a historical document, this film will never lose its validity. It opened up a whole new subgenre within the field, albeit a short-lived one that has already passed. It is also made horror popular again, almost single-handedly upturning the fortunes of many genre directors. But as - I'll say it - a movie, it has sorely dated in under five years. Where it was once fresh and sparky, now it's glib and passé.Inevitable sequels followed, the second being arguably better. The third, written by Ehren Kruger after Williamson had moved on, was fine, but lacked impact. Maybe it was the familiarity of the characters, particularly the constipated expression of David Arquette (Who it's now impossible to take seriously after seeing his character reborn as ""Doufus"" in Scary Movie) and the hard-as-nails attitude of Cox. Moreover, it was a film whose time had now passed, and, the biggest irony of all, it failed to last as long as the movies it lampoons and unwittingly resurrected.",Scream
126,fernandoschiavi,"Scream manages to get his message across, moving between horror, suspense and comedy, with many references of the genre. Everything is done with balance and subtlety",8,24 July 2021,"Scream manages to mix horror with a kind of dark humor, which is yet another innovation for the genre, which would be copied over and over again as in I Know What You Did Last Summer and in Urban Legend, both written by the same writer of Scream, Kevin Williamson. The film tells Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a teenager with a life somewhat disturbed due to the brutal murder of his mother, when she was younger. Despite this, Sidney has a normal life, has her boyfriend, her best friend and is a good student in her quiet town of Woodsboro. But one day she arrives at school and sees the police and local TV's, interviewing students. A student and her boyfriend had been brutally murdered last night. After that a series of murders starts to happen, and Sidney is the main target of the killer.Throughout its 111 minutes of duration, Scream brings many references to the horror genre that go beyond the murderer's questions on the telephone. In the school hallway, the janitor who quickly appears wears an outfit similar to the classic costume of Freddy Krueger, the villain who propelled Wes Craven to success in the 1980s. Linda Blair, the eternal little girl from the stupendous The Exorcist, appears as a reporter, even if their participation is minimal and without any narrative function. The opening sequence of this film is among the most memorable scenes in North American horror cinema. These are chase minutes that emulate a whole generation of movies and their clichés, techniques and character archetypes. A true greeting that marks the transition of the genre to a new era. The protagonist of this moment is none other than Drew Barrymore, a cinema icon, who in his few minutes of life makes reference to the classic ""The Nightmare Hour"" (also by Wes Craven), revering the feature and humorously criticizing his countless sequels. Another reference in this opening passage is the classic 'When A Stranger Calls', a film about a young woman terrified by a psychopath who threatens her over the phone, someone who is supposedly inside the very house where the girl is babysitting.Moving from laughter to screaming in a few minutes, the film reveals its spirit in this brief introduction: it is not because it is a satire that the deaths will be less violent or repulsive. And the probably great protagonist of Drew Barrymore dies gutted right in this prologue, a choice made by the actress herself, who had the role of Sidney in her hands before deciding to play Casey and shock viewers into an early death like Janet Leigh's in Psycho (1960). Every character in Scream seems recurrent in the horror genre, but here they're fueled with surprisingly witty and entertaining dialogue that serves as acid commentary on the conventions of cinema made to shock and frighten. At the very first meeting of the main group, they discuss their connections to Casey Becker and the possible motives of each for having killed her, demonstrating the lack of sensitivity and youthful empathy that remains one of the main themes of the franchise. Kevin Williamson assertively balances references, tributes and reinventions in his script, in an original approach that would serve as the basis for so many other teenage horror movies.The rest of the characters are also ""stereotypes"" in the majority with the highlight being Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox), a sensational reporter who does everything for a story. Her scenes are endowed with an almost satirical humor to the media circus around violence and she herself is not the most charismatic person off camera. But it is used by the script in order to criticize the heightened prominence that the media gives to serial killers, as it is clear that in that situation, the victims are no longer human and become just a means of personal promotion for the reporters. Thus, causing an extreme dehumanization in these victims and making the lives of survivor's hell without privacy or empathy.Characters such as Casey (Drew Barrymore) and Tatum (Rose McGowan) function as explicit vehicles for the critique of slasher's clichéd and conservative values. They're both blonde and pretty, so they're also the classic favorite victims of killers in most movies of the genre. Aware of this, both satirize the stereotype and are never reduced to a sex object and male delight. However, as complex human beings, they perish in the struggle for survival, each in their own way.On the other hand, Sidney is the legitimate protagonist of the franchise, keeping one of the great eighties horror legacies; the ultimate girl. However, she is a character who moves between submission to clichés and breaking paradigms. Minutes before her first clash with the villain, she judges the victims who run upstairs to their homes, rather than fleeing the killer through the front door, but soon afterward she is forced to perform the same action on her own account. Imposed circumstances, showing that not all attitudes are simply inconsistent, but often necessary. In the final stretch, as we approach the end, Sidney subverts one of the most conservative stereotypes of the genre. In the sequence in question, we follow Randy - the nerd - trying to explain the rules of horror movies, comparing the situation they are living in to John Carpenter's classic Halloween. In one of the dialogues the importance of virginity is mentioned so that the female characters survive in the end, making a direct mention to Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), parallel to this the edition intersperses this moment with Sidney undressing for Billy in one of the rooms from the same residence. This scene is even constructed without exposing or objectifying the actress's body.The direction of photography is predominantly focused on dramatic shots, especially the use of close-ups, but unlike other horror films that use this technique to preserve the mystery around the scene, in ""Scream"" the main purpose is to highlight the interpretations, allowing us to judge who was possibly lying and was the psychopath behind the murders. The art direction is simple when we think about the composition of the sets, and explores common environments of general daily life, such as school, home, and for a moment, the police station. That said, we don't see many settings that demand more than simple, and important, narrative coherence. Now when it comes to costumes, we have excellent choices, with different looks and full of vivid colors that represent the individuality of each personality present in the film. In particular, the only one with shades of black is the iconic villain, Ghostface, who through a common fantasy, creates a legendary figure that remains alive today in film history.With Scream, Wes Craven proved, once again, that he knows how to manage a suspense plot well. Responsible for abyssal reflections in A Nightmare on Elm Street and in the social terror The Hills Have Eyes, the director has always known how to charm films that could be fiascos in the hands of other directors. The director builds the suspense scenes with a tone drawn to exaggeration, it is noted that he directs the film using the conventions of the genre, but with a difference for the fact that he understands what he should show in the scenes. The film's opening scene is the biggest example of this, all the tension between Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) and the murderer on the phone is slowly taken care of. You find yourself doubting the seriousness of the situation at times and that's why it's so good, because he knows how to manipulate the audience's emotions well. This feeling of manipulation is something recurrent in the narrative, as the identity of the killer is something of constant debate between the characters and Craven at all times gives indications of several suspicious people, but there is always that internal feeling of doubt, even more considering that the characters are stereotyped in the extreme and one of them may not be your real persona.Both critical and box-office hits, Scream revitalized the genre and became a successful franchise, echoing the slasher fever that emerged after its release. We can really understand the reasons for success. Smart, shrewd and fun, the film demonstrates how horror is a fruitful field for a mix of entertainment and social criticism. After riding the slasher's hit wave with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984), Wes Craven returned to directing this legendary film, which criticizes several previous works, and sets a milestone in cinema. The director manages to get his message across, moving between horror, suspense and comedy, without much difficulty. Everything is done with balance and subtlety, like a true masterpiece. We're talking about a classic slasher horror, which even years later, still manages to be fun and clearly well executed. It is a landmark that reveres a subgenre that had a ""shy"" beginning with the revolutionary Psycho, and fell completely into the general public's liking through Halloween, in 1978. Scream summarizes this era and its legacy, through a good story and outstanding characters.",Scream

128,cchase,"Third Time's The ""Harm""...",8,4 December 2008,"By 1996, horror films were at a low-ebb again in terms of originality and the number released in theaters. But as this always happens every few decades or so, a young hotshot director and/or writer shows up with something that shakes things up again, if only temporarily.However, in this case the ""young upstart"" was actually an old hand at the game. Wes Craven had ""rebooted"" the genre twice before, with the uncompromising LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, and then again with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. And how would he launch a new trend in horror? By tapping the talents of a then sizzling-hot 'new' writer named Kevin Williamson, the creative force behind the hit teen dramedy DAWSON'S CREEK.What made the first installment of SCREAM so unique, is that it took all the conventional rules of horror that an entire generation had learned by seeing ""FRIDAY THE 13th"", HALLOWEEN and Craven's own ELM STREET series on home video, and gave them a playful, self-referential tweak. And the twist started with an opening sequence that horror fans are still talking about to this day.Hitchcock stunned the movie world back in the Sixties, by killing off his lead heroine halfway through the classic PSYCHO. Craven and Williamson took his established rule and ran with it, going the Master one better...by killing off the 'heroine' in the FIRST TEN MINUTES!If it had been some bit player from a soap or a sitcom, the scene wouldn't have made much of an impact. But it's DREW BARRYMORE, an immediately recognizable face playing the doomed Casey Becker, who learns the hard way not to play 'Horror Movie Trivial Pursuit' on the phone with a knife-wielding psychopath...especially if your answers are WRONG!The audience is then thrust into a slasherific whoddunit as a group of Casey's classmates, all relatively unknown actors at the time, try to figure out who's doing the killing...and who may be next, all the time aware that they are in their own ""real-life"" horror movie, where the killer knows the rules as well as they do.And as if to underscore the irony, there are several prominent cameos that are a nostalgia and/or trivia lover's dream, from Linda Blair and Henry Winkler, to Joseph Whipp (who sort of reprises his brief role in ELM STREET) to the director himself (look closely).It was a surprising and engaging way to ""freshen up"" time-tested horror conventions, and even now, ten years later, it still holds up pretty well. Only many of the actors have moved on to become bigger stars (Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Courteney Cox-Arquette, husband David Arquette, Liev Schreiber) or major players in Tinseltown as well, (Drew Barrymore, Jamie Kennedy).The brilliant scenario dreamed up by Williamson and Craven then is something of a cliché now, (with the satire parodied again in the SCARY MOVIE franchise), which somewhat explains the current lean of Hollyweird towards remaking classics and B-movies alike. Nothing this original would really surface again until a few bright sparks burst on the horizon, like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or Lucky McKee's challenging MAY. Which brings us to where we are now.Pop in a copy of SCREAM today, and enjoy your ride ""back to the future"" of the genre.",Scream
129,ajs-10,Enjoyed it a lot more than expected...,8,28 May 2011,"I have been recently reading a lot of reviews of the latest film in this series, Scream 4. Now, for one reason or another I have never seen any of the 'Scream' films before well not all the way through anyway. Time to change that I thought and so here we are with the first one, Scream. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, it doesn't take itself all that seriously and there's an awful lot more humour than I expected.We open with a mysterious voice calling up a girl called Casey, who is home alone about to watch a scary movie. She tries to blow him off but he is persistent and eventually begins to creep her out. Things don't end too well for Casey, or her boyfriend, Steve, after a masked assailant has finished with them. We then switch to another girl, Sidney, her mother had been murdered almost a year ago and her father is about to leave on a business trip. All the talk the next day at school is about the murder and on returning home Sidney receives a call from a man with a mysterious voice. She isn't so easily scared, but still she is attacked by the same masked assailant. Having fought him off, her boyfriend, Billy turns up just before Deputy Dewey. Having found a cell phone on him, Dewey arrests Billy and Sidney goes to stay the night with Dewey's sister, Tatum. As time goes by the bodies begin to mount up and this attracts the media, particularly ambitious reporter, Gale Weathers. It's only a matter of time before Sidney is to be the next on the list, and anyway, there's a score to settle and an awful lot of suspects.This made a refreshing change for me, a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time has all the scares and shocks of a more serious one. I liked it! Decent performances all round; Neve Campbell did a good job as Sidney, as did Skeet Ulrich as Billy. Also of note were Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Matthew Lillard as Stuart. Also nice cameos from Drew Barrymore as Casey, Wes Craven very briefly appeared as Fred the Janitor and Henry Winkler as Principal Arthur Himbry.There is a great soundtrack too, including an interesting acoustic rendition of 'Don't Fear the Reaper' when Sidney and Billy are first seen on screen together (very nicely done). I suspect, unfortunately, that the other films in the series may not live up to this rather good beginning, but we shall see If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a viewing, even if you're not really a fan of teen horrors (like me) Final verdict: Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",Scream
130,TheNorthernMonkee,witty entertaining original chiller,8,9 August 2005,"SPOILERS Horror is one of the most varied genre around. Handled well and you could be looking at multitudes of weak inferior sequels, handled badly and you could be looking at multitudes of dire sequels. Either way, the world is going to suffer when you create a fresh story. Written in 1996, no film is a better example of this than 'Scream'. Refreshing and original, it was a superb film primarily because of the fact that it rejuvenated a sickly direction. Whilst authors like Steven King were writing excellent books, the adaptations were often weak, at the same time old series like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' were stale and beyond saving. Horror needed a new direction, and by bringing teenage life into the equation writer Kevin Williamson did this. Creating a clever and witty story, Williamson and legendary director Wes Craven brought fresh life into a fading genre and managed to give us one of the finest teen based stories for decades. An entertaining film, with some outstanding butchery, 'Scream' is a pivotal film which you can't help but enjoy.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is your typical teenager when her mother is murdered. Beginning the film never fully recovered Prescott's past comes back to haunt her when a killer in a white mask begins to slaughter her friends.'Scream' is one of those movies where the intelligence which went into writing it is so easily ignored. Beautifully written, it is in effect a satire of the entire Horror genre. It manages to poke fun at the thing it is actually resurrecting. With a killer wearing a mask based on a famous painting (and a film title to match), certain aspects about it are just magnificent. Whether it's Drew Barrymore's brief cameo or Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy analysing the rules of horror, so many moments are memorable and entertaining. Few spoofs are ever that long lasting, but by inverting the idea and actually poking fun at itself, 'Scream' manages to guarantee itself a worthy place in the history books.True there are flaws, the acting is dire, one or two lines make you groan in disgust, but these flaws feel like they are intended. It's like Wes Craven knew that to do a true horror, certain 'flaws' had to be implemented, and it's hard not to admire his skill at matching Kevin Williamson's magnificent story with equally stunning direction. Craven is a Horror God, and with 'Scream' he proved once more how clever he really is.Until 'Scream', Horror was terminally ill. Old and tired, it had no new ground to really cover. Suddenly though Williamson and Craven built a new road. Making a joke out of the genre, 'Scream' managed to put a nail into the old style of horror design and simultaneously give life to a new direction. It is a landmark film and is a joy to watch. Bloody entertainment at a new level.",Scream
131,swilliky,Started the 90s horror boom,7,14 August 2016,"Sparking the late 90s campy slasher film boom, Scream terrified audiences in 1996 as Wes Craven puts his hand to serial killers. The meta-movie explores the horror tropes with a certain self-awareness that adds to the horror and inserts comedy, defying the clichés and stating the rules. The story embraces the genre and doesn't shy away from the overly campy nature of a murderer stalking teenage girls in a small town.The story begins with the iconic phone call as young teen Casey (Drew Barrymore) is home alone. The conversation delivers the iconic line ""What's your favorite scary movie?"" before diving into dumb victim choices and gore. This murder brings back the media to the town of Woodsboro that experienced a previous flood of reporters a year early with a mysterious murder. Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is still struggling with her mother's death as a new killer stalks her. The film contributed further to the horror genre with the ghostly masked killer who was not an unstoppable force, but stumbling human that could be knocked down and outrun. Surrounding Sydney are potential suspects including her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), her lustful boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Tatum's boyfriend Stuart (Matthew Lillard), and film buff Randy (Jamie Kennedy). The killer slices through victims including the Principal (Henry Winkler). There are some gruesome deaths including a garaged door, a television, and, of course, a knife.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Scream
132,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,A superbly chilling satirical commentary that compliments the horror tropes really well,10,27 October 2019,"To be honest with you all, I was only a kid at the 90s and wasn't allowed to watch Rated R movies (though I've only watched the Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Friday the 13th movies over my pre-teen years and I've seen a PG-13 Rated flick on VHS ""The Mask""), but the moment I came across this and decided to do a marathon of all four of these films, I understand why this left an impact when it came out in 1996.All the stuff it got right. The acting from everyone involved especially Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott) who made an interesting protagonist along with other actors like Drew Barrymore (Casey Becker who gets killed in the most iconic opening of all time) and Matthew Lillard (Stu Macher) and Skeet Ulrich (Billy Loomis) along with Courtney Cox and David Arquette is great, the pacing is very brisk and doesn't feel dragged or overlong, the music score from Marco Beltrami fitted the atmosphere and tone of the film authentically, the writing is really thought-provoking, funny and chilling and the death scenes are so creative. Even the directing from Wes Craven (the guy who directed A Nightmare on Elm Street, another great horror movie) is really neat.And most importantly, it complimented on the horror tropes really well. The way it satirizes the clichés from horror movies alike such as Halloween and others in which a female character becomes the final girl and sole survivor against a horror killer only this time to let a female character fight back against the horror killer is done perfectly.Overall, Scream is another example of a 90s movie that stood the test of time, but not only that. It's without a doubt one of the best horror movies ever made since Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street. With my recommendation to those who haven't seen it yet, give this one a go. It's worth it! :)",Scream
133,movies2u,This is one of the best slasher films out there!,10,10 June 2001,"""Scream"" is practically the best slasher film out of all of them (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, etc). The movie delivers a chilling plot and story, and makes you think your being watched by the murderer in the ghost costume. Wes Craven did an excellent job on the directing. The acting was very good. Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Drew Barrymore, Courtney Cox and David Arquette did an excellent job in their roles. This movie is very creepy and very good. It makes you think there is a killer stalking you. If you are a movie person I recommend ""Scream"", especially to horror fans. The movie is well done the acting is great, the filmmaking is excellent, and the movie is just plain great! This is a classic horror movie for anyone who has interest in horror films! This is my favorite slasher film out there. The movie is great! You should DEFINETLY rent this movie if you stop by your local video store. I'm sure any video store carrys it. This is the best slasher film in the world! This is a highly recommended horror fans! It is great! I give it a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!",Scream
134,Jack the Ripper1888,I can blame this movie for many things.,7,14 April 2002,"SCREAM was a slasher flick that is responsible for regenerating the teen slasher category. If it weren't for this film, we would never have seen CHERRY FALLS, FINAL STAB, and many other movies that never should have been brought to the screen. FINAL STAB is one audiences could have lived without seeing. So, looking away from that, what else can I blame SCREAM for? A lot. My reoccuring nightmares maybe!!!! Just kidding. This was a movie that, like so many movies these days, but isn't. The first time I saw it, I was afraid about what would happen next. When the movie ended, I was yelling at myself for being afraid. Because there were no scary moments of this movie. PLOT: masked killer walks around cutting people up, right in places where you would think that someone nearby might hear all of what is going on, but no. That's about all. So, for being no different than any other horror movie made since the 70s, I give this terrible piece of cinematic value 2/5",Scream
135,Atreyu_II,A scream,5,25 May 2011,"This movie is a return to the slasher genre after it got somewhat ""asleep"" for some years. And it ""woke up"" again with this scary, scream of a film.The movie is scary from the start. What begins as a flirtatious but apparently harmless phone call from some guy turns out to be frightening. The guy begins to make strange questions and calls back whenever the girls hangs up the phone and makes serious threats. Soon very disturbing and gruesome things happen.More of these nightmarish events happen through the movie. The phone caller is disguised with a ghost mask on his face. The most unexpected surprise is that there are actually 2 ""Ghostface"" assassins. The movie is a nail-biter until the end as many terrifying events continue to happen until then.A dull terror/horror movie, but probably a landmark for those who appreciate the genre because it meant a return to the genre, particularly teens.None of the actors are great, although Drew Barrymore has probably her best acting in this small role. Neve Campbell is okay but I appreciated more her prettiness than her acting skills.",Scream

137,rebeljenn,not scary,1,2 April 2006,"Typical plot for a horror film. A group of teenagers are being murdered by someone who dresses in funny costume/masks. The deaths are pretty horrific, with plenty of heart-racing chase scenes and gory, creative deaths. This film seems to have gathered a cult following, probably because most people did find this film to be horrific. However, when I saw the film, I just laughed at the antics and the character dramas unfolding. It is suspenseful, and it is gory, and most people did consider this frightening. However, if you do not like this type of film or are looking for something a little more than a cliché, then do not bother with this one.

138,EijnarAmadeus,Scream is a modern teenage-horror-classic,9,1 August 2007,"Wes Craven's SCREAM quickly became a staple in modern horror history, the movie took everything we beloved from the 70ties slasher movies and turned it into a humoristic flick which contained just as much nerve and blood-spilling as its inspirations as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH. The teenage-setting of the 70ties movies may have been even more realistic, in a world where bad girls got punished by the killer for being naughty, and the ""un-flowered-girls-will-be-killed"" plot is just as intact here in SCREAM. The frights are dead-on, never being sloppy or clichéd, they are tightly directed killings that surely will get you blood pumping. Neve Campbell is great in the main role as Sydney, as she is the only one who truly manages to battle the killer (popular named ""Ghostface""). And the movie was a groundbreaking take at the horror genre in the 90ties as the movie kick-started a bunch of teenage-slashers, making it a pioneer for exactly this genre for being both the first and being the best. SCREAM fits perfectly a Friday night with friends, as the movie is truly made for those teenage-gangs who're out for a fright, as it encounters them and faces them with its brutal slashing of themselves.",Scream

143,raymond-15,A slasher film that's a cut above the rest,8,11 July 2005,"Horror is not my preferred theme in cinema so it's no surprise that ten years have passed before I decided to have a look at this blood-bath of a film.It's about a masked serial killer who decimates a group of high school students knocking them off one at at a time while they party around a television set watching horror films. There's a lot of running and chasing and locking of doors and threatening with up-raised daggers. All this action is scary at first but eventually you get used to it and take it in your stride.The opening scene in which Drew Barrymore alone in her home at night answers the phone to an unknown caller is quite frightening as he whispers instructions in a threatening tone. This sets the mood of the terror that is to follow. We learn that it is inadvisable to venture outside on a dark night or neighbours could find your gutted body strung up in the nearest tree next morning! There is another scene which I found very scary. One of the girls finds herself locked in a garage with the masked killer and there appears to be no means of escape. Suddenly she sees the doggy door at the bottom of the roller door and she attempts to squeeze her slim body through the opening. When her hips gets stuck, the killer activates the roller door and her dangling body is drawn up with the door. Horrible to behold! There is a lot of realistic blood-letting in this movie and characters are drenched in gore. This is as it should be. Not like most movies where a thrust of a dagger leaves not much more than a relatively tiny stain on the clothing.I'm surprised that reviewers have not paid more attention to the character of Billy Looms. Admittedly Skeet Ulrich does little more than stare unrelentlessly into Sidney's face at very close quarters, but just watch his eyes and ask yourself could you trust this character. He convinced me that it is not necessary to shout and scream and threaten with a knife to create a tense scene. Just a smouldering eye contact well-done can send shivers down your spine. And Skeet is a master of this technique.As I said, horror films are not for me. They are usually laughable. I have to admit though that this is one of the best.",Scream

145,Geeky Randy,What More Could A Horror-Buff Ask For?,10,2 February 2001,"What more could a horror-buff ask for?  `Scream' has it all.  Movie trivia, movie spoofs, twisted ending, twisted beginning, talented actors/actresses, a great motive, lovable characters, and even scary the second time you see it. `Scream' is about a young girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is trying to put her life back together after the brutal murder of her loving mother, a year earlier.  The accused murderer, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), is locked up and is waiting for an appeal to be put to death by the gas chamber. Out of the blue, these mysterious killings start to happen.  The nosey, local news reporter, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), is scooping out this mystery of why these killings are starting.  Weathers believes that Weary is innocent of the murder of Sidney's mother.  Sidney disagrees.  But Gale Weathers isn't too far from proving Sidney wrong. So, is the real murderer getting nervous, about getting caught for the murder of Sidney's mother, and the framing of poor Cotton Weary?  Is the murderer going to try and frame somebody else for the murder of Sidney's mother after Weary is proven innocent, like.Sidney, or even Sidney's father? Is that why there is a killing spree?  Sure, why else would the murder want to reveal Weary's innocence?  If the murderer doesn't do something soon, (s)he'll be caught.  So (s)he wants to throw Weathers off track. Though we wonder what the killer with do next, we also wonder.who is the killer?  Could it be Sidney's boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich)? Sidney's best friend, Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan)?  Tatum's brother, the town's deputy, Deputy Dwight `Dewey' Riley (David Arquette)?  Tatum's boyfriend, Stuart (Matthew Lillard).  Sidney's secret admirer, the town's mastermind, who knows everything about everything, Geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy)?  Or even Gale Weathers herself?  (Gale is money hungry, and seeking for fame, maybe she could use a little publicity, you never know.)  But I tell you, the killer is great and surprising, with a fantastic motive. I did not see any problem with this movie, except for a couple bloopers (which no movie doesn't have), so I give it a 10/10.  (And I'm the kind of guy who watches stuff like: `Citizen Kane' or `The Godfather)!",Scream

Casey then realizes the killer has her boyfriend tied up outside and she has to answers questions to stay alive but when she fails he gets gutted and the killer strikes and comes after Casey, stabbing her cruelly 7 times then hanging her up outside with a piece of swing rope against a tree for her parents to see.This was a brilliant opening to the movie and Drew Barrymore plays it down to a te as the terrified victim.We then meet the main character Sydney Prescott played wonderfully by Neve Campbell, the lead heroine, we see her alone in her and getting a visit from her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), then it cuts to the school and we meet her friends Tatum Riley (Rose McGowen), Stu Marcher (Matthew Lillard) and Randy Meeks played brilliantly by Jamie Kennedy as the horror nut and the love slave of Sidney.The movie just keeps getting better and better after the cool opening, and down to the final climax between killer and heroine.The case are excellent, Courtney Cox is great as the bitchy Gale Weathers, the reporter you love to hate and David Arquette is also great as Dewey Riley.The kills are quite effective in this movie, girl gets gutted at the beginning, another girl gets her head crushed by a garage door, a guy gets a TV on his head and even the Principal gets it.Overall a welcome return to slashers.",Scream

149,eibon09,Over-rated Nonsense,2,10 April 2000,"No matter what critics or anyone else say, I think that this film is not good at all.  The scary part about this film and the series is that it has probably made more money at box office then the unholy trinity of Italian Horror(Dario Argento, Mario Bava, & Lucio Fulci) has ever made in their life.  One problem is its poor attempt at being humorous.  Scream(1996) is a popular film because many people are desperate to see a well made horror film.  The acting is below average and technically, the movie is unimpressive and uninspired.
Its a shame that Wes Craven sold himself out to do this overbearing ""horror"" film.  This was made for a generation of people who have no idea of what a great horror film is or what makes them scary.  The whole thing is formulatic and genetic when it comes to the movie itself.  I prefer the slasher flicks of the early 80's to this movie and its clones because they were filled with better murder scenes, more gore, and a lot more evil villains.

From the opening sequence to the somewhat silly closing cliffhanger, it is one of the scariest productions of the past several years. Now, about the opening sequence, it features a penetrating Drew Barrymore receiving prank phone calls from a man with a deep, mysterious voice, who becomes more and more conversationally aggressive as they talk. ""What's your name--because I want to know who I'm looking at."" After building up some very effective momentum, the scene has a heart-stopping climatic payoff that isn't only  pointless gore, but terrifying suspense. It is moments like these that make ""Scream"" one of the best movies of 1996. 	""Scream"" centers on a high school girl named Sidney Prescott, a modestly productive young woman who spends much of her time alone and with her boyfriend, Billy. She is approaching the anniversary of her mother's murder, whose killer has been convicted and sentenced to death. Sydney's school is in the process of mourning the brutal murder of two fellow classmates, and the pupils aren't exactly sympathetic.One night Sidney is home alone, and receives a phone call similar to the one in the opening scene. Sidney is tormented in that call, and after an exchange of a few unfriendly words, attacked by a dark individual wearing a white ghost mask. She fights him off, however, and lives another day, much in regard to the mysterious appearance of her boyfriend and a young, squeamish cop named Dewy. 	The presentation of Sidney's life is not one-dimensional. The overlook on her schooling experiences, classmates, relatives, friends, and teachers are all believable. Strongly supporting the character are the details and sub-characters. 	It is nearly impossible to watch ""Scream"" without making a list of assumed suspects to the numerous killings that take place. Here is my prediction list of murderer suspects, not telling who, if anyone, is the correct guess:· Dewy, the young police officer who suspiciously shows up at nearly every crime scene, and has somewhat of a psycho personality.· Sidney's boyfriend, Billy, who is actually sent to prison for a short period of time after being accused as a prime suspect. He also appears at a crime site unexpectedly.· Sidney's  father, whom has motive for murder and is nowhere to be found locally.· A crazy video store clerk who is obsessed with scary movies and who I forget the details of. 	Another element that makes ""Scream"" so great is the content of the murders. The victims aren't just helpless plot puppets waiting to die like a mannequin, but real people who want to live. Each puts up a good fight in defending themselves, and several nearly escape the killer. The characters who die are often unexpected, members of the main cast--making this production unpredictable. 	The performances are electrifying in Wes Craven's highly acclaimed horror film. The actors act with dramatic intensity and the characters are perfectly cast. Each character is explored with suspicion, and due to Craven's direction, the villain's identity remains a mystery until the lazy finale. I am an experienced filmgoer, and I thought that I had the killer picked out at mid point in the film. But I was so wrong--the film had me fooled all along, and that is not an easy thing to do. I had no clue of who the killer actually was. ""Scream"" contains so many twists are turns that by the end of the movie, I couldn't have correctly predicated the killer's identity if my life depended on it.

153,moviesleuth2,"Well done, but it doesn't work like it's supposed to",7,27 November 2007,"There is no doubt that this movie not only caused a resurgence in slasher movies, it completely changed the way they work. For a movie to do that, it has to be very good, and I applaud ""Scream"" for its ability to do so (though I'm getting kind of tired of the style it created for a few reasons which I will list here).""Scream"" is your standard slasher movie, albeit with a few major differences. First and foremost, it is a curious mix of scares and comedy, which I will get to later. Second, unlike most slasher movies, it's pretty smart. The characters do dumb things, but they talk smart, and the fact that they still do dumb things makes it pretty funny sometimes. Finally, it's well done. It all seems very fresh and nothing is sloppy or hammed up. Very welcoming.The plot is standard, but given the purpose of the movie, that's what it should be. It's a slasher movie that pokes fun at itself and the earlier entries into the genre, so it's only natural that it takes this route. Basically, a costumed psychopath is stalking and brutally murdering local teenagers (after they drink or have sex, and/or do stupid things...again, part of the joke). But it centers around one local teen, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is of course, not without a dark past.That's pretty much it. Sound familiar? It should. Again, that's the point. But what rises it above the level (significantly) is that it knows what it's doing, and isn't trying to hide it (therefore not assuming its target audience is dumber than the characters that inhabit the worst entries into the genre). The characters are actually pretty intelligent (thanks to the smart script and the solid acting across the board), and even know the rules of the slasher movies, and of course the people who laugh at the warnings die gruesome deaths by making the mistakes that they were warned about (again, it's being funny and scary at the same time).Now about that purpose I was talking about, the fact that it's aiming for both laughs and scares, sometimes at the same time. It's certainly ambitious, which is rare for a big studio, and unheard of for a horror movie, especially a slasher movie. However, I have to admit, it doesn't work like it's supposed to. The laughs dilute the scares for the most part (though there are a good few creepy moments). The beginning scene with Drew Barrymore, is excellent, though not very scary. Still, it's commendable for how well it's done. I admit that I didn't see the final twist coming, which is kind of surprising (and probably should be rather embarrassing) since it was probably meant to lampoon the feeble attempts of the same obligatory task that was made by its predecessors. Then again, movies like ""Scream"" are typically not my kind of movie. But it's a modern classic of sorts (as close to it as a mainstream movie will come), so I had to check it out.While it doesn't work like it's supposed to, that doesn't mean it's a waste of time, not by a long shot. ""Scream"" may not be the best horror movie, but it's undeniably engaging, and never boring. I was always involved in the movie, and its interesting tone helps a lot. It's a fun movie, in a way, but it still manages to be pretty dark and grim. The recognition for that goes to Wes Craven, rightly known as one of the masters of the genre. He puts a lot of effort into the movie, and it shows. His goal is clearly not to have the most brutal deaths and the most sex, booze and gore he can cram into a single movie (though there are significant amounts of all of them and then some). He loves what he's doing, and wants to make it the best he can, and for his part, he does the best that can be done with the material. The new mixture of laughs and scares not working is not his fault, it's the concept that doesn't work. That statement is proved by all the future horror flicks that try to use the same method, which has long worn out it's welcome (even though it never really came).The acting isn't that important, as it's not that kind of movie (slasher movies aren't supposed to be). That said, all the acting is believable, and serves the film's purpose solidly.Writer Kevin Williamson is clearly very talented, especially since this was his first script. He is an idea man (something that is almost extinct in mainstream Hollywood), and he has about as much know-how and as strong of a love for the slasher movie as Craven himself.Speaking of, Wes Craven deserves most of the credit for pulling this movie together. Again, this movie doesn't quite work like the filmmakers had perhaps hoped, but it could have been a complete mess. Applause goes to Craven for preventing that. Actually, he makes it work well enough that almost none of the horror movies these days aim for just scares, which is kind of a shame now, because after 11 years, I kind of miss those movies.Do I recommend it? Sure, just know what you're going into. If you're going into it expecting a pure scarefest like ""Halloween,"" you're probably going to be disappointed because that's not what ""Scream"" offers. It's a slasher movie that offers a commentary on itself. Now that's something you don't see every day.",Scream

""Scream"" was a tribute to many slasher films but using a special mark, the dark humor. A smart mysterious thrilling script, great performances of Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette, and a great direction make of ""Scream"" a gem of the slasher subgenre and one of the best horror films of the 90's!

155,movieguy1021,Scream: 8/10,8,7 August 2003,"Scream is in the same category as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They've been parodied so much it seems like the movie is just a parody of it. Scream is a parody, but an unfunny parody, of the teen slasher flicks of the 80's, such as Halloween and Friday the 13th. In it, a masked killer runs around trying to kill a helpless teenager in a quiet, idyllic small town. Unlike, say, A Nightmare on Elm Street (which was cleverly referenced with `Fred the janitor'), Scream actually had some good scary parts to it, making it a great horror/slasher film, which it didn't want to be.Sidney (Neve Campbell)'s mother was raped and murdered a year ago. Her father is going out of town. A masked killer has already killed Casey (Drew Barrymore) and her boyfriend, and it looks like Sidney's next! Nobody's safe from the masked killer in the famous mask (based on Munch's `Scream' painting), but it's up to Sidney to figure out who he is and why he's killing everyone. I'm not a huge gore fan (but I am a huge Gore fan, pardon the political `humor'), but I'm not squeamish, and I wanted Scream to have a little more gore, but I wasn't complaining. Red was abound but not realistic (I'll get to that later), but I'm happy that Wes Craven didn't go for the PG-13 audience. This would not have worked as PG-13.What makes Scream so scary is that it's more realistic than other slashers. The killer kills in a realistic way (such as, not attacking in dreams), and the victims fight back, knocking out the killer. The killer is real, not some fictional being that exists in the head of the teenagers. The acting is very good for this type of movie, with the standout being Barrymore, who's billed high but is only in a little bit of the movie. Also, I liked all of the horror movie references, and how it's sort of a huge meta-reference. Overall, Scream is a screamingly good time that won't disappoint.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong graphic horror violence and gore, and for language.",Scream

157,Min111,It's the best in the series,7,16 November 2017,"It's the best movie in the series - Scream. It's also scary. If you're into scary movies, Scream is the movie for you to see. Scream is what reshaped horror movies back in the nineties. It's one of the best horror movies to have come out from that decade. The movie is for adults. Scream is a horror, mystery and thriller movie. I liked the part at the beginning, and I've never seen an introduction quite like that. That's one of the best parts of the movie. I actually wanted to see more of high school student Casey Becker in the movie. She's the only character I wanted to live along with Sidney Prescott. It should've been someone else in her place otherwise that scene or part was perfect. That's just my opinion. I say that because Casey Becker is a very attractive girl. Scream would've been more better had Casey Becker had a major role in the movie. She only has a minor role. She was played by Drew Barrymore who is a very popular actress. Sidney Prescott, whose name I've already mentioned, happens to be the main character. She's targeted by the mysterious killer known as Ghostface who uses horror movies to play a deadly game. I just like how scary Ghostface looks, especially with the knife in his or her hands. That mask is scary. In fact, the entire costume is scary. It's one of the best costumes to wear for Halloween. I was a kid when Scream came out, and that masked killer scared the heck out of me. I was too frightened to see it. I had to wait till I was much older, but I still found it quite scary. Scream is unlike a lot of horror movies out there. There were quite a number of people that died in Scream that I lost count. You need to see the movie to find out. The only thing I didn't like in Scream was that it's clear who the killer was. I wasn't surprised at all. That still didn't stop me from liking the movie. In fact, I liked it a lot. But it could've been better. Scream is a horror classic. Scream is different watching it the second time around compared to the first time I feel. There happens to be a sequel called Scream 2 which I think is more scary than Scream. However, the first movie is still the best.",Scream

It's fitting to let Wes Craven direct this film, it's basically an dedication movie to all the great slasher films of the 80's. The first 15 minutes of this film are amazing, the rest is tight, it just never holds up to those 15 minutes. The film is well casted and well written and there are a lot of great moments for horror movie buffs. Wes Craven has had a long career in horror films and he deserves a big hit such as this film.

161,RossRivero99,A weird horror movie that is very good in its own right,8,3 August 2017,"Wes Craven's ""Scream"" is a truly original horror film with a very original plot that wasn't even thought of before it was made, though it is very creative it isn't perfect and most movies aren't. The movie opens with a high-school girl named Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) who is home alone in her house making popcorn and is about to watch a movie until some sort of creepy voice calls her on her cell phone asking her questions that are related to horror movies such as ""What is your favorite scary movie?"" along with ""What was the name of the killer in Halloween""?"", and ""Who was the killer in ""Friday the 13th""?"" numerous times after repeatedly hanging up on him, and then he says to her that if she hangs up again, as well as gets any questions wrong he will kill both her and her boyfriend Steven, and unfortunately both of them get killed by a serial killer dressed in some sort of ghost-grim reaper costume. The next day her whole school in shock and grief after hearing about the murders. The next person on the serial killers hit list is a girl who was a friend of the victims named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) whose mother was murdered approximately a year earlier and fears that she might be next, and as a result is staying over the house of her best friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan), and also being guarded by a local Sheriff's deputy by the name of Dewey (David Arquette), while also being stalked by a journalist named Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who wants to ask questions about her mother, and how she is doing after the murders happened, and as a result of that her school principal (Henry Winkler) suspends school for reasons of curfew until the serial killer is captured by the police. But however I will not spoil anything beyond this point which will practically give away the entire movie due to the major plot twists towards the end of the movie. During the movie however Craven and his screenwriter Kevin Williamson do a very good job of messing with people's heads by making people think that a certain person committed the crimes and then constantly make us think that it was a different person every few minutes. Craven's direction and Williamson's screenplay are very good and well balanced but could have been better with a lot more tension and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock once said to ""Always make the audience suffer as much as possible."" Which is what I feel like is lacking here. There is no question the Craven was one of the most popular horror filmmakers of all time along with George Romero, James Wan, John Carpenter, James Whale, Tod Browning, and many others. However this movie did make me more excited to see other horror films by Craven such as ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977), and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984) which may be much better films to watch, but then again that's just me.",Scream
162,LoneWolfAndCub,Wes Craven Has Made A Brilliant Horror/Comedy,9,25 September 2005,"Wes Craven (Nightmare On Elm Street and Last House On The Left) has done a great job with this horror. The horror genre became crap at around the time of the 80's. All we got were crappy rip-offs or sequel after sequel. Friday the 13th has 10 and Halloween has 8. It was about time for someone to come along and save the horror genre.The plot here isn't hard to follow at all. A killer in a ghost mask is killing of teens in Woodsboro High School. The story follows Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her life that is practically ruined. A year ago her mother was raped and butchered and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is pressuring her for a better relationship. All she needs is a killer that appears to be targeting her and her friends which include Tatum (Rose McGowan), Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Stu (Matthew Lillard) and Dewey (David Arquette). Also included in the bunch is Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), a reporter who reported on Sidney's mother's death.This horror/comedy is really one of the only great horrors of the 90's. It has tried to be duplicated but never bettered. The acting is great in this, the music chilling and the directing fine. The other great thing is this doesn't take itself seriously. This is a parody of the horror movies in the 70's and 80's. It has typical clichéd situations and many horror fans will recognise references to Halloween, NOES, Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The movie is filled with plenty of scares, especially the first 12 minutes, and is filled with plenty of gore. The climax is well played out and the killers identities are unexpected.4½/5",Scream
163,LebowskiT1000,An ok film...for horror.,6,27 August 2002,"First of all, I have to admit that I am not a fan of the horror genre, there are a few that I really like, but for the most part...not a fan.  With that said, let me get on with the review.I thought ""Scream"" was an ok film, it had a lot of good things going for it, but there were a few things that just didn't sit well with me.  Overall, I thought the story was actually pretty good and quite suspenseful.  The comedy was also just spectacular in the film.  The best character (hands-down, no contest) in the film is Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy)! His character and the way he says things totally made the movie for me.Alone with Jamie Kennedy, the rest of the cast was pretty good as well. Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Winkler all did great jobs with their characters.Like I mentioned earlier, the story is actually pretty good in this film. The only complaint that I have is that there are a number of murders and killings that take place in the film that are completely useless (I guess that defines a horror film).  For instance, it is never explained why the killer kills Drew Barrymore and what she has to do with the entire story....maybe that's cause she DOESN'T!!!  I just don't like that they always seem to throw in a killing here and there that have nothing to do with the story, just an excuse to have another gruesome death scene.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  There were a few other problems I had with the film here and there, but nothing I can't deal with.If you like horror films, and especially if you like teen-slasher films, then you should definitely see this film.  If you are like me, and just like the occasional horror film, then you may also want to check out this film. If you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",Scream
164,OriginalMovieBuff21,Wes Craven's best film,9,1 November 2005,"Scream is about a dressed up serial killer who stalks teenagers in a small town in California. I think this is Wes Craven's best film he's ever done. Nightmare on Elm Street is a great movie but intentionally, I think Scream is his best. This movie isn't really scary and is actually more funny than freaky, with a good amount of funny lines. There aren't much scary scenes besides the opening scene with Drew Barrymore and the hanging, which I thought was the freakiest part of the movie. There is a couple jumps in the film and the ending was the coolest part of the movie, revealing the killers and all. Overall, I think Scream is a classic thriller and is Wes Craven's best film to date.Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-",Scream
165,asda-man,Send yourself a copy,10,25 August 2011,"I'm a sucker for a slasher. I even like the bad ones like ""Halloween: Resurrection"" and ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" but to me they're really fun and often have a really cool twist ending. So when an actual good slasher comes along, I'm all over it. As soon as ""Scream"" starts with its tremendous opening, you know you're in for a really fun and interesting film with originality. ""Scream"" ticks all the boxes and is probably the best slasher film ever! Wes Craven's known for his ""Nightmare on Elm St."", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and such. All have been OK, but I think Wes has really found his place in the teen slasher genre. He makes it fun and original with the help of the excellent writers who are actually really clever at creating irony plus funny lines and characters.The thing that holds a slasher together is its characters and ""Scream"" has really memorable characters. Courtney Cox is a delight as the originally annoying TV presenter that eventually turns into someone who we actually really like. David Arquette is also really funny as Deputy Dewey the policeman. In fact the whole cast is brilliantly fun, including Matthew Lillard who is suitably hammy as the friend of the group.Aside from the memorable characters and sharp wit, ""Scream"" is also really exciting and suspenseful. There's even a chase scene that lasts a good 15 minutes. A rarity where nowadays its a quick 2 second chase in the woods. The cinematography and camera movements are also really interesting. The camera sometimes has this dream-like quality to it that suits the film really well. ""Scream"" never gets dull, it's tense and exciting right up to the shocking end twist that really fulfills your expectations.""Scream"" grasps you by the throat from the minute it starts and doesn't let go. It's memorable and really exciting fun. If you're a fan of slashers like me then ""Scream"" should be at the top of your list. The sequels are quite good as well, especially the incredible latest instalment ""Scream 4"" that is probably on par with this incredible original. Horror fans should also really appreciate the references to classic horror films throughout the film. Don't answer the phone, don't open the door, just go onto ebay and click ""buy it now!""",Scream
166,oOoBarracuda,Scream,3,17 October 2016,"In what should have been the ultimate homage to the horror genre, Scream turned out to be a disjointed look at how horror movies are often perceived. Directed by horror master, Wes Craven, his 1996 film followed a high schooler as she copes with the brutal murder of her mother when it seems as though her killer has returned to terrorize her town. Starring such 90's stars as Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette, Scream towed the line between horror brilliance and comedy quite unevenly. It was this disjointed dance among genres that left me far less impressed with Scream than I intended to be, especially having been directed by the man who gave audiences my personal favorite horror franchise, A Nightmare on Elm Street.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) a high school senior grieving her mother's senseless murder is stunned when it seems that, just before the year anniversary of her mother's death, the killer is still terrorizing the town. Sidney's world is rocked to its core when the ones closest to her begin being slaughtered in the same senseless fashion as her mother was killed. When the murders keep happening, police begin to suspect that the wrong person may have been convicted of Sidney's mother's murder, and begin to suspect Sidney's father. Convinced that her father is not the murderer, Sidney along with the help of the lead officer on the case, Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) begin to comb over all the case details in the interest of protecting Sidney's father and finding who they believe to be the copycat murderer. Their task is made none the easier by the constant intervention of Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) a money-hungry television reporter who wrote a book about the murder of Sidney's mother, which did little to endear her to Sidney. The more murders that take place, the more the killer's motive looks to be nothing but a game. Initiating the killings with a phone call and a quiz to save their lives, police must learn the identity of the killer before their game runs out.I wasn't sure what took me so long to see Scream. I am a big fan of the horror genre and had heard that Scream turned the genre on its head and was a fun mystery slasher for horror fans. A couple of poor casting choices and genre jumping, however, ensured that Scream will be a movie I only view once. I have never liked Matthew Lillard in any film I've seen him in. It's a personal problem, I know, but with him having a prominent role in Scream, I could hardly avoid my distaste for him by engulfing into any other actors. Also, the casting of Henry Winkler, as the principal of the high school, in a caricature of his most famous role as Fonzie from the Happy Days was an interesting maneuver. In a way, I admire the choice, as it's not likely those in the audience see Winkler without thinking of his iconic role, but it also pulls you out of the movie a lot to see him doing such an exaggerated caricature unrelated to the film. The other nail in the coffin of Scream was the senseless jumping around between a serious mystery of discovering the identity of a brutal killer, and a cheap laugh grabbing comedy. There were no smooth transitions between the comedy and the drama leaving the film a disjointed mess. A severe disappointment, Scream is a one-time viewing for this reviewer.",Scream

Horror movies were dead in the early nineties where we didn't have characters that can scare us, but that made us laugh. Not only were people in America were starting to label video games but actually went to family movies rather than horror movies. Scream is a resurrection of the horror movies, where the film itself is a parody of horror movies and understanding the rules of who lives and who dies.The film's prologue begins with Drew Barrymore as a driven sex teenager who gets an anonymous phone call from a mysterious man that says he's going to kill her and her boyfriend if she doesn't cooperate with his scheme. They play movie trivia on horror movies where if she answers one right, the game continues, if she answers wrong, he dies. The boyfriend dies either way, so now it's up to Drew Barrymore's character to escape or die; the killer appears in a black costume with a white mask along with a sharp knife chasing her and than mutilating her body.We move on to the film's hero Sidney Prescott, (Neve Campbell of ""Party of Five"") an average high school bookworm who hasn't lost her virginity yet as her boyfriend Billy Loomis wants her to open up to him (you know what I mean); her father is leaving on a trip for the week, leaving Sidney by herself since her mom has died.The next day, its total chaos at Woodsboro High where reporters are all over the incident, questioning students, teachers or anybody who knew the death of Drew Barrymore's character and her boyfriend. Even Sidney's friends Tatum (Rose McGowan), Steward (Matthew Lillard), and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the movie freak, find it all to be a big horror movie.One night, Sidney receives a call from an anonymous stranger and asking her what is her favorite scary movie. It's a dark and raspy voice just like the film's prologue where we don't know who the person is. It's the same murderer who killed Drew Barrymore's character and is now after her; Sidney escapes this time but the killer will return again.To quote Randy: ""Everybody's a suspect!"" Indeed the whole town is suspected after Billy Loomis had been taken in by authorities, because of a cellular phone he carried. Now a curfew has been placed, with people getting killed one by one, especially a new clue involving the anniversary on the death of Sidney's mother. The final showdown is taken place at Steward's house where the mysterious murderer is revealed with a twisted ending.""Scream"" is not a horror movie, in general, but a homage where everything we see is a reference to most of the popular movies from ""Evil Dead,"" ""Halloween,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""When A Stranger Calls,"" ""Psycho,"" and many more.

Everyone's a suspect in this case.In the mid-90's 'Scream' was released, and after disappointing horror flicks, was able to produces a new type of horror movie. A type which hadn't been seen for a long time. The great thing about 'Scream' is the concept of it. It's not just a horror film, but also a spoof of previous horror movies. Countless references to the behaviour of characters in previous horror movies add to the enjoyment of this movie. Everything you would think of when watching a horror film (and still do now) was addressed, such as what type of character died. Wes Craven changed these and created a film with characters who could actually be unpredictable. Another great thing about this film, is the fun behind figuring out who the killer.

Neve Campbell's film career took off with her role here as Sidney Prescott, the young high school girl who's a target of the killer that does practically the same thing Michael Myers did in ""Halloween"". In the midst of all the gory murders, there's delightful bits of comedy. David Arquette  (Dewey) and Courtney Cox (Gale Weathers) provide alot of the humor, as do Matthew Lillard (Stu), Jamie Kennedy (Randy), and Rose McGowan (Tatum). Even Henry Winkler has a funny bit part as the principal. Williamson (his first screenplay) became such a hot item after the success of ""Scream"", he followed this with ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Scream 2"", and ""The Faculty"". All these movies were either big or modest box office hits. And as for Wes Craven, this is probably his best film to date. I liked ""Scream"" better than his earlier hit, the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (which was good). Craven would eventually follow ""Scream"" up with two sequels, but neither one could top the original. Still, a pretty good trilogy that starts with a bang with the first one. This one is the best.**** (out of four)",Scream
175,socrates4,Decent Horror Film,6,19 April 2020,"SCREAM is a well-known horror classic by this point in time. It was a milestone when it first came out, and it has held up with time. There are a lot of things that were original to this film that we've seen a hundred times since, but SCREAM did it first.Of course, there are a few things that it stole from earlier horror films, as is the case with most movies. There are bits that it borrowed from elsewhere that everyone else forgot about, so SCREAM gets all the credit in most folks' minds. There are some cheesy bits, and bits that didn't seem cheesy when this came out but do now. Overall, it's a must-see for those who enjoy the genre. Recommend for horror fans.",Scream
176,baileycrawly,Style Over Substance,5,18 September 2020,"Scream will forever be remembered more for what it did for the horror genre than what's actually in the film.If Wes Craven excelled in one thing over anything else, it's in breathing new life into things that are otherwise dead. The two notable examples of this are Wes Craven's New Nightmare, which gave a refreshing new look to a franchise that was, for all intents and purposes, completely dead.The other, of course is Scream, which came about during one of the worst times for horror cinema, offered something that was unique for its time, and revitalized a genre that was otherwise dying. It inspired so many copycats, in fact, that it can often be difficult to tell them apart and, because it's been parodied and copied so many times, watching this film feels like deja vu because of everything else that's out there, even if Scream did it first.Now, that's not to say Scream is a bad movie per se. The pacing isn't all that great, the scares don't necessarily land and it's a horror movie that doesn't work today (most of 'em don't, but this one is a particularly colossal failure today), but for a lot of people, it's something of a guilty pleasure.It's an example of Wes Craven doing what he does best; the only issue being that the characters, with the exception of Sidney, perhaps, are so bland and boring it's like sitting down to a family dinner only to find the potatoes are undercooked; you eat them because you're not a snob, but you struggle to even pretend to like them.Yeah, it shook up the genre somewhat, and it's to be commended for that point, but sitting down to watch this film in 2020 without lens of nostalgia is an absolute chore.Don't watch this one without a pot of coffee or a Red Bull and a group of friends to provide commentary, because it's just too bloated and boring to hold interest for very long.",Scream
177,SKG-2,Still worthy,8,14 September 1999,"Like Quentin Tarantino before him, Kevin Williamson has become one of the most revered/reviled writers of our generation.  I don't revere him(I hated I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and while DAWSON'S CREEK started off good, it got mediocre, except for Katie Holmes(*sigh*)), but I don't revile him, as this movie was good.  You don't have to be a big fan of the horror genre to even appreciate it(though it does help, which I found out after watching HALLOWEEN and then watching this again).  It does share a problem that every Wes Craven movie has had since NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET - an overlong climax - but it's funny and scary, it takes some well-deserved shots at both the horror genre and how our culture reacts to death, and it doesn't look down on its characters or its audience.  Still, I am looking forward to SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST SUMMER(or is it HALLOWEEN?), as this does need a spoof around now.",Scream
178,PeachHamBeach,Devilishly clever spoof!!!,10,10 April 2005,"I still relish this hilarious, ultraviolent first of a trilogy starring Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Rose McGowan. It's got very clever above standard writing, terrific scares, and load of belly-laughs, which really is what makes it fun. I don't usually crave standard horror where there is lots of blood but no laughter. I think my favorite scene is where Billy and Stu stab each other as part of their big scheme to frame Sid's dad for the killings. Arquette is wonderful, had lots of great comedy lines. McGowan's character is mean to Arquette, but it was sad to see her go!!! Jamie Kennedy is the heart of the movie, he is adorable!!! Any naysayers that declare this is NOT horror: Well, it is a spoof, a parody. But there are so many scares that will make you leap out of your couch, and so much blood and screaming, that it's safe to say that the horror element is very strong. It's a horror comedy!!! A++++",Scream
179,chrisbrown6453,This is a killer film.,8,17 June 2002,"For years I've been complaining how all horror films that make it to the big screen in recent memory, have all been more like psychological thrillers. Movies that make you think instead of movies that make you, well, Scream. Remember back in the good old days, the originals of A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Halloween? These were films that didn't fool around. They were made just to scare the living daylights out of you, and they did just that. Scream takes place in Smalltown, U.S.A. A girl (Neve Campbell) is being stalked by someone. Coincidently, a year ago her mother was brutally murdered and it was Neve's testimony that put an (innocent?) man in jail. Her stalker, who goes around wearing an outfit taken from the famous painting Scream, knows her every fear, her every thought. Wes Craven has managed not only to return to the good old days of horror films, he also managed to make fun of those same films. One of the twists, and there are many, is that these kids know all about horror films. So they know that instead of running up the stairs when there's a killer in the house, you run out the front door, and never, ever say, ""I'll be right back"" because you won't. That's what is so fun about this film. It takes all the horror clichés, and turns them around so they're still scary and unexpected. Also, there are actually legitimate actors and actresses, including Courtney Cox and David Arquette (and look for a cameo by Wes Craven himself), that actually make you believe everything that is happening. Scream is one of the best horror films I have seen in years. If you're looking for a good fright, this is a good movie to go see. Just don't watch it alone.",Scream
180,ethanbresnett,So much better than I was expecting,8,20 October 2021,"I watch horror films to be scared and entertained, and Scream delivered on both.The opening sequence with Drew Barrymore was genuinely scary. Full of suspense and terror, I was hooked from the beginning.What followed was a beautiful mixture of horror, gore, suspense, farce, comedy (very 90s comedy but it worked). There was a brilliant mix of crazy oddball characters and the performances were all solid.I loved the satirical approach they took to horror, with this meta self awareness, and winking to the camera style. Occasionally it was a bit on the nose and a little too much, but for the most part I loved it.Having watched this at the cinema for the 25th anniversary, I can see why this is a much loved classic. It feels a little dated yes, but also holds up surprisingly well. A fantastic horror/teen/comedy film.",Scream
181,hellholehorror,Self-referential nineties,7,18 April 2018,"This movie changed horror. Other movies have changed the way that we are scared through film and this changed it for the teen market. The gore was there but not extreme; the stars were kids and the music for the new generation. This film also brought a self-referential nineties post-modern irony to the ball game. As a film it is very good with strong acting and some good jumps. It does lack depth although the light comedy makes up for that. This is an entertaining, if lighter than most, slick teen horror.",Scream
182,DavidSim240183,The best horror movie of the 90s,10,30 May 2005,"It is so rare nowadays to see a horror film that can truly frighten you, while at the same time make you look at horror films differently through sheer invention and originality. Wes Craven managed to do such a thing in 1996, when he directed Scream, one of his best horror films in years. Certainly his best since A Nightmare on Elm Street.The reason why Scream is different is because it is about characters in a horror film that know they're in a horror film. Or rather the events they are being forced to endure mirror those of something right out of a stalker/slasher movie. And they're all too aware of the clichés, e.g. ""the dumb, big-breasted blonde girl who can't act who runs up the stairs instead of out the front door."" These are very self-aware characters, but that doesn't stop them from falling victim to the murder spree. That is never more evident than the opening scene. A scene that is as shocking in it's intensity as in it's audacity.A young woman, Casey, played by blonde Drew Barrymore, is at home all by herself. She is in her kitchen making popcorn, getting ready to watch a movie (probably a horror movie). The phone rings. On the line is an anonymous smooth talker, who wants to talk to her about ""scary movies."" Watch the way she fingers with a butchers knife while she's talking! Things turn nasty when Casey's caller starts threatening her, and traps her in a potentially nightmarish situation in her own home. She sees her boyfriend tied up on the patio, and now to save both their lives, Casey must play a game. Questions about horror movies. When she gets one too many wrong, her stalker finally shows. Wearing a black costume, and a ghoulish mask, well they all have to wear masks don't they? It all culminates in Casey's boyfriend being gutted like a fish, a mad chase through the house and garden, until finally the stalker catches up with Casey, and kills her. Even in her death throes, she is still holding the phone, and manages to choke her dying breath to her parents who are on the line. Casey is strung up like macabre modern art, to be found by her mother, who fittingly ends the scene with a piercing scream.I know I sound like I've been carping on and on about this one scene, but it is that important, because it sets the whole tone of the film perfectly. By killing off a famous person that early in a film, we realise at that point this is not going to be just any ordinary horror movie. Not since Psycho and the shower scene have we witnessed such a shocking event. At this point, anything can and will happen.And this is just for starters. The stalker (or stalkers) seems to have a personal grudge against Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell). But why? That's the beauty, and the genius behind Scream. The possible motive (if any) is left up to the audience to decide. Is it because Sydney's mother was murdered precisely one year ago? Is it just some insane psycho out for kicks? Who knows?As the body count piles up, we are introduced to each one of the characters, who is a stereotype in some way. Sydney, for one, is the plucky, headstrong heroine. Like Nancy in ANOES. Then there is Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox-Arqette), the tough as nails reporter. She never actually convinced me in that role, but that could be intentional parody on the part of Wes Craven, which may have escaped Courtney's attention.Dewey, (David Arquette) is the idiot deputy sheriff. Full of his own self-importance, it's a wonder he survives the film at all. In a terrific plot twist, his little sister played by Rose McGowan bullies him every chance she gets, pointing out his inadequacies in no short order.Finally, you've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the self-appointed expert on horror movies. Always coming out with the clichés, expectations and rules, he is like a walking encyclopedia on the subject, such as, ""You never say I'll be right back in a horror movie because you won't be back.""Everything about Scream is designed to comment on the horror movie genre in some respect, whether it be the actors or the situations, e.g. the sheriff was played by the same actor in ANOES who was the inept deputy, who tutors Dewey! The film is packed to the rafters with in-jokes, self-referential gags, and puns on the genre. Scream is a literal treasure trove of film references, and one of it's many joys is looking for them. Wes Craven has officially joined the ranks of self-referential irony that Joe Dante and Quentin Tarantino does so well.With a tortuous script, red herrings, and dead ends Scream is a complex maze that leads you a merry dance until the final, very bloody finale. Maybe a little too bloody, but it is added a line of invention by having a hidden camera on the premises, and the events being watched by Gale Weathers. A horror movie within a horror movie!This is horror movie making of the finest order. Scream has layers of sophistication other horror films only dream about. Wes Craven redefined the horror movie for the modern generation, and in the process spawned a series of inferior remakes. That goes for the sequels too, which increasingly became the thing the flawless original had been parodying to begin with.Scream, the ultimate horror movie buff's dream come true!",Scream
183,willcundallreview,A different perspective on the genre,6,3 October 2015,"Ah Scream, a movie that blew away the horror going cinema goers and haunted kids of the days nightmares. This is one movie considered one of the quintessential viewings of horror and is credited with revitalising the genre which had up to that point been in a way, dying out. As much as I respect Scream for doing that I can't write this and say I loved it or found it to be this amazing movie, I more felt it tries very hard to be smart but thinks it is smarter than it really is. The master behind the whole shebang is none other than Wes Craven who is considered one of the daddies of the horror movie genre and for good reason, the guy knows suspense when he see's it and crafts a movie that on his part is good and well done. I did however find little things about this that aren't all that great and the acting is not always that great even if this is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.Our plot takes us to a town in the US and more specifically to a load of teenagers who are shocked to find out one of their classmates was brutally murdered by someone only we have seen wearing that now infamous mask. Our plot then takes us between murders as people are killed in the town, and not only teenagers are the target, this killer is one sadistic piece of work who also happens to be oddly funny too. Scream prides itself on making a mockery of horror and it's usually before this obvious plots, what it doesn't do though is truly branch out of that I mean if you watch closely it never truly changes the story, just plays out like any other. One thing I really did appreciate was the way Craven makes everyone a suspect and you really don't know who it is until the very end and even then you expect some kind of twist. I really wanted to love this I truly did but I do feel this has aged quite a bit, and I don't mean with its fashion etc. The reason I felt it is dated is because Scream itself created horror that could also contain humour as a light side gag, in turn Scream may have changed the game and had a few comments on the industry in horror but never truly stands out to me today and any movie which changes the game should be able to beat anyone who dares copy it. That all said Scream is still pretty damn scary I mean the killer jumping around is really quite chilling even if he keeps getting smacked by cupboard doors and kicked in the balls. As Horror goes it may not satisfy all those who prefer it serious but truly don't take this seriously and you'll have fun. I almost forgot to mention the actors involved; of course we have Neve Campbell as our main character of sorts Sidney Prescott who is in a spot of trouble throughout. Cast like Courteney Cox make it good but watching many episodes of ""Friends"" before hand makes me see her in a whole new light where she isn't Monica Geller. We then have David Arquette as a kind of comedy reliever in Deputy Dewey and some jokes also come from the future shaggy in ""Scooby-Doo"" (sorry I mean that is what I most remember him for) Matthew Lillard who alongside all the other cast members always has something funny albeit a little dark to say. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to see Scream and call it a masterpiece or brilliant or even good for that matter but maybe one day though. I will though be able to recommend it and say it is OK and that I feel is good enough because this is one movie I think everyone should see whether horror fan or not you can't deny this is a popular movie and one you might just love yourself.",Scream
184,kirk-246,A scream of a classic!!!!!,9,26 April 2009,"Wes Craven is the true master when it comes to mixing horror with comedy and a great cast and great acting.Scream is an excellent example.I didn't find this movie to be too scary or suspenseful,but it's downright fun and sure as hell funny in some parts of the movie.But don't be surprised if this movie seems like a ripoff of other horror movies like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th'.But in my opinion,I think that 'Scream is way better than the original Halloween(which was also a good movie,but I don't think that its just as good as Scream).I'm 13 years old and this movie is still one of my favorite slasher films.Do you like scary movies?Then I highly recommend this classic film.",Scream
185,emperor_bender,Not bad at all,7,11 March 2008,"Many people bash this movie for many reasons:Its a modern horror. Its got big name actors. It tells a story of itself.But, thats not how I see it. I'll admit the big name actors being present almost made me not want to see this movie, but when I saw that anyone could be killed at any time, I changed my mind. The story here is quite simple: a killer in a ""ghost face"" costume goes around killing teenagers. Seems too simple?Well, actually, its quite interesting. The teenagers are not stupid, horny junkies who do stupid stuff and get themselves killed. Well...mostly not anyway. The style of this movie is what made me enjoy is so much. One of the teens is the killer, and you sit there trying to guess who it is. Also, they refer to many past horror movies, and make it known that they are in what appears to be a ""horror movie turned real"".David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Skeet Ullrich, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, and Jamie Kennedy all gave great performances. No cheesy ""scare"" acting involved.I recommend this movie to fans of crime and thriller. Horror fans may find this a bit difficult to watch, but give it a try anyway. 7/10.",Scream
186,skybrick736,Scream (7/10),7,25 June 2016,"Wes Craven officially supplemented himself on the Mount Rushmore of horror once his nontraditional slasher film Scream hit theaters. Utilizing a style of writing and dialogue that is closer to that of a midday soap show than a feature film, Wes Craven successfully pulled off a fun ""who done it"" slasher. The film does a great job at poking fun of horror clichés and has an aspect of unpredictability. Even though Neve Campbell is the star, the show stealers are Courtney Cox and David Arquette with great character development and chemistry. Scream isn't perfect by any stretch but does a good job at being different, thrilling, intelligent and entertaining, everything to look into for a horror flick.",Scream

188,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,21 February 2005,"Wes Craven proves he's a master of horror and innovation with Scream, over 10 years since his last smash A Nightmare on Elm Street. Craven had been a legend for 3 decades, but with this he made possibly his best known film, reinventing a dead genre for better and worse, making horror films profitable again. More importantly it gave horror fans something to cheer about, a smart, funny, sexy, but above all scary film.Scream's intro has already gone down in movie history as the benchmark of a shocking and effective way to start a film. Take an established actress, and eventually butcher her to set the tone. The phone, knife, shocks, inevitability of death, blood, helplessness, and a love of scary movies. Craven turns what we expect on its head, and we know we are in for something special. We are introduced to Sydney Prescott, a teenager whose mother was murdered a year ago, trying to get on with her life, coping with school, boyfriend, the court case involving Cotton who has been charged with her mother's murder, and intrusion from journalists. She has become strong through this ordeal, but is still vulnerable. Her boyfriend Billy wants sex, but won't push her as she is still a virgin. The news of the new murder comes as a shock to the whole town. Journalists flock in, including Gail Weathers who had accused Sydney of lies. In school the news spreads, and the cops question the students. Sydney's tight group of friends try to work out who it was, believing everyone's a suspect. Her friends are Tatum, feisty, strong whose boyfriend is like her, and Randy, movie nerd who secretly loves Sydney. When Sydney is attacked, it seems the killer is after her. Her father is supposedly out of town and cannot be found, a curfew is ordered and all the kids have a party. Soon the killer attacks, but who is it? This is clearly one of the best horror movies of the decade, not just an excuse for gore, but clever on many levels, and self-referential. It is more than that, being one of the best looks at teenage life in the last few years. The characters are extremely well drawn, taking stereotypes, but changing them against our expectations, enhanced by some brilliant performances. Every cast member performs well, with special mention to Randy, Arquette and Lillard. Cox is good, but Campbell is excellent, going through a myriad of emotions, proving that her character does not have to be stupid like most would typically be.Craven is in control, feeding us clues as to the identity of the killer, but ensuring that by the end we are surprised. Gore is used wonderfully, the scares and jokes are many, but it is the story of Sydney which makes it a classic. She is strong willed, smart, and we go through every emotion with her, aided by Neve's performance. We feel for her, but know we cannot help. The film is shot beautifully, the scenery stunning, an idyllic place to live, but with dark secrets. We get many close-ups of each character's face, Leone style, and we are hurt when one is killed, but become suspicious of each one. The script is sharp with many references to horror movies which the fan will try to recognise.Thematically we return to Elm Street territory. We must fight for ourselves in the world, and while our friends are the most important people in our lives, they may not be around forever and we must be able to cope with their loss. Parents are either not around, don't care, don't understand, or are to blame. Sydney's mum seems to be the catalyst for the deaths, the only authority figure to gain respect is Dewey, who isn't much older than the teens. The opening scene as Casey crawls towards her nearby parents, with the killer behind her highlights this, that the older generation will not always be able to keep us safe. The Headmaster, played by Henry Winkler hates kids, but he cannot organise or gain respect from them either.We are never certain of Gail's intentions, another point to do with the media's involvement in society today. Death has become trivialised, the victims just a ploy for ratings or power for those who tell the stories. Our thoughts on violence, on violent movies are challenged, Craven a veteran of criticism over use of violence. In the end it's up to us as individuals. The film shows that places we believed to be safe-our homes, and schools, have become dangerous places today too, that we are not safe anywhere. In a group, or by yourself, we are still vulnerable. The scene in the school toilets emphasises this point, and is another beautiful scene. However, the film teaches us that rather than being overcome by fear, by the fact that we are not always safe, we should fight.The death scenes and scary parts are memorable. My favourites- Sydney on her porch, staring over the hills, and the scene with Sydney, Billy and Gus's Don't Fear the Reaper playing in the background. It gives a perfect glimpse of what it is like to be in love at that age, and together with Campbell's beauty makes an odd atmosphere, especially when viewed again, having watched the other 2 films. We become intimate with Sydney, wishing we could save her from her pain.With the combination of genres subverted, a brilliant script and score, some excellent acting, good scares and jokes, Scream paved the way for a new breed of horror films, none of which, like Halloween and Elm Street, have matched it. We should be thankful for Craven, as he has provided the world with another film which should be watched and talked about as much as those felt to be the best movies of all time. This is certainly one of the best of our time.",Scream

191,bh_tafe3,A fun movie that effectively parodied the slasher genre,9,6 July 2009,"Following the big flop ""New Nightmare"", which was not actually a bad film, Wes Craven came out all guns blazing, armed with a nice script from Kevin Williamson, and made the single biggest movie of his career.The script is a lot of fun with various in jokes, and it doesn't take long for them to start coming. ""The first nightmare on Elm Street was good, the rest sucked,"" was an obvious reference to Wes Craven directing the original and not the later ones, Craven later makes a cameo appearance as a janitor named ""Fred"" wearing a green and red jumper. Several other classic horror films are also referenced including the Exorcist, Friday the 13th, Halloween 1 and 2, Hellraiser, Prom Night, The Howling and Rosemary's Baby.The plot revolves around Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a young high Schooler who's mother was viciously murdered a year or so earlier. Sidney was convinced her mother's murderer was Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was convicted of the crime and is in now in jail. Tabloid news reporter Gail Weathers however, has her doubts and has printed a series of articles and a tell all novel pleading Weary's innocence. Her theory is given credence as a series of copycat killings, modeled after 80s horror movies, occur. Sidney soon finds herself living in a real life scary movie with no allies and everyone's a suspect.I find it a bit hard to rate Scream as a slasher film, as I don't see it as one. I see it as more of comedy thriller, which was successfully marketed as a horror film. Not that it was hard given the many litres of fake blood used in the story or the rather grisly subject matter.On the acting side, Skeet Ulrich easily steals the movie from under the rest of the cast, while Matthew Lillard and Jamie Keneedy are both delights. David Arquette is equal parts annoying and endearing, and Courtney Cox is convincing as a bitch, but not so much as a reporter. Neve Campbell puts in a strong performance as Sidney, while Rose McGowan is under used, and unlikeable in her few scenes. Drew Barrymore's cameo in the opening ten or so minutes has become an iconic scene in 90s film making, and is some of the best work she has ever done.Craven's affection for the horror genre has been evident in many of his movies and he does a fine job here of both sending up the genre he helped create, and also redefining it for a modern audience. Well done to Craven and his script writer Kevin Williamson for breathing life back into the slasher genre.",Scream
192,eagandersongil,A Slasher metalanguage,8,2 November 2020,"""Panic"" came to resurrect a genre that was already nearing its end, slasher films, a genre that dragged crowds to the cinema in the 80s but that was increasingly ostracized, ""Panic"" not only brought the spotlight back to above the genre, he innovated in his language, narrative and visual and managed to score one of the most successful serial killers in cinema.The 1996 feature film is directed by the brilliant Wes Caven, an enthusiast of the horror genre and completely in love with Slashers films, who in 1984 had already made a super contribution to the genre when he directed the first ""Nightmare on Elm"" personifying one of the most scary movies, 12 years later the American filmmaker reinvents the genre by creating a completely innovative serial killer, without supernatural aspects or an unbeatable killer, panic innovates, first of all because he is a human stalker, who makes several mistakes and it's completely flustered.The performances of the film are all good, mainly because of the clichÃÃÂ©, we have many performance and stereotyped performances that work in relation to the film's climate, in addition, the direction is great, with merit to the already mentioned good script and a gore, which is contained , but very effective, with a gray photograph, typical of 90's horror films and an exquisite edition, without leaving bellies or gaps, the conduction is fast, the story develops well and holds the viewer at all times, mixing a humor acidic to a suspense that works well considering the comic horror climate of the feature, ""Panic"" is a satire taken seriously that works very well.(SPOILER) One of the greatest merits of director Wes Caven is to reconstruct the murderer in a mold that the important thing is not who is behind the mask, but the mask itself, because panic is not a unique villain, since even in the first film this role is shared between two assassins, this is brilliant because it gives the film a unique iconography. Another cool point is to know how to play with those who wear the mask, as the killer is always a fan of horror movies, someone who grew up watching the great classics and therefore decides to copy, another great allegory from Caven. (END OF SPOILER)Wes Caven makes ""Panic"" a love letter to the horror slasher genre, conducting his work as a tribute to all the great films that marked the genre, with several references, whether directly - as a janitor in a green and red shirt called Fred -, or even us in the details -As the character in the first scene is eating a popcorn- making a reference to Halloween, even with the clichÃÃÂ©s the director jokes, ""Panic"" is a perfect, intelligent, thought-provoking and passionate metalanguage. Wes proves all of his horror nerdiness through the script, whether in the brilliant quiz of the opening scene or even in the frames honoring the great classics of an era. ""Friday the 13th"", ""Halloween"", ""The hour of the nightmare"", ""Massacre of the chainsaw"" among others, all have their homage here. 7.5 / 10",Scream
193,tankace,What a surprise!!,8,18 April 2016,"Scream is a good movie, more of that is a great meta-movie /parody of the slasher genre of horror ,which by 1996 ,when scream came out was in decline. West Craven here in a way made fun the main movies of his directorial history (like A Nightmare on Elm Street) and show us that even the most hardcore Filmer can be caught of guard. That is in a sense the story of Scream and fortunately Mr Craven and the actors made a great job pocking fun in the clichés of the horror movies we all know and either love or hate. To the point this flick was a sleeper hit and twenty years later has become the guideline of ""How to survive a horror movie"". Before I saw for the first time Scream ,I thought that it was overrated, after seen it it more than deserves the praise it gets. If I have to nit pick some thinks, is the fact that it is a bit dated for todays standards and the chill which once made people chill ,has been spoiled due to the low point in which horror movies are in modern-days. Note that it also had unnecessary sequels like the films it made fun of, what a irony!I am pretty sure that, horror movies will come back ,like the superheroes movies before them and Scream will be seen as a historic film ,like Phsyco(1960), Dracula(1930) ,Alien(1979), The Thing(1982) and the rest of the historic horror movies which even today we praise them as landmarks.

It takes a look at all of the horror/slasher clichés and says ""we're gonna do something different here."" The writing and acting are both great and, unless your friends have given it away, you won't see half of it coming from a mile away.Scream is a movie that no horror fan should go without seeing. If you're a big fan of classic horror, check it out!",Scream
195,La Gremlin,"Admit it, it's a classic!",9,28 September 2001,"If you think about it, this movie's got a lot to answer for.  After ""Scream"" became a surprise hit, it was assumed that *any* scary movie would be a guaranteed hit.  And so we got ""Urban Legend"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", which didn't do much other than reminding us what the cliched scary movies ""Scream"" was making fun of were like.That's my only problem with ""Scream"".  Other than that, it's my favorite scary movie and an even better tribute to ""Halloween"" than the wrong-headed twentieth anniversary sequel.  You might have a problem answering the phone immediately afterwards.",Scream
196,smla02,The first intelligent horror movie since Halloween.,8,4 August 2002,"***Starring: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, and Skeet Ulrich.There haven't really been any good horror movies since Halloween back in 1978.  None of the Friday the 13th were ever intelligent.  Do drugs, have sex, get slaughtered are the common formula for a past horror film.  This one is far better than that.  Sure people get drunk and die but that must happen in order to die.  The movie is about a crazed killer who took horror movies a mile too far.  (t)he(y) start stalking Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell).  A high school party comes and a mystery of the killer starts to be unfolded.  The movie has some very scary parts and very hilarious parts (""Jamie, Behind you!)  That was funny.  I highly recommend this and also recommend its sequel, Scream 2.",Scream
197,Hunky Stud,Not a scary movie at all.,3,15 June 2001,"I watched it late at night alone. I didn't get scared at all. To me, this movie is such a joke, it is a bad joke. It tries to be scary, but those scary things only make me want to laugh. Yet I can't laugh, because those are not funny enough. Everything is so  predictable. The only thing that I was not able to predict was that the real suspect is actually acted out by two person. One of the guy just has that face and act which I can tell from the very beginning.
This movie has so many flaws. For example, why did the girl has to go through a cat exit on a garage door when the garage door can be opened by herself? What kind of idiot would try to go through a cat exit on a garage door? It is SUCH a common sense what the exit is for, and why it is only that big. I can't see a particular reason to kill her. There is no reason to kill her, because she is a girlfriend of one of the psychos. There are so many things in the garage that she can grab to defend herself.
Another example, at the very beginning of the movie, how did the killer cut out the girl's boyfriend's gut remotely? What is the reason of killing the school principal? And how did the killer get in and get out? How did the killer hide his costumes? How did the killer kidnap the father, etc, etc.This movie is neither scary, nor sophisticated.I am surprised that there are actually two sequels to this simple movie.",Scream
198,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Scary And Funny Horror/Slasher Classic. Wes Craven At His Best.",10,14 April 2014,"Scream is an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic and one of the greatest Horror films of all-time that is filled with amazing direction,a wonderful cast,a terrific script and a creepy and memorable score. All of the elements make Scream an unforgettable Horror film and is Wes Craven at his best.Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell),a teen who on the one year anniversary of her mother's death discovers that a killer with a ghost face mask is stalking and killing people in her home town. When Sidney finds out she's next on the list Sidney has to try and stop the killer and stay alive.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen as dead by most critics and audiences I wouldn't say the genre was dead but was more in a coma and waiting to wake up and the film that woke up the Horror genre was Wes Craven's Scream,a brilliant Horror movie that was not only a critical and Box Office hit but also made the Horror genre hot again and paved the way for other slasher films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer(1997)and Urban Legend(1998). Right from the movie scary and now famous 10-15 minute sequence,Scream is an amazing and terrifying Horror movie that takes the Slasher genre and toys around with the Slasher movie giving us a film that is not only scary but also funny,smart and clever giving viewers a film that rethinks the Slasher genre while paying homage to Slasher films of the past. Scream is one of the few films I can think of that mixes Horror and Humor flawlessly with intelligence. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Scream are done with powerful and explosive intensity that punches you right in the face and during the scary scenes none of the characters are never safe or secure with violence in the air. The violence and gore that happens during the scary scenes are horrific and disturbing and reminds me of the in your face brutality of his earlier classics such as A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984),The Last House On The Left(1972)and The Hills Have Eyes(1977)because like those films Craven shows us the disgusting view and doesn't hold back one bit. The Comedy and Humor is funny and at times hilarious because it seems like the teenage characters know that they're in a Horror film are self aware and know all of the Clichés and things that happen in a slasher film(or all of the rules in order to survive a Horror film)which is in line with the post-modern film making of the 1990s. Scream also features terrific and fun references to landmark Horror classics such as Psycho(1960),A Nightmare On Elm Street,Halloween(1978)and Friday The 13th(1980)and some of the references are obvious while others are subtle. The balance of Horror and Humor makes the movie more intense and unforgettable. Sidney Prescott is one of the great Horror movie scream queens/heroines and that's mainly because like the other scream queens of the past Sidney is tough and can handle herself and you root for her to survive despite the viciousness all around her and when you see her going through terror you will relate to her. The Ghost face killer is a classic villain in the Horror genre because what sets this killer apart from other killers in the genre is that the killer calls on the phone and uses Horror movie knowledge to test the victim and if get the answers wrong Ghost face will kill you with no remorse. The Ghost Face killer will have you on edge when you see Scream the first time and will stick with you and you can say was one of the reasons caller ID was invented. Much of the film's success of Scream is thanks to the screenplay by Kevin Williamson which is amazing,terrific and in my opinion one of the best screenplays in Horror film history. Williamson script is filled with great dialog that is clever,ironic and done with a style that has been imitated but never duplicated. Williamson fills his script with Horror,Mystery,Comedy and Drama all within 112 minutes and giving viewers a unique story that never slows sown. Williamson has never topped his Scream script and I don't think he ever will. The ending of Scream is a classic conclusion that is filled with twists,turns and thrills that will catch you off guard and add to the movie's greatness. An outstanding ending.The cast is incredible. Neve Campbell is excellent as Sidney,one of the great Horror movie heroines,with Campbell bringing toughness,sympathy and depth to the role. Courtney Cox is wonderful as Gale Weathers,a heartless News reporter. Skeet Ulrich is terrific as Billy,Sidney's boyfriend. David Arquette is great and funny as Deputy Dewey. Rose McGowan is fantastic and sexy as Tatum,Sidney's best friend. Jamie Kennedy is outstanding and hilarious as Randy,a movie geek. Matthew Lillard is delightful as Stuart,Tatum's boyfriend. W.Earl Brown(Kenny)and Joseph Whipp(Sheriff Burke)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for credited and uncredited cameos by Liev Schreiber(Cotton Weary),Linda Blair(Obnoxious News reporter),Wes Craven(Fred The Janitor)and Henry Winkler(Principal Arthur Himbry).The direction by Wes Craven is amazing,with Craven always moving the camera and bringing a thrilling and intense style to the film. Wonderful direction,Craven.The score by Marco Beltrami is sensational,suspenseful and intense and adds to the atmosphere to the film. Great score,Beltrami.In final word,if you love Wes Craven,Horror films or Slasher films,I highly suggest you see Scream,an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic that you will never forget and will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Scream
199,Trevor-Kerensky,One of the better slashers,7,10 September 2018,"I'm not the kind of person who watches horror, much less slasher movies. In fact, I can't stand them. Knife-wielding maniacs, female victims, and lots of blood. Maybe this is why those kind of movies get such a bad rap. But this was actually decent and actually works like a mystery too. We get Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore and lots of dark humor and maybe some thrills and chills too. If you're a horror movie fan and haven't seen this, give it a try. It's not too scary and I wasn't too scared. It's more of a thriller. I'd heard about the sequels; the second one being as good, but the rest tanked. And now that Wes Craven is dead, I seriously doubt there'll be more. But maybe this is the crown jewel of his 1990s horror movies.",Scream
200,Donatien3,The Start of a Self-Aware Legacy,9,17 October 2020,"By the early 90s, the horror movie genre had seemingly fallen into a sequel-dominated rut, with two of the biggest franchises - ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" - producing a seemingly endless number of sequels of varying quality. The seeds of ""Scream"" were sewn in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" (1994), with tons of meta commentary (Robert Englund played both Freddy and himself) and a more serious tone that ditched the Elm Street sequels' increasingly silly tone.In ""Scream"" Craven takes ""New Nightmare's"" self-awareness and pushes it further, making fun of tired horror movie tropes and subverting them: for example, while the 'Final Girl' is traditionally a virgin, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) loses hers during the film.Ironically, ""Scream"" turned into the long-running franchise that it tried to mock, with three sequels (and a likely fifth movie coming soon), a recent TV series, and - in an extra layer of self-awareness - it arguably inspired the ""Scary Movie"" parody franchise, their own slew of progressively horrible sequels, AND then further spinning-off to the more mainstream ""something something Movie"" films, most which are horrible.The original ""Scream"" is peak 90s pop culture, with a cast including Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and Drew Barrymore (who enjoyed a career revival from her opening cameo). It helps that Kevin Williamson's script is solid, it's filled with red herrings to multiple suspects, a few clever callbacks, and Ghostface's eventual motivation is plausible. This means they can pack in all the horror rules and movie references (including Craven playing a Freddy Krueger-esque janitor, complete with the iconic striped sweater), without it seeming forced or too gimmicky.The one drawback is the lack of inventive kills: Craven's ""Elm Street"" series was famous for Freddy's increasingly creative deaths (even in the sub-standard sequels), but most of ""Scream's"" kills are relatively simple, though there are some scary moments. Maybe Craven and Williamson wanted to keep the focus on the meta commentary rather than the gore?Still, the original ""Scream"" is a lot of self-aware fun, even 20-odd years later.",Scream
201,kylehaines96,We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes.,10,31 August 2012,"I am deciding to rewrite my reviews on the Scream franchise because I was not very satisfied with my original reviews. I really didn't express how much I loved these films. So I begin with the first film Scream.In the early to mid 90's, horror films were getting stale and people were not responding well to recent installments to Halloween, Friday The 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street. In 1995 a young writer by the name of Kevin Williamson wrote a script for a film entitled Scary Movie. This script started a bidding war between different directors until Wes Craven decided to pick it up. The title was changed from Scary Movie to Scream.Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell is an aspiring girl who is just about ready to graduate High school with her friends. Her best friend is Tatum Riley played by Rose McGowan who is willing to take on anything that gets in her way. Then we have Randy Meeks played by Jamie Kennedy who is the big horror movie geek in the school. Stu Macher played by Matthew Lillard who is dating Tatum and is a big party goer. Finally there is Billy Loomis played by Skeet Ulrich Who is dating Sidney.One night Casey Becker played by Drew Barrymore gets murdered along with her boyfriend by a man wearing a Ghostface mask and the first on the scene is Gale Weathers played by Courtney Cox A reporter who will do anything to get the latest story and police officer Dewey Riley played by David Arquette who is shy and uncomfortable but has a big heart. After classes have been suspended for a few days Everybody heads to Stu's house for a party. One by one people get murdered including Tatum.Spoilers! After Sidney is attacked she finds out that Billy is the killer and Stu is his accomplice. Billy is driven By Maternal abandonment whereas Stu is driven to peer pressure. Stu dies from being electrocuted and Billy dies from being shot. The characters end there night by walking into the sunrise.This is a great horror film. The dialouge is well written because it is self aware. It knows it is making a mockery of horror flicks and has fun with it. The characters are nicely developed and the story is very original for a horror film.Rated R For Strong Graphic Horror Violence And Gore, And For Language.1hr 51min/111min.30 uses of the F-word.****/****",Scream

This is actually one of the first slasher films that I saw with more than one survivor. This film also has some big stars. Henry Winkler as Principal Himbry. There is also Drew Barrymore as Casey, the girl that is gutted and hung in the opening. Overall, this is one of Wes Craven's finest work.9/10 Rec.

205,the amorphousmachine,The original and best of 'Scream' series!,9,5 March 2001,"What can I say? This movie rocked! Wes Craven reinvents the horror/slasher genre in this clever spoof, and it is also surprisingly filled with suspense!(SPOILER) The whole cast is excellent! Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Urlich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore and even Henry Winkler all perform well! The script is fantastic and refreshing, and there is plenty of clever jokes that's will make you laugh but at the same time give you the creeps i.e. Meeks saying ""look behind you!"" to the television! Great stuff and an excellent homage to the slasher/horror movie genre. 'Scream' stands out as a unique spoof on the horror genre and a memorable thriller with enough blood and guts to entertain most horror/teen slasher fans! This is vastly clever and original film that analyses it's own genre. 'Scream' is one of my favourite scary movies! ****1/2 out of *****!",Scream
206,squirrel_burst,Smart horror film for fans of the genre and newbies,9,18 April 2015,"""Scream"" is a good horror/thriller that works not only as a deconstruction of the slasher/dead teenager genre but also as a scary who-done-it? film. It follows high-school student Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is being stalked by a mysterious killer who wears a long black cloak and a mask based on The Scream painting by Edward Munch.What I like about this movie is that it's a lot smarter than your average horror show. An easy example that makes my point is that in this story, people have actually seen horror movies before. How many films have you seen where you can't help yourself, you end up screaming at the people inside the movie because they walk into a dark room without turning on the light or grabbing a flashlight, they don't grab a weapon to defend themselves or they put themselves in situations that give away what their fate is? This, combined with a solid cast, a well written script and a lot of funny moments will suck you into the story, while the mystery of the face behind the killer's mask will compel you to stick around. If you're a fan of horror films you'll be happy to see that not only the film makers, but the characters in ""Scream"" film share the same love and it's a lot of fun to go through the film and check off the titles that are referenced to, in order to see if you have seen them yourself. If you aren't a fan of horror films this is a smart one that doesn't linger on the gore as much as It presents a mystery with some frightening scenes here and there. I really feel like this picture has a lot of re-watch value despite the fact that it's a mystery because it gets better the more horror films you have seen. If you want to get Into the genre of horror films and you're wondering where to start, then of course you have your classics like ""Nosferatu"" and ""Frankenstein"", then you've got your 70s flicks like ""Black Christmas"" and Night of the Living Dead"" and from there, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" but you better make sure you don't miss ""Scream"" on your way you're the 2000s. It might even make you appreciate some of the franchises that eventually devolved into bad R-Rated comedies or you might feel even stronger about pictures like ""Leprecahun 4: In Space"" being utter trash. It's scary, at times very funny, the characters are compelling and it'll keep you guessing all the way through. (On Blu-ray, November 9, 2012)",Scream
207,Jacques98,I expected more . . .,2,7 September 2008,"Scream had an amazing point behind it, and I am glad that it was one of the first films to deliberately stand up for originality. With that said, ironically, the reason I didn't like it was because it was just a typical slasher with something to say instead of something to rip-off.The kill scenes were all well done and some of them were downright iconic. But they were few and far between, with way too much bloated dead space between them. I'll never understand why action movies and horror moviestwo genres that are meant to thrill youalways seem to think they have to throw in yet another overdone woman's channel drama, and that is one cliché Scream doesn't break out of, sadly. The drama takes up way too much screen time and dulled the amazing intro and secondary kill scenes. This would have been a near perfect movie if they would have just stuck to the horror.The blood is pretty minimal, and not really even up to the bar set by the older slashers mentioned in the movie. However, some of the kills were more intense than normal slashers.As all of you should already know, the main point to have made Scream is to show that movies were cliché and predictable without turning into one of those movies itself. I think it does that wonderfully, but a little bit more on the subject would have made it more solid, because some people didn't even catch that was the point of the movie.In the end, Scream is just another typical slasher played out on a anti-cliché soapbox. I expected a lot more from it, and I still see no reason for the boring drama scenes that played out through most of the middle. It's a must view for any serious horror fans, but don't expect to be amazed like I was.2/10",Scream

209,cinephile-27690,The Best Horror Movie I Have Ever Seen. (Some spoilers possible.),10,8 May 2020,"I have seen many horror movies, and it seems to take a special type of craft to make a great one. Scream has the craft to be the best horror movie I have ever seen, and that may be against Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom. It also parodies the genre, bringing smiles along with the shocks.To quickly summarize, Scream is mainly about a teen named Sidney, who is being stalked by a masked killer a year after her mother's murder. The movie is directed by Wes Craven, who made A Nightmare On Elm Street. This resume shows how creative he can be.The film starts with a 13 minute prologue, which is the best written and crafted opening I have yet to witness. Drew Barrymore is home alone, and she gets a call from an anonymous person. This could have only worked in the 90s, as all phones have caller ID now. He famously asks her: ""Do you like scary movies?"" This leads to a bloody murder, and the scares are all justified.As I mentioned already, Scream is the scariest movie I have ever seen, and it had a real effect on me. For instance, I used the bathroom right before it started and as the opening unfolded, I had to go again. I was seriously about to wet myself with fear! I managed to wait another 27 minutes, and even then I had to go a while later.I also took a shower afterwards, and I was shaking so much that I almost lost balance getting into the tub!Aside from the opening, there are many other gory moments that will terrify you. This is not a bloodbath for the sake of bloodbath though. People get shot and people get sliced trying to stop the monster. The violence is realistic and tense as a result.As I mentioned earlier, Scream is not just a horror movie, it's a PARODY of horror movies. You can see many references and nods to other classic horror movies-Frankenstein is played in a video store. Halloween is mentioned and clips are seen at a party.Try to spot references to movies like A Nightmare On Elm Street, Psycho, Carrie, or The Shining-whether by name or by their iconic scenes. Even the opening is clearly an homage to When A Stranger Calls. This is part of the viewing pleasure.Scream is also cleverly self aware about horror movies since this is a parody. For instance, one person begs the villain to not kill them, because ""they want to be in the sequel."" Ha ha. What ""sequel"" if this is actually happening?When the killer is loose, one character discusses 3 rules to survive a horror movie- never have sex, no drugs or alcohol, and if you are going to leave a room, don't say ""I'll be right back.""So 2 people have sex, they were already doing drugs and alcohol, and a person says that they will be right back. There are many other clever jokes like this that are sneaked in if you pay attention. If this wasn't part comedy, things like this would be flaws. Since it is part comedy, it works with the rest of the structure flow.As both a parody and a horror movie, Scream is an unqualified success. Those who don't want to get scared should avoid this one. But for those who love horror movies, Scream is not to be missed. This movie is a real scream.",Scream
210,SafReviews,"Although it wasn't scary, the plot was decent",7,2 April 2021,"I felt that the movie was a bit slow towards the beginning, but after that the plot started to get a bit more entertaining and kept me intrigued till the end. The ending was not what I was expecting and it definitely wasn't one of those cliche and obvious horror movie endings which is one thing I liked about the movie. I knew the movie wasn't going to be scary as I have seen short clips years ago and I wasn't scared, but luckily the plot was good. I feel like if I watched this movie during it's time I would probably give it a higher rating because horror movies have become more advanced now and I feel this movie would be considered average if it was released today.",Scream

There's a killer in their midst who's seen a few too many scary movies. Suddenly nobody is safe, as the psychopath stalks victims, taunts them with trivia questions, then rips them to bloody shreds. It could be anybody.Scream serves as a near perfect example of how to successfully and single-handedly revive the horror genre. It is a film that takes elements from classics that evoked the genre and reinvents melodramatic conventions breathing life into a worn-out genre. The movie contains the usual horror characters, but they are supplied with dialogue, often surprisingly smart and funny, that serves as a running, biting commentary on slasher tropes. Scream builds to a splattering finale that should leave genre fans highly satisfied. Scream is nothing short of a classic.",Scream
212,Darkjak007,There's a formula to it a very simple formula everybody's a suspect!,7,20 September 2021,"In the nineties horror was taking a drastic turn instead of being seen as a serious genre it was now being mocked and made fun of up until the mid 2000s. Films like leprechaun or I know what you did last summer that didn't even try to be suspenseful or mysterious. In 1996 Horror Legend Wes Craven the man behind a nightmare on elm street, The Hills have eyes, and the last help on the left. Delivers in 1996 Scream arguably the pinnacle of horror comedy sub genre.

The anniversary of her mothers death's coming up then all of a sudden she starts getting mysterious calls from a stranger and people end up being murdered. What make scream different from any other film of the time was the fact that scream actually built using it's clichés. It's a movie that fully acknowledges it a dark spoof. The characters are all purposely cliché you got a movie buff,the party guy, the pretty boy. Spoofs of characters like Courtney Cox as Gale who's kinda a terrible news women who's more concern with getting the story. David arquette as officer dewy is this dimwitted cop whose trys to play it serious but nobody takes him serious. The idea that movies are more or less a problem to the wrong person. It pays tribute to the genre more then anything and having a killer center around horror movies add to that. Scream was one the first self reference film that actually mentions real world films. Friday the 13th, The Howling that was unique for the time. The ghostface killer is one of the most popular slashers. The fact that you can still find this costume on sale com Halloween submit to that. It's it a slasher of multiple interpretation who's more grounded in reality surprisingly. Not a powerful stopping killing machine, tripping over the costume and getting knock over, but still capable of brutality stabbing you. When Sidney's being chases up by this person it feels real in a way, rather suspenseful. The idea that the killer truly can be anybody does in some way, add to the suspense.",Scream
213,dk77dk,Make Your Last Breath Count,10,14 April 2021,"What's really interesting is that this is a film that is essentially a combination of parody and serious film, and manages to be both by creating a truly unique structure.In the film, the director very intelligently uses the clichés of a horror film, creating an almost parodic atmosphere, and yet not going out of the scope of a serious film in any way.Paying homage to the horror film itself, the director creates an interesting atmosphere and openly shows us through dialogues that he plays with various elements of the horror film. The film is unusually interesting and entertaining precisely because of such a combination, and when it comes to violence alone, it is definitely appropriate for a horror film, it is brutal and bloody and gives the film the tone of a real horror movie.The cast did a great job, they made the characters fun and interesting. The direction is great, the scenes of violence are brutal and realistic, and the soundtrack fits perfectly into the film.Definitely a great selection of songs that gave the film an extra dimension and made it even more fun.

Filmmaker Wes Craven continues to show his skill with Scream giving audiences a horror film that delivers on what fans expect from the genre bloody deaths, a scary villain, and some suspense that doesn't quite pay off entirely but it's still worth seeing at least once. The cast of relative unknown actors at the time including Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and Skeet Ulrich are admirable in their roles. David Arquette (Courtney Cox's future husband), Matthew Lillard, and Rose McGowan turn in decent supporting performances but they aren't given much screen time. Drew Barry makes a brief appearance and then is written out of the movie rather quickly. The rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, W.

215,revival05,"I mean, its so BIG!",8,19 April 2000,"**Small spoilers below, small but they who have not seen the movie should still keep away for best result in the movie.
''Scream'' is huge! 'Scream' super-blockbuster! 'Scream 2' naturally mega-blockbuster! 'Scream 3' will probably be even bigger, after a while. Those who love horror (or all related genres) films have so much to thank this movie. ''Scream'' kicked up horrorfilms from the grave. Sure we've seen some real crap, but at the same time some greatness (''The Faculty'', ''The Blair Witch Project'' (I know, its not the same, but really, do you think anyone ever done it if 'Scream' never came`?)). The movie itself then. This movie is my third favorite movie of all time. Its so entertaining and funny. Except for the opening scene you can't buy any mean say that its scary anywhere, can you?Craven and Williamson have cooked up a standard slasher-film where teens get sliced up by a maniac. But now the teens are prepared (from all movies of course). The thing that makes ''Scream'' so different from the rest is that we find out about all details, compairs, and rules of scary movie, who we all know existed but never thought about. And if that wasn't enough it is funny! Craven and  Williamson makes, among much else, fun about how long the killer can survive (how many can survive two runthroughs in the heart by an umbrella?) and just look at the school-cleaner, Fred. Take a look at his clothes too. By the way, he is played by Craven! The acting is very funny (I just loved the super-stupid Dewey), the music is standard-good, but the soundtrack is great (I have it myself).Of course these slashers can't be really called as horrorfilm, so I can say that this is the best slasherfilm ever!10/10",Scream
216,revival05,"Can all the people who don't like ""Scream"" please stop seeing it as a horrormovie?!",8,13 June 2000,"Here is a word to those who don't like SCREAM.I can agree at some points, some of the people who loved it has probably not laid an eye on the classic ones, and the scary stuff is scary for those peoples. But are you aware about that SCREAM IS A SPOOF AT THOSE MOVIES?It's a SPOOF! So why, oh why keep on comparing it to HALLOWEEN and THE EXCORCIST. HELLO???? IS THERE ANYBODY HOME???? Maybe you don't know WHY it's called ""Scream""??? Ghostface, the painting (scream), hello... Oh, and the ending might be refered as a satire on how long the killer can survive in all the movies (nobody can survive an umbrella to the heart twice)? Why do you see this as a horrormovie. I have actually seen PSYCHO, THE EXCORCIST and HALLOWEEN and all of these movies are very good films (Psycho is one of my favorite movies), but SCREAM IS FUNNY! It really is, didn't you even notice that Fred, the janitor, had Freddy Krueger's clothes? Didn't you see the fun where Jamie Kennedy shouts to himself to watch out? 
Come on... I loved SCREAM and since I'm the movie-nerd that's worse than Randy, I put this movie at nr.3 on my top-movies. SCREAM is the movie-trivia-heaven and THE ULTIMATE HORROR-SPOOF.It is a comedy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Scream

218,galileo3,The best horror movie of the decade,8,8 January 2008,"Scream (1996)Scream is an interesting film. While at its core it is a gory slasher film, it is also a comical, entertaining and often very tense experience. Wes Craven's film is a success. Scream while it has all the expected clichés (the killer's behind you) it dares to be original. It is about characters who go to the movies and know and discuss famous horror movies (Halloween, Psycho). They analyse their motives; there's one scene at the end of the film, where a character is watching Mike Myers stalk Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween while the killer is behind him. The bloody horror violence works effectively. It adds an effect. A sort of running joke. Characters who love iconic horror stars are getting killed by a local psycho. It works. Kevin Williamson's script is fiendishly inventive, in making this horror film, funny and mysterious and makes you keep guessing and guessing till the end. Fantastic stuff from a man who has a significant contribution to the horror genre.7.5/10",Scream
219,zac-04879,Definitely One of the Greatest Teen Slasher Films,7,19 August 2021,"Overall, Scream is a very fresh entry to both raw teen slashers and exciting murder mysteries. It's an original and iconic tale directed by Wes Craven and with a brilliant cast of Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette. Thanks to the cast, the teenage characters are undeniably witty and appealing. And Roger L. Jackson, behind the spooky mask of the brutal Ghostface killer, definitely manages to portray a rough and aggressive murderer.This superbly-written slasher is clever, entertaining and gripping. Highlighting a first-class whodunnit, Scream kicks off right where it all begins. The unhinged opening scene is probably one of the most engaging introductions of all horror movies. It sparkles up the entertaining mystery and is never afraid to get violent.Although it's an excellent movie, expect high levels of suspense and excitement, but don't anticipate strong horror that isn't just jump-scares. Tense music, fast chasing and the killer's spooky appearance doesn't automatically prove it's terrifying.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Scream
220,Aly200,Savior of the '90s Horror Genre,7,26 July 2012,"By the 1990s horror had grown stagnant due to the numerous sequels that were preceding films like 'Friday the 13th', 'Halloween' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street.' But when Kevin Williamson wrote the script for 'Scream' it was destined to be a winner. 'Scream' is one of the scariest 1990s films I have seen in my teen years since I was only three when it came to the big screen. The genius of the film is that the device known as a telephone/cell phone can used against us in sinister ways which makes us fearful of our safety in our community. I was impressed with the performance of the cast and of course Wes Craven's creativity in the manner of the film's deaths and look.",Scream
221,Jerique,Best Horror Film!,9,23 January 2010,"I'm gonna go out on a limb and say: best horror film.Yes, I said it. Combine gore of Friday the 13th, the disturbing phone calls from When A Stranger Calls and add in some comedy. The story is very exciting and it's fun to analyze the movie to see ""who killed who"" since the killer is two people.I think this story is very original though it has some similarities to other films. Now add in a grand cast and you've got a great horror flick. The realism is good too, they don't make the killer invincible. He can be knocked down, and he can be killed.Neve Campbell is the star and plays Sidney Prescott. Her mother was murdered nearly a year earlier and she thought Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) was responsible. She still can't get over it as the new killer seems to be linked somehow since when he calls Sid he mentions her mother.Skeet Ulrich plays Billy, Sid's boyfriend. Sid gets him arrested thinking Billy is responsible for the calls to her and all the other victims but when the phone company's info comes back, Billy is clean.Matthew Lillard plays the friend of them all and is dating Tatum, Sid's best friend. Matthew provides the most comedy with his lines and his ad-libbed lines. Combined with Jamie Kennedy they are the perfect comic relief.Drew Barrymore has a 12 minute opening scene as the introduction to the killer's appearance and first kill. Matthew Lillard (Stu) is seemingly the first suspect as he dated her before, but Tatum says that Stu and her were together when it happened.David Arquette plays Dewey Riley. He's the brother to Tatum and friends with Sid. He is also Deputy of the town of Woodsboro. He does a good job but throughout the series his character changes the most, I think.Finally, last but not least, Courteney Cox-Arquette plays Gale Weathers, a small town local reporter who is writing a book on Sid's mother's murder story. She is actually quite a sweet character as the series goes on but she has her bitter sides as well.All of them are very important to the overall movie. Their performances are all some of the best I've ever seen. If the award Best Ensemble Cast Performance was available, I'd give it to this movie for 1997's award show.Just about every scene has excitement, drama and comedy.",Scream
222,happyendingrocks,Not nearly as textbook as the lengthy speech about horror clichés would have you believe,8,20 July 2009,"Despite the running joke throughout this film about how predictable and formulaic horror films are, this modest little thriller gave the genre a much-needed shot in the arm in the mid-90's. Though it would spawn scores of mediocre imitators, and eventually open the door for the dreadful ""torture porn"" phenomenon a decade later, we can hardly blame Scream for the untalented auteurs who attempted to follow in its footsteps. Taken on its own, and not considering the largely unnecessary sequels that followed, Scream is aging extremely well, and remains a solid, classy, and dense thriller that works on multiple levels.Scream delivers actual scares, humor that doesn't detract from the horror elements, and a twist ending that I defy anyone to honestly claim they saw coming when they first saw it. The script is sharp-witted and sharp-fanged, balancing the base horror components with a sophistication that one doesn't find in too many teen-targeting genre offerings. Additionally, the film functions as an homage to horror itself, deftly lampooning and referencing key moments from many genre classics while simultaneously out-performing most of the films it references.The cast is a superb ensemble, and even actors like Jamie Kennedy and David Arquette, who are responsible between them for some of the most idiotic and useless films of all time, shine with this material. It's a testament to the strength of the writing that even the most annoying actors to ever soil a screen are genuinely likable here.Surely, some of the best horror films of all time employ a full-throttle assault of terror, and this approach is largely the most effective way of presenting the genre. But Scream succeeds simply because it's such a fun movie to watch. By presenting this film as somewhat of a goofy teen romp (even though it's not all that goofy), the film-makers keep the viewer off-guard through much of the proceedings, and the air of satire the film never leaves behind gives the genuine scares that much more impact.Of course, most people who only know the film peripherally will undoubtedly remember Scream as ""the one with the rules in it"". Anyone who doesn't immediately tear holes through the logic presented in this famous monologue clearly hasn't seen many horror films, but it remains a great bit, especially since Scream, itself, so stridently defies many of the most harrowing clichés in the genre. My favorite touch: until Scream, never had a killer routinely endured so much abuse at the hands of their intended victims. The ghost-masked assassin here literally gets the crap kicked out of them in every scene they're in, and even though we know we're watching a film that obviously isn't trying to take itself too seriously, this note of realism adds a great dimension to the happenings. Our victims-to-be fighting back enhances the tension in each death scene, and the film presents polished and exciting sequences that are ultimately much more memorable than the rote stalk-and-kill we usually get in the less imaginative offerings of splatter's hallowed past.This film was highly original when it came out, and none of its imitators have even come close to matching the magical combination of non-formula elements that make Scream so special. We'll see how this film is regarded once it's further relegated to horror's history, but its hard not to notice that this film was pivotal in changing the genre's climate in the same way that Nirvana's Nevermind changed the landscape of popular rock music a few years before. I'm certainly not directly comparing these two works, but in terms of impact, it's safe to say that the analogy applies here. And, ultimately, if Scream is the Nevermind of scary movies, that's not all that bad a distinction to have.",Scream

The narrative is forced and overly long at times, the soundtrack doesn't work for its scenes' purposes, the actors are mediocre at best, with the exception of Courtney Cox who drags this movie on her shoulders and Matthew Lillard who is so convincing that you can't help but wonder why isn't anybody else trying equally as hard to bring Scream to a level of brilliance it could have achieved but sadly, for me, it will be remembered as a mere blueprint for a far superior parody (!) movie.

There are a few likable characters but not much to keep you engaged.I like to think that the characters are unlikeable because Wes was using an old giallo trick, making all of the characters assholes its a way to make your audience suspicious about every character, so there isn't a clear answer on who's really the killer.Overall, the film was trying to make fun of slasher movies but it wasn't trying to make a legitimate slasher instead we got stupid in- jokes and a bit of giallo here and there.I wont recommend it, but if you are not looking for a genuine horror film then this may be up your alley",Scream
227,"David, Film Freak",Horror flick of the century that will leave you short of breath!,10,4 November 2000,"I was only 10 years old when I first saw ""Scream"". And I nearly c****ed myself. Seriously, Scream is the most scariest, intelligent, witty movies ever created in the horror genre.The first 15 minutes are obviously, the best, as Drew Barrymore falls prey to that Ghostface Killer, we've all got to love and hate.Neve Campbell acts really well as teen heroine Sidney Prescott - the poor girl who's being hunted down by a maniac with a knife. David Arquette also puts in a few good lines as the slightly thick 'Deputy Dewey'. Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich are also OK, but Courteney Cox is the stand out character in this film, as the annoying, bitchy self-absorbed TV reporter.I thought that Scream was very good. It had some pretty gory shots which added to the effect, plus the added bonus of making fun of horror movies and the whole idea of it.However, as the movie progressed I thought that the plot began to slide, and at some points seemed somewhat unrealistic and unfinished. But the final scenes at the house, were excellent, as Sydney attempts to get her own back on the people responsible for her emotional hell (and decapitation of friends and family).Anyway, I've seen Scream many more times since then, and can safely say it is a classic Horror/Comedy film. The acting was brilliant, the plot was good, the one-liners were excellent and Gale's bitchy comments to cameraman Kenny were even better! 8/10",Scream

Because i liked so much, i started renting almost all the horror movies in the video store. Although Scream 2 came close, none of the movies i have rented were as creepy and scary as this one. It is very rare for a horror to be so plenty of dark humor. The whole idea of a killer getting his inspiration from scary movies is, in my opinion, very realistic and creepy. It shows what a scary movie freak is capable of doing.It's no wonder Kevin Williamson is very busy writing at the moment, he's brought back the whole horror genre. If it wasn't for Scream, we wouldn't have I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, The Faculty or even Halloween H20. Not that it would be a big loss if we didn't have any of these movies, but still.But the person who's to credit more than anyone for this movie is director Wes Craven.

231,Mr_Censored,A seminal slasher flick for the 90's.,9,19 June 2009,"By the time we had reached 1996, the horror genre was in a pretty stagnant state. With nothing to define the decade but cheap sequels and even cheaper direct-to-video productions, the timing was just right for a film to come along that both defined its era and spun the genre on its head. In the 60's, it was ""Psycho."" In the 70's, ""Halloween."" The 80's were owned by ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" Enter ""Scream,"" the one true stand-out genre flick of its time, a film that has incited as much praise as it has criticism from horror fan-boys, as well as inspiring and reviving a whole new breed of self-aware slasher films that were, sadly, not nearly as good as this big-boy.After losing control of the franchise he started with ""A Nightmare On Elm Street,"" director Wes Craven got his groove back with ""Scream,"" settling in as the director of its two sequels and earning himself back some of the credibility that the late 80's and early 90's stripped him of. With a clever script from newcomer Kevin Williamson, it was the first slasher film where its characters were aware of what was happening to them. Heck, they even invoke a set of rules to survive a horror film, while blatantly taking stabs at the well-worn classics of the horror genre. While this formula became rather redundant by the time ""Scream 2"" rolled around (let alone, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Urban Legend"" and the like) it was rather inventive and fresh for its time, and taken in the correct context, makes for a brilliant and unique slasher film.You'll spend the bulk of the film trying to guess the identity of the killer, but thankfully the script is smart enough to lead you astray and only by blind luck would you be able to identify him/her. The death scenes are surprisingly intense considering how neutered the genre was at the time, and in its most notorious scene – the opening – does away with a big-name star in a way that sets the tone for the rest of the film by leaving you with the feeling that anything can happen. Part mystery, part comedy, part slasher, ""Scream"" pays tribute to its influences but has enough of a sense of humor to poke fun at the clichés in the genre. One of Wes Craven's finest films, and certainly a definitive film for the 90's, not just in the horror genre, but in general.",Scream

I love this movie and its a fantastic start to horror series that starts a structure for what's to come.The opening is fantastic and the way this movie deconstructs horror movies is fantastic and it's brilliantly written.
The Killer Ghostface is one of my favourite horror icons after Freddy and Michael he is such a cool character and the fact that he can be anyone there's just more to do with him.The meta style this movie is brilliant and it's goes through all the franchise and for me it's what makes Scream stand out the fact they use other horror movies to explain what going on its awesome and it's a great watch for horror fans.This movie introduces one of my favourite horror final girls in Sidney Prescott as played Neve Campbell she is is fantastic in this movie and the rest of the franchise.Just a fun horror movie and a great start to the franchise not my favourite in the series but I love it as a first chapter great horror icon and a great final girl with a great meta storyline just makes for a fun Slasher movie.Verdict 8.5/10 great start to a horror series and a great fun Slasher movie",Scream

This is of course, ridiculously deplorable and deporably ridiculous, but it knows it is, and it is very, very entertaining while being such.Scream takes its cues from Halloween, Friday the 13th and its three sequels, and it doesn't hide that fact, even playing Halloween on screen in the movie - allowing for a rather humorous twist towards the end, heh. This pretty much follows the blueprint of all the cheesy 80s splatter/serial killer movies there ever were, but it doesn't screw up.There's little here that you haven't seen already if you love these dumb 80s slashers, but if that is the case, then what's one more to add to the pile?

Scream delivers, rescuing horror fanatics and fans of film in general from the jaws of straight to video gore fests that have plagued the 1990's after the classic stalk and slash flicks of the '70's and '80's. The reason that this film succeeds is that as well as scaring and thrilling the living daylights out of the audience, Wes Craven takes the opportunity to take the mick out of the horror genre, and this hint of comedy is great alongside the much slicing and dicing going on around it. Funnily enough I wasn't that impressed with the film the first time around but I watched it again and picked up on a lot of things which I didn't get the first time around.

How stupid can it get? Dressed up like that in a supermarket, the day after a double murder. Nobody's going to notice that (heavy sarcasm). I though the ending was really cool though. I had the twist partially figured out, but I really didn't think it was Billy. I did figure there was more than one killer, but I fell for the obvious red-herring of Randy...I guess I just underestimated Craven, didn't think he'd twist it too much.

240,Panterken,Wes Craven resurrects the Slasher genre with one hell of a movie.,8,12 February 2008,"Horror movie are considered by most bottom-of-the-ladder cinema. And let's face it, they have a point. The True Classics can be counted on one hand. A Nightmare On Elm Street is fantastic, Carrie is brilliant, but only a few other movies in the genre deserve to be mentioned in one breath with them. 'Scream' is definitely one of them, a scary movie with real scares, a more than decent soundtrack, acting that is of a very rare quality in the genre and a very surprising ending for a change. What makes the movie work on the level of believability is the nifty way it was written. By the characters' constant mentioning of real movies, you get the sense that the world they live in is in fact ours. Countless movies use this technique (Donnie Darko with Evil Dead for instance) and it works very well on a subconscious level.Another thing the movie has going for it, is the clichés. Craven actually embraces them and the film is filled with them on purpose. It actually ends with the ambulance and police cars shot, seen in countless action or horror movies.Many people who haven't seen the movie may assume 'Scream' is just the next over-hyped brainless pubescent cinema, but it's far from that. It's without a doubt the best of the rebirth wave of slasher movies of the mid -90's (although I liked 'I know What You Did' too), and can in no way be compared to the truckload of bad horror movies coming out every day still. The plot is original in all it's cliché-glory and the characters are relatively complex, the mask may be a little laughable but 'Scream' was never meant to be taken seriously.

The Worst: The movie has almost two hours but as well as any good movie it passes like it had only half an hour, which is something that can be not good. Rating: 8/ 10Two young teenagers have been murdered by a dysfunctional killer that took his love for scary movies one step too far the day after on the local high school of Woodsboro, the police is in a commotion, every student his being asked about their relationships with the frustrated students. This story is particularly interesting the young student Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her group of friends, her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Tatum (Rose McGowan), Dewey (David Arquette), Stu (Mathew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and the opportunist reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Sidney's relationship with Billy isn't the best currently as her mother's one year death anniversary approaches, having in the background all of these sudden and macabre deaths on campus. Deaths are becoming more frequent, bodies pile' up, Sidney gets attacked, never knowing in who to trust she realizes that the deaths are all coming each time closer to her The killer seems to be everywhere at any time, to scare everyone.As I said, after this movie movies with a killer with a knife chasing high school students and killing them start appearing countlessly. Although, the script and general quality of this movie started being insulted and imitated with movies trying to let themselves too seriously, of course failing Anyway, Scream always came out as a winner and it still remains so as a common know.  Not to be forgotten that this movie is considered one of the all time best horror films, and my God it deserves it so much! Like a declaration I heard sometime ago: ` Horror/ Scary movies are only good and really frightening when they can happen to anyone, at any place, at any time'.I was to write this review a few time ago, but I decided to go rent this movie again so I could be more inspired doing it. One tip: the perfect set is alone at house or with your friends at night lights off, closed doors, window(s) opened and curtains closed dancing in the wind! One last thing, a goof actually, one that really p***ed me off: when Casey Becker gets killed, and hanged on the tree, you can clearly see that she is a toy or a stunt as the faces are completely different, and when `someone' is killed on the garage and electrocuted you can clearly tell that it is a toy by the look of its skin.Don't wait and go see it, if you already have, do it again! 8/10",Scream
243,TheMovieDoctorful,My Favorite Film in My Favorite Slasher Franchise,10,11 November 2018,"Scream is the film that saved the Horror genre. While there are certainly 90s Horror films pre-Scream that I enjoyed, films that slowly helped to errode the decades of outdated and ugly narrative cliches that had poisoned Horror films for decades (Candyman, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers being the first that come to mind), Scream is the film that finally shut the door on them and paved the way for a smarter and more mature breed of Horror film. This movie can stand alone as my practically my whole thesis on why 90s Horror is infinitely superior to that of the 70s and 80s; stronger characters, better acting, more thoughtful stories, more consistent tone and self aware without being lazy. Slashers don't get much better than Scream.The performances in the original Scream are iconic in a way that few if any other slashers can match. Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott has a very strong edge and non-conformist attitude to her personality and choice-making that distinctly separates her from typical final girls. Even before she loses her virginity to her boyfriend, Sidney's assertiveness, proactive nature and passion make her feel much more real, relatable and likable than the numerous final girls of decades past, hollow personifications of Conservative values to validate their films' gratuitous violence and sexuality to the hypocritical moral arbiters of their times. Watching her break the shackles of her possessive relationship with Billy will always be incredibly satisfying. The label ""feminist Horror film"" is obnoxiously overused (Halloween 2018's self labeling as such was a rather irritating reminder), but in the case of Scream, it undoubtedly fits. The 90s were the catalyst decade for true social justice in Horror movies and Scream is perhaps the most celebrated example of a progressive Horror film. Speaking of Billy, Skeet Ulrich's portrayal of the sexiest slasher villain in Horror history is unforgettable. Billy is so manipulative with such an alluring, sweet voice that he even managed to convince me that he was just a good guy with some personal issues. Yet, when he finally reveals his true nature to his trusting girlfriend, it feels less like a cheap trick and more like a clever ruse that I feel foolish for falling for. Every time I watch Scream, I wish to myself that perhaps, this time, Billy's humanity will come from a place of sincerity. A place of good intention. Even when I know it won't. Matthew Lillard as Stu is an absolute delight. If there was one negative effect that Scream had on the genre, it was the numerous actors who unsuccessfully tried and failed to copy his hilarious, one-of-a-kind performance. That being said, there's only one Matthew Lillard, and his eccentric, childlike, off-the-wall bonkers depiction of Billy's dimwitted helper is comedic acting at its finest. And, of course, I'd be remiss not to bring up Jamie Kennedy's performance as Horror fanboy Randy Meeks. A lesser actor would have come across as obnoxious and pretentious in the role, but Meeks' unconditional love of all things Horror comes off as rather genuine and Meeks himself has some excellent comedic timing.What makes Scream a cut above the rest in terms of slashers, what made it the standard by which all Horror comedies would follow, is how it satirizes Horror cliches by subverting them rather than repeating them. One thing true of both great Horror and great comedy is surprise. If you see a joke or a scare coming, you're not likely to be affected by it. Where Scream sets itself apart from its contemporaries is how often it breaks the rules. It will set you up to expect a certain scare, plot point, character reveal or death and then completely turn the tables by revealing it was all a ruse or distraction from something else. This keeps us shocked in response to its scares and caught off guard in response to its comedy. It also keeps us more invested in the story because we can much more easily imagine ourselves in the roles of the characters. They're human beings, not stock archetypes in a cheap Horror flick. Merely repeating cliches and genre conventions from the genre with the excuse of ""lol irony"" is bad satire and thankfully something that Scream is never guilty of.The 90s atmosphere of the production will always have such a wonderful charm. Everything from the costume design to the sets to the dialogue feels so beautifully nostalgic, this whole movie is such an endearing time capsule without ever forcing it. On top of that, like the best teen Horror films, Scream does a wonderful job capturing the freedom and ignorant euphoria associated with teenage life. The feeling that you're ready to take on the whole world...And the sinking tragedy of murder, community terror and mourning that sends your fantasy crashing down.The soundtrack is absolutely glorious. Everything about it screams 90s teenage counter culture and it was a breath of fresh air for 1996; a year where the popular music was largely sickly sweet, sentimental bubblegum pop. With tracks from Gus Black, Moby, Alice Cooper and Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, Scream's music just screams alternative angst and I mean that in the best possible way. If Scream were a person, it would be a gorgeous, tattooed rocker chick with her middle fingered hand extending out the window of her girlfriend's car.As much as I love the Friday the 13th and Halloween franchises, the Scream franchise and Ghostface will always be No. 1 in my heart when it comes to the slasher genre. The 1996 classic has more than deserved its reputation as a seminal example of the genre and here's hoping we can see a revival of it in years to come. Now, what are my thoughts on the sequels? Well, that's a topic for another day.",Scream

So, I thought I knew who the man behind the mask was but of course I was wrong. This is the surprise effect for me, although I didn't really like the disclosure. That made the mystery felt, as a matter of fact, too simple. Whatever that was, I did enjoy the movie. It was so frightening. I really like the whole performance of the casts, especially Courtney Cox who played Gale Weathers. . She's amazing. Her voice really fits her role as a reporter, I think.",Scream
247,McQualude,The little parody that could.,7,10 February 2008,"I recently watched this again for the first time since it hit theaters. Scream has been parodied and copied so many times the film itself is now a cliché but that doesn't change the brilliance of the original. In some ways Scream is an end cap to the modern slasher sub-genre beginning with Halloween on one end and culminating in Scream. Sure, there have been a number of slashers since but the genre hasn't dominated horror as they did in the two decades following Halloween. Scream isn't terribly original but by capitalizing on that it serves to masterfully sum up the genre and two decades of films before it. Wes Craven, where are you now? Deliver us from Eli Roth and Uwe Boll!",Scream
248,evans-j34,Still rocks 25years later,9,24 October 2021,"Can remember watching this when it first came out can't believe its been 25years already. I never get bored of watching this movie at nearly 2hours long its fast paced, intense humorous, and great chemistry and acting between the characters. Even ghostface was actually creepy when it came out( until the wayan brothers used it in their comedies lol) There's due to be a scream 5 released in just a couple of months but I really wish bk at the time we got given a prequel film of Maureen's murder, so we would've got to see more of Stu & Billy ( skeet ulrich) as there's no doubt they're a massive Joy to the film along side Neive, such a shame this wasn't explored while they was younger, as Billy is charmingly mesmerising for a psychopath. Has to be the best of 90s slashers.",Scream
249,Zombified_660,"Fun, if somewhat predictable.",7,8 July 2005,"When I'm watching a horror movie, I generally watch for two reasons. Firstly, I want to be scared and enjoy the adrenaline rush of the jumps. Secondly, I want to lose myself within some kind of dark fantasy setup. Despite the fact that Scream fails to provide on either, it's a great movie in it's own right, but I think it's time Scream was referred to as what it is, a suspense thriller, and not a balls to the wall horror movie.With that comment out the way, I can say this: Scream is the best movie I've seen of it's kind. It has no pretensions to being an out and out horror movie, whereas it's copycats seemed to set out to be scary as hell and fell flat on their faces. The main reason it's such a joy to behold is this lack of pretension. Most modern horror blockbusters make themselves out to be the best thing since sliced bread within the first ten seconds of the trailer. They rarely are. Scream is happy to be Scream, and it doesn't really mind about how scary you find it so long as you're enjoying it.The cast are pretty annoying (par for the course with a Hollywood horror), but since this is a slasher parody that follows the 'cast iron genre rules' it's worth noting that a few of them are roadkill by the end of the movie. However, aggravatingly enough whereas in Fri 13th or Halloween, anyone who's a complete dummy or a lush or whatever will dead cert be on the end of an axe by the movies end, most of the victims in Scream have little or no relation to the greater plot, something that irked me a bit, as you'd know every death was coming because it'd go back to the random person who only just appeared last scene. It almost seemed that Craven and Williams didn't want any of their stars to die (aside from Drew Barrymore, who in the only shock in the movie is fairly unpleasantly slashed to death and hung in the opening sequence). Add to this the fact that most of the deaths had a 'I've had worse' type effect on me (even the aforementioned sequence is relatively non-violent in comparison to a Jason or Freddy film) as opposed to shocking me, and the horror aspect pretty much failed to have any impact on me.Aside from the fact that Scream is only scary if you're 14 (in which case you shouldn't have been watching it anyway lol), and the cast is full of people I've had my fill of (Please, someone cast Matthew Lillard in one of these movies and pickaxe his head in the first five minutes!), Scream has a pretty cool (for the time, it's now been copied to death) plot line, even if I did guess whodunit in the opening sequence. The plot twists around and around, and if you haven't seen a lot of these films, it'll probably throw you for a loop. It's well worth watching just to see the intrigue and mystery unfold.Add to this an original looking killer, some cool black humour, and there's a lot of reasons to watch Scream. It's an enjoyable, unassuming movie with slick production values and a good script and storyline. However, it has got its flaws and I disagree with its classic status. If you're into movies with the 90s/00s brat pack in them (Drew Barrymore, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell etc) you'll love this, and if you want a soft entry into horror, check this out as it's a fine place to start, but I would suggest you check out some real, non Hollywood horror as well, not merely confine yourself to the 'horror revival' genre Scream sits in, as frankly, movies like Maniac Cop, Ginger Snaps and Candyman (all of which come firmly recommended) make sitting through Scream seem like a walk in a happy happy field full of dandelions and bunnies. The best of the revival bunch. Recommended, but not perfect.",Scream
250,jed-estes,Don't you blame the movies. Movies Don't Create Psychos they only make psychos more creative.,10,17 August 2006,"It is with those lines uttered by Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis that my life changed. Before this film I was just a casual movie watcher being only ten years old. The only films that had stirred my attention by this point were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars, and Alien. Even though Alien was my first encounter with horror, Scream catapulted me into an obsession for the genre. Scream introduced me to so many franchises and pop culture phenoms that I was now an instant film buff after watching this film. Irented it no less than twenty times before my mother gained the good sense to buy it for me. After I owned it I had free reign to dissect the film. And dissect I did. I went through found all the quotes and references and then went on to find those films thus increasing my obsession for the genre. Thank you Wes Craven for many, many, many years of enjoyment. I now share this film with my little eight year old sister who her self is becoming a fan of horror. This movie is great, ten stars.",Scream
251,roddekker,And It All Began With A Scream Over 9-1-1!,6,21 January 2015,"Using every slasher-movie cliché in the book, Scream's deadly, blood-drenched story of vengeance and madness worked, for the most part, because it took the time to actually laugh at itself.Featuring a very strong opening sequence (""Hello? Who's calling?"") that literally sent shivers of terror running up & down this viewer's spine (seriously), Scream certainly delivered the horrific goods in the course of its adrenaline-rush story.Competently directed by Wes Craven, I'd say that Scream and A Nightmare On Elm Street are 2 of this dude's best horror-movie offerings, to date. I can't believe that this movie actually spawned 3 inferior sequels.My 2 beefs about this film are - (1) The final sequence (which revealed who was behind these ghastly murders) was too dragged out and this seriously weakened the story's fever-pitch momentum.(2) Product placement of Chex cereal and Jiffy Pop popcorn lost this film some significant points.",Scream
252,psycho_153,HIGHLY OVER-RATED!!,8,28 December 1999,"I watched this before I started watching horror films and when I saw it, I thought it was highly entertaining. But now that I have watched many horror movie I've realized it's not all that original. The movie hasn't got much violence and gore and no great killing through the film (the one in the garage, was cool) The phone calls were good, but the calls in lack Christmas were so much better cause the killer was crazy and he wanted to let the person know on the phone that he was crazy and he was after her. I also didn't like the killers, because they were too clumsy and got their butts kicked by Sidney, you don't see Jason or Michael tripping over things and getting beaten by a girl. The movie trivia was a good add and very original. The story is It is a year since Sidney Prescott's mother was raped and murdered, now someone that has a fascination for horror movies is killing people close to Sidney. But who is it? Overall the movie is a fun watch, but people who say it is the best and so violent must not watch many horror movies because there is much more worst stuff out there and a lot of that stuff Scream ripped off.

253,MovieProductions,"Witty, unique, hip, Craven's ""Scream"" is loud",7,9 April 2011,"*** out of (****)Oh ""Scream"". What's there more to say? This was the granddaddy slasher of the 90's, and reasonably so. With witty dialogue, a slick atmosphere, and a nice line drawn between horror and self-parody, ""Scream"" resonates. The kills? This is the goriest of the trilogy. We get dismemberment, disembowelment, and tons of red fluids. Don't be fooled though. This film isn't competing for the most blood used in a film. Craven builds up suspense pretty nicely with a dark, sinister tone, unnerving music, and a few glimpses of the killer himself here and there. Strip away the profanity and gore, and ""Scream"" would still be a strong production.Not to mention the script is where it's at. The dialogue is cutting edge material, sprinkling in some welcome humor and sharp one liners. The performances are solid. Nobody here is trying to win the Academy Awards, yet everyone here is doing their job. And for once we don't have ""Friday the 13th part 38"". This is a unique film that stands on its own two feet. What I thought was pretty neat was how it references slashers that came out nearly a decade before. That's just an added bonus for horror fans.All in all, ""Scream"" isn't a film that I loved, but it resonates with me, and I found myself to still enjoy it. The dialogue, the characters, the story. It's all there. Witty, unique, hip, Craven's ""Scream"" is loud.",Scream
254,80sHorror,The slasher film that started it all (again) CLASSIC!!,10,21 February 2015,"The 'slasher' film, i.e. a killer stalking a selection of dippy American teenagers, had kind of gone out of fashion in the late eighties. Therefore, the early nineties were a barren place for masked nutjobs wielding knives. Then Scream came along.It's about a young girl, seemingly destined to spend the entire film being stalked by a masked killer who despatches her peers in many different knife-related ways. Nothing particularly unusual there, but don't let the basic nature of the plot put you off. There is definitely more to this than meets the eye.It not only revitalised the 'slasher genre' but it also was the first of such films to poke fun at the whole genre in itself. If you've ever found yourself yelling at the 'dumb blonde' on the screen to run the right way and not straight back into the serial killer's clutches then this is the film for you. It uses the horror clichés to the max and takes great pleasure in, not only pointing them out, but dispelling them.However, Scream wasn't just hugely successful because it poked fun at the genre. It was also a damn good mystery. With other similar films, the killer was normally quite obvious, i.e. the big disfigured bloke in a mask, wielding a chainsaw. But in Scream, pretty much every character is a suspect. The only time you can really rule them out is when they end up the wrong end of the killer's knife.If you love horror then you've probably already seen it. If you haven't... watch it now. The only downside you might find is that it was so successful that there were almost an infinite number of (nowhere near as good) copies. However, Scream is the original and BEST. It's fun, gory, well-written with great characters. What more could you want if you like scary movies?",Scream

258,rebecca-ry,Anti-cliché,8,29 May 2012,"'Scream' brought a lot of attention back to teen-based horror films. However, despite a lot in this genre being 'movie-trash', this film certainly is not. It's a black-comedy almost with a lot of now famous names included in the cast. The most famous at the time this was made (1996) was Drew Barrymore who doesn't last very long. This opening sequence to the film automatically made 'Scream' special. Throughout the film there are a lot of nods to teen-horror cliché's which are usually ridiculed. Mocking the typical teenage horror character stereotype is what made this film so unique and very funny. The script itself is often genius, the funny scenes can be really funny and the horror/frightening scenes do what they're supposed to do.Most of the acting is pretty good. Matthew Lillard is probably the best in the film, providing most of the comedy. Other performances like those of Courtney Cox and David Arquette are very good which is something you don't see too much of in horror films. The film overall is really worth a watch, apparently after this film was released sales of house-phones with caller ID doubled, you know that a film had that great an effect on people must be worthy of watching.",Scream

However, my opinion is that the script ruined this movie. It could've been a lot better. Especially with Nev Campbell. Who can forget her? I thought the story was good, but the movie was very, intensely boring. It was 100% suspense and no action. Yeah, it was cool when Nev received the phone calls, and in the beginning, where the killer plays that ""what's you favorite scary movie"" game with her. That was all original for it's time. Although, unless your down for 100% suspense and no action, this is the movie for you. Me personally, I hate waiting. So maybe suspense isn't exactly the right way to go for me. Only if it's a half and half type thing. Maybe it was just the script though? Who knows? All I know is that they could've did a lot better of a job with killings and action. Despite all my negativity, this movie did have an awesome ending. It was a stab fest. I was just thinking to myself when I first seen this ""how the hell are these guys even doing this?"" It's crazy. I gave this movie a mid-range score, based on the ending alone. The script sucked, but everything else was good. I guess it's good for a one time watch.",Scream
261,IamROCKAS,Low kill count but at least there were a bunch of horror references,8,3 July 2020,"The movie had one of the best starts for a horror movie ever. It set the tone for the entire movie (and, I assume, the sequels too) and it deserves a legendary status in my book.After that, we get a bunch of references to classic horror movie titles and tropes, which includes Carrie, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Hellraiser, A Nightmare on Elm Street and so on and we even get a quote from Psycho. I'm sure there's more and I'll need to watch the movie again just to catch them all.I tend to focus a lot on the soundtracks when watching movies and I was certainly pleased with the soundtrack of Scream - from the romantic alternative version of Don't Fear the Reaper by BOC to Whisper To A Scream by Soho, this movie picked perfect songs for the right scenes. Youth Of America by Ammo stood out for the ideal transition to change the scenery and the mood that the film was taking at that moment.Now let's talk about the characters and the action - it was cute that Dewey and Gale were making eyes at each-other through out the movie so much that David Arquette and Courtney Cox ended up marrying (and later divorced) years later and a light, slightly comedic, tone managed to lift up the mood of the movie but the oblivious nature got old quite quickly to the point that it was just plain weird and slightly stupid. I don't know if Tatum's clothes would fit any school dress code back in the day and the whole scene in the garage, even though it was one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, felt more like a parody of a horror movie. The twist that followed later was cool, I'll admit that, but everything following it was a bit dull - it seems Billy decided not to shoot Gale just because he needs to see Monica end up with Chandler next season. Also, somehow nobody dies and everyone manages to just get up after being shot, stabbed and injured in any other means. I enjoyed most of the acting, with Billy being the chaotic evil and Stu being the chaotic good and the most comical diabolic psycho, only matched by the Three Fingers from the Wrong Turn series with his laughter, and most of the characters seemed either likable or interesting in some means, I don't recall anyone being plain and boring.In the end of the day, it is a descent horror film about horror films and it deserves a watch. Love it or hate it, this movie is important for the horror genre for inspiring countless movies that came after it.",Scream

266,wchngliu,"Without Doubt The Ultimate, Original, And Best Teen Horror Slasher Flick Ever Released",9,8 September 2007,"*** This Comment May Contain Spoilers *** I for one will say that I am not a fan of horror movies, least of all stuff such as The Nightmare On Elm Street series, but I did enjoy watching the Scream trilogy. If anything, thanks to Wes Craven it has totally reinvigorated and rejuvenated the horror genre, thus transforming it from what was deemed as old fashioned and catering towards older folks into a trendy, contemporary and youth based genre and introducing movie goers to a new sub-genre of horror: the slasher flick.Scream in truth for most part, is a thriller which incorporates and juxtaposes elements of horror movies to it. Evidently, its success spanned other movies of a similar- yet not as good nature, likewise I know What You Did Last Summer, in addition to silly and innocuous spoof movies such as the Scary Movie series.What was so great about the Scream films though was that there was no way of telling who the killer was, the first time you'd seen it. Rather you'd assume it would be this person, when in fact he/she wasn't involved whatsoever. When I first saw the first movie, I had no idea that Sidney's boyfriend was the killer, alongside one of her so called best friends. Also, the victims weren't as hapless and hopeless as we'd come to expect, as all of them put up a brave fight and attempt to make their escape unharmed.The twists in Scream were clever, but what was also clever was in finding out and discovering the sheer motives and reasons, as well as actions that led up to and during the killings by the killers themselves. The performances from the leads ranged from the very good to terrific; hence, Friends's very own Courteney Cox Arquette successfully manages to plays against type as a roving reporter, and the build-up to the actual revealing of the killer's identity is full of suspense and intrigue, whilst Neve Campbell does a good job playing would-be hero, Sydney. Therefore, it's not so much the blood, gore and killings that shock and leave the audience baffled but rather the final outcome when everything is out in the open, the whole truth is revealed and the murderer unmasks himself.In all, Scream is one rare and yet extremely intelligent horror thriller. It is full of suspense, intrigue and some of the scenes will make you jump out of your seat. It is undoubtedly the ultimate, original and best teen horror film, as well as the best contemporary horror movie you will ever see. The sequel meanwhile was good, although not as great as the prequel, whilst the third, well it is not as good as the second and no where near superior to the first.As a horror movie, Scream is a scream and the killer's mask itself is almost an iconic movie trademark that is reminiscent of the Michael Myers version from Hallowean. The best horror movie of the 90s methinks? well, its certainly one of the cleverest that's for sure",Scream
267,harybobjoebob,One of my favorite movies,8,10 October 2020,"I grew up watching this movie, I love every second of it. As a child I enjoyed it for its horror and as an adult I enjoy it for its comedy, this movie is very funny and makes me laugh ever time I watch it, ghost face is a very iconic character, and screams horror. This movie has really cool ideas and themes and they are all executed perfectly, the opening scene will always be my favorite, the first time I saw it I got nightmares for weeks and I couldn't sleep. This movie is epic",Scream
268,WasiReviews,This Movie is Super Meta,10,11 November 2020,"I loved this film it was self aware having specific lines targeting the cliché's of slasher films which is pretty comedic yet this film has soo much gore and thrills for it to be a comedy-horror. I did laugh a few times but I felt the awareness was just an excuse to have moments of calm because for 90% of the film it just kept hammering you with horror and gore. Soo many deaths, great acting it felt like fake teen stuff but with real teenagers. I only now realize Matthew Lillard was a star he wasn't the best of the cast but he did very well. Neve Campbell stole the show with a great performance by a female lead. Steve Ulrich made a very convincing performance without spoiling anything you were suspicious of him for 20 minutes then you realize he can't be it then you're suspicious of him again. I knew he looked familiar. I don't have much else to say if you love a 9/10 slasher film but more meta check it out.Not trying to sound narcissistic but I saw the ending coming and I accurately predicted what would happen to an extent. I didn't know who but you are constantly trying to figure out who the killer is using the evidence acquired during the film. I love when horror adds murder mystery that's why I gave this movie a 10.",Scream
269,Lando_Hass,A corner stone in the horror genre...,8,20 April 2002,"Scream gives an excellent presentation to the horror genre.Over the past six years,many Scream clones have hit the big screen,but Scream still manages to stay out on top,achieving the goal of being a memorable horror movie that has great acting,buckets of blood,and chilling story.Wes Craven made a horror movie that will be remembered due to how much violence this movie contains,its deep,solid acting,and one of a kind story.Now lets keep the main flaws in prespective that this movie has.First off,its a tad predictable,lots of times it focuses to much on certain events in this movie that arent needed,and last,It gets old after you watch it to many times.Other than that,those flaws dont affect the movie.Great movie,watch it! 8 out of 10.",Scream
270,Det_McNulty,"Surprisingly Effective Horror Spoof, Manages To Make A Joke Out Of Every Horror Cliché and Still Remain A Horror",8,7 October 2006,"Over the last decade the painting ""Scream"" by Edvard Munch has become better known from the creation of what is now an infamous Halloween mask. The classic image of the white face stretched in a painful scream has become iconic for it's simple and yet un-nerving look. First thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of Scream is the ""ghost face"" mask and rightly so, it managed to create one of the perfect horror villains. The fact that throughout the film you never know the evil that is behind the simple mask and it makes it all the more brilliant.I feel guilty saying that I love this movie and yet I still feel I have every right to like it. On first glance I felt I'd been for the typical clichéd teen slasher movie, in which dumb teenagers get picked off one by one and still making sure there are two victims of the ordeal remaining to make room for a sequel. Of course the film does make room for its two-follow ups and still manages to reference another certain Wes Craven originated franchise that became an awful money making machine.The fact that ""Scream"" is a horror movie aimed at teens and it still manages to be fun and intelligent. The cast's chemistry is amusing and you can tell everybody had a lot of fun on set. The film's biggest star would be Courtney Cox who plays a highly entertaining and overwhelming character. Drew Barrymore also makes a small role for the infamous opening sequence, one of my favourite scenes. There is a certain moment in the 15-minute scene that stands out for proving the film's sarcastic, twisted and almost guilty comedy level. The moment is one where Drew Barrymore gets put in a tight spot and runs into the kitchen, the cliché joke (in what is actually a very tense scene) is that the kitchen table is empty apart from a box of kitchen knifes. Very sardonic humour, that you'll have to look out for and it certainly is honest in the way it studies the art of making a horror.I've never been a fan of Wes Craven, yet I think Scream proves that he can make a good movie when he puts his mind to it. After watching Scream, I've gained a newfound respect for the horror director. There's a scene in the high school that involves an excellent cameo from the director himself, so keep an eye out. The script is very clumsy, yet it somehow still manages to be perfect for the type of film Scream is. The fact that there is ""rubbish"" is Scream, still does not take away the fact it is an excellent film. The characters are likable and memorable which helps you to become involved in the film.The film's pacing is one that keeps you wanting to watch and always tricks you into thinking the killer is someone else and then when the thrilling finale comes to a close you'll certainly feel tricked. The whole last 30 minutes of the film are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense that even Hitchcock would take note to. The film's references to classic horror movies are certainly impressive and will please all the horror hounds out there. Scream is somewhat a mixture Halloween, but with a slight Carry On edge clinging on. The lighting and the music help create the tension for the crazy and darkly funny death sequences.Avoid Scary Movie which is a painful attempt to rip off the Scream franchise with a spoof attempt (as if they didn't realise Scream was a spoof). If you're looking for a movie that you hope will scare you, then don't watch Scream. But if you want an amusing horror movie, that is from it's roots and still manages to be original then look no further. Perfect to watch with a bunch of friends or just on your own for pure ""sit back"" entertainment value. Criminally underrated, don't feel guilty for loving it for what it is.",Scream
271,twpain,Great,10,6 June 2020,This is the best horror movie for me. This movie is amazing for me. I love the parody aspect of the film and how it doesn't try to be scary. I love the idea of Ghostface and the mystery of who's behind the mask. There is some really cool scenes in this movie making for a really satisfying film.,Scream
272,drawlife,A first of it's kind.,8,3 September 2015,"Back in the 90's horror movies were dead. Scream revitalized that genre for it's meta and self-aware take. Since Scream most movie have tried that meta, self-aware angle, some have been successful, but a lot haven't. We can all thank Scream for that. Give a lot of credit to Wes Craven's sense of direction, building scares and tension per each scene, and Kevin Williamson's original sharp script. He obviously had a brain child. It's also almost hard to even imagine Wes Craven almost passed on this movie. Killing off Drew Barrymore right from the beginning was a huge deal back then. Killing a big star like her meant no one was safe and that unpredictability was at massive play, keeping you guessing. The cast is wonderful. Neve Campbell was my childhood crush. I watched this film when I was about twelve years old and since then I fell in love with her. Neve portrays her character Sidney Prescott very well, she's strong and she plays the victim role effortlessly. Couteney Cox is great at playing the bitchy reporter Gale Weathers, David Arquette gives the film some levity as a clumsy deputy Dewey Riley. Rose McGowan plays Sidney's spunk best friend Tatum with attitude. Skeet Ulrich plays it straight as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis, almost all the time you can't help but wonder if he's a suspect or not. Matthew Lillard also provides some humor as Stu, as well as Jamie Kennedy who is the breakout character Randy Meeks, the film's go-to for anything comedic. The Ghostface killer is so iconic now that it just doesn't seem scary at all, but the very first time we see that costume, and he's chasing Drew Barrymore, it is quite effective. Craven does such a good job with building up suspense. He makes Billy Loomis look guilty, but then innocent. You almost kind expect him to be the killer, but in the finale what don't you expect is Matthew Lillard end up being the second killer. It's a double whammy and you'd never expect someone like his character to end up being a killer. Williamson's writing allows you to take a breather from all the suspense and laugh once in while with solid dialog and jokes. The only gripe in this near perfect film is when Ghostface is stalking both Sidney and Tatum in broad daylight. That is one moment where it just looses some credibility. Also some of the special effects are just a tad bit outdated. Not so much so that it takes you out of the film, but you can tell, especially Tatum's death by the garage door. I grew up in the 90's, I'm only in my early twenties and Scream was definitely a part of my childhood. Thank you Wes Craven for not only giving me nightmares and making me afraid to go to sleep(another obvious iconic Wes Craven horror villain) and answering phone calls. You will be missed by many. 8.7/10",Scream
273,Jerry Ables,Excellent horror film,10,31 October 2001,I thoroughly enjoyed it because it has plenty of creepy fun and excitement throughout.  The story was very well written and everyone in the movie did an excellent job with the roles they played.  Highly recommended to any slasher fan.,Scream
274,irishm,Why am I even watching this?,2,10 October 2014,"That was what I kept asking myself for the entire duration. My motives were weaker than those of the killer I had a couple hours to kill, I didn't feel like thinking, the cat was in my lap, those are my only excuses.I've heard a lot about how great this movie is but I honestly didn't see any indication of it. I was interested in the references to other horror movies, most of which I had seen and many of which I had enjoyed enough to see them multiple times, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested. The one thing in the movie that I thought was sincerely funny was the scene where Henry Winkler (Fonzie, what are YOU doing here??!) as the school principal goes out into the hall muttering some obscenity, and the nearby janitor who's dressed in a green-and-red striped sweater wearing a cruddy brown hat says ""what did you call me?"", and Winkler replies ""sorry, Fred"". Now, THAT was FUNNY. One of the two stars I'm giving this movie is for that scene.Eventually the film turns into a total bloodbath and you lose track of who's dead, who's dying, who's still upstairs, who got out of the house it just all happens so fast it's utterly ridiculous and you stop caring about the whole deal. At least I did. Oh and Matthew Lillard is possibly the most annoying young actor working today. I couldn't wait for him to get murdered and it took way too long.Disappointing.",Scream
275,lovintennis,"Stupid. 'Clever, hip, and scary' my @$$",3,29 August 2017,"Great acting. Now for criticism: how many doors do the Beckers need for crying out loud? Why are they all glass and why so many windows? Haven't these people heard of curtains? A young girl would never leave every door unlocked when home alone and when she keeps talking to the caller, she goes around locking only random ones, every other. Not all. What's the point of that? It's when she's finally frantic that goes ahead and locks the rest, including the FRONT door! When she first locks the SIDE, we later learn that there are actually two side-by-side doors, only one of which she initially locks. And she doesn't have to keep answering his calls and talking to him when she's obviously annoyed and insecure before becoming frantic. This whole opening sequence is so completely unrealistic and stupid. When things are heating up half way through, the sheriff's talking to Dewey in front of the station. Dewey asks if there's any way that a cellular could've been cloned. The sheriff never answers that, just progresses to tomorrow being the anniversary of Mrs. Prescott's death. At the climax, Billy and Stu relish how they want their spree to end way too much and it's no wonder it backfires. This movie's definitely sub-par.",Scream

279,darkjosh,Craven Rejuvenates The Genre He Pioneered,8,23 November 2000,"Wes Craven's Scream is a welcome, fresh, and fun endeavor into the seemingly tapped horror genre. It's smart, fast-paced, deliciously self-referrential and tense, but above that, it's a breath of life into the tired, predictable horror movie.When a killer begins terrorizing a small town with is love of slasher films and incessant quizzing, Neve Campbell becomes the object of his perversion and just about everyone becomes a suspect.Kevin Williamson's smart, tight script highly original method of literally revealing all the cliches and 'rules' followed in making a horror film.  The fact that the film's devices make it much more interesting, leaving the viewer to wonder exactly what will be done to create suspense now that the bag of tricks has been emptied.  Craven's direction is once-again in top form, and this is certainly one of his most suspenseful films since her introduced the proverbial nightmare walker, Freddy Kreuger.  Unlike Nightmare on Elm Street, however, the tension is built not only by the killer but by the revelation of horror tactics.  Scream is certainly not as gory as some of Craven's other outings, but it will still satisfy gore-lovers.Performance wise, the cast is an effective array of over-confident teens, with Lillard's annoyingly off-beat character stealing a few scenes.  Neve Campbell does well, making Sidney a strong, formidable foe as the Langenkamp-esque heroine. Skeet Ulrich eminates Johnny Depp during some scenes and fares well as Campbell's boyfriend.With its self-referrential quirkiness, some truly genuine scares, and a pulse-pounding, satisfying last half hour, Scream delivers the goods as an inventive horror film and reinforces Craven's masterful standing in the genre.8 out of 10",Scream
280,Phantasm01,Lots of Screams Heard,8,25 July 2006,"""Scream"", released in 1996, is a great horror film that stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox (now Cox-Arquette), David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Berrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and others. This film pays homage to many horror film classics that many horror film fanatics never forget. Two sequels proceed. Its release started a new frenzy of horror film fans. It encouraged its audiences to watch the classics that influenced this film. This later became Wes Craven's highest grossing film to date. It received critical acclaim, including a consideration for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (which was overlooked).""Scream"" desplicts a group of people in a town that is terrorized by a ""serial killer"" whose obsession with horror films goes too far. He, she, or they call the intended victim, alters their voice through a machine, flirts with them, threatens them, and attacks them. The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer. Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before? Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat? Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect. And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target.Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully. He doesn't spoof any of them. Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling. He occasionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including ""The Ricki Lake Show"". Meanwhile, he adds the occasional teen humor that relates well to that age group. Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films. He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own. He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense.Horror film commemorations include ""Friday, the 13th"", ""Halloween"", ""Carrie"", ""The Exorcist"", and his own ""Nightmare On Elm Street"". Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor ""dressed as"" Freddy Krueger. Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted. Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask. While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality.Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining. They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes. Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from ""Halloween"". Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer. The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling.""Scream"" begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time. Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first. Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline. This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.",Scream

282,saint405,"""Do you like scary movies?"" Yes I do!",10,25 June 2005,"Scream is a perfect ten, my all time favorite scary movie. Wes Craven knows how to do horror films and he's brought us an all out horror mystery classic about a hooded figure that's killing teenage kids in a small town. The plot is like any other scary movie, kids are killed, killer gets caught leading to him being unmasked and big shock, yeah well there's a twist! The writer has put in a twist that the kids know that they are in a scary movie, needing to fallow the rules. The cast is perfect, my props go to Matthew Lillard as Stu, the best character in the whole movie. The opening is played perfect and Drew couldn't of been more on the mark. Jamie Kennedy is the perfect as his role as the geeky film nerd Randy who lives by horror films. David Arquet, Courtney Cox,Henry Winkler, and more support this film which gives it the extra steam to be a perfect film. The acting is done greatly, mostly by Drew in the beginning because you can feel for her as she is being spied on by our killer Mr. Ghostface. And I must say, though we don't see his face, we must thank the man who did the phone voice Mr. Roger Jackson. Well done Wes, great directing. Now not only do you have a great plot and well in depth characters, you get tons of blood. For gore fans, you'll really appreciate this film. Now do all yourselves a favor if your a scary movie nut like me, quickly go out and get a copy of Scream. Itself is a scream, enjoy!",Scream
283,Mr_PCM,"Iconic, unique, fresh, a definitive new horror",8,27 February 2006,"Scream With the countless number of teen slasher movies doing the rounds, it is too easy to watch scream and see simply another school serial killer movie that has just rolled off the factory production line. However, it was Wes Craven's 'Scream' that started the whole revival of the horror genre and re-invented the teen horror. Through no fault of its own, but rather a succession of bland rip-offs, not to mention a very successful spoof (Scary Movie), Scream's original impact has been severely dulled. Were Scream released today it would no doubt be moderately successful but would be instantly forgettable. But back in 1996 the teen horror market was wide open. The teenagers of the 90s were bored of traditional horror movies featuring haunted houses, vampires or deformed monsters. They had seen them all. So Wes Craven, having reinvigorated the horror genre once before with 'Nightmare on Elm Street', set out to do it again. This time, along with Kevin Williamson, who would go on to be creator of Dawson's Creek, created a new kind of horror  one that you could laugh at as well as scream at.What made Scream so successful is that it was never patronising, and displayed a strong sense of ironic self-awareness. It took every horror cliché in the book and turned them upside down. For the kids that had seen too many movies, there was now a movie for them. The characters did not follow the clichés, but in fact talked about them, and talked about what would happen if they were in a movie. This sense of irony may seem tired now, but when Scream came out it was new and exciting. There was rarely a need to scream 'don't go upstairs' or suchlike in Scream, because the characters themselves were saying that! The idea of the killer being amongst the students adds a fresh dimension to the film, as fear gives way to paranoia at not being able to trust anyone. The subversions of the accepted horror clichés, in particular in the opening ten minutes (I'm not going to give anything away for those who have not seen it) also contribute to making Scream a truly shocking movie. It was this sense of innovation that made Scream such a breath of fresh air for the horror genre, and it is only a shame that Craven's genius has been ripped off so many times that his work has dated far too quickly. Craven and Williamson have also created a new horror star  but it was not a particular character but just a costume with an iconic mask. The Scream mask has become just as symbolic, perhaps even more so, than that of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees.For any serious horror movie fans, Scream is essential viewing, if only to witness the film that started it all. The 'movie within a movie' idea was terrific, and would be taken even further in the sequel. The frequent references to classic horror movies, and reversals of accepted horror clichés, especially in the opening ten minutes) are also fun to watch out for. There is even a wonderful moment where one boy climbs in the bedroom window of his girlfriend  a scene that would be taken and used as one of the foundation for Williamson's successful teen series Dawson's Creek.The iconic mask, the one-liners, and the unique self-awareness when it comes to horror clichés make Scream a true original  accept no imitations.",Scream

A lot of the acting was awful and the script was pretty bad. But I still found it very entertaining and fun.The filming was good and the ending had a very good twist of finding out the killer.The mask was a cool icon and the voice on the phone was awesome. This is a good fun horror to watch with a bunch of your mates, to take the Micki and laugh at it. But taken seriously its rubbish.To be honest I think it's cool and bad at the same time.

287,henrymadman,Horror had fallen until ' Scream ' came along.,10,8 July 2007,"Scream is a 1996 horror film, directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. The film revitalised the slasher film genre in the mid 1990s, similar to what Halloween (1978) did for the 1970s, by using a standard concept with a tongue-in-cheek approach that successfully combined straightforward scares with dialogue that satirised slasher film conventions, (for example, the final girl). The film features many teen idols of the time, including; Neve Campbell, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and in addition, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Liev Schreiber.Scream became a major commercial success upon its release, and was one of the highest grossing films of 1996. It was also highly acclaimed by many critics worldwide, who appreciated the film's tongue-in-cheek approach. It got an 86% rating at rottentomatoes.com. As a result it spawned two sequels, Scream 2 and Scream 3.The film also provided the direct inspiration for the horror movie parody tetralogy, beginning with Scary Movie (2000)which also became a box office success, spawning its own three sequels, as of 2007.",Scream
288,CaressofSteel75,Great Horror Send Up!,8,22 March 2017,"A masked killer called Ghostface stalks Neve Campbell and her teen friends- this is all you need as a lead in to Scream. It's a great send up to an otherwise tired and overworked genre full of good humor and self awareness. Without giving away too much, one character figures out early that they're being disposed of by the well established slasher movie rules. Neve Campbell is perfect as the classic, sexually repressed victim/heroine. Skeet Ulrich probably has the best part in this, channeling James Dean as Campbell's boyfriend. Good writing and good plot twists raise this above the usual by-the-numbers body count flick where you walk out wondering how you spent two hours of your life on it. In your standard issue slasher movie, your supporting cast is usually made up of poorly defined, soon to be slaughtered characters. Scream couldn't do without its supporting cast. Courtney Cox and David Arquette are particularly good. You'll also see Matt Lillard, Drew Barrymore and Jamie Kennedy in good parts. Look for Linda Blair and Henry Winkler in walk-on parts as well.While there's a good level of slasher movie violence, most of this movie is pretty watchable. So, watch Scream if you haven't already.

291,Funky A,"A good slasher, but still a bad movie...",5,17 February 2000,"I think slashers are boring. They are neither funny, nor frightening, but this one is almost an exception to this rule. Why ""almost""? Because its not frightening. It's funny, mainly because of Randy. Randy and Dewey are the only characters that I didn't hate in this movie. Randy is funny and Dewey is pretty friendly. The others are all jerks that you hope will get killed in the most horrible way and never be heard of anymore, and that INCLUDES Neve Campbell. I have to admit it's hard to like a movie when you hate the hero. But the most annoying character is the one played by Rose McGowan. She is incredibly stupid. A real walking stereotype. The kind of character I absolutely hate. So, it's even harder to love a movie when you hate both the hero and her best friend... Annoying characters are bad in slasher, since you are supposed to like the characters being hunted down and fear for them, not hope they get killed, chopped down in pieces and die in the most horrible way you can imagine. Well, that is the way I felt during the whole movie, except when Dewey and Randy were in trouble. Some jokes about the ""rules"" when you are in a slasher are funny(and pretty realistic). But, I never screamed... It's not frightening! THIS IS NOT AN HORROR MOVIE!!! THIS IS A SLASHER!!! Horror movies leave a strange feeling, gives you the creep, have a lasting effect. Slashers go for cheap surprises(killer coming out of the closet, jumping from the roof, etc...). Maybe Scream is, in a way, an horror comedy, since it makes fun of slashers. But if it is, then it could never compete with the kings of horror comedies: Dead Alive(a.k.a. Braindead) and Evil Dead 2. So let's just say it is the king of cheap teen slashers. It is the best of the collection of bad movies that can be found in this category, but that doesn't make it a good movie. It's also better than the horrible sequels that followed, or any of the movies that where ""inspired"" by its success. If you love slashers, you will probably love this movie. One last thing: I guessed who the killer was in no time.5 out of 10. A good slasher, but that doesn't make it a good movie...",Scream
292,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,A new Horror classic!,9,12 July 2016,"What's your favorite scary movie?"" Well, Scream is certainly one of my favorite horror movies. Scream is directed by Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, The People Under The Stairs). Scream was the smash hit that transformed the horror genre. Scream is a rarity of horror, spoof, laughs, thrills, chills, and overall Wes Craven crafted another amazing horror classic.I'm going to try and keep this review short. Mainly because a majority of people already know this is a good movie. I honestly believe, it takes someone with the talent of Wes Craven, to somewhat poke fun at the horror genre, and in the same film deliver a good horror movie. The movie is original, and even though it has '90s written all over it, it still feels organic and fun.Everyone does an amazing job acting in the film. Neve Campbell is tough as nails, David Arquette and Courteney Cox work well on screen, Matthew Lillard is funny and scary, along with the rest of the cast. My only complaint, is from the poster of the film, you would expect Drew Barrymore (Charlie's Angels, 50 First Dates) to be the star. I believe they did this as an extra way to make money, and cash in on her popularity.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Scream. If you haven't seen this movie, what the Hell are you waiting for? Seriously, it's more than a movie for horror nerds and geeks. It's a movie that should be seen by any movie lover. Oh, and the Fonz is in it! I believe Scream earns a...9/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading/viewing, and I know you'll all have an amazing day as always. :)",Scream
293,benjaminwest-242,An amazing horror entry,8,26 October 2021,"Scream encapsulates everything the audience wants from a horror. With various twists and turns, and moments of relaxation that never truly settle in, the film is a thrilling journey from beginning to end. The acting is great, with solid performances from all, aided by meaningful dialogue that helps the ever so ominous tone. The plot is also extremely well written, with a wonderfully executed emotional depth that furthers the story. Few moments are wasted. Overall, a truly fear-inducing movie.",Scream
294,khouston86,"It is pretentious to criticize this movie, one of the best horror films ever",10,6 March 2003,"Having suffered through numerous boring, stupid, overrated horror movies in my life, I found this one to be refreshingly excellent.  Really, critics, with all the junk out there, isn't this movie a gift?  It is scary, smart, well-acted and well-done cinematically.  Scream III did suck.  I hope people are unmerciful in their criticism of that pile of junk.  But I think it is disingenuous to criticize Scream.  By the way, the Drew Barrymore scene at the beginning is one of the most frightening and memorable in the history of horror movies.",Scream
295,HorrorFanatic4Life,No other slasher horror can top this classic!,10,2 March 2019,"Although I was only a few years old when this movie came out, it is still to this day my all time personal favorite horror film. Even after three others that continued on with the franchise (which were equally just as great), I still always came back to this one. The reference to all things horror movies within the film is a great comedic relief throughout, especially with characters like Matthew Lillard's and Jamie Kennedy's. And the almost constant action keeps you reeled in the entire time.The first time watching kept me guessing the whole way through who the killer actually is. The reveal and whole ending scene is spectacular in that it is both shocking and witty and left room for plenty of storyline to follow in the other three movies. All of the characters work well together and add their own little quirks and personalities to each little bit of the movie.It is definitely a classic and has yet to be topped by any other slasher film to this day in my opinion. It is rewatched religiously even 20+ years later.",Scream
296,rutt13-1,A curse in disguise...,8,4 July 2001,"Don't get me wrong, I love this movie.  It wasn't particularly scary, except for a few good ""jump"" scenes, but it was a fun, humorous, bloody rollercoaster ride.  I thought the cast was entirely likable with great characters, and I think Mr. Craven did a great job of directing (I like lots of his stuff).  It was great to see Fonzie's cameo, too.  This is an enjoyable film, but a true horror fan like myself was first delighted by this movie's success, then appalled by what actually became of horror's ""Ressurrection.""  The floodgates are still open, and the crap keeps flowing through.  A bunch of young, hip, teen-soap stars and a guy in a mask with a knife do not a good movie make....unless the script contains even an ounce of the wit, style, or energy that this one has....Horror fans get together, don't allow anymore ""Urban Legends"" (scarily enough part 3 is in the works) and there sorry ilk to make money....The first is always best and this one is it....",Scream
297,xsophietaylorx,top notch,9,14 October 2014,"Scream is a film I must have watched over a 100 times and it still doesn't get old. All thought he first time I saw it I found myself jumping every three minutes and was really sitting on the edge of my seat in fear that effect has worn off over time probably due to the amount of times I have watched it, however I still really enjoy watching Scream. It may not be as scary as it once was like many horror films because you know what is going to happen etc. but to this day I still adore this film it's funny and I love all the cast! Especially Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Courtney Cox & Neve Campbell. The ending is surprising and really was a slap to the face the first time I watched it. Was Craven the director of this film made a whole new genre to the horror film kind if was something that almost makes a mockery of the others it uses the stereotypes to it's advantage. I would recommend it to all.",Scream
298,Xophianic,One of the coolest and more original horror movies I've ever seen,9,6 February 2000,"I thoroughly enjoyed SCREAM. I haven't seen too many horror movies that struck me as great, especially since most of them are the same. I like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and SCREAM for the same reason, they are more original than the default horror flick.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is still mourning the death of her mother, who died nearly one year ago. She seems very distant, even from her best friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). She, and most everyone else, thought that the killer was already behind bars. But when people close to Sidney start to get killed, Sidney realizes the the killer is still at large. Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is there to protect Sidney and reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is there to get the scoop.I think the plot of this movie is very interesting and fun. The best part of it is that the killer does his murders in the style of horror movies. The rules of horror movies are often referred to and horror movies are even spoofed fairly often as well.The actors do a very good job. Neve Campbell is excellent as the primary target/victim and main character of this movie. David Arquette does a fair job as the inexperienced cop (but not as good as in the sequel) and Courtney Cox does a great job as the bitch reporter. Drew Barrymore did very good in her very brief part as Casey Becker. Jamie Kennedy does an OK job as Randy Meeks, the movie expert (but again, not as good as in the sequel). Roger Jackson is the best possible choice for the phone voice and Henry Winkler had a great cameo.The character development in this movie is good. You'll probably often yell ""Look behind you, moron"" or ""Get out of the room, idiot"" at your TV, which this movie is probably going for. Sidney is the most interesting character, with Dewey and and Gale at a close second.I was surprised that I found Scream 2 to be even better than Scream was. But both are really good. Go out and buy them.",Scream
299,flickjunkie-3,Masterful.,9,16 December 2000,"I hadn't heard much about Scream, surprisingly, so I didn't even know what I was going to see. When I realised it was about murderers, I was deeply surprised and very intrigued...Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has alot on her plate. It's hard enough to be a teenager, coming of age in today's world, let alone have a boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) with raging hormones, a father whose life is one business trip after another, and still feel healthy when your mother was brutally murdered one year ago. Just when things seem to be getting back to normal for Sidney and her friends, the small town is once again plagued by a killer. Someone who is taking their love of scary movies one step too far. To survive they must follow the golden movie rules - don't answer the door, don't leave the house, don't answer the phone, but most of all, don't SCREAM.Scream is one of those movies you can watch day in, day out and never stop loving. The performances are fine, Neve Campbell is the perfect heroin, while Drew Barrymore plays Casey Becker in her gory opening scene to perfection and Skeet Ulrich is perfect for the part of creepy Billy Loomis. Kevin Williamson is a marvellous writer, his ""do you like scary movies?"" terrorising plot is amazingly convincing. And, of course, Wes Craven has done it again...A total classic, Scream fulfills in all areas.I rate Scream 10 out of 10.",Scream
300,MadReviewer,"Hate To Admit It, But It's Great",8,9 May 2001,"There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death.  Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror crap like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day.  `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage.  But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.The plot of `Scream' is very simple: a masked knife-wielding maniac is busy stalking the students of High, killing them off one by one.  The killer's inordinately obsessed with one girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who of course gets involved in the quest to unmask the killer.  The catch (in case you don't already know it), though, is brilliant.  Everyone in the film is familiar with all the slasher film conventions.  They know that you shouldn't walk in the woods alone at night.  They know that having wild sex is an unwritten invitation to be hacked to pieces.  They know not to say things to each other like `I'm going outside for a cigarette; I'll be right back.' -- such statements are virtual death warrants.   One of the best examples (and best characters) of this is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the film-obsessed nut of the film, who actually goes so far as to muse what `real' actors and actresses should play the other characters in the film, going so far as to joke about who gets to be Tori Spelling.  All the dumb conventions of slasher films are pulled out of the shadows, exposed for what they really are . . . and then, some of them get used anyway, because the characters willingly choose to ignore those conventions.  Some cliches are thrown away, while others are embraced.  `Scream' really turned the horror/slasher film genre on its ear, becoming the first truly suspenseful and exciting slasher film in many, many years simply because it suddenly had a million new avenues to explore.  The film's self-awareness allowed to move in brand-new directions . . . and suddenly, scenes that used to be predictable in other slasher films suddenly become incredibly intense in `Scream'.Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film -- as director of slasher classics like `Nightmare On Elm Street', he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then, much like `Scream's' script, chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true, or to go off in competely unexpected directions.  Either way, Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nail-biting, thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore, which is always a plus in great slasher films.  The acting ranges from barely mediocre to good -- Neve Campbell's okay as Sidney; Courtney Cox is pretty good as tart-tongued reporter Gail Weathers; Jamie Kennedy rules as Randy the film geek; and David Arquette is utterly bland and forgettable as Deputy Dewey Riley, the sad-sack policeman.  But casts in slasher films don't particularly matter anyway; the good ones are all about suspense, terror, and gore.  And in `Scream', Wes Craven provides massive amounts of all three of those criteria.The irony is, `Scream' spawned dozens of imitators, and by spawning imitators, all the new avenues opened up by `Scream' quickly got old and boring once more.  Still, purely on its own merit, it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second.  It's well worth watching.  Grade:  A-",Scream
301,briandwillis-83825,Still Excellent,9,22 October 2020,"It's sometimes easy to forget how great Scream is. The opening sequence with Drew Barrymore might promise a slightly more terrifying film than we actually get, but it does start things off with a bang and it rarely ever lets up except to deliver yet another funny one liner or astute observation about horror films and pop culture. It never forgets to be fun and it never forgets to be scary and make the audience care about its characters. Who couldn't fall in love with Courtney Cox's devilishly self-absorbed reporter, David Arquette's charmingly inept deputy, or Neve Campbell's tragic and ""sexually anorexic"" final girl?",Scream
302,Colbridge,Scream is a post modern take on the horror movie,7,18 October 2021,"Wes Craven's most mainstream horror film served to revitalise the slasher movie in the mid-90's after all the Friday the 13th, Halloween and Craven's very own Nightmare on Elm Street franchises fizzled out to ever diminishing returns. It was time for a new horror icon to get fans excited and that appeared in the form of Ghostface, giving Wes Craven the biggest hit of his career and spawning 4 sequels to date.Scream opens with a similar Hitchcockian trick of killing off the A list star in the first reel, like Hitchcock did to Janet Leigh in Psycho, but when we get into the real story of the murder of Neve Campbell's mother what we find is a smart, knowing, self deprecating horror movie that revels in referencing other movies, so it's not your predictable slice n' dice horror movie after all, despite Drew Barrymore's helpless victim succumbing to all the cliches at the start, which was put there just to lull the audience into a false sense of security.Screenwriter Kevin Williamson satirises the genre with in-jokes and characters who know the rules of how horror films work while Craven knows how to scare and surprise the audience. In fact he pulled off a similar self referential trick with Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) by turning the concept on it's head and having the characters be in the real world referencing the previous movies, Scream is a continuation of that post modern take on the horror movie.It treads a fine line between parody and being a horror film in it's own right, so it never becomes a spoof like Scary Movie (2000) which is built around lampooning Scream. Friend's star Courtney Cox and David Arquette met on the set and later married, Henry Winkler (The Fonz) makes an uncredited appearance as the school principle and the eagle eyed viewer will spot Linda Blair (The Exorcist) as a reporter trying to interview Neve Campbell's character Sidney.",Scream
303,The Yeti,Waste of time,1,16 October 2001,Most have you have already seen this movie but for those who haven't then this film is s**t. The acting is too funny to be scared at. It has the usual girls running around screaming and tripping over things. It has the crappest killings ever. Wow!!! Stabbings!!!Scary!! The garage door killing was awful!

It's schtick of making fun of tropes and breaking the 4th wall (a little) were very funny, but got a little tiresome by the end.

305,theterminator-92378,A self aware horror flick out of the mind of Wes Craven,8,29 September 2017,With horror dying in the 90's Craven thought of an amazing idea Scream a self aware movie with some comedy and some mystery solving put in as well. Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott the main girl who's confident and strong and she is just a perfect hero. Gale weathers is played by Courtney Cox and she does great at a women who just wants to make her place in the world. David Arquette is deputy Dewey who wants to protect Sidney but also have to follow police rules also in the men part of the cast is Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard were Billy and Stu who are 2 best friends who love movies and they are perfect at their knowledge of movies. Scream was a movie that i enjoyed it wasn't just a horror movie it was also a comedy and a mystery which kept us on edge for who the killer was and it was cleaver in referencing other horror movies but it also wasn't afraid to be different and that's why it worked and it would span into 3 more movies and a spin-off series which would would make fun of other horror movies so its always going to be a movie i could re watch.,Scream

I was waiting for some stupid horror movie like those ones seen everywhere and I was wrong.The whole movie concentrates on parody and irony, its more than just a horror movie its comedy. If you have seen those older ""same plot same stuff"" movies maybe you can adapt to the Scream itself.Great plot, seems sometimes like trying to be a scary movie but no, there are lots of funny things for a horror fan if you are recalling them but also there's parts that are little nasty for younger viewers.I recommend this first one to all horror movie freaks if you wanna get some beer and get some kicks with the parts that you realize ""lol it was from movie blah-blah"" :)Plot really is great but it have been built on older ones and can't be taken too seriously, It made me laugh.

307,LagerLagerLagerShouting,A Sophisticated Horror Comedy.,10,17 September 2002,"For the average cinema-goer this is just your basic run-of-the-mill teens stalked by nutter in a mask fare. But for a seasoned horror veteran who understands about the basic social significance of the slasher film, having seen every title under the sun this a masterpiece. It is a defining moment of contemporary horror, marking the resurgence of the slasher flick with a self-referential postmodern spin on proceedings. Wes Craven previously explored this with his return to the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise he created with Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994 but essentially it is Kevin Williamson's script that delivers the good. Craven's direction is slick as he keeps the action moving fast but with dragged out, tension-filled, brilliant composed scenes. But as a big horror fan I see this film essentially as a comedy, poking fun at the hallmarks of the slasher phenomenon whilst at the same time paying homage to it. It is like a reference book of contemporary horror and it is great and probably knows it is!10/10",Scream

But over the past 3 years I've become a more respectable horror fan, and I look at this movie as an extremely overrated horror flick, that has spawned silly rip-offs, including a Scream take on the Halloween franchise. Which I liked it first, with the return of Michael Myers, but it was one of the silly rip-offs of Scream, that should've gone it's own way. The Halloween series had a great image. But now it's looked at as Scream-like entity by many who love it. I respect Scream for it's reigniting the series. It's just unfortunate, filmmakers like Moustapha Akkad aren't taking advantage of the reignition, in their own highly respectable styles. Instead, their drowning the horror genre with the Scream-likeness. God give gifts to Chucky creator, Don Mancini for taking "" Bride Of Chucky "" in it's respectable style. Hopefully, the Scream followers will end soon, so we can have our Freddy, Jason and others back! Perhaps, Halloween : H2K will deliver a more respectable return for Michael Myers.

The death scenes weren't that elaborate, I mean yes the garage door was a little odd but mainly stabbings with knives. I already knew who the killers were and that kinda spoilt it for me but I think it was fairly obvious who it was.

320,NpMoviez,Wes Craven's best work.,10,18 April 2021,"Pure brilliance! That's what this movie is. Not only it's a modern day classic, it's almost a perfect film. It serves as a slasher flick, a perfect blend of slasher and whodunit, an excellent thriller and an extremely exciting rollercoaster ride. In my opinion, Scream and Scream 2 are better than his most popular movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street. No, I don't hate original Freddy movie, I consider it to be one of the bests of the genre but that doesn't change the fact that I find Scream to be Wes Craven's greatest work.There are a lot of goods I have say about this movie, and I won't be spoiling anything. All these stuffs aren't probably things that have not been already said prior to my review. But these are the reasons why I love it so much. First, it's extremely well-paced. It has a definitive tone it goes for, any doesn't miss a bit at all. It is almost two hours long, it begins to end at around 1:30:00 mark. The last 30 minutes doesn't even feel like 30 minutes. It's almost like 5 or 6 minutes, and I am not even exaggerating. There's not a single moment in the movie which doesn't give an uneasy feeling. That uneasy feeling lasts throughout the movie, until things start getting revealed. And after that, what follows is an intense, action packed finale that the movie absolutely deserves. And I almost forgot. The opening of this movie is perhaps the best opening of all the slasher films since the late 70s.Even if it wasn't a meta film, except for a few interesting pop culture references, it would've worked equally well. That's because it has a story of it's own. You are constantly gripped by the whodunit aspect of the movie. It completely understands that it's actually the intensity, the tension and the characterizations you give in the film that makes it work, not some pointless gory scenes. The gore and kills are mere aftermath and payoff of what we had just witnessed in the story. Gore doesn't equal a great horror, and in particular, a great slasher. Seems like this film understood it really well. And there's something that this movie does, which none of the slashers before it and (except for a little extent in Scream 2) none of its sequels do. That is getting the uncertainty factor absolutely right. Definitely, I would say none of the endings of the Scream movies (1 to 4, at the time of this review) were quite predictable to me. But, even in the beloved classics, except for a possible few dodges, we get to know who the main lead is and who's going to be the victim. It's not that with Scream. At many moments, even though we recognize the main lead (who's awesome, btw) we feel like she might not make it. And, definitely a lot of people are sliced. But, we do not, or should I say, cannot expect a character to die or not to die because it plays the trope of ""everyone is a suspect"" extremely well.This movie has the best batch of characters in any slasher movie. All the characters are so memorable and the characterizations are brilliant. You cannot exchange one character with the other. There are no stock characters for extra kills or something like that. Every kill happens for a purpose, may it have a motive or may it be an act of a pure psychopath. And in that line, I would also like to mention that Neve Campbell is my most favorite actress (and Sidney Prescott is my favorite slasher lead character) when it comes to the ones who've been the lead of a slasher movie. Unlike a lot of such leads, she doesn't feel like a ""typically written to survive"" lead. She has more depth to her character than many of the leads from many different franchises combined! She does a lot of stuff that kinda reminds me of John McClane. She definitely does whole lot less of over the top things that McClane does, but she does have some great one liners, fantastic fight/action scenes and the vulnerability that makes us feel that she's one of us, and not a movie character. That being said, the performances are extremely great. Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Dewey, Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) as Stu, and Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis and all the others have given a fantastic performance.It's a movie which doesn't use its meta nature as an excuse for being lame, in fact, it's everything but lame. Being a meta movie, it serves as a celebration of almost two decades of slasher films by taking jabs on cliches while using that cliche in a much more grounded way. It gives a well written story and a whole bunch of well written characters and an intensely exciting storytelling. That's what makes it so great. If you haven't checked it out, don't waste any time. Please, see this movie. It's a highly underappreciated (though insanely popular) and a criminally underrated gem of a movie. .

321,Finntroll,Pretty good.,7,15 July 2004,"Many people hate this movie. And maybe they should, after all hideous films that have tried to copy this one (Valentine, anyone?) it's no hard thing to do. Scream still stands as the best of the genre it invented i.e. the ""slasher-wannabe"" genre. This means it tries to be something it actually isn't. Scream is not a slasher movie, plain and simple this is just a thriller dressed up for Halloween.The story is simple; a man murders teens just like in numerous real slasher films. This is what makes the movie pretty funny to watch, there are dozens of jokes that relate to films of the slasher genre. A pretty solid cast makes this work fine. Neve Campbell (what's she doing nowadays?) is probably the best of the lot and she looks wonderful too. A crappy ending makes the movie a bit less entertaining but it's still fun to watch and well recommended both for those who know the horror genre well and beginners.7/10",Scream

323,Speechless,"Good, in and of itself",9,15 March 2001,"A lot of people hate this movie, mostly because it inspired the glut of awful postmodern horror flicks we've endured over the last few years.  The complaint is valid (don't get me started about Urban Legends: Final Cut), but don't let that stop you from watching and appreciating this movie for what it is.  Scream really is a good film.  Sure, some of the characters are a bit annoying and some scenes just kind of slow things down, but as a whole the movie is exciting, well-written, and occasionally truly frightening.  The Drew Barrymore sequence, as overly familiar as it has become, is horror filmmaking of a high order--Craven proves that even the same old cliches can be frightening if they are used with the right timing and balance.  It's nearly impossible to make a good slasher film, since the genre has been so overdone; Scream pulls it off, and does it with a smile on its face.Sure the sequels and imitators and spoofs are awful.  Sure Craven and his colleagues fell back into the same old rut that this movie protested.  But Scream exists on a higher level than the rest of the pack.",Scream

325,c_p_c,Pure fun!!!,7,26 October 2002,"I love scary movies!  They are absolutely the most fun to watch!  However, the genre seems to be cursed in that it is very hard to put out a decent horror film.  Scream has done it!!!Creatively done, a mix of humor and scare, Scream is fun from start to finish.  What makes it even better is that this film does not derive its scares from blood and gore (although there is a fair amount of it, especially in the opening scene), but it truly does have you in suspense in many of the scenes.  What also adds to this benefit is that the film actually has a plot aside from the slashing that tends to dominate these films.  Because of that this film is a whole lot more interesting and captivating.  The slashing almost becomes a side part, but still offers a lot of fun to the movie.So for great scares and a whole lot of fun, Scream rates a 7/10",Scream
326,DesertDogMedia,Scream,7,2 July 2014,"Title: Scream Directed by: Wes CravenStoryline: The beginning starts off with a random man calling up a random girl and asking if she likes scary movies. This type of scene can go wrong very quickly or even just fall flat if not done correctly, but this movie makes it turn from a comical little chat into something more with the words ""I want to know who I'm looking at"" along with the sudden drop in the music. The man on the phone gets more violent with the fact of him knowing what she looks like, with all things adding up to make her more frightened while still adding suspense to the opening scene. You will also see that Scream made the ""I want to play a game"" line a lot more sinister for its time before it was used by the Saw franchise. The level of psychological torture that the man puts her through in the first scene is made all the more haunting by his monotone voice. Along with the woman actually sounding scared for her life and the life of her boyfriend and not like she is trying to sound scared for the camera. Which is more than what can be said for the parents. After the first scene we are introduced to two more teens, the main characters of this movie, who seem to have a relationship of sorts. We are then shown the high school that the girl from the first scene goes to as well the main girl. Afterward, we are introduced to the bunch of friends who we will be watching for this movie, one of which is called Stuart who is played by Matthew Lillard. This is a character I cannot take seriously, mainly because he also played and does the voice of Shaggy Rogers from the Scooby Doo movies. Our main character Sidney is left home alone because her father has gone away on a trip, so Sidney goes over to stay at a friends house. In a real world situation, this is actually a very smart thing to do under the logic of safety in numbers. Ghostface finds were she is and starts attacking her when she goes back inside, but runs off when her boyfriend comes, naturally she adds two and two together and suspects he's the killer, he gets arrested and she goes with her friend. But even at her friends house she still gets the man calling her with her boyfriend held in custody. Soon after getting attacked in school, Sidney goes to her friends to watch a movie feeling it would be safe there. There also is a subtle reference in the school with Frank the cleaner being dressed like Freddy Kruger. This is in the same scene where the camera is focusing on the headmaster walking around the school after hours. You can tell he is going to be attack and/or killed because he is not even a secondary character and is getting screen time. Because of all the murders people are jumping at all sorts of conclusions of who is the killer, this also instigates a town wide curfew. Ghostface appears at the party and his first kill is a creative one, he uses a garage to break someones neck. While Sidney is being romantic with her boyfriend upstairs, the rest of them are watching the horror movies downstairs, this is when we are introduced to the rules of how to survive a horror movie. They also get a call about the headmaster being found dead, this is a smart little plot device to get rid of the excess people in the house, shows how morbid those people are but it is believable. From there on it is just different ways to kill all of the different people. But it then turns out that Billy is the killer, who faked his death, but he's not the only killer, the twist is that there are two killers Billy and Stuart. But as expected they die in the end and Sidney lives on to do sequels. Acting: The acting of the main characters is solid, Neve Campbell plays the surviving Sidney, she adds a sense of reality to the main character who seems shy mostly. Skeet Ulrich plays Billy the brains of the murders, apart from mistaking him for Leonardo Dicaprio several times due to the way he looks he was a great actor and adds an unnerving sense of psycho into it. The secondary characters are good and actually feel like typical teenagers for the most part, apart from that there isn't really all too much to say about it, I admire that the movie didn't take itself all that seriously and that they were able to avoid being really cheesy at scenes that could have been cheesy. Noticeable Camera work: The panning and tilting shots were used effectively, wasn't to keen on the times where the camera jump zoomed, these were rare but still noticeable. We were treated to voyeuristic shots as well which worked well for the overall feel along with being a plot device. Costume: Not much to say about the costume, sort of inventive. Not much else. Length: 110 minutes Overall Feel: I enjoyed this movie overall, I was bored by the romantic scenes between Sidney and Billy after the first time we were introduced. The rest of the film created a dramatic and tense atmosphere, but when it cut to the romance I felt the suspense drop and was actually wishing them for to hurry up and get stabbed so we could go back to the main group watching movies downstairs. Apart from the pacing of the movie, everything else was OK. The story was pretty solid, no real plot holes that stood out. It was a good classic horror movie, simple as.",Scream
327,mbworm,A change for the horror genre,10,27 August 2005,"""Scream"" is completely entertaining and totally terrifying. In a time when horror was losing its touch, Kevin Williamson wrote this clever script and Wes Craven brought it to life beautifully, reinventing the modern slasher and still remaining better than most of the films that followed it.Neve Campbell is Sydney Prescott, a shy girl who's life is turned upside down when somebody begins murdering her friends. In comes Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and a hilarious reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, the best character in the film) to investigate the murders and stay alive.The movie is funny and scary, with homages to famous older horror classics the entire way through, and the climax is excellently tense. A horror movie that started a legacy.",Scream
328,writtenbymkm-583-902097,Only for blood and guts fans,1,15 June 2020,"I hated this movie and it's my own fault. I never bothered to read the reviews or find out anything about it first. I honestly thought it was a sort of ""comedy horror"" spoof. If I had known it was one long drawn-out series of slashing teens to pieces episodes, I would have avoided it like the plague. If you enjoy that kind of garbage, fine. But to me it was not the slightest bit funny, and not the slightest bit scary, just incredibly stupid, poorly written, poorly acted, and so sickeningly sadistic that I would up on fast-forward to the end. I really like great suspense and atmosphere and something really scary, such as The Haunting, or The Shining, but Scream is simply gore for the sake of gore. By the way, I'm checking ""spoilers"" because I said it's about slashing teens to pieces.",Scream

The idea of using horror movies as a way to kill is an original and very creative plot. The performances are what drags this movie down. They don't feel as authentic and organic as the story calls them to be.
Still a great horror movie worth your time.",Scream
331,ARTaylor,Modern Horror Classic,9,13 October 2012,"Scream was made at a time when slashers were on their way out. Michael, Jason, and Freddy had lost their touch. They were battling psychics, going to New York, and all sorts of weird stories that went completely against what the franchises built themselves on. Wes Craven had some luck with with New Nightmare, a meta return to the franchise he built. But it was this movie that really rebuilt the genre and brought it back to glory.The movie is about a group of horror movie buffs who find themselves in a horror movie. Much like the original Friday the 13th, there is a mystery as to who the killer(s) is. It focuses on Sidney, the incredibly sexy Neve Campbell, whose mother was killed a year before and learns how she is tied to the killings. They are all aware of the movies this film references.New Nightmare may have been the first, but Scream was the first to popularize the idea of self-aware characters. Any movie buff will recognize the references (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Prom Night, etc) beyond those the movie directly references. The movie is a love letter to the genre and will make film buffs out of anyone. I know this movie is probably the reason I'm such a film buff, particularly of horror movies, myself.I love that the movie is a mystery. There's so few horror movies that include mystery aspects. The original Friday the 13th tried it, but Ms. Voorhees came out of nowhere. Prom Night did it, but the killer was pretty obvious. This is very much like an Agatha Christie story. The suspects are all there, and they're all guilty until they're gutted or the mask is taken off. The reveal is quite satisfying. Their motivation is fitting. Screams 3 and 4 would be disappointing, but this one was really good. And the movie just gets better with multiple viewings so you can see new layers to the real killer throughout the movie.The cast is good. Campbell looks great and is a great heroine along the lines of Alien's Ripley. McGowan isn't just a dumb, horny blonde. Cox proves she isn't just her Friends character. Arquette is hilarious. Though it's Lillard and Kennedy who steal the movie. The two are terrific and hilarious in every scene they're in, especially the ""Rules of Horror"" scene. My only complaint is that Ulrich looks a little too ""evil,"" though he otherwise does a great job. They all are convincing as high school students.Of course, what really makes this movie great is the frights. This is an incredibly effective scary movie. Like all the best slasher films, this one relies on suspense over gore. There's plenty of blood, but it's the build up to the kills that really scare people. The opening scene is probably one of the best in the genre. Anyone can make a person jump and enough gore will gross even those with the best stomachs, but suspense is the best way to really scare someone. The movie really spends the time to make you care about the characters, so when their time comes you're actually rooting for them rather than the killer, the main problem with later Friday the 13th films. This is one that will have you hiding behind blankets and pillows on your first watch.The movie's use of cell phones may date the film somewhat, but Scream is a terrific film otherwise. The movie knows the genre and is one of the best of it. This is a can't miss for any horror fan, and will likely make some new fans.",Scream
332,Chris-332,Made Me Become a Slasher Fan!,10,5 February 2000,"Scream has to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made. People that have not seen the film or its sequels would probably think of it as a plotless horror movie with bad acting, just like its inspirations (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend). That steriotypical remark is so far from the truth it's amazing. Scream is a funfilled, extremely clever, and exceptionally funny movie that it is right up there with Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Psycho as my favorite horror movie. This movie has everything a scary movie can offer. The beginning is the greatest beginning to any movie I have ever seen. The Ghostface costume and the terrifying voice is bone-chilling. It is pretty scary (And I'm a guy that doesn't get scared by movies too often) and it has many edge-of-your-seat thrills. The script is so original and fresh. It has such thoughtful and great characters. And who the killer(s) turn out to be is totally awesome. I really loved this movie. It made me become a teen slasher fan. This movie has inspired me to see the Halloween movies, the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and even the ghastly and horrible Friday the 13th movies.

The perfect mix of horror and comedy, it sparked a new form of horror in meta commentary. Ghostface probably has to be the worst killer in the slasher genre. He takes so much physical abuse, he's not really intimidating. It's kind of hilarious. Sidney Prescott is technically considered a final girl, but I'd absolutely go to her for protection in these times. Rewatching this movie, I saw myself in Randy Meeks. He's also the perfect comedic relief for this movie. I really like the moment when he's drunk watching Halloween, he's saying ""Jamie look out"". I think that's funny, especially because his name is really Jamie. In addition, the score (which I didn't notice the first couple times I watched it) was super awesome.

335,guskeller,A fun guilty pleasure,7,10 October 2021,"Scream has been lauded as groundbreaking for its self-aware references to the horror genre. There are several instances where the film directly acknowledges the tropes it engages in. While that is fun and unique, it is not enough to carry this movie by itself. Scream is certainly meta, but it doesn't take the next step with that awareness. The story still falls into predictable clichés that slasher flicks have become known for. So, even though this gimmick makes the movie above average, it fails to go too far beyond that.Plus, from a technical perspective, Scream is standard. Visually, there are tilted angles but that is the only technique used on that front (and it's a basic one). Meanwhile, the soundtrack, editing, and effects are all fair but forgettable. Overall, there isn't much filmmaking here that stands out. The mask has become iconic so that was a great costume choice, Drew Berrymore's opening scene is a strong hook, and Matthew Lillard provides a charismatic performance. However, those are all the positives of note in this film. Therefore, while Scream has a few tricks up its sleeve, there simply isn't enough here to make it more than a fun guilty pleasure.Writing: 6/10

338,timefreezer7,A true masterpiece (some minor spoilers),9,24 May 2001,"What else can I say that has not been said before ? Scream is almost perfect. I think the movie managed not to revive the horror genre as many said , but something even better : born a new kind of film , the mystery / horror . We have seen other movies with unidentified serial killers like Copycat . The brilliant idea of combining the mystery element with teenage stars representing the horror / slasher films is VERY functional . Many said that there are comedy elements and the movie is funny . I disagree because I think the writer wanted simply to make the film less scary at occasions so it would not be more entertaining. The heroes have seen many scary movies and know many cliches that are inherent in them . Personally think that the continuus quotes from other movies was a bit entertaining sometimes but very irritating other times and this is a big flaw . There are unforgettable lines like"" It is a lot scarier WITHOUT a motive !! "" or "" Movies do NOT create psychos , they simply make psychos more inventive "" .I won 't tell much about the plot because the less you know the more you will enjoy it . Basically gruesome murders happen in a small American town . The maniac killer is dressed like a ghost : black cape and cowl and a white - faced mask a direct copy from the famous painting "" the scream "" . He is a pure sadist : makes threatening phone calls to his victims always asking them if they like scary movies . After he intimidates them and scares the s**t out of them , he attacks and slaughters them with a knife in full-of-panic-heartpumping-suspensful -bloody chase scenes . The killer can be really anyone . As Randy ( Jamie Kennedy ) says wittingly "" EVERYBODY IS A SUSPECT !!! "" . So far nothing special you may say . Here is the evidence you are wrong
1) The chase scenes despite the cliches are the most suspenseful in any film of the decade . Wes Craven proved that even the oldest and rehashed recipe can work magnificently if the ingredients are used properly.2) Finally a horror movie where the killer is a common mortal !!! If you hit him he will hurt . If you stab him he will bleed . If you shoot him he will die . At last ! Not some stupid unkillable "" boogeyman "" like Michael Myers in Halloween ( don 't get me wrong I like Halloween but it IS stupid ) .3) A horror movie with detective crime mystery . You don 't know who the killer is . Is it Billy ( Skeet Ulrich ) ? No , too obvious ! Is it Sidney 's father gone mad ? Maybe . No it maybe Randy gone crazy of all the thrillers he 's watching . Too obvious . Again Billy has a very mysterious eye look . But again is he . Is he not ? And how about Stew ( Mathew Lilard ) ? He seems a real wacko . And so on and on . The film keeps you guessing until the end . I believe the solution of the mystery was probably inspired of some Agatha Christie novels like ""Ten little niggers"" and "" Crime Witness "" .3) The performances are very good especially Skeet Ulrich as Billy one of the most controversial characters ever seen . He is very enigmatic. By the way if his figure reminds you of something it is Johnny Depp. Excellent performances from Rose Mac Gowan ( Tatum ) and Neve Campbell ( Sidney ) . Adequate acting by Jamie Kennedy , Mathew Lilard , David Arquette as the Deputy Dewey and Corteney Cox as the pesky reporter Gail Weathers who sees the story as a skoop for her carreer . Despite the acting the characters are very strong ( except Dewey ) and very memorable .4) I have read many comments and critics about the film but noone has made a comment about the psychological terror . There is a widespread threat throughout the whole movie . First of all the Ghostface is very scary . He seems like a divine supernatural figure . When Casey ( Drew Barrymore ) unmasks him in the beginning we are almost sure that he is a person she knows . But the most horrifying part in this excellent story is that despite the numerous suspects and the hints that the script provides us to keep changing our suspicions , the killer can be literally anyone : just a psychopath who has spotted these friends and wants to have his sick fun . Maybe he is even a guy from out of town. The threat is exposing itself when the murderer is in front of Sidney sweeping the blood of his knife implying directly , "" You are next "". I have never seen such a frightfully intense scene in a film before : the danger is HERE ! The atmosphere really convinces you that this can happen to anyone .5) There are some excellent original scenes but I won 't give them away. All I can say is that the Drew Barrymore opening is regarded as a classic . Something I would like to comment is that finally the heroines do something I always wondered why not in other horror films : when the killer corners them , they simply kick him in the sensitive area.6) The revelation of the killer is simply SHOCKING . As for the climax I can assure you that it is the most nerve - shattering you have ever seen . You will probably need a sleeping pill to sleep afterwards because you will be frightened to death by the twisted mind a person can have ( the PSYCHOLOGICAL TERROR I mentioned above ) and moreover the final action scene is going to steal your breath and have your heart crazy . Trust me ! You will remember it as long as you live !A few weaknesses : Some scenes are very contrived like the murder of the Headmaster . Other scenes are quite boring like when Sidney is whining about her family background something which annoyingly holds the plot development back . But I guess we may forgive that . How can anyone NOT love this movie or even worse hate it ? I believe the only ones who hated it are people who simply don 't like action films or mysteries . But for you who like thrillers this is definately a must see.S C R E A M    F O R E V E R                                 9 / 10",Scream

She, and others, begin to realize that there is a serial killer obsessed with scary movies and that she or some of her friends may be the next victims.Also starring in this horror movie/spoof are David Arquette, who plays the deputy, Courtney Cox (the future Mrs. David Arquette) as the aggressive tabloid journalist covering the killings, Skeet Ulrich as Campbell's boyfriend, and Rose McGowan as Campbell's best friend. With this talented cast, terrific direction by horror movie whiz Wes Craven, and a great script by Kevin Williamson, it's hard to go wrong with ""Scream.""Henry Winkler (of TV's ""Happy Days"" fame) has a cameo as Principal Himbry, and Wes Craven appears briefly as Fred the high school's janitor (he's wearing the same sweater as Freddy Kruegger in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films.

Sure, they are funny, and I do find them all to be acceptably suspenseful, but they're all extremely flawed, as well - including this, the original.  While this movie probably contains less flaws than the other two, it's still full of continuity errors and unlikely occurrences.  The question is, how much of it is intentional?  Who can tell? (Example: *spoiler* somebody fakes his death with ketchup while making it appear to an onlooking character that he really is being stabbed by another character.  Come on.)In the end, though, it doesn't really matter because all three movies manage to entertain despite their flaws, partly due to decent acting on the part of some of the supporting players (Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and especially Jaime Kennedy) and the direction of Wes Craven.  I do NOT, however, credit Kevin Williamson that much.  While his concept is good, he really only creates a couple round characters and his script succeeds onscreen only because of the aforementioned individual efforts.  One need only look at anything Williamson has ever done outside of the Scream series to realize how bad a writer he really is.Incidentally, I predict that the Scream movies aren't going to age well - not at all.  Why?  Because all three are so wrapped up in nineties dialogue and pop culture references that in fifteen years no one under the age of 25 will understand them and those older than that will probably be embarrassed that they ever did.

Yawn, more like...",1,28 October 2000,"I have to say I was seriously underwhelmed by this movie, though possibly more than I would otherwise have been had there not been so much hype about how wonderful it was. The first sequence with Drew Barrymore was very well done, and would have made a good short film, but the whole ""aren't I cool having all the characters in my 'horror' movie talking about horror movies"" thing got very old very fast; it was a good idea, but overused to extremes.However, I was more put off by the ""we're making a movie for teenagers so we must make sure we explain everything VERY CLEARLY so everyone knows exactly what's going on"" approach to the script: for the first half hour or so it seemed like we'd get a couple of minutes of plot, then an Exposition Break as some character had to explain to some other character exactly why they disliked them, or what their personal problems were, or whatever. Dull, dull, dull.In the end I gave up and watched the last half on fast forward. Ah, so that's who did it. Well, ho hum.Shame, I really liked Wes Craven's first 'Nightmare on Elm St' movie and the last half of 'Last House On The Left' is pretty much unforgettable (then again, so is the appalling dialog in the first half!); I think I'll have to watch both of them again to remind myself that he could make good movies once.",Scream
345,nmp381,Revived the genre,7,15 July 2000,"Slasher movies had pretty much disappeared after the late 80s because they were all poorly written and acted and had become cliched. Scream came along and changed all that. A fresh look into slasher movies with a 90s trendy edge. While the movie was not really suspenseful it did deliver scare thrills and some exciting chases. The acting was also much MUCH better than alot of the 80s slashers and should become a classic, much like Halloween and Friday the 13th became, down the road.",Scream
346,Peter Elefant,This film is not funny!,5,1 July 2001,"I don't like this one at all. It's not scary. It's no good. It's not anything worth waisting time on.

347,TheReviewMaster,Taking My Love of Movie Reviews One Step Too Far,10,15 May 2015,"I first watched this as a teenager and was blown away by the first ten minutes, and after the impressive opening of this film, was kept hooked and entertained the whole way through. The first frame through to the last showcases, despite a few flaws, what an almost flawlessly perfect horror movie looks like. Scream is well known by now for revitalising a dead genre, and in doing so, created its own, and burrowed its way deep into my subconscious that I screamed out in agony when they not only screwed up Scream 4, but flat out denied us the promised Scream 5 and 6.Keeping this review Spoiler-free is hard considering it's the type of movie where twists and turns and red herrings is what keeps it entertaining. It's the type of film where you have this one conversation with yourself the whole way through: ""he's the killer. No. He's the killer. No. He's the killer. No. He's the killer."" I never guessed the killer.Kevin Williamson has always been one of my favourite writers and ideas man (when he's writing films and not crappy television shows), and Scream shows him at his best. Wes Craven has an uncanny knack of creating memorable icons. It must have been his destiny to scar people's brains with terror-ific, unforgettable images. As a child he probably sat in bed thinking: ""How do I make other people not be able to sleep at night?"" Neve Campbell is the perfect scream queen, marred only by the fact she won't do nudity.Marco Beltrami's Scream score is still one of his best musical works to this day. Nothing he has done since Scream and two of its sequels has ever come close in brilliance to the unique sound he created for this and those films.This movie truly is a Scream and I gave it, at a time when the internet wasn't really around that much, the greatest word of mouth ever. I still enjoy sitting down with people who haven't had the pleasure of watching it and seeing their reactions for the first time.It's most certainly a Screamer.",Scream
348,bradykitchen-33648,Easily my favourite horror movie,8,8 October 2021,"Positive:
Acting is very good which is something that's not always true about horror movie but everyone did greatHorror was well done had some good jump scares and gave you some great creepy feelings throughout the movieUsually when I watch a movie that tries to mix to polar opposite tones it never works but this nails it. It found a way to make horror and comedy mixThey constantly make remarks and recognize that they are living a horror movie and it's done so well. It is a celebration of the horror genre which is part of what makes it so iconicThe story does a good job of being unpredictable of who will die and who the killer actually is and keeps you intrigued. Pacing is so good doesn't feel like 2 hoursNegative:
It's not here to blow you away it doesn't give you big dramatic Oscar type quality but it doesn't need to.Ghost Face is a little on the dumb side seems to always miss his target and it kind of shows in the endingCritical score 8.5/10Enjoyment score 9.5/10.",Scream

350,Millennialprince,Scream,8,25 October 2019,"Scream is the movie that resurrected the slasher genre. It also serves as a brilliant deconstruction of the slasher genre.

I know the Scream legacy has been tarnished by the sequels but the first one still holds up today.",Scream
351,TruPretender,...as desperate a film as it was a franchise!,5,24 October 2005,"""Scream"", yes. The film released in 1996, and the abomination to the entire genre! Yes, a real attention getter and a real creep of a film! Full of suspense and stupidity! The absolute definition of wretched impact on society, with good characters to follow in a homage for obsessive freaks! Screenwriter Kevin Williamson almost had a terrific idea about a gruesome killer stalking the teens of a sleepy California town. Wes Craven is a genius of this certain genre, and to have him direct this film was a lucky break for the fledging writer. The concept was fine. Teens in a small town are being offed one by one in some of the most gory turn-outs. Soon, the police are baffled, and the teens are doing nothing but relating the vicious natured killings to pop-culture horror films. When situations grow from bad to worse-a town curfew is set, and a party is held. It is during this final party that all is revealed.First, we shall go over the concept. It has a strong presence, very strong, and very predictable. How many people do you know, actually saw the film, and could not see the next part coming? Yes, as scary as it might be, it is just as predictable as well. Williamson tries to put forth new ideas and interesting killings, but alas, it does not work, especially when the apparently innovative death scenes are more like puns. It does, however, have many good moments in which dialog is spoken, or imagery is shown that will send chills up your skin. The film seems to try too hard at getting a scare, as though it is afraid to be original, so it relies on the success of other films for reference scares. The concept is overblown by unrealistic scenes of shock value and character analysis details that need not apply. Over all, it was good, but it was also bad.The acting and character placement was fair and easy. Neve Campbell was very popular on the FOX drama ""Party Of Five"", and furthermore, she had completed ""The Craft"" just months before. Therefor, she definitely had the victim act down after playing the villain. Rose McGowan, Jaime Kennedy, and Matthew Lillard all had good shots at success as newer faces in the crowd. They in turn, had nothing to worry about. All three gave credible performances. Courtney Cox and David Arquette have certainly won the award for most spirited cast members to this day, just look at their position now. Skeet Ulrich is so irritating, he actually comes off well in his part. The rest of the cast features good supporting performances and cameos all around.Now, about the writing, Kevin Williamson is either smug and obviously desperate, or rather way too obsessed with the genre that his extreme passion clouds the writing and brings out the hackneyed atmosphere that films of this type should have been trying to ride themselves of. Even more annoying, is that obvious way Williamson is trying to give every single teen a sort of modern lingo about ""the werewolf movie with ""ET""'s mom in it, or 'Wes Carpenter', or even ""Tits Lagites"" thing."" Worst of all, the rather convenient way the everyone is an expert on horror films. Randy must be shooting for Leonard Maltin or Rex Reed status. The film has a little too many crinkles in it. Still, those flaws will fade when the moments of madness take tole.The directing is...well, Wes Craven did the deed, need I say more? All in all, the film was a nice little piece of scare fare, but it ruined the genre by giving away movie secrets and supposed methods that make the film formulas work. Nice try Williamson, but no horror film has been very enjoyable since your little stab film was released. Stop trying so hard, it's pathetic.",Scream
352,unikorn-67905,A true horror classic.,8,1 January 2021,"When I say true horror I mean true horror.Sure, freddy krueger is terrifying and the blob is a fantasy creature out of nightmares but Scream is relative horror, a fear that crossed most minds while taking a shower.A fellow citizen murdering you in the dead of night.They intertwine that suspense into a coming of age tale. The protagonist is navigating first boyfriends and highschool and all the uncomfortable creepings those can bring.There is a underlying tension throughout the film. Yes there are jump scares but they are earned. There is a psychological thriller element and a bit of mystery.Teenage angst, primal fears, and the veneer of civilization that the suburbs bring stew into a true horror classic.",Scream
353,supernj,Scream for a Review,7,25 October 2020,Good Movie overall. Neve Campbell's performance was outstanding and the great references to other horror films made sense to the audience.,Scream
354,SlimeyPete,Overrated,5,21 July 1999,"This is the most overrated film I've seen! Yeah, it's OK, but it's nowhere near the great movie everyone seems to think it is. The direction is good, but the plot is boring and the characters too annoying to care about. I have a shocking revalation to make: THE PLOT WAS NICKED! Anyone who has seen Black Christmas will agree that the plots are identical - it's just the characters and setting that are different. Even the twist at the end is the same. Having said this, the way the movie takes the p*ss out of the horror genre is good.",Scream
355,howellgirl2011,There's a new killer on the loose who loves to terrorize teens!,9,21 January 2011,"I love this film including the way the killer(Ghost-face)is killing these teenagers in such brutal ways. When some of the teens were turning around to see if Ghost-face was still following them, I was like ""don't turn around, keep running, he's right behind you, run for it!"" This film was great I loved the characters Sydney trying to figure out who is trying to kill her when the one she is dating is actually the killer who is blackmailing the real one, the true killer. I was afraid for Sydney when she had finally found out that the killer had killed her mom years ago. I was scared that she would suffer the same fate as her mother and her friends and schoolmates. I was surprised when Gale had shot her boyfriend who had nearly killed her with a gun and a knife. I thought of her as the hero and a savior who had saved Sydney and Dwey her soon would be boyfriend. I thought the film overall was great because you would never suspect a boyfriend close to someone who had seen her friends dying would be a killer. I really hope that there is a sequel to this film because if there is I am going to see it and hopefully write a review for it. I do hope that Sydney is going to finally get rid of anyone who killed her mom, because in the film it did say that she did die from stab wounds and blood loss, because I don't think that they had killed her. Maybe copycatting a similar death.",Scream
356,sterlinrivera-2000,My Favorite Horror Film,10,1 November 2019,"Scream is without a doubt my favorite horror film of all time. It is very creative, spooky, well-made, and it has never gets old as I have seen it countless times.Scream is about a killer that wears a ghost mask and threatens people over the phone and later kills its victims. A young girl named Casey (Drew Barrymore) and her boyfriend Steve get killed from this killer and triggers a huge investigation in Woodsboro, California. A girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), becomes the next victim and she must do everything to find out who is the killer and fight him off.Scream is very top notch and flawless. The plot is very creative with some cool twists to make it more interesting. The acting is great and I love the cast. Neve Campbell did a wonderful job playing the lead, Sidney, David Arquette was great as playing the cop, Deputy Dewey Riley, Courtney Cox was amazing as the news reporter, Gale Weathers, and the rest of the cast, such as Matthew Lillard, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy and Drew Barrymore was awesome.Out of all four Scream films, this one definitely has the best killer reveal. You find out that there were two killers, and they were Stu (Matthew Lillard) and Billy (Skeet Ulrich). They were the killers of Sidney's mother as well, and it was because Billy's mom left his Dad because his Dad was with Sidney's mom. I felt that was a very cool twist and they explained how they planned everything out.In conclusion, Scream is a successful and masterful horror movie that lives up to this very day and will always be my favorite horror film.",Scream

I recommend this movie to all.",Scream
358,sjwest,Another original contribution by Wes Craven.,7,27 July 2003,"Wes Craven has provided audiences with original, entertaining work which has left their indelible mark on the movie world. One only has to mention 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for it to be seen that he is a director who has made a massive impact on the horror genre. Both movies had large followings and produced characters that will be long remembered. Creating characters that become icons within a genre is difficult and Craven has produced two. Not only is it because the material is so original, it is also because Craven uses a talented cast who appeal to present day audiences. He is able to blend classic horror, that is, the bogeyman with the mask who stalks the main characters from the shadows, with the window dressing provided by photogenic actors and actresses which is obligatory for today's movies. In effect he has made horror movies appealing to mass audiences  something that only the very best could do. This has been accomplished by way of numerous means. As previously mentioned, the cast - window dressing - are usually fresh, bright, young talent. They can act. There is also a story of note. The central characters are all engrossed in conflict with each other and this is not only due to the fact that the characters have been created with a lot of personality differences, but also because they are given real dilemmas. A good example is in 'Scream' where Sydney is struggling to come to emotional terms with her mother's death and she then also has to deal with Gale Weathers who questions the legitimacy of her testimony which put away the main suspect. She also has to deal with her mother's promiscuity. This is a great basis for conflict and has a high degree of believability. In the hands of two good actresses, it enhanced the movies plot.
The suspense is of such a high level, that you could argue the fact that this movie leans more towards suspense thriller rather than horror. Although it is argumentative, I believe that this movie is still rightfully classified as horror rather than suspense since the suspense is a catalyst for the horror. The suspense sets us up for the horrific scenes. The suspense thus provides a service rather that it being the recipient of a service.In accordance with present day adaptations of teenagers on screen, they are insightful with understandings of relationships, but not the emotional maturity to deal with them. This is well used within 'Scream' as the main characters have insight into the 'rules' of horror movies, but still put themselves at risk for the climatic sequence where they are secluded and vulnerable although probably feeling safe in numbers.Neve Campbell is excellent as the fragile Sydney Prescott. She has an extremely fragile way of speaking which makes her more vulnerable to the villain. She aptly portrays the emotional turmoil which seems to sap her characters strength. Her ability to show the dilemma concerning her testimony towards Cotton Weary aids in the audience acceptance of her trusting of her boyfriend - would she be able to deal with another questionable accusation?  Given her portrayal, we think not.Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard are equally commendable. Ulrich does not get too offbeat when his characters true intentions are shown. This keeps the transition more plausible. Lillard remains as over the top as he was before which thus keeps his character consistent and hence believable. They were the best villains of the franchise and were a healthy contributing factor to the first movies success and its reputation, earned quite correctly, as the superior.You could not comment on 'Scream' without mentioning Kevin Williamson. He is the one who after all provided the seed for the most successful horror movie. Although he penned a few of the movies that followed on the success of this one, this is still the gem. The audience is kept guessing throughout and suspects are numerous meaning that some members of the audience may have changed their minds on several occasions as to who the villain is. Who guessed that there were two of them? Not many, of that I am very sure. There is ample plot here to keep attention as well as multi - layered conflict. This gave a new dimension to the slasher flick and redefined the genre for the 90's.This movie is not reverential of the genre. It rather pokes fun at the 'rules' that moviemakers kept to in order to operate within the genre. Success of a movie meant that others would follow and many similar movies were produced which were mostly a paler version of the source of inspiration or source of plagiarism, as would have often been the case in order to secure sound revenue. Audiences became indoctrinated with the same ideas and thus familiarity gave birth to contempt. Although this is true, the rules' must be kept to even within the most original script. A fine balancing act needs to be struck. It is important to note that all genres have their own set of rules which must be abided by if audiences are going to identify with the movie. Notwithstanding this fact, movies made for the drive - in theatre age, the B grade support flick, generally followed these rules' without much attention to plot and were therefore ridiculed. 'Scream' makes the most of this. It could have so easily fell into the spoof movie trap, but does not thus securing its place in movie history. Of more importance, it reignited the genre which had long been without a leading torch. The last one was Elm Street' and this is not coincidence that the director was Wes Craven. He is that good.",Scream

The scenes involving Drew Barrymore were by far the best part of the film. The rest (on reflection) was a bit like a grown-ups version of Scooby Doo.If you want to calibrate my taste (and lack of), I prefer Wes' ""People Under the Stairs"". Enjoy the black comedy.",Scream
361,very_doubtful,90210 meets horror,10,16 April 2000,"Many IMDb-Users have commented that this is the movie who brought the horror genre back to life. I disagree. What Scream really did was to invent a more or less new kind of genre. It definitely has horror elements in it but more important are the teenagers that are all over this film. All right, ""Halloween"" (1978) did have teenagers too but still the film was about the killer (Michael Myers) himself and not about the kids he happened to kill.What I'm trying to say is that Scream is a good film. But after the huge success many other studios tried to make money with other teen-horror flicks that were aiming at the same audience. And that's where it got really stupid. Scream could have been unique but unfortunately it spawned a whole generation of similar films that fed of the same basic idea but just failed to be original. The makers of Scream were lucky to publish the film at a time where there were almost no good horror films anymore and that's why it attracted that many people.Scream is a good combination of horror and comedy/parody, there's no question about that. The general problem with this kind of film always was that it is very difficult for a film to be scary and funny at the same time. Craven and Williamson avoided to mix comedy and scares in the same scenes and separated these two elements. That's the reason why Scream did what others haven't been able to do.The film is by no means as scary as the ""true"" horror films (Halloween, The Evil Dead, A Nightmare on Elm Street and others) but has its scares. The opening scene is very intense and sadistic but we already get some allusions to other horror films. This scene is more intense than the whole remaining 100 minutes. There are other scenes where the killer is very sadistic when killing his victims but it never gets really scary. Although the killer looks great in the white mask I didn't have the impression that he was as dangerous as good old Michael Myers or Fred Krueger. The idea of a 18 year old psycho-boy hiding behind that mask didn't make it any scarier.But of course Scream wasn't supposed to be plain horror. More important are the allusions to other horror films and these were done very good. Some of the jokes were a little too obvious but I guess otherwise most of the ignorant viewers out there wouldn't understand it. On the other hand I think I still haven't noticed them all myself.Another important aspect is the who's-the-lunatic-behind-the-mask question. We have the time to get to know all the persons including the one(s) that is/are responsible for the murders. Honestly, I didn't have the slightest idea who would be the killer (I didn't think about it very heavily though). Some persons have commented that they found the film to be predictable. They are either very clever or lying and I tend to say the latter thing is true (no offence included).I hope I didn't make it sound as if this movie was mediocre because it isn't. It is clever, suspenseful in some places and very amusing in others. Overall it is one of the most original films of the decade and perfect to watch with a group of friends.I highly recommend this movie but also advise you to stay away from the imitations that followed.My rating: 10/10 (Don't expect the sequels to be equally clever!)",Scream

Taking allot of inspiration from ""Halloween"" and a dozen other movies, this movie references more horror films than any movie buff could handle. Its scary, its cool and it doesn't take itself seriously which is what makes it stand above the rest. Neve Campbell is great here along with future star Rose Mcgowan and the ""Friends"" protagonist Courtney Cox. Skeet Ulrich was awesome too.

Scream came out at a point when all slasher movies were done before, yet it was unique as it parodied all the stupid tropes in those movies. But unlike the movies it copies like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream is actually a good movie. Just the opening of Scream blows me away, too bad the rest of the movie doesn't manage to live up to the perfect first 10 minutes. Everything thing from the killers design to the cliché jokes are incredible. The meta-ness of the film really works in its favour to get a mysterious and sometimes funny movie that is completely unique in it's otherwise boring, repetitive genre.",Scream

However, in retrospect I wish they hadn't made this movie.  If you look at recent horror movies that are widely released you will see that horror movies suck unless you know about independent movies that film studios wouldn't touch.  This is more or less a parody of horror movies.  I would never have commented on this movie, however, I see that everyone thinks it's so great.  If you are a fan of movies such as Dead Alive(by the now lame Peter Jackson), Re-Animator and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you hate the fact that this movie exists.  Every horror movie except for the Ring is copying Scream.  Think about every horror movie you see at the movies or hear about...  all you have are a bunch of WB actors running around showing that they really aren't that talented and some aren't even that goodlooking.  Wes Craven is a master of genre redefining movies.  Last House on the Left, Nightmare on Elmstreet and New Nightmare were all awesome movies.

Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears.

370,Mileskolehmainen,"Even better than I thought it would be!! Clever, scary, and smart.",9,4 November 2014,"First of all, I'm not going to write any spoilers. I usually don't anyway, but knowing any more than some of the most obvious deaths/twists in this movie or it's sequels can ruin them. These movies are murder mysteries, so you shouldn't know much about who lives and dies going into one of them. Now onto the review. This movie is scary. Lots of jump scares, violent killings, and edge-of-your-seat chase scenes. But Scream is also smart: The characters put up a fight, they are smart, and they really try to escape. The characters also make many comments on horror movies and how to survive a horror movie (This adds to the movie sly but subtle satire). The movie itself is very well written and acted. The characters are realistically written. They almost all have something to make you think ""There's no way they would kill someone!"". That's why it's so hard to figure out who the killer is. The plot ain't bad either, but after the first scene it takes a while to pick up, but when it picks up, it picks up. The acting, like I stated earlier, is decent. You really feel for the characters, you don't want them to die, and, unlike in many other movies, they have a good chance at surviving. Scream is an exceptional horror movie. Kudos to Wes and Kevin. Remember, like most of my reviews this is a rating specific for films like this one. It's not like you can compare this to Forest Gump or something.

This movie is scariest when you're all alone at night with the lights off, especially in the middle of nowhere, trust me, this is how I first saw it.  Watch the director's cut if you can find it, it's a little better in my opinion.",Scream
373,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Do you like scary movies?,7,4 November 2020,"This movie wastes no time and hits the ground running with an iconic opening 15 minutes. It sets the tone right away while giving us some truly memorable lines like, ""Do you want to play a game?"" Easily my favourite element of this movie is that it's a murder mystery. Even though I figured most of it out before the final reveal, it was still fun to watch everything unfold. But what this movie excels at is how self-aware all the characters are to horror tropes and what not to do. It just makes everything feel more grounded in reality.However, as far as serial killers go, Ghostface sucks at his job. I understand that he's inexperienced, but then again, he somehow manages to move around like a silent ninja without ever being spotted. He was just a weak serial killer who was never scary, and quite honestly, I think I could have taken him down. As well, for a movie that is self-aware of horror clichés, it still falls victim to horror clichés. For instance, running and tripping on thin air or just dumb people dying in dumb ways. I also hate the fact that the movie constantly tried scaring us with ""jump scares"", which only turned out to be harmless friends popping up out of nowhere.I also acknowledge the fact that this movie was made for horror buffs and fans of slashers. Seeing as to I am neither of those things, I can still respect the amount of passion that went into this project. Particularly with all the call-backs and Easter eggs. With that being said, this movie was still a ton of fun and I'm curious to check out all the sequels now.Score: 7 out of 10
Overall: GoodRecommended for: Fans of horror/slasher movies, fans of murder mysteries, or fans of Ghostface, a serial killer so bad at his job that I could probably take him down.",Scream

Two obvious idiots running around unnoticed in  bizarre getups as if they had some sort of paranormal ability, killing at will, and never getting seen or caught, who, in the end, not only have to explain the whole plot to the last victim (actually more cliche than cliche -it requires a whole new word) but stab each other (this is their ""alibi"") before killing her!!!! C'mon, even my six year old was scared until the end when she pronounced the whole thing ""stupid"". I realize this movie was geared toward teenagers struggling with attention deficit disorder or a crack addiction, but even they must have some standards.

The Killer was done well. You think you know who it is, but once you get certain of who it is, the movie will violently prove you wrong. Wes Craven hasn't made another horror classic or anything, but it is a nice cult classic.WARNING: The second movie is 'ok' but not worth it. fun for a few viewings.The third isn't even worth looking at.

Unfortunately, I was turned off immediately when the killer(s) are revealed. Would have been far better if the killer was never caught or identified.I saw Scream 2, knowing it would be terrible compared to the first and I was not proven wrong.  Never saw the third film.

380,Jack Smith - The King Of Horror,A Cancer!!!,1,7 March 2001,"SCREAM is a cancer, a cancer that has spread and infected nearly all those who have watched it, a cancer that has killed the Horror Genre. The catch is that SCREAM in itself is not an awful film, it is actually quite good. The problem is not the film itself it is the way that people have embraced it. Jaded horror fans who have OD'd on lousy horror movies have been so refreshed and blinded by this movie that they have proclaimed it as the new king, the greatest Horror movie ever. In a word - bull****. Anyone who says this needs shooting, SCREAM is not even in the Top 100 Greatest Horror Movies. Even the director, Wes Craven has made several superior movies. In my view a good comic-horror should not attain glory by ridiculing REAL horror classics like this film ends up doing. Now all Horror Movies are just blatant imitations of this. Parodies of a Parody, no thanks. On its own merits SCREAM is a good film but in terms of the effect it has had it is the worst thing ever to have happened to Horror. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, DAWN OF THE DEAD and the Italian shockers of Directors such as Fulci and Argento are classic horror movies, SCREAM should never be included in the same league.",Scream

A dismal failure to entertain on any level. While viewing this film, when the chick got trapped in the garage door, I could only laugh, as it was more a scene from a Chaplin silent than a modern day horror film. That this film appealed so much to the 20-30 year old crowd reveals a sad commentary on a generation which seems to have no sense of film appreciation. Where's Vincent Price when you need him? At least that generation knew how to camp it up and play with its audience. There's absolutely nothing new here, and how it spawned sequels is beyond comprehension.",Scream

However knowing that sort of makes these scene more intense.Neve Campbell is a megababe and she does sort of look like a young Heather Langenkamp who played the main character in A Nightmare on Elm Street.The film is good but was not as scary as I expected when I went to see it when it opened.

It's funny, Gory and sexy what more could you want?A must see for horror fans!!!",Scream
385,Schnayblay,"You May Not Scream, But You Will Grin",7,5 January 2012,"In the 90's, the slasher genre was worn out. Series like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" had gravitated away from their horror routes and were now like comedies. The longevity of these series were now a running joke to the audience, and the genre needed some new life. So ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" director Wes Craven decided to make ""Scream"".""Scream"" is a horror movie that is self aware. While most films in the genre are usually mocked for being so cliché, ""Scream"" celebrates it and cleverly follows the classic formula.The beginning of ""Scream"" opens up with Drew Barrymore. Many people thought that, due to the marketing campaign, she was going to be the lead role, since she was such a big name at the time. But, no, she's actually killed within 15 minutes. It's kind of a tribute to ""Psycho"", where Janet Leigh was portrayed to be the main hero, but was abruptly killed early.So then, the film transitions over to Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell. Sidney's mother was raped and killed a year prior to the film, and as such, Sidney is in a depression. I find Capmbell's performance to be very solid for a horror film, and this is my favourite role she's been in. This is the film that launched her career. She may have a respectable resume these days, but in my heart, shes a scream queen.Sidney has a boyfriend named Billy, played by Skeet Ulrich. Neve Campbell had co-starred with him earlier that year in ""The Craft"". In his very first scene, Billy sneaks into Sidney's room just to make-out with her. But the way he proposes it is funny as hell. Funny enough, this is probably the way I would propose it if I had a girlfriend.Then there's Sidney's best friend, Tatum, played by a young Rose McGowan. Funny to think that in 11 years, this chick would be blowing the hell out of zombies with a gun-leg in ""Planet Terror"".Tatum's older brother, Dewey, is played by David Arquette, who is the real life older brother of Patricia Arquette. Patricia had starred in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors"". Dewey is an easily lovable character. He comes off as kinda wimpy and weak, but you just love him.Then there's Gale Weathers, played by Courtney Cox. Gale's a news reporter, but she also becomes Dewey's love interest. While the sequels expanded upon this, in the original, it seems like Gale is just using Dewey to get to Sidney for her next big story. Sidney gets so mad at Gale that she punches her square in the face. I laugh my head off every time I see this part.But the man who steals the whole film is Randy, played by Jamie Kennedy. Randy is a film buff, always overflowing with film references and great humour. Randy is probably my favourite film character of all time. Mostly cause I can relate to him. Being a film buff myself, I know the mindset, and thats my favourite part about Randy. He's always in movie-mode.The finale is a 40 minute long build up, sprinkled with a kill here and there, and it keeps you guessing at who the killer really is. Speaking of which, I haven't even talked about the killer yet.The killer's costume was an actual real life Halloween costume that was already popular before the movie. It's kinda like the original ""Halloween"", where the filmmakers went out, just bought a random mask from the store, and used it for the movie. Reusing this technique was very smart in my opinion, cause it truly gives the feeling that the killer could be anyone.Overall, I love this movie. While it's in no way a masterpiece of horror cinema, the modern age owes a lot to ""Scream"". It revitalized the slasher genre and brought a new audience's attention back to the classics. It's not a landmark, but it's a pretty solid horror film. Check it out.",Scream

Unlike some horror movie characters you actually feel sorry for her because she is so convincing. Courtney Cox is good, but even better in the sequel. David Arquette is always funny.

And this is supposed to be a ""parody"", if I'm not mistaken.

396,claptonisgod53,Scream: A Parody Of The Slasher Film,7,18 September 2008,"Scream is always wrongfully called a horror movie. To be 100% truthful, Scream isn't a horror film by any means. Some Contemparary horror audiences might find Scream to be terrifying, but true horror fans can find the gimmicks and little laughs to make the film entertaining. Scream is not entertaining by the horror standard at all. I first seen Scream when I was fairly new to the horror genre, and I didn't find it to be suspenseful or scary by any means. It didn't even get to the graphic scenes until the very end. I couldn't exactly appreciate what this film was until I searched further in the horror genre, then I re-watched Scream, and found all of the parody moments.Scream was directed by Wes Craven, who is mainly known for directed A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and several exploitation films from the 70s (Last House on the Left (1972); Hills Have Eyes (1976)). However, Wes directed Scream several years after directed A New Nightmare, which would be the final installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. A New Nightmare basically took place in the real world outside the movies with the actors playing themselves. Scream basically works in the same way. It parodies the films that inspired it. For me, this film is a first rate comedy. I'm sure that some people will find this film to be absolutely terrifying in the last half an hour, but others will just find it to be guilty fun. Which category do you fall into? Well, when I referenced Last House on the Left (1972), did you know what film I was talking about? If so, this will seem like a pure comedy to you.While Scream IS a comedy, it still supplies some fun graphic scenes near the end of the film as well as some decent performances by the cast. The twist at the end was expected looking at the rest of the film, but was still nice to see.",Scream

399,Egg_MacGuffin,I screamed alright.,1,1 June 2005,"I screamed because of how bad this movie is.We'll start with Wes Craven. The guy made one good movie in his whole career...A Nightmare On Elm Street. And even that could have been twice as good as it is. This is just more generic crap from the Craven factory.Second, the writer. Kevin Williamson. I think that's his name. I'm not going to look it up either because he doesn't deserve it. Not only did he write this horrible piece of crap, but he also wrote I Know What You Did Last Summer (AKA Prom Night the remake). The only good thing about that was the possibility for a spoof called I Forget What You Did Last Summer. But enough of that crap (literally), let's get back to Scream.The movie starts with a carbon-copy of the opening of When A Stranger Calls (which was fifty times scarier than everything Williamson and Craven did put together twice). Then we get into the actual movie, which is just constant references to other horror films.My main gripe with this movie is not the writing or directing...but the characters. All of them. We literally have NO reason to care about ANY of them. Rose McGowan is nice to look at, but that's as far as it goes. But the worst is the actual killer himself. I know they were trying to break the invincible horror movie killer cliché intentionally, but they went WAY too far. This guy falls over at the drop of a hat! Instead of being totally indestructible, he's just plain clumsy. And why on Earth was he dressed up in his disguise while at the grocery store in broad daylight? And when the identity of the killer is finally revealed, it's really no shock considering he did absolutely nothing for the whole film, not to mention that he has no motive except for some little soap-opera bullcrap that we're just supposed to believe. It doesn't come as any type of shock at all.Is this movie horror, or comedy? It tries to be both but never goes far enough in either direction and just ends up being neither funny nor frightening. Williamson and Craven think that referencing great horror movies means that theirs will be great, too. All that did was remind me of how awesome a movie like Halloween is and how pathetic this tripe is.But the worst to come out of this movie is actually it's influence on other horror films to come. The fresh teen cast, all featured on the cover art in the same exact fashion as this movie. If you're ever at the video store and see a box cover that mimics that of Scream's cover...just walk away. Because honestly...what Scream-influenced movie was even halfway decent? None.Scream is anti-horror. It's everything that a horror movie should NOT be. Fresh teen cast, bright cinematography, clumsy/harmless killer, fast-cut editing, banal directing, forgettable action movie score, references to other horror movies, too much comedy, unbelievable sequences, characters that we have no reason to care for, and to top it all off...it spawned countless imitators that were even worse! Do yourself a favor...don't watch this. Watch something great instead. Something like Rosemary's Baby.",Scream
400,Chandlergellar,"""It's a Scream baby""",10,1 August 2005,"When i first saw Scream about 2 years ago, i wasn't expecting much because i knew what all these ""Teen"" Horror flicks were about (bad acting, bad direction etc) but when the opening scene began with Drew Barrymore playing helpless blonde Casey Becker, my mind was changed almost immediately, words cant describe how brilliant Drew Barrymore was in this opening scene, and i have never scene her act this good fantastic since. it starts of with Casey Becker answering the phone, while shes alone getting ready to watch some scary movies with her boyfriend Steven Orth, but suddenly out the blue, the stranger on the phone starts harassing Casey and this is when she knows something is wrong here, every time i watch this scene my heart still pounds and i still cant watch it when her parents find her hanging from a tree, because without this Drew Barrymore opener, this movie would have been awful. Then we get introduced to Neve Campbell playing Sydney Prescott, a 17 year girl, with a boyfriend who is always trying to get into her pants. Her boyfriend Billy Loomis played by Skeet Ulrich suddenly appears through her window giving her a big fright and the only reason why he wanted to see Sidney was because he wanted the night to be the night (if you know what i mean!) but she says no and he leaves. The next day after Casey and Steve were murdered and Sidney finds herself being swamped by tabloid twit Gail Weathers played by Courtney Cox (Tv's Friends), because a year earlier her mother Maureen Prescott was raped and murdered and Sid blamed it on her mothers ex lover Cotten weary (liev Schreiber) and Gail has been bashing Sidney since Cotten got sent down for her murder. We than get introduced to Tatum Reily played by Rose Mcgowan, Sidneys best friend, Randy Meeks played by Jamie Kennedy and Stu Macker played by Matthew Lillard (Tatums boyfriend). That very same night Sidney gets attacked at home whilst waiting for Tatum to pick her up, and suddenly Billy shows up and he gets arrested because Sidney thinks it was him. This is when Deputy Dewey Riley gets introduced played by David Arquette. its now the one year anniversary since Maureen Prescott was murdered and this when things start getting crazy and more bodies start piling up and its up to Gale, Dewey and Sidney to stop it.we found out who the killers are and their motive is blaming Horror movies and they want to blame the whole thing on Neil Prescott (Sidneys father) to make sure they don't get caught. in Conclusion i enjoy watching this masterpiece by Wes Craven and i want to give out mini awards to the brilliant cast: Drew Barrymore: No words cant describe the brilliance of her performance, she really was amazing Neve Campbell: Neve is always great as troubled Sidney and she was great in all 3 movies Courtney Cox: Courtney proved that she can get away from her ""Friends"" character Monica Gellar and this showed us she is a mature actor and can do any role Rose Mcgowan: she cracks me up in this movie with her sarcastic remarks ""no please don't kill me Mr ghost face, i wanna be in the sequel""The rest of the cast are brilliant as well but i was disappointed with David Arquette because he was good in this but he isn't a great actor in my opinion i give it 100/10 because this is the modern say ""Halloween"" and this best Horror Movie of all time.",Scream

Hiring Wes Craven to direct it was another brilliant move as he squeezes as much terror and suspense out of every sequence as he can, especially the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore which is just as effective today as it was in 1996. Neve Campbell makes for an appealing and relatable heroine with great support by Rose McGowan as her loyal best friend and Courtney Cox as the opportunistic tabloid journalist.",Scream
403,ChoiceCuts,Better than you might think.,8,9 March 2004,"***Possible spoiler***I should hate this movie, not only because what it is but because it has spawned hundreds of shoddy movies that has tried to cash in on it's success. I should hate it for what it is because it's a thriller which just tries to look like a horror movie plus it stars David Arquette one of the most annoying actors in the business. But I still can't help myself from liking it.The plot is at sometimes rather smart. A killer is slaughtering people and terrorizing them by forcing them to answer questions about (in)famous horrormovies. Craven could and should have used this element more than he did since it's a pretty clever idea. Still he makes it work well.The movie has got some good actors in it: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, David Arquette is actually good as the nerdy cop here but I think that we should have had the rights to see more of Drew Barrymore. She's easily one of the best actresses in Scream.The movie has got some scenes packed full of suspense and tension. Sure some scenes may seem clichéd, but not so much that it doesn't work. And this is a movie about movies, so I guess that it wouldn't have that much of a point if it didn't seem clichéd at one point.The first time I saw this, I had a special kind of feeling in my stomach. I had a feeling that anything could happen. I don't think I've had that kind of feeling watching a movie ever since. It was my first contact with the horror world, even though this is more of a thriller than pure horror.The only downsides I can figure out was that the plot weakens at the end, and everyone tends to be look a bit too crazy to make it work as good as it should.So to spell it out: if you want to start to watch horror movies but you don't know where to begin than start here. It might be a blend of thriller and horror but it's still a very fine start. It just worked for me.8/10",Scream
404,WandrinStar,Scream (1996),8,24 April 2012,"80/100. The movie that begun the silver age of slasher films in the mid to late 1990's. Although Wes Craven's horror filmography is glowing with other culturally significant trips to the macabre ( A Nightmare on Elm Street, Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes) I consider 'Scream' to be his greatest achievement. Not only was the timing for the film perfect, but Kevin Williamson's simple yet brilliant script and an almost perfect cast help hail this movie as one of the best horror movies of the 1990's. Neve Campbell as the film's sexually repressed or 'final girl' character, if you will, rivals that of the original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. David Arquette as Dewey Riley steals the spotlight every scene he's in, Courtney Cox proves her acting talent by playing a stuck up, malevolent news reporter whose passion and slight hint of selflessness makes her character hard to not love, while Jamie Kennedy helps channel the audience's thoughts and concerns to everyone on screen. Even minor characters such as Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and even Henry Winkler all have memorable roles. Drew Barrymore's opening scene although perhaps a little over-the-top, is both memorable and nostalgic to horror movie lore. This strongly meta influenced film is one of the few to get the concept right and the laugh to scare ratio is perfect. The final act is a wild ride that should make everyone shudder at how plausible it would be for someone to put on a Halloween costume and start butchering inebriated teenagers.",Scream

I grew up watching Scream.What separates this film franchise from the others is just how self aware these films are. It knows it's a horror film so instead of trying so hard it has fun with all the tropes, and signature moments that make horror, horror. It does all this while also being a great slasher.Those other films while they have their own following, and merit they just don't do it for me, probably because I didn't grow up with them as so many others. Scream is my slasher killer franchise.9/10.",Scream

408,Sheepi,Excuse me?,1,29 January 2000,"I can't believe some of the people that said this movie was good. And so many people gave it a 10 ! This movie was AWFUL!It's the typical slasher movie. A guy calls a girl and asks her what's her favorite scary movie. She hangs up on him, and then her parents find her dead, hung up in a tree covered with blood. Ooooookie dokie.
This movie is terrible. If you don't like it, you'll certainly be laughing most of the way through. I asked every friend I hang out with regularly (about 10 people); they all agreed that this was THE SINGLE LAMEST MOVIE they had EVER SEEN.Take my advice; see the Blair Witch Project. That movie scared the crap out of me! But be warned, you HAVE to have at least a hint of an imagination to like it. The people who hate it are pitifully without any imagination at all.1/10 without question",Scream
409,Tyler-Durden,"Read my comment, not the summary.",9,14 July 2000,"Scream was an excellent movie. It did it's job very well. The purpose of the movie was to scare the viewers and it really worked fine.This was the first movie of it's type, and after this film there have been many other movies made trying to duplicate it.The sequel of Scream (Scream 2) was not as succesful as the first one. And the last one (Scream 3) was a total chaos.The reason why Scream was so fantastic is, as I mentioned before, it was the first movie of it's type. No other movies like this had been made before, so nothing in the movie could be said that it was ripped off from other movie(s).The plot isn't that good, we all know that, and neither are the performances by the actors, but the reason I'm saying that this film is so good is because it accomplished it's mission, it gave a really good time to all the people who watched it (at least all the young people), so I guess I can't complain. I really enjoyed watching the movie.I'll rate it with a 9 out of 10. It's not really a 9 movie, it's more of like a 7 movie, but as I said, most (young) people enjoyed it a lot, it was original and the first of it's kind.",Scream
410,chaaa,"Scream deserves a second look, fifteen years on",10,11 April 2011,"Those who remember the release of Scream will undoubtedly remember it as something of a genre revolution. For a period, teenagers sneaked into cinemas all over the world to scream and giggle; sleepovers full of teenage girls had never been so afraid and no one answered the phone when they were in the house alone. For those unfamiliar with the premise, Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott, whose mother was brutally murdered a year earlier and now a ghost-masked serial killer is tormenting her with phone calls, movie trivia and a series of bloody murders. The fictional town of Woodsboro is in a panic. Who is the masked serial killer? Can hot-shot reporter Gale Weathers solve the crime and win her Emmy with the help of the sweet but dim Deputy Dewey? The plot is as basic as they come but what sets this film apart is Scream's borderline satirical awareness of the genre allowing it to play homage to all the great slasher films of the past while bursting the door wide open for a new wave of slice n' dice murderous mayhem in cinema.Scream follows the same basic conventions of a slasher film but with a knowing smile. These kids are well-versed in movie terminology and the sagely nerd Randy explains the conventions of the horror genre. Rule #1: You can't have sex, since only virgins can outsmart the killer in the end; Rule #2: You can't drink or do drugs, since like rule #1, they are sins. Rule #3: Don't ever say ""I'll be right back."" Needless to say, Randy's rules are fairly accurate and allow the audience a tantalising prediction of who's going to die.Scream stands out, not only because of its tongue-in-cheek genre-bending but also because it is damn scary! The scares come hard and fast, starting with the classic Drew Barrymore opening sequence. There is something untrustworthy about Scream's ""the rules are there are no rules"" cavalier attitude towards scares that keeps the audiences feeling uncomfortable for the entire film. You think you know where the jumps are coming, but since you also know that they are playing with expectations, you can never quite trust the rules you think you know. Another unique element of Scream is the self-aware nature of these teenagers. Kevin Williamson would go on to create an entire generation of over-thinking, verbose teenagers with his TV show Dawson's Creek and it's clear to see his pattern emerging here. The cast and characters are equally colourful and much of Scream's power is wielded in the energy and likability of the young cast. Unlike the teenagers in previous horror films, these kids were not so interested in sex and drugs that they are oblivious to the fact that they are being picked off one by one. These teens are well aware of horror movie clichés. They know what is expected of them and know how to avoid being killed. As the panic spreads, they look to the movies to figure out how to survive. Also, when the films killers are finally revealed it is their disturbing relationship to the horror genre that has inspired them. But they are quick to dismiss that horror movies actually make people commit murder, they just help them come up with interesting ways to do it; ""movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative"". Williamson was unafraid to create two sides to the ""video nasties"" argument, giving the audience something meaty to mull over after the movie ended, if they were so inclined.Scream was a gigantic success both critically and financially and so it sparked a new wave in teen horror, many of which were pretty terrible. There were even two sequels to Scream, the first of which was a winking discussion of the rules of the sequel. It was reasonably clever but not as good as the first (but then again, isn't that the rule about sequels?). Scream 3 however was an absolute disaster, hated by pretty much everyone and especially infuriating because its twist ending managed to ruin elements of the original film. Scream 4 is a dissection, fifteen years on, of the effect of the original film on horror films and how the genre has moved on, with particular attention paid to the Blair Witch inspired tendency of horror films to be based on supposed ""found footage"". Whether or not the fourth film manages to become a worthy addition to the franchise, it gives us the perfect opportunity to reflect on the original Scream film and to appreciate it for its sense of humour, its cinematic wisdom, it's uniquely postmodern concept (this is a concept that could only be used once, any followers were mere copycats), and it's ability to scare the crap out of audiences all over the world, even the most seasoned horror buff!",Scream

413,dynagirl,The intellectual slasher flick...,9,6 February 1999,"Cleverly scripted and surprisingly full of suspense, this is one horror movie that really leaves all others in the dust. Even the first Nightmare on Elm Street can't compare.What this film does, above all else, is renounce the cliches of horror movies past. There are, of course, a few moments of digression when you know what's coming and who's going to get it next. But for the most part, this one really keeps you on your toes, rather than yelling ""don't go in there!"" at the screen.Scream is certainly bloody, so it's not for the squeamish.

With this all-star cast including Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowen, Jamie Kennedy, and Drew Barrymore it couldn't go wrong. The story begins when Sydney Prescott is stalked by the same killer that took her mother's life one year ago. Surrounded by suspects that include her best friends, father, and boyfriend, Sydney must try to survive a night of terror. It will keep you on the edge of your seat till the surprise ending.

The story, it has no story it is just about a group of teens who are getting murdered by a guy in a stupid costume. The Music, it wasn't that good but it was OK with speakers. The Special Effects It didn't have any or if it did there weren't many and they weren't that good. And a thing I hate and most horror movies have is the Killer never dies the first or disappears specially the 3rd one the killer gets shot about 5 times and then you find out he was wearing bullet proof vest. The sequels are just as bad the 2nd one is about the killer from the first mum is angry and wants and has revenge.

The opening scene is so intense - Drew Barrymore's acting is perfection - had me tearing up at the thought of how helpless her character was in that scenario (comparable to the classic When a Stranger Calls). Prefer movies like this where there's more suspense than gore. At the same time, the movie has its funny parts of educating the audience on horror movie cliches and survival rules. Scream 1 & 2 are the better of the 4 movies. Highly recommend",Scream

I would really appreciate if someone can tell me in which moment exactly I was supposed to feel scared. A few years later, it came ""Scary Movie"". Who needed to see that one?

419,Overtheredskies,"Good movie, could've been a perfect slasher though.",8,17 January 2020,"Perfect humor, mystery, but where are the murders? The opening should've been what the entire film should focus around, a killer calling and asking creepy questions then killing them off, but this movie is almost all over the place once you get to the cliche High School scene...I even heard someone had to tell Wes Craven to throw in the High School kill scene because after the opening murder, we babble in the town with perfect humor, & mystery, but like I said, no murders happen for a good 30 minutes maybe, then the rest of the kills are super simple and nothing like the first. (Well the garage kill is cool when it's uncut) So it almost seems like they tried to take the original 1978 Halloween route with doing one kill for the intro, then the rest of the kills take place at a house way later into the film... Overall the movie is easy to watch, entertaining and definitely one of the top late 90s/early 2000s horror films made. (It's way more enjoyable than Halloween H20 if that's saying anything.) On top of all of this, I enjoy burtal horror films, like early gore exploitation films such as ""Cannibals"" ""Absurd "" and ""Fight For Your Life"" etc. and even I can say ""Scream"" is a great film",Scream

The cast were a good reflection of how the 90s actors were both good and charismatic! Lots of movie references and pop culture trivia in the scenes but you gotta pay attention to get them as they re meant to give a certain effect. This film had a huge impact not only the genre but on the whole film industry and til today many movies try to copy the spirit of Scream in one way or another. See this with open mind and remember that this film doesn't take itself seriously. Ps the soundtrack is cool esp for the rock alternative genre lovers!,Scream
422,patrick_bateman_90029,An Instant Classic!,10,8 December 2001,"It is a known fact that in the mid-1990's, the horror genre was very dead. Very few horror movies were recognized. Until Scream came out, the only horror anyone would watch would be either an old Stephen King movie on TV or going to the video store so you didn't have to spend six bucks on seeing Candyman (1992). The Scream trilogy redefined the genre. The best is always the original Scream. It had an very original plot, a decent cast, true scares, some very good references to classic films (Wes Craven's cameo as the janitor in Freddy Krueger clothing and the use of colored corn syrup as blood, like what was used as pig's blood in Carrie (1976)), and it introduced an all-new terrifying serial killer: GhostFace. When I saw it in the theaters in 1996, I was truly scared out of my wits when GhostFace attacks Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore). Very few movies in the genre and the past five years since have been able to be as scary as Scream, except for Jeepers Creepers (2001). Believe me, rent Scream some time, make yourself a nice bucket of popcorn, turn off the lights, and prepare to scream endlessly!",Scream
423,cwkenreich,"A LOT of fun, albeit cliche and over-the-top",7,31 October 2021,"Wes Craven's mark on the horror genre is supposedly a twist on classic horror. The main killer centers around horror movies is a connoisseur regarding horror tropes and how to survive. But, rather than being an ambitious critique on the horror genre as a whole, Scream presents a shallow plot indulging in nearly every horror movie cliche it seeks to distance itself from. The predictability of the plot ensures this will never be nightmare fuel. It is little more than a remake of Halloween, maybe with a bit more comic relief and satire.The characters are not memorable, save for Drew Barrymore's Casey. It's no wonder her brief cameo is the most iconic scene in the film. Her first encounter with the killer is a masterclass opening scene; it includes arguably the greatest phone call in cinema, Barrymore's performance is perfect, it sets the pacing for the over-the-top action scenes that follow and...it was a break from horror tropes. For the supposed protagonist to be brutally killed off in the first 10 minutes is what kept my attention.Just to clarify though, in the moment, the various fight scenes are wonderfully suspenseful and a pleasure to watch. It is once we've recovered our senses that we realize we've seen it all before, just not as bombastic.",Scream

I loved the characters, the plot, the time period and I jumped up when I worked out Gale was Monica from Friends!!!! She was awsome in this Movie. Unfortunately, I had seen scary movie before Scream so I knew sort of what the plot was going to be due to Scary Movie being a spoof of Scream. However, it still had plenty of surprises and the opening scene is one of the great moments of Film history!It was very self aware and by all means this is not one of the best films of all time, but certainly one of the best horrors of all time because it understands the genre....it has learnt from it's predecessors that it has to be different, not take it's self seriously and try to discover a new type of horror.

The direction is fitting and the acting is perfection. Especially by Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox. While giving plenty of scares, it keep intelligent twists, and some very witty dialogue that was missing from earlier films of the genre. While it gives odes to such films as "" Halloween "", and "" A Nightmare on Elm Street "" it keeps the horror film fans watching, while newcomers to the genre can still have full enjoyment.

Its about a stalker/killer dressed up in a dark costume with a ghost mask and right from the beginning starts slaughtering teens. The direction by Wes Craven is good, and the script by Williamson matches it in this witty slasher. But, it wasn't really all that scary as soo many people seem to say, I think it had a couple of shocks here and there, but the scares toward the end take a back seat to the stylishness of the references found through out the film. And the cast, the cast is alright, but nuthin too special unless u compare them to the 80s horror films (except to a few like Nightmare on Elmstreet,  first Friday the 13th, and Child's Play).

431,horror3333,Redefined the Horror/Thriller Genre,9,17 March 2004,"Ok, when this movie came out I was six, and horror movies scared me. When I was eight, I loved horror movies. I really wasn't interested in seeing Scream, since it was new, and probably sucked. When we went to Wal-Mart (don't say anything!), I saw a copy and thought I might give it a shot. When It started, I was in the basement, which I used to think was the spookiest part of the house. My father was watching it with me, since we both love horror movies, and he hadn't seen it either.  SPOILER ALERT: TURN BACK NOW IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!! Ok. It starts with the title Scream, and a woman's voice can be heard desperately screaming, probably for her life. A hand picks up the phone, and we realize that it is Drew Barrymore. At first she doesn't think much of it, since they get into a conversation about their favorite scary movies (he he he). He asks her if she has a boyfriend, and she replies no. Liar. Anyway, he asks for her name, and says that he wants to know who he's looking at. That is when she realizes that she is in trouble, and we as the audience wonder how she'll get out of it. Drew Barrymore is a major star, she can't get killed off! Wrong. It was very much like Hitchcock and Psycho, killing off Janet Leigh early in the movie. Well, a killing spree takes foot, and our hero, Sidney (Neve Campbell), is the main prey. When the killer (he he he) is revealed, the answer is mind blowing. The sequels were actually worth watching, and I want to get the box set. This genre defining film is an absolute MUST for any horror fan.  10/10.  PS: What are your favorite scary movies? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!",Scream

Teen slasher movies have a tendency to be filled with annoying, brainless characters, but this one is very different: the plot, although simple, is substantial and effective; murder scenes are not overly gory (a personal pet hate of mine) and very tense and heart-pounding.The plot also has a few interesting twists and unexpected ones.

The film makes fun of many of the slasher film clichés, many of which Wes Craven adopted in his other movies. Which is funny that he sort of parodies himself. But with all the cliché parody, this film presents an intriguing mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end (which is certainly not clichéd). I gave it a ten, because it does what it is suppose to do flawlessly. Is it Citizen Kane or Shawshank....no...but it was not suppose to be. This is a slasher film meant ro reinvent the genre, and it did just that. However, they did it in a way that is truly original at the same time. This really is a very smart concept, and Craven pulled it off perfectly. Definitely a film that all horror fans need to watch.

442,bhanna23,Best of '96,7,16 September 2001,"Scream is in it's on category of horror movies, it's not the same kind of scary as Halloween and Friday the 13th. It is more of a thriller, it has a very well thought out story, and it will make you jump and scream, but still it's not near as good as the older 80's horror movie. Still I was very pleased to see this movie do so well, it started a whole new horror movie frenzy with I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend taking in some of the bucks as people flocked to the theaters to get another good scare.",Scream
443,JudgeChaos,A Nice Love Letter to Horror Fans,7,26 October 2015,"Let me make one thing very clear; I'm not a horror junkie. Sure, I'll watch horror movies like ""American Werewolf in London"" and ""Misery"", and enjoy them, but I haven't seen the major horror landmarks like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", or ""Friday the 13th"". For the past few years, I've always tried to watch a new horror movie every October. This year, it was ""Scream"", and...it's alright. Maybe I'd enjoy it more if I saw all these ""slasher"" horror films that this one is clearly paying homage to. But I did like it. However, it didn't scare me that much. Sure, it's gory and has plenty of jump scares, but it takes more than 50 gallons of fake blood and false alarm jump scares to get me. I mean, yeah, it's bloody, but in the gore department, I've seen much, MUCH worse. Okay, I've bashed this film enough, what did I like about it? Well, it was really good at keeping me guessing. I already knew there were two killers, I don't remember how I knew, but I kept guessing on who they were. When you watch it again, you realize they were directly telling you who they were the entire time. But for that first viewing, it's a wonderfully gory version of ""Clue"". So, did I enjoy myself? Yes. Will I watch it every Halloween? Probably not. My recommendation depends on how you feel about horror movies. Want a scary movie this Halloween? Give this one a try. Want something that's not too bloody? This isn't for you.",Scream
444,Tremor,The Slasher Film is Reborn,9,4 June 2000,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along and revives or re-defines a specific genre. Two great examples are ""Die Hard"",which gave the action genre a shot in the arm, and ""FatalAttraction"", which gave new meaning to the term ""psychologicalthriller"". In 1978, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" revived theslasher picture, which was spawned 18 years earlier by AlfredHitchcock's classic 1960 film ""Psycho"". In 1996, 18 years after""Halloween"" scared the hell out of movie audiences, the slashergenre was revived and redefined yet again by Wes Craven's newnightmare flick ""SCREAM"". ""Scream"" tells the story of a rash ofspree killings plaguing the suburban California town ofWoodsboro. These murders seem to be connected to teenager SydneyPrescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother Maureen was brutallyslain exactly one year earlier. The film opens with a tour-de-force performance by Drew Barrymore, who has the JanetLeigh role from ""Psycho"" (first identifiable character who iskilled off early on in the story). Barrymore is terrorized viatelephone (borrowing from such horror classics as ""When AStranger Calls"" and ""Black Christmas"") by an assailant wearing ablack cloak and eerie ""Ghostface"" mask. After this harrowingopening sequence, the fun begins again as the people in Sydney'sorbit become either suspects and/or victims. These characters(superbly written by Kevin Williamson) include: bitchy,ambitious journalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, in a knockoutperformance); Sydney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) and herditsy policeman brother Dewey (David Arquette, Cox's on-screenand off-screen paramour); Sydney's boyfriend Billy Loomis(played by Skeet Ulrich, a dead ringer for actor Johnny Depp,who starred in Craven's 1984 classic ""A Nightmare On ElmStreet"". Ulrich broods much like Depp, and his character's nameis an obvious reference to the characters in ""Psycho"" and""Halloween"" played by John Gavin and Donald Pleasence); Billy'sgoofy buddy Stu (Matthew Lillard); and horror film buff Randy(Jamie Kennedy). The script includes rich characterizations (theactors are all in top form as directed by the brilliant Craven),several plot twists (you'll change your mind a dozen timesbefore you guess the identity of the killer), references toother horror films, and an audacious sense of humor. ""Scream"",like ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween"" spawned a countless number ofclones and imitations in the wake of its success. A must-see forfans of this genre. My score: 9 out of 10.",Scream

It is not scary, and does not strike me as a good horror movie, overrated.",Scream
449,ian_bell,Great opening . . . then I fell asleep,3,20 April 2010,"Amazing. I honestly don't know how Wes Craven does it. He takes another genuinely interesting premise and absolutely slaughters it on screen - and I'm not referring to the body count here.The opening ten minutes are admittedly great. Drew Barrymore reaching for the phone, only to find herself in conversation with a stalker is inspired. What a pity then about the rest of the film.Back in the mists of time when horror movies used to scare people - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Psycho - Scream would probably have passed without notice. But since The Evil Dead, it seems you don't have to scare people anymore, you simply have to amuse them.Quite honestly, I don't care about Jason's mum, nor about Jason, nor about who was hiding behind the curtain with a machete in their hand and wearing a stocking over their head halfway through Prom Night III.The genre of horror lost its teeth some time ago. Just occasionally a modern day classic will rear its head. If you want to see real true horror, watch Wolf Creek from about 2005.For those of a less demanding taste watch this drivel, masquerading as a horror film and stuffed full of characters straight out of any number of American sitcoms. Which brings me back to my earlier point: how does Wes Craven manage to slaughter so many genuinely good ideas?I recently saw his New Nightmare aka Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7, and it was virtually identical to Scream. The same sets, the same characters, the same supposed shocks you can see coming from a mile off. The only difference of course was in place of the tiresome Freddy, we have some tiresome bloke in a mask waving a fake knife.Fake just about sums it up.",Scream
450,PhillipMichaelH,A horror triumph that is also the last best ever in the genre.,10,17 March 2012,"Released in 1996, at a time when it seemed like horror and slasher movies were beginning to fade, this superb little gem of a film was released to an unexpected public who had lost interest in the genre. It had seemed that the slasher genre was dead because of a tired release of sequels from Friday The 13th, which did nothing but make the same film over again. I've always liked the Halloween sequels but even they were not making money. Along comes this hip screenwriter named Kevin Williamson. The same cliché in up and coming screenwriters was apparent here, he was struggling, didn't have money and living off of nothing but he always loved horror movies and was able to come up with his own concept for a script that would become his ultimate masterwork.Then comes in Wes Craven, who was already a horror legend that at the time, it seemed like he could have gone in any direction he wanted to as a director, he even rejected the script at first, claiming that he shouldn't go down that road again. After noticing what a huge impact he had made with fans over the years and coming to see that he could do no wrong at coming back with another horror powerhouse, he decided, why not? Diminsion Films loved the script from the beginning and always had Wes in mind and now they had him on board, a great script and a director who is a genius at what he does, now all they needed was a cast that could make the story's movie within a movie concept believable. This time though and was unknown in the genre, the producers chose well known actors and hot up and coming talent to portray the characters in this quirky horror opus. Neve Campbell had already received recognition for the hit television drama Party Of Five and was the right choice to play the lead heroin Sydney Prescott. Then you had Courtney Cox from another popular show at the time Friends, had the right amount of personality to play Gale Weathers. The rest of the cast included the always lovely Drew Barrymore. To play a character that is killed off in the first scene, instead of casting some unknown, which is what you usually do especially to a character who is the victim, you had one of the biggest young actresses in the world, Wes even stated that he wasn't sure if the audience would ever forgive them but because Barrymore is so memorable in what is already a well crafted set up to the film, the audience loved it.The shooting of the film seemed like a fun one when you watch the behind the scenes footage, Wes seems relaxed and confident and the cast is charming and excited to be a part of the production. Post production had a few problems, to get an R rating, a few gore effects had to be cut down to where you see less which I would say is the only flaw to the film but only the MPAA is to blame for that.Released in December of 1996, the film had a decent run but after only a few weeks, it was the most talked about film. It was clear that this was a horror triumph and one that surely had an effect on younger audiences that they began to show interest in the genre again. Because of its smart concept and witty satire, the film was something special I think that it could not have been pulled off effectively again, so in that context, I think this may be the last great horror film. Of course, this is open for debate and I have seen a few decent horror films since the release of Scream but none as believable or intelligent. Urban Legend (1998) tried to be Scream and I thought that movie was good by the way but wasn't as successful. Over the years we have had a tired release of remakes and few films have paved the way for horror, although I thought that the 2002 film The Ring was the most interesting American horror movie I had seen since Scream but still not the best. The most well done horror films are coming from foreign countries right now that it seems that American horror is dead again but we can only hope that someone will come along and bring something new and fresh to the genre but because Scream did such a unique way at breaking rules and coming up with new ones, I will say it's the last great American horror film. Still, I really enjoyed the sequels, even the 2011 release of Scream 4. I also thought Halloween: H20 was one of the best sequels I had seen in slasher movies, even if it was in a way a response to Scream's success.Good luck to up and coming directors and screenwriters, let's hope that the one with the interesting take on horror gets the attention of studio heads and producers and also becomes the next horror classic, we desperately need it.",Scream
451,moviedude-72,A highly entreating and intelligent teenage slasher,9,31 August 2006,"PLOT: A psychopathic serial killer is stalking a group of teenagers in a quite and peaceful American town, just like in the movies, first threatening them with scary phone calls.John Carpenter's 1978 classic 'Halloween' is responsible for Scream, and before you watch Scream you're probably going to wonder whether this is another one of those unoriginal Halloween knock-offs with over the top gore. Well, I must let you know that it is far from that. Scream is a 1990s style teenage slasher movie with just enough tongue-in-cheek understanding of its own silliness to make it gruesomely fun without being insulting or boring and full of nonsense. It's a hip, stylish and expertly filmed, original slasher.Directed by Wes Craven, king of teenage horror (e.g. A Nightmare on Elm Street) has delivered a winner. He has managed to make a movie that is both genuine scary movie and arch parody of scary movies. It's the film's very self-awareness that makes it different from all the rest. Instead of following the time-honored horror rules that it so carefully details, it leads them - the virgin is immune from death, we are told, but what if she gives it up? Well, you can guess the rest. Craven also owes a great deal to Kevin Williamson's first-rate script, a witty and smart piece of horror comedy that makes him worthy of the career he gained after this.The performances are some of the best I've witnessed in a horror film, Neve Campbell (how come we don't see more of this girl?) manages to pull off a tormented, innocent teenager with a lot on her plate. The rest of the cast brings up some memorable performances, especially Rose McGowan who plays Tatum, my favourite character. Among the rest of the cast is Friends actress Courtney Cox, Matthew Lillard, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and how could I forget Drew Barrymore, electrifying cute Scream queen (sadly she dies about 10 minuets into the film).Overall, Scream is a great entertaining movie. However, you must keep in mind that it isn't meant to be taken seriously, as there is nothing too universal or groundbreaking in the film. Despite that, on its own merit it's a classic slasher film. And you can see the films legacy in its dozen of boring imitators (Urban Legend, Valentine and I Know What You Did Last Summer).9.5/10 See It If You Liked: I Know What You Did Last Summer, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Urban Legend.",Scream
452,the rock-17,Great movie to revive the horror genre,10,31 August 1999,"Some people may think this is just another typical slasher flick.  I disagree, and I'm sure lots of people feel the same way.  First off, when ""Scream"" came out in 1996. it started off mild at the box office.  When more and more things were said about this movie, it became better and better and had big success.  After this movie, several teen slasher films came out as copycats of the film.  I am a huge fan of Kevin Williamson as well.  I have seen ""Scream,"" ""Scream 2,"" ""The Faculty,"" ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Halloween H20"" (which he helped with the script but was not credited), ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"" (which, in my opinion, was his worst film), and TV's ""Dawson's Creek,"" but I have stopped watching that because me and Kevin both feel the same way: the show has become too ""mushy.""  He is starting a new tv series called ""Wasteland"" which you can be guaranteed I will tune into. Anyway, back to ""Scream.""  This film was entertaining from start to finish, and the fact that Wes Craven directed it also helped as well.  He is as creative a horror director there ever was.  This was the first well known horror film of the 90's, and it helped revive the genre in a HUGE way.  Its creativeness in the sense that people were having the movies get to their head, and the killers were two of the main characters (don't worry, if you are one of the few people who have not seen this, I won't tell you who they are), was excellent.  This is a great, somewhat classic, horror film that should be in anyone's library.  Also, go see the sequel (it is just as good, if not better) and watch out for when Scream 3 comes out Dec. 10, it is sure to complete the already incredible trilogy in a huge way.  My grade: A",Scream

It was the most satisfying $1.50 I have ever spent on a movie.  I've been watching horror movies since I was very young and the first scene of this movie had me on the edge of my seat and legitimately scared.  The self aware feeling of the movie and the many references to past horror films was a double treat for any horror movie buff. Wes Craven attempted this with the last Nightmare on Elm Street (new Nightmare) and suceeded mildly. For Scream, he honed this wicked sense of comedy and made a ground breaking, unpredictable film.      All the acting performances in this film were leagues above all the movies it is paying homage to.  Campbell was convincingly tortured and confused as Sidney. Ulrich was excellent and subtly creepy as Billy. Courtney Cox makes the best PMS affected, over achieving, self centered reporter I have ever seen.

all the time, the film makes jokes about other horror films.

served more for ...

But, I wasn't hardly scared at all.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's because after living with my parents for the last 15 years, everything else seems a lot tamer.  But like I said with 'Halloween', just because it wasn't scary doesn't mean I didn't like it.  The movie made me laugh more than it made me scream.  It's hilarious but not because it's lame.  It's not lame at all!  It's funny because the movie makes fun out of other slasher films.

From the opening sequence, which hits you, like a well-aimed punch to the gut, right to the end, which leaves you wanting more, this movie is everything you could ever want from its genre.

I though that the move was gonna get a lot more bloody!Well 2 years later, after people talk about all 3 of the Screams, i dicide to watch it, but i started watching it at noon, in the light, not the dark. And I was surprised, it wasn't as bloody as i thought, and before having watched ""Scary Movie"", I knew kinda what was gonna happen!  Well i liked the first Scream, and so i kept the tape playing cause we recored Scream 2 after it.  After i watched both, I really wanted to watch the third, because ""Scream"" is not anything like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""It"", or ""Needful Things"" whihc had a crazy blood scenes to what i saw.  The Scream movies are like Mysteries, with Swearing, and Blood.  They also have Comedy, special in the third one, which they did i little too much.

This film came out at a time when slasher films were beginning to die out and with the success of this film, it was revived once again (sad to say with pathetic copycats). The film is about a serial killer, who loves horror movies, goes on a massive killing spree and is targeting a girl named Sidney Prescott, played by Neve Campbell, whose mother was murdered a year before. The one thing I love about this film is that it is a horror movie, but it has some comedy to it (thanks to Jamie Kennedy and Matthew Lilliard). This movie makes fun of the horror film audience and the rules you need to have to survive a scary movie. But I shouldn't say that because this film is also a good thriller with chills, thrills, and lots of horror movie gore to spare.

I don't understand why Hollywood lets anyone except Kevin Williamson write these scripts. Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legends, and all the other non-Williamson movies have been, in a word, pathetic.  The best part of this movie is how throughout it, they make a complete mockery of horror movies, and yet come up with one of the scariest ones I've seen in a while.  This total self-satirizing style kept me laughing when I wasn't screaming, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.I don't think Wes Craven or Kevin Williamson ""rediscovered"" the teen horror genre.  I don't think it's really a genre worth rediscovering, at least based on the recent flops that have been released.

466,Piper-10,A wicked and helacious ride,9,17 February 1999,"A good deal of horror fails in the reactions of the critical characters in the plot. ""Scream"" suceeds, from the start, with reaction. It isn't enough to scream--you have to MEAN it. Drew Barrymore looks truly shaken as the beginning of the movie hammers her poor psyche. From that moment, one thing was clear:This movie was coming from a place that it knew to be in dire need of reform. That there was any thought given by Kevin Williamson to how atrocious horror movies had become gave me a charge. I realized that the movie was going to play with my expectations, and as a die-hard, horror-movie addict who can't give up on the genre despite myself, I realized I was in for a ride and a half. Perhaps I was lucky to see ""Scream"" at its East Coast debut. The crowd was wonderful, and the feelings were all celebratory, because not one of us had seen a trailer or knew anything about what was to follow. Such a thing complemented the film's attitude of taking you by surprise to dish out something fresh, something new, something that was aware of all the standard pit-falls.The writing was good, yes. Sure. The direction was precise, yes. Sure (save for that one boom shadow and a few quick cuts that don't seem to fit), but what hooked me most were the characters, acted wonderfully by Campbell, Arquette, Kennedy, Lilliard, Ulrich, and Cox. What a group of great people, no? Such memorable characters are a pleasant surprise in light of the usual, cardboard actors a horror movie dishes out. ""Scream"" makes you care about the people dying, even if they're not around very long.Though despite it all, it's the seedy core of the movie that gets me the most: the rape and promiscuity of Sydney's mother as well as the absolutely vicious attack scenes show guts, so to speak. It eliminates a great deal (not all, however), of what I consider the Hollywood Barrier. You know the feeling--that feeling of restraint on the part of the killer. That feeling that the evil It, or evil He, or evil She would LOVE to go further, would LOVE to kill as it is created to do, but can't, because, well, who would want to see that? ""Scream""'s opening sequence goes further than most films would dare, and I greatly admire that.",Scream

What a horror movie to start on. I was shocked and horrified by the amount of blood in this movie. Well, that was back in 1997, and now I've seen almost any horror movie you can think of. Was I only scared by ""Scream"" because it was the first movie I'd seen with so much blood? The answer is no. I've seen this movie at least 40 times, and enjoy it every time. Each time I watch, I discover something new I didn't realize before. I was obviously disappointed that Neve Campbell didn't show it all, but it probably would've been rated NC-17. So that was a good call. Of course Neve didn't go nude in ""Wild Things"" either. She's a rather respectable actress.

This was a frightening, gory movie that also had a bit of comedy mixed in with it. A series of murders occur and all the victims are from Woodsboro High School. The murders are gory and no one is safe. Everyone is a suspect and everyone is in fear. Courteney Cox plays in-your-face reporter Gale Weathers who is always ready to be at the scene and reporting the latest. Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott, an innocent girl whose mother was murdered and raped and now the killer is after her, too! Jamie Kennedy plays Randy Meeks, horror movie expert and comical friend. Rose McGowan plays Tatum Riley, Sidney's best friend who is the sister to Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley. David Arquette plays Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley, a brave deputy who must investigate the tragic events. Matthew Lillard plays Stuart Macher, wacky student at Woodsboro. Drew Barrymore plays innocent Casey Becker who is brutally murdered in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Liev Schreiber plays Cotton Weary, accused killer of Sidney's mother.

475,YT_RealJoshTv,One of the Best!,8,28 March 2020,"I grew up in the 90's and remember the popularity of these scream masks, I had seen some references to scream throughout the years in movies, but had never watched one. I was revising older movies and everyone kept saying ""when scream changed everything"". I had always viewed scream as a dumb fake 90's comedy horror, boy was I wrong.I cannot tell you the treat I had watching this movie after all these years, it's like a horror movie that feels like the quality and fullness of a normal movie. Like I'm watching a blockbuster good horror movie which doesn't happen. I'm so thankfully I didn't know anything about the story and killer as that's most of the fun in these movies, whose the killer.This movie completely opened up my eyes to a different type of horror, I immediately without hesitation watched all the other scream movies after and had a blast. I remember telling myself I wish I could erase what happened from my brain so I can watch them again. I liked them that much.I also watched every movie I could find inspired by scream because I loved this movie so much, highly recommended. If you remember the 90's and haven't seen this movie, you are in for a treat, don't watch any more reviews just go see it!",Scream
476,pkollmeier,Truly Visceral and Disturbing,9,30 January 2018,"I re-watched Scream last night with my girlfriend for the first time in a couple of years. She had just watched Scary Movie the night before with her roommate and had a scary movie in mind for the both of us to watch together. Before viewing, I could tell that she didn't remember much about Scream and the fact that it is actually a scary slasher movie. I couldn't wait to see her reactions.From the onset, the opening scene with Drew Barrymore is still one of the best in horror/film history. It's absolutely terrifying. The music? 10/10. The cinematography? 10/10. Writing? 10/10. Suspense? 10/10. Hitchcock elements? 10/10. It hits on all cylinders and then some. When Barrymore's character is attempting to scream for her parents in front of a tilted, uneasy camera, with the killer right behind her...that is horror movie magic right there. Now, don't get me wrong. Scream is a brutal film. That opening scene could emotionally scar you, especially if you are a young woman in this world. That said, Scream plays on itself and other horror movies throughout, and plays the exact same game that the killer plays with his victims, with its audience. Horror movie tropes are a real thing, just like action movie tropes and romantic comedy tropes and suspenseful film tropes and cliches. The list goes on and on. I always find it funny when people think horror movies are the only films with these scores and scenes that can be predictable for the audience. How about Tom Cruise hanging out of a car door 565 feet in the air with machine guns firing at him, a beautiful woman by his side, and the fate of the world in his hands? Yeah...I think you get my point.What Scream does so well is relish in its self-awareness and then some. As I watched the movie a second and third time, it's so blatantly obvious who the killer is, it's hard to believe I ever thought that was the point of the film in the first place. Yet, there is still a twist. Just like in Pyscho, we know something is off about Norman Bates, yet we don't know the entirety of it. We're just scratching the surface. Now, does Scream have its faults? Sure. I'm not really going to dwell on them. From the tilted camera and quick zooms used in the film, I felt uneasy and slightly off throughout. Wes Craven has a way of making you feel uncomfortable just like he did with Freddy. The killer is a bit clumsy...but when you watch Nightmare on Elm Street, so was Freddy. He knows how to ride that line so well. The last few scenes are also pretty disturbing to watch, but with the music and the strange acting and horror movie games and cliches, it's just bloody fun. So many movies copied Scream that it can be hard to take it serious at times. When I tried to explain to my girlfriend that they are self-aware in their horror movie cliches and rules, she didn't seem to agree with me. ""It's just being a horror movie."" Which is true. It is. But, it's also playing on itself and so many that came before it, and now, so many that came after it. I can't imagine reading the script for Scream (originally titled Scary Movie). It is seal-vacuum tight. I am a firm believer in catching the viewer from the opening scene and with no cuts for the first 10-15 minutes, I was on the edge of my frickin' seat! Isn't that the joy in seeing a movie in the first place? I can't imagine seeing this in theaters and I hope it is re-released soon. It would be worth a visit to see on the big screen.",Scream
477,jacobhenrytucker-1,Absolutely World-Class,10,3 March 2007,"I first saw the preview of Scream, the only reason why I wanted to see it was because of Drew Barrymore. I then found out it also starred Courtney Cox, I was a big fan of her from Friends but it still gave me no reason to watch it. I only wanted to see it because Drew Barrymore.By the end of watching the film, I was amazed. It was probably the best horror movie since Halloween. The plot is great, the acting is great. David Arquette is the lead part who in my opinion does a great job in doing so. Courtney Cox was not the main character but was in it for most of the film. If they ever made such a thing as the Horror Film Awards, Courtney Cox would probably win Best Supporting Actress.It's also a refreshing movie because it broke away from all other horror movies. Now adays, movies like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"" are always the same storyline. People enter a haunted house and they all get killed, yes they're good movies but the plot is always the same thing and what Scream did was made a different storyline which is fantastic and I thing that's what made it great.The cast is also young and hip. I'm sick and tired of seeing people in their 30s and 40s dominating the horror screen. I mean before Scream, they never made a horror movie with teens in! Overall an excellent movie and I strongly recommend it.",Scream
478,Gen S2rt,"""Scream"" defines horror films of its generation",10,28 December 1998,"""Scream"" is a film that did for horror films what ""Star Wars"" did for science fiction: it re-awakened the horror genre.  In the 1970's, when horror films stopped being made well, people stopped taking horror films seriously for the most part.  Predictable slasher films generated fairly strong followings, such as the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" films. When that general string of films died out in the late 80's, these films were still watched, mostly when people wanted a good laugh, the way people watch ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (Most commonly believed to be the worst movie ever made.)  Now, in the late '90's, with the advantages of modern special effects and blood that doesn't have the texture of Kool-Aid, horror movies are being taken seriously, and are being well-made instead of just pumped out every five minutes, and ""Scream"" is the one movie that started this up.  Writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven do brilliant jobs of making the film interesting, even BETWEEN death scenes, a concept that completely escaped the makers of the '70's and '80's slasher flicks, which went no further than scenes of sexuality in those cases.  One element that made ""Scream"" so brilliant was the strategy the filmmakers used to get around the standard-cliched-situation problem.  Instead of trying to disguise the fact that a certain scene had been done numerous times before in countless horror movies and was predictable for anyone who has seen any of them, they took another approach.  They explained these cliches used in older horror movies before or while they were supposedly happening, making the scene funny when you hear about how lame they are, and scary when you realize they are actually happening to the characters.  Although the movie was good all the way through, the best part of the movie is the opening scene, especially the first time watching it.  This is because it starts out with a seemingly harmless phone call from a seemingly harmless person which lasts long enough for you to get the feeling of tranquility, until the voice on the other line says something you didn't expect, and catches you, as well as the person he's talking to, completely off guard, and the only reason you don't wonder if you heard correctly is the fact that you know you're watching a horror movie.  Although that line was in the trailer I had seen many times before seeing this film, I still got the chills when it came. The ""slasher flick"" idea is also combined with the idea of standard mystery movies, which is that everybody's a suspect.  This really goes well with the slasher idea, and I believe this is the first ever film that has these two ideas paired together.  Other films, of course, followed using this same idea, such as ""Urban Legend"" (1998), but just know that ""Scream"" was the first.  There is also very good acting in the film, and the main characters all have very distinct personalities which are portrayed very nicely by the individual actors.  My personal favorite is teenage film expert Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), probably because he was so much like me it's freaky.  Neve Campbell does an excellent performance in the leading role of Sydney Prescott, the primary target of the killer.  Other very notable performances include over-the-top Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard), dweeby Deputy ""Dewey"" Riley (David Arquette), obnoxious reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), and token main suspect Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich).  No matter what you think will happen next and who you think will eventually turn out to be the killer, there is always one more surprise waiting, and a definitely unpredictable ending.  Scream makes a great film to watch alone in the dark, or in the broad daylight if you are the kind who just can't handle it.  A must-see for horror fans.",Scream

481,paulnm96,"""What's your favorite scary movie?""",9,27 May 2011,"'Scream' is a scary movie however the light-heart attitude of this movie makes it quite funny also.The story begins with a phone call and ends with a blood bath in true horror style. A young teenager Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) gets a mysterious phone call and the caller asks a series of questions most famously ""What's your favorite scary movie?"" he terrorizes her for a good ten minutes and probably the most terrifying scene in this movie he finally kills her while wearing the famous ghost-face costume.The story jumps between horror and comedy, for most of the movie the viewer's heart is racing and for the rest they are roaring laughing. Much of the comedy is provided by the stupidity of Dewey Riley (David Arquette) the always lovable character.Much of this movie revolves around one character Sidney Prescott (Neve Cambell) and the grief she suffered since her mother was murdered and she a witness. An inpatient boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) seems a suspect of the Woodsboro murders as does many others even Sidney's father (Laurence Hecht) and her friends as well.I think it is safe to say Wes Craven has done it again in creating 'Scream' it is well recommended on seeing especially at night.

Scream is both a homage to the 70's slasher films and a reinvention. It's 25 years old now so I guess I'm not including spoilers here, but when you watch it now it's s obvious who the killer/killers were. I don't see that as bad writing though. It's clever, because it's like a double bluff... so obvious it can't be. Then wham, yes it is. I'm not naive, the biggest thing Scream had going for it was there hadn't been a movie like this for a good 10 years and we all love a good jump scare at the movies.

This in turn, actually makes it a little funny. The counterpart Scary Movie, is very similar and just as ""scary"". This is not scary, just rather telling of the ""airhead teen cast"".

488,so_original,"""What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?"" Scream.",8,21 May 2008,"""Scream"" remains one of the smartest and most entertaining teen slasher films ever. Why? Well, of course there's the actors. Neve Campbell definitely gives Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money as the Reigning Teem Scream Queen. She makes the lead character, Sidney Prescott, all at once strong, smart, and vulnerable. Besides Sidney, there's ruthless and ambitious reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox); dopey but lovable cop Dewey (David Arquette); Sidney's feisty and funny best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan); Sidney's brooding boyfriend Billy and his wisecracking friend Stu (Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard); and movie-obsessed geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy). All the characters are distinctive and well-acted, and it really is an ensemble film.However, it is the writing by Kevin Williamson that makes ""Scream"" truly special. As Billy states to Sidney at one point, ""It's all one big movie. You just can't pick your genre"". The film stays true to this quote. Unlike other slasher films full of clueless teens, the characters in ""Scream"" know they're in a movie. And if they don't, they sure do know a lot about them. The script contains several humorous, pop culture references to movies (many of them being horror films). The film takes pleasure in poking fun and deconstructing many horror movie standards and clichés. ""Scream"" is still a horror movie itself and often implies a few of these so-called rules. But they are often done in an ironic and inventive way. The death scenes are creative, the characters are actually smart and know how to fight back, and the plot twists are effectively surprising. Actually, it would be safe to say that ""Scream"" is not so much of a horror movie, but a mystery movie with blood and violence. Unlike Freddy, Michael, and Jason, the killer is never given an identity until the climax of the film. ""Everyone is a suspect!"" Randy proclaims. At different points in the movie, every character does come under questioning. Is it Billy, Sid's dark and angst-ridden boyfriend? Did Randy see one too many movies and snap? Or is Gale doing all of this to get another story? Anything can happen, and the final reveal is very unexpected.""Scream"" is amazingly entertaining and suspenseful on the first viewing. And the great thing is it remains fresh and continues to keep you on your seat every time you watch it. Afterwards, many teen slasher copycats like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Urban Legends"" were made, and two more films in the ""Scream"" series, but none of them are like the original ""Scream"".",Scream

This film has all the great elements for a successful scary movie, it has some funny moments mixed with some tense and scary scenes giving the audience a clash of laughing and the jumping or feeling uneasy. It's a great fun ride that is extremely cleaver, what makes this film unique is that it's self aware of itself and over horror films. The characters are aware that there are other horror films out there and they know of the clichés and rules that those films follow and so this makes for a great fun device for the characters to use. The movie does a brilliant job of playing with audience's expectations of horror films keeping them on edge when they're expecting the killer to jump out and when he doesn't it shakes the audience and keeps them guessing about what will happen next. This film is genius and puts shame on it's sequels ( i haven't seen Scream 4 yet) I could go on and on about this film but if i did no one would read it. It has a fantastic feel about with a very strong 90s feel but that's what the scream films are about, their about a statement of a generation at the time it's set (which is what Scream 4 looks to follow).

However this is one of the appeals of the movie - it doesn't take itself seriously. Of course it also has it's creepy side and for me it contains several of the most terrifying slasher scenes of all time. It has elements of all the slasher movies that went before it but it takes these ideas further or improves on them making it original in it's own right.

491,Cajmere,Scream vs Halloween vs Prom Night,10,18 October 1998,"Before Kevin Williamson came along I was avoiding horror movies like the plague because of the lack of originality the later 80's slasher movies had, i.e. Nightmare on Elm St. 2-4, and Halloween 3-6.  The whole genre was becoming tired and over-used.  Kevin's 'Scream' was what the genre really needed.  I think that Williamson's clever add-ons from 'Halloween' and 'Prom Night' are delightfully on-point, i.e. remember when young Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) tells Tommy and Lendsey to go to the McCensey's and call the police because of the killer, now, remember Cassey Becker's father tell her mother to go to the McCensey's to call the police because someone has killed their daughter. And remember when Tatum gets stuck in the garage while trying to flee from the killer, remember the girl in 'Halloween' trying to climb out of the window from the washroom and she gets stuck. Oh, and remember the principal Mr. Himbry expelling the kids and remember the Mr. Himbry from 'Prom Night' (also starring Jamie Lee Curtis) expelling kids from his school.  In a nutshell, the humor is very hidden with in the plot of 'Scream' and Kevin Williamson did a great job writing this movie.

I was in a good mood while leaving the theatre, having been very entertained throughout the film. The events in the film actually managed to surprise me, and when the killer/killers was/were unmasked, it was proven to me that my guesses were completely off track. I did not however think that it was a masterpiece, for one reason mainly. The point of a horror film is to be scary, and this one wasn't. I have three criterias for a great horror film, and for it to be okay it has to pass atleast one, they are: Scary, Exciting and Entertaining. I found the film to be highly entertaining, somewhat exciting in places, but not scary. But two out of three ain't bad. The actors are okay, the cinematography is slick and good, so's the editing, but the music, AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! It's utter and total crap! CRAP!!! Okay, now that that's out of my system, perhaps I can continue with some more thoughts on the film. A lot of people say that the film owes a lot to ""Halloween"", which may be a valid point, but the film this one mainly reminds me of is ""Black Christmas"", just think about it, the phone calls, the hiding places and all.

494,VivaLaGloria18,A true old school slasher homage,9,3 April 2009,"In the late 80s slasher died. It was slow and sorrowful death. The fans remained and the audience stayed true long after its passing. All that was left was the memory and sequels to past corner stones (Halloween, Nightmare on elm street, Friday the 13th). And then 1996 ""Scream"" came and breathed new life into the genre giving birth to one the greatest entry's and series in the genre.Scream may be called a spoof but its more a homage. Pulling together the original elements (masked killer, teens being stalked, the killer using a hunting knife, and a twist in the end). But it is not a spoof. Its not making fun of the genre its paying well due respect.The only difference is in Scream slashers exist and are consistently mentioned. A masked killer is recreating the films and the teens know it. But of course the practical police would rather play cat and mouse then sit through ""Prom Night"" which as Randy mentioned might have helped them out more then any silly lead would.The idea is itself is creative. Instead of just doing a imitation that takes itself to seriously *cough* I know what you did last summer *cough* it makes it fun. Pokes are made at slashers on occasion but are mostly in good fun and are not insulting. It has a good balance of fun and serious such as when the killer is finally killed someone says (I won't disclose who so its not spoiled) ""Now this is the part where the supposedly dead killer comes back for one last scare"" and then yes thats just what happens. And of course you laugh and say to yourself ""Of course!"" but despite its comical moments it has a nerve racking tone that puts it in its genre.The characters are as well a big part of the film's quality and they don't necessarily fallow the character stereotypes of slashers. We have Sidney Presscot, our main girl who will of course live in the end, She's strong, likable and just so happens to be the main target, We have Tatum Riley the silly best friend who you actually grow attached to and hope lives, The boyfriend Billy Loomis a smooth character who is suspect number 1, Billy's best friend and Tatum's boyfriend Stu Macher is a typical goof ball type but not the only comic relief, Randy Meeks is our slasher buff other comic relief character, Deputy Dewey Riley Tatum's older brother is a slightly slow but extremely lovable guy, And Gale Weathers is a very annoying, pretentious news reporter who wants to get the big scoop on the woodsboro murder spree and even pretends at first to like Dewey to get inside info and even though she is annoying at first she proves useful and I must admit you grow to like her. The character development is on a really personal level. You grow attached and really get to know the characters. Its hard to pin point the killer because you like them all. Even the first victim Casey Becker you feel for. In her 10 minute scene you get a real sense of her personality. The acting is more real and not silly. No outlandish screaming and the actors just look like scared senseless people. This movie is my personal all time favorite and a must see for any horror buff. If you're like me and are an obsessive slasher fan you'll get a kick out of the references and nods to all the classic slasher greats!",Scream
495,Tha_rick-me,Do you like scary movies?,9,14 July 2008,"Scream is the best horror of the 90's, absolutely. It's a great, on purpose predictable movie with great actors. It's really a typical slasher movie, with a typical psychopatic killer and typical teen victims. The differences made between other slashers, like ""I Know what you did Last Summer"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and all their sequels, is that the victims KNOW what they must do to survive a horror, they KNOW what they mustn't do/say/feel, but even THEN get slaughtered.I think this movie is both a great comedy and horror, it's not a horror which gives you nightmares, but it shocks you out of your chair sometimes. I give it 10 stars for the comedy and 10 for the horror!",Scream

The plot is so smart, stylish and creepy as hell. Although the characters that you love get killed off in this series you know you wanted them to go at the same time. This suspenseful series just gets worse and worse though. Im not saying any of the movies are bad they just don't beat the original. Kevin Williamson has never let me down. In Scream,Scream2, and I know what you did last summer you can tell how skilled Kevin is. Besides John Carpenter and Stephen King I think Wes and Williamson are the best team out there for horror films.",Scream

It has a great script, great characters, great atmosphere, and what every great horror film needs, plot twists.

498,zdh952,The rebirth of horror,9,10 November 2013,"I know a lot of people are going to read the title of this review and scoff, but hear me out. Every generation has a movie that defines horror. My generation had Saw and the birth of torture porn, the 80s had Jason and Michael, and the 90s had Scream and the ""smart"" horror movie. To understand how important this movie is think about where horror was in 96. Jason has visited New York, then we sent him to hell. Freddy had a daughter, and Michael was the product of Druid cults. Sweet God WHAT HAPPENED? Horror was in the toilet and all the ""heroes"" were dead. The second stringer's weren't much better. Hellraiser was on his way to DVD and Leprechaun was... well that was something else. This came out with smart, self aware characters, strong writing and known actors who could convey terror. And these 3 things were copied for a decade. Those simple things made this movie a success and the money it made revitalized horror. The scares are good, the tension is good, the ending (I think) is good. Also, it STILL has one of the best opening scenes in a horror movie to date. Saw it when i was 12, and funny enough, before I saw the movies it mocks/loves. It got me hooked on horror and I've seen hundreds of horror movies since because of it. I'm giving it a 9 not because it's the most terrifying horror movie, because it's not. This is no Alien, The Exorcism, Halloween or The Thing. This is a smart, fun, scary movie that kickstarted a dead genre. Wes Craven at his best. Enjoy!!",Scream
499,j-kirby247,The Reason I Got Into Slasher Films...,10,26 March 2012,"Some of the basic story guide spoils some of the movie, but I needed an good intro, and this was as good as I could make it.Basic Story Guide: Spoiler Alert (some of the introducing paragraph spoils certain aspect of the beginning scene, if you wish to remain in the dark, read from ""Enter Sidney Prescott,"") Woodsboro, a town settled far away from the more violent and notorious states of California, such as L.A., or Oakland. But one night, while a teenager is settling down to watch a horror movie, she receives a phone call from an unknown person. At first, its all innocent flirting from both person on the phone and your girl. Until, he begins stalking her, with repeated phone calls. (spoiler, if you wish to remain in the dark, do not read) After an extended amount of time, young Casey, and her boyfriend are both murdered. Enter Sidney Prescott, an average teenager of who is still recovering from the tragic murder of her mother a year prior. The murderer, Cotton Weary has been placed in prison, is awaiting the death sentence. As she begins to put her life back together from this traumatic event, she then receives phone call from an unknown person. Sidney finally realizes she is in the cross hairs of a killer who is relentless, and that she may have placed the wrong person in prison for her mothers murder.Verdict: This movie is my all time favorite. The acting in it is convincing, the plot is throughly engaging, and the characters are absolutely enjoyable. Although I will say this (spoiler alert for a certain event in the movie): by the time the party scene starts up, it's almost like it has out of steam, and then it picks back up, so be prepped for that. But this movie is my all time favorite horror movie for three reasons: 1.) The main character had a back story to her, and the movie had a plot. It wasn't some nihilistic movie like Hostel or something along those lines where someone is standing on a street corner and is abducted by a deranged psychopath, and plunged into violent circumstances.2.) The movie has a balance of both comedy and horror. One moment you are laughing, the next you are jumping in your seat. And the characters themselves are lovable, even the killer. They literally grow on you.3.) This movie breathed life back into the slasher genre, most of the movies were sub-par, but none-the-less, effective and creative. Urban Legends, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Cherry Falls being a few that stick out in my mind.Overall, an awesome movie, and I am grateful for seeing this movie. Thank you Wes Craven for making this historical movie.10 out of 10",Scream
500,nickyjohnp,"""What's your favorite scary movie?""",7,28 October 2017,"Wes Craven bring's back the horror/thriller/slasher and adding the mystery genre to make Scream. The director of A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Hill's Have Eyes 1 and 2, Swamp Thing, and another installment of A Nightmare On Elm Street called New Nightmare. All these before Scream, but the slasher genre wasn't doing so great, but Wes Craven worked his movie magic and with his directing came Scream, a movie about teenager's in a small fictional town called Woodsboro, California, who are being stalked by a mysterious killer, it could be anyone? That's one of the hook's to see this movie another one is the new faces introduced to film: Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Jamie Kennedy and more. Also with familiar faces of Courtney Cox, David Arquette,Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler. This movie bring's the modern day teen's into the world of horror. As with partying and acting like teen's in the 1990's. With the shocking, but obviously reveal of the killer make's the movie clues about the killer actually make sense. Kevin WIlliamson's script make's this movie a cult classic along with Wes Craven's directing. And with Bob and Harvey Weinstein executive producing the movie with their movie production company Dimension Films. And now GhostFace is now part of cinematic history and his famous phone call's before he ""slices and dices"" his victims. Almost 21 year's later it is still very influential with how it's filmmaking.",Scream
501,Straff,This Film Rediscovers A Genre.,10,6 April 2000,"In the 1980s' the horror film genre took off in a big way. Initial films were followed by sequel after sequel after sequel. This ended up making the genre into a laughing stock, the scares weren't scary the acting was at best 'hammy'. To coin a phrase it all went a 'bit pear shaped'. Upon watching Scream for the first time I set my expectations low, this was an error because this is a truly brilliant film, a masterpiece of horror in its own right.Wes Craven uses the tired nature of horror flicks to his advantage throughout this carefully plotted film, with constant jibes and references to inferior slasher flicks of the past.  Both Craven and Williamson have combined to deliver us a well presented and scary movie that is a thrill a minute from the first Hello to the final fright.The plot centres around a teenage girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is being terrorised through phonecalls and attacks of various sorts from a person in a ghost-type costume. As the film carries on many victims succumbe to nasty ends to the killer, who is trying to make a statement until the time comes for his ultimate and essential victim.The location for this film is a quaint little middle-class American town. As usual in Hollywoodland, there only seems to be one type of person in these surroundings and they would be White people. The race card is played again by Hollywoods big bosses which doesn't necessarily let the film down, but does rub me up the wrong way somehow. So for me the film loses some of its high status that I'm building for it.This aside it is a really good film, the best horror for a long while, and streets ahead of the many similar films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty and Urban Legends.This film does put things right for horror films in many ways and sets them back up alongside any other type of film in the world.This film will probably go down as a classic. Leave all other horror films alone  when making your choice, this is the one you will appreciate the most, a thoroughly good, enjoyable, witty, thrilling and scary film. Nuff said.",Scream
502,Straff,The ride of a lifetime.,10,9 March 1999,"This film has it all; action, suspense, adrenalin, a great bunch of actors and one of the most original scripts that the film world has seen in a long time. Scream helped to redefine and re-invent the horror film genre of the nineties and has helped many other great horror films develop since its release. That's what it has and what it's done, but why is it so good??Wes Craven surpassed all that he has done before and brought the element of believeablility to this film, as a result it takes you on a twisting turning ride that makes you feel sick and dizzy but leaves you begging for more.Because of its closeness to reality through its ""it could happen to you tomorrow"" mentality the film grips you in a way that few other films could. Because of its horror theme it makes you intensely intrigued by its nature.It may not be the finest film in the filmmakers sense of the word, but for me it has to be the finest film that I have seen at the cinema this decade, and out of the all time list only takes a slight second place to the magnificant Star Wars trilogy. See this film above all others, trust me.",Scream
503,will51224,Not just my favorite scary movie...,10,24 July 2001,"...it's my favorite movie of all time!  It's so much fun; every time I watch it, I love it even more.  It's extremely clever, hip, funny, and of course, absolutely terrifying!  I remember the first time i saw it.  I was like 10 and it was on Starz! and I couldn't watch the first scene w/o switching the channel.  Actually, it wasn't until i rented it on video a couple years later that i watched the entire movie from beginning to end - simply because I couldn't change the channel!Scream is so original and creative - from Kevin Williamson's fresh, witty script, to Wes Craven's awesome direction.  And of course, the terrific score doesn't hurt, either.  One of the best things about this film is that it has many things that most other horror movies lack, such as a plot (big one!), well-developed characters, and even good acting!
Drew Barrymore shines as Casey Becker.  I mean, if she weren't able to cry so well on cue like she did, that first scene just wouldn't have been as believable as it was, nor would it be one of the most classic scenes in horror movie history, right up there with Psycho's shower scene.  Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott) is a very talented actress as well and makes a great leading lady.  David Arquette is perfect for the role of Dewey.  And who could forget Courtney Cox - she's such a good actress that when I watch Friends, it's hard for me to believe that Monica is the same person who played Gale Weathers!  Jamie Kennedy makes a great movie geek - he's probably my favorite character in the whole trilogy.  Everyone else is great too - Matthew Lillard was hilarious as Stu, Skeet Ulrich made a creepy boyfriend, and Rose McGowan was a cute best friend.  After all, this movie did launch all of their careers!Although Scream is responsible for a lot of crap (bad imitators like Urban Legend, horrible attempts at mixing genres such as Idle Hands, and unnecessary sequels to classics like Halloween: H20 and The Rage: Carrie 2), there's no way any horror movie fan won't like this!  I'm telling you, it's sensational!  10/10",Scream

506,kevin_blaze,This horror flick has killers who kill per horror film conventions.,6,15 January 2002,"Scream is a rarity: a horror movie spoof that succeeds almost as well at provoking scares as laughs. That's because director Wes Craven in addition to having a genuine affection for the genre, understands how wildly improbable and easy to lampoon it is. And, with Scream, he skewers it at every corner, using self-referential humor and a flood of in-jokes (some subtle, some obvious).In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film criticism involves ``deconstruction'' of movie plots. ``Deconstruction'' is an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words nobody can understand. ``Scream'' is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup.But this movie is not just a horror film. The self-referential tone of the movie allows us to step back from the horror. Also, the presence of detectives and inquisitive characters focuses our attention away from fear and toward curiosity. We can stop the killing if we can only unmask the killer.For those who know horror movies, the self-referential tone provides some funny moments when characters point out the ""rules"" of a horror movie, mention director Wes Craven, or comment on what would be happening ""if this were a movie.""And, for those looking for a good scare, Scream is an excellent choice. The mask the killer uses (which appears to be derived from Munch's ""The Scream"") is really quite frightening. The killer is more human than in most horror films, and therefore more terrifying. He is not invisible, but he is only seen in a quick flash. His advantage is not supernatural power - victims can lash out against him and have some effect - his advantage is surprise and fear. The killer's humanity and thus his potential vulnerability makes him all the more frightening, and makes us all the more tense for his next victim.MESSAGE - Horror films may breed copycat killings.Conclusion: This is a modern type of heart-thrilling horror movies and it really does scare you who are not a real fans of horror movies. I rate this movie as a good movie and it is also a good way to thrill the audience. So it realy does had a very strong effects on the thrilling part. I rate it 3,5/5. But for the story of the movie I rate it as a fair story. Great score for a movie like this.",Scream
507,harmisjack,Best Horror Trilogy Ever hands Down,10,16 January 2010,"There are many reasons to why Scream is the best horror trilogy, and movie out of any other Horror slasher film such as Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc.1. Actually has a story, rather than just killing people, and stalking them like in most films.2. Always a different killer in the same costume in each film. Rather than it just being Michael Myers, and Jason in each sequel. Which is why the person who is causing the murders is a mystery.3. New Rules to abide by in order to survive through each film.Scream: 1996 ****/****This movie is the best in so many ways, you will want to watch it over and over if ""Horror"" is your favorite film genre. This film stars: David Arquette, Cortney Cox-Arquette, Matthew Liliard, Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, and Jamie Kennedy. Directed By: Wes CravenWhere to begin. The actors are well casted, the story is brilliant, there are clever scenes, good jokes, and this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat trying to figure out the mystery killer. Plot: Scream is a film about a killer who has watched too many scary movies, and is now making his own real life horror film attacking High School Students from Woodsboro, CA. The target is Sidney Prescott (Campbell). Late one night, she has gotten a phone call by the killer who is able to see everything she is doing, and later tries to make a move to murder her, just like her mother who was killed a year before all these tragic events. Now, who can the killer be? Can it be Billy Loomis (Ulrich), Sidney's boyfriend, Randy Meeks (Kennedy) the geeky film genius, Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette), the quiet sheriff of Woodsboro, Sidney's father, or Stewart Macher (Liliard) the goofy weirdo?I highly recommend this film to all horror fans, and for you to watch the whole trilogy.

508,bigbenjr48,My Love/Hate Relationship With Scream,8,1 January 2005,"I grew up in the 70's and 80's with nothing but cheesy slashers. I hate the snappy and intellectual dialogue that slasher films have these days. ""Scream"" is an example of what I dislike about horror these days. Now don't get me wrong, Scream is refreshingly original. I only have a problem with it being a new ""trend"" that will live on forever and the slasher of yesterday will only be remembered as a passing fad. I hate it that they warn you about the ""Rules you shouldn't break"" or else you will die. How dare they know these rules. I want my teenagers to be dumb as hell and unsuspecting of the horror that lies ahead. I don't want them trying to follow the ""rules"". The teenagers of Scream (and other 90's/05 slashers) are portrayed as ""smarter"" than their 70's-80's counterparts. I want to go back to the days when twelve teenagers didn't realize anything strange was happening until only two of them are left, and the bodies of their girlfriends and buddies start falling out of trees, and out of closets.Scream made me literally scream, even though I still sorta liked it. It's just that I don't want parody-slasher such as Scream becoming the norm.The good times are gone. I'm an old-timer in my 30's. I guess the reason most youngsters are not in pain over this new breed of horror taking over is because there is not much nostalgia for the old. Nothing can compare to growing up in the 70's/80's and seeing the trailer for a Friday The 13th or The Howling or Slumber Party Massacre. I could actually deal with the way they make slashers these days if at least two or three directors would defect from the pack and start making slashers in true 70's/80's fashion. That way the playing field of slasher films would be even, and this new generation of slasher-fans can keep their ""Dawson's Creek"" dialogue and the ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" actors that they love so much, and we fans of old-school slashers can go back to the way a slasher was intended.I long for the unknown actor who has never appeared on a sit-com or TV drama to star in a cheesy horror. A character who would never take notes from previous slasher movies in order to stay alive. I would love to re-visit that dumb blond who rejects the smart nerd for the dumb jock, only to get killed while in the missionary position. The old man with the dirty dog who warns the kids of danger. The Deputy who pays the teens a warning-visit at the beginning of the film but doesn't show up again until the bodies are cold. And finally, the bloody finger that twitches from the corpse with an ax in his back as the paramedics are zipping him up in a body-bag.Those were the good old days.I give Scream an 8/10Yes, I'm sure my rating surprises you. I can't deny that Scream was a good movie. My anger lashes out only at this new trend that Scream has started. I just hope that it hasn't completely destroyed the slasher of old.",Scream

Scream came at when the horror genre was running out of steam .Its witty post modern , self analytical script along with some genuinely great scares topped off with its whodunnit flavour gave the horror genre a kick in the ass and totally revitalised it.Its legacy aside, scream is still a superior slasher film on its own merit , better than many of the films it mentions and parodies.

It is a classical horror film with all the known elements, but mentions and makes fun of the known traits of the horror genere, making it refreshing and also funny. It had a great combination of having a humorous light side while not faling to keep it scary.The acting and character are very expressive, somewhat cartoony, but it fits the style quite well. The story is also intersting, it has a good amount if information withdrawn to keep you wondering while still being straight forward on where your focus should be. At some moments I would have preferred the film being slower to build up tension. The story could also have been more novel.This film is such a classical piece of horror that it becomes the first film I think of when I think of slashers. Fun and scary and a great capture of old horror film vibe makes it one of the safest films to turn on whenever one feels the need to feel fear,.",Scream

512,ScaryBoy,What's YOUR favorite scary movie?,10,16 March 1999,"Oh my God. Words cannot describe how wonderful this movie is. Everything about it is top-notch: the acting is three-dimensional, convincing, and charming; the scares are potent and chilling; the laughs are hilarious and common. Neve Campbell turns in a star-making performance as Sidney Prescott, who is not your typical ""big-breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door""; Sid is a tough cookie, and she faces off against the killer with admirable strength. Likewise her friends are not typically bland oversexed teens who merely exist to be butchered in all sorts of gory ways. Jamie Kennedy plays Randy the film geek, who has one of the largest followings in all of filmdom; the character is an amazing, wonderful creation. Rose McGowan is now more commonly known as Marilyn Manson's better (if not more normal-looking) half, but before that, she was known as Tatum, the perky blond sidekick to Sid with a sassy mouth, a saucy wit, and a bod for sin. Yummy. And Matthew Lillard is maniacally perfect as Stu; his wild eyes, goofy face, and squealy voice make him a memorable addition to the Scream family. Then of course there's Gale and Dewey, played by now real-life sweethearts Courteney Cox and David Arquette; Cox is awesomely bitchy as the backstabbing reporter with a knack for ticking people off, and Arquette is sincere and charming as Gale's total opposite, a small-town deputy with an aw-shucks attitude. But enough about the characters - the in-joke references are great too. Everything from Halloween to The Town that Dreaded Sundown is mentioned and/or made fun of in this film; it's like the end-all, be-all for every horror movie ever made. But the best part is that it is completely scary and completely funny at the same time. What other movie do you know that can do that? Well, other than Scream 2, of course . . .

It's entertaining to watch, and you will enjoy the movie, but it's far from scary. Most of the scenes I found myself laughing or enjoying the lines. The fact that everyone thinks that someone in the killer's outfit is a friend pulling a joke, makes it comic instead of scary.Some scenes are far from realistic, especially when Neve Campbell happens to toss the gun (the only thing to defend herself with!) towards the door opening and guess who happens to be still alive...You never get to wonder who the killer is, coz there's not a clear motive for anyone.

After Sidney is attacked and manages to escape, Sideny's boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) seems to be the prime suspect.

She tells Sidney that it could possibly be the same man that killed her mom one year earlier. But when Billy is proved innocent, a confused and upset Sidney tries to find who really is causing all the past murders and soon to come murders.This film has chills, thrills and laughs.

The first death is very interesting, because they actually take into consideration the physicality of death, albeit very briefly when Barrymore can't speak because her lung is punctured. However, it quickly fades into 'Really?' for me, from the parents being able to hear their daughters moans when the phone is held in an outstretched arm, to the rest of the entire film being completely slapstick and silly.For those who call this move original, it DOES do something most horror movies try to NOT do, which is be fairly fake, flat, and uninteresting. I guess not having watched this in my teen years but really WANTING to have watched it when my older sister saw it with her friends, this movie was hyped up to me, with mental images of red filtered scenes of people falling to their deaths, screaming as they did so, to a much more artful process (must like Kill Bill, actually) than this was.It is mildly entertaining, but not what I generally look for with a movie that is SUPPOSED to be scary.",Scream

521,Ty-12,Good for what it is,6,24 October 2000,"Being a fairly big horror fan I put off seeing this one because I got tired of hearing the ""best scary movie ever"" chant and knew it couldn't live up to the hype. (Although anything with Barrymore, Cox, Arquette and Campbell is in it's self a scary proposition) As a spoof of slasher films it's pretty good at what it does, the acting isn't all that bad believe it or not and Craven, who's not my favorite, did a fairly good job. The tongue in cheek humour was good and I esp. liked the homage it gives to it's forefathers. Some great background music which probably lends itself to giving away the killer. On a scary scale however, it rates up there with ""The Little Mermaid"". Mostly it rehashed all the old slasher modus operandi and if you've seen a Craven film before you can tell when someone is going to get it. No suspense at all and it constantly resorts to the old ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" jump outs for it's frights. Also, it put out too many red herrings about who the actual killer is for my tastes.6/10 (because of some good lines and paying respects to Hitchcock but sadly no Phantasm or Romeros) but if you think this is the end-all-be-all of horror watch a few of the movies this one took from.",Scream

Craven jokes about all the stereotypes typical of the horror / slasher genre, mixing fear and tension with humor and comedy, making the viewer reflect on horror thanks to a perfect and veiled metacinematography. Obviously not everyone is able to appreciate Scream as it also serves a good horror culture, the film is full of quotes to Psycho, The silence of lamb, Halloween, The texas chainsaw massacre and even the Nightmare itself, teasing and celebrating all the horror cinema.",Scream
524,time_2_scream,A COMPLETELY BRILLIANT MOVIE!!,9,15 August 2001,"now if u haven't guessed, i love this movie soo much and the only movie that i love more than this is scream 3. ok so i might be well underaged to be seeing this movie but i know a great movie when i see one. ok the basic plot is that there is a psycho killer who starts killing every1 associated with Sidney Prescott whom he/she is obssessed with.very minor spoiler: now i might as well get rid of the one bad point 1st, now in the garage scene when tatum riley (sid's friend gets well u knowed, couldn't wes craven have made the dummy seem more...well realistic like drew's hanged dummy instead. cause i'm sorry but to me the dummy looked completely fake and plastic or whateva it was made of. there that's all the bad stuff, now for the good points :) well where do i start. ok how about this, scream is funny, very clever what with the movie making lots and lots of references to other horror films and how the whole film sort of explains the rules of a horror film, scary and pretty yucky at times. throughout the movie u keep guessing who the killer is and what's so particularly good about scream is that a person could do this. i mean the killer isn't an unstoppable force and doesn't come back from the dead or anything like that. the acting in this film is absolutely fantastic. courtney cox arquette is soo hateable in this film  as the bitchy reporter gale weathers, which is a completely out of character person that courtney usually plays. i had never seen neve campbell be4 until this movie and now she is like my favourite actress. she is totally believable and likeable in this movie and personally i feel she was the best actor or actress in the whole movie. skeet ulrich, matthew lillard, dave arquette, drew rilley, rose mcgowan and james keendy were also very very good.",Scream
525,Brodie_500,Teen slasher with an edge,9,8 September 2001,"Wes Craven & Kevin Williamson's slasher came as a blessing, but is now unfortunately looked back upon as the movie that opened the floodgates for dozens of undesirable and truly awful cash-ins.It's important, therefore, to look at Scream for what it is, and ignore the imitators (AND the sequels), and judge it as an individual film, free from the influence of what this movie resurrected.There are many things to admire in this film. It stands out from most other slashers by making the film not *just* about the killings. While the murders and nearly-murders are masterly executed with flair, there is significant entertainment to be found elsewhere. It is the satirical humour which gives 'Scream' its edge. 'Scream' is like watching a spoof without it going to ridiculous and unsubtle lengths (a la Scary Movie), but instead taking more thought-out stabs at modern culture and, more than anything else, other horror movies (and indeed itself).On top of the comedy value, slick direction and thrilling set pieces ('thrilling', never terrifying), we have the wholly likeable characters and an ideal cast. Matthew Lillard is great as the repulsive, idiotic Stu, David Arquette is very funny as dim Dewey, and Skeet Ulrich is nicely creepy as the dodgy boyfriend. Neve Campbell has the wettest role, but she excels as scream queen Sidney. However it is Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan's sparky performances that really stand out. A horror movie is not the place to expect Oscar-calibre acting, but Scream couldn't have asked for a better cast, as everyone nails their characters perfectly.I, like many others, have tired of Williamson's self-referential style of writing, and suspect he's a one trick pony, but that's not to say it was a great trick... the first time around.Overall grade: A -",Scream

528,silverfish,An interesting take on the horror genre,7,30 October 2001,"This is a horror film, but also a sort of spoof of horror films.  It plays around with some of the rules and cliches of the genre, whilst avoiding using them.  Whilst in the middle it gets slightly sidetracked, it is a good horror film in its own right, with quite a few scary moments, and some 'false' scares, when we expect something to happen but something else does. There is quite a bit of comedy, but also this film has its fair share of tension.All in all, a film well worth watching.",Scream

530,jhobbs123,Classic,10,26 March 2009,"Scream is one of the greatest movies of all time, even though it didn't have much of a plot. I just enjoy all the laughs and chills you could get watching this movie. This movie is highly entertaining and in my opinion will never get old. It's funny to notice that the MPAA rating consists of strong graphic horror violence and gore when the movie itself isn't really that violent. But, for that time I could see it being one of the most violent movies of its time. It's just cool to see how special effects have changed over time and movies now are so violent that they take away the point of the movie. Scream is a perfect movie when you're in the mood to be entertained. No one needs all the blood and guts that come from movies like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"", even ""Final Destination 3"" was a little too violent. This movie will remain in fame for ever.9/10",Scream
531,clownbaby866,Still scares the sh*t out of me!,7,25 August 2005,"I just watched Scream for maybe the 4th or 5th time, and i still got the chills while watching it. The way it's directed makes you jump all the time when people pop out of nowhere and attack. The suspense and lack of murders in the beginning is great, because it's not simply about blood and gore, it's about keeping the audience on the edge and making shivers go down their spine. I had to watch porno and comedy shows after watching this...that is always a great sign in a horror movie. The fact that i had to watch non-scary shows in order to flush out the frights from Scream shows how effective it really is.Even so, i still had to jog up the basement stairs when i turned off all the lights. And i know it will stay with me when i go to bed in about ten minutes(yes, i am still trying to avoid chills by delaying being alone in the dark)Also, as far as acting goes, there was some good acting in there. Jamie Kennedy was good(well, actually i liked his intelligent, paranoid character, but he played him, so i guess he gets credit for it). Matthew Lillard does a good show taking attention from himself and making it seem like he's not a killer whatsoever. Rose McGowan = Greatest Tits in the world.(Barrymore is good too) And lastly, Skeet Ulrich portrays the psychopathic killer tremendously, even if he couldn't fool me(until he got stabbed).All in all, an awesome movie that delivers exactly what it promises...Wes Craven's Finest.",Scream

535,Pinupguy,The film that restarted it all...,10,1 October 1999,"This film spawned the 90s slasher craze thus being as important as Psycho or Halloween in continuing the serial killer phenomenan. While maybe not as sophisticated as either Psycho or Halloween this film is not a classic horror but a 90s spin on the genre. It is essentially a homage to the 80's horror genre unintentionally spawning an entire new subgenre within horror.Neve Campbell is at the center of the film playing Sidney Prescott who becomes the target of a maniac in a costume. Rose McGowan is her plucky friend who is the only one she truly trusts because everyone else is a suspect, including her own father. The cast brings the script to life with some of the best acting I've seen in a horror. Neve Campbells performance is what you'd expect from your standard (standard being - Jamie Lee Curtis standard)lead heroine, with the rest of the cast also fulfilling expectations, especially Cox (as a bitchy tabloid writer) and Kennedy (horror fan gone wrong) whom surpass them. With several plot twists clever parodies and sharp pop culture references, Scream is way above the usual drivel that occupies the teen slasher genre. It's as good as either Psycho or Halloween and had just as bigger impact as well. Grade - A",Scream

This has everything a person could want from a movie; laughs, scares, drama, action, etc.  The opening fifteen minutes alone leave a person breathless. Because of this movie I have found a new home in horror movies.  They are my favorite to rent and go see.  I used to be utterly frightened by them and now I watch them religiously.

542,Spectator_Consumer,Brings Fun To The Teen Slasher,10,28 August 2005,"Every once in a while a movie breaks the mold and redefines a genre, Scream is one such movie.This isn't going to teach you anything new about life, broaden your horizons, or appeal to those of you looking for such. The movie is titled, ""Scream,"" and if you think you're getting something other than a teen slasher, you're mistaken. This movie doesn't save the planet, it's only there to entertain, which it does better than any other horror film you'll see. No, it isn't the most frightening movie ever made, just the most fun. If you want terrifying slasher, go with the original ""Halloween."" Scream keeps all the tenets of the slasher genre: teens, serial killer on the loose, killer is unknown, killer has a unique look, and all the characters are stereotypes. On a deeper level, the genre is really about the dangers (really sin) of girls losing their virginity before marriage, where the slasher is a metaphor and symbolism abounds. But don't worry, Scream doesn't take itself seriously, it's postmodern fun. Scream stays true to the genre but is able to maintain a comedic element while all the time keeping you in suspense.The cast is a St. Elmo's Fire of the 1990s, and all turn in solid performances. Matthew Lillard's character is particularly memorable and propelled him to many lesser films, but also the excellent indie film from 1998, ""SLC Punk."" Please don't confuse this movie with Scream 2 or Scream 3, both with use the same casts, basically, and prove the first film really was catching lightning in a bottle. Scream 2 and 3 are bad films, sadly.Overall, an important movie in the middle 90s. Big box office hit that contributed to a whole slew of lesser films and parodies. A great time, fun to watch, and expertly put together.",Scream

I hate it when there's just a little bit of gore, this one has more than the others. It is also very, very scary. Who wouldn't of been scared when Barrymore looks up and see's the Ghostface mask? And it wasn't a copy of any other movies, I don't get people who say it was a copycat of Friday the 13th, because it's not! No other movie before Scream was anything like it, and no one can argue with that. The amount of killing is also really good! It's not just like 2 kills like some of the new movies. It also is really hard to guess who it is. There are all these twists that keep you guessing. I recommend this movie to someone who wants gore and scares.",Scream

545,blondeems-452-74374,Still scares me every time!,9,19 August 2012,"I was 12 when I first saw this with two girlfriends when it came out on video, my parents were asleep and we watched it on the sly as we were told it was too scary for us. Well, the opening sequence alone was enough to scare the crap out of us, and we spent the rest of the movie peeking out from under the quilt.And even now, 15 years later, after seeing it numerous times, it's still scary as hell. The first ten minutes would have to go down as the best first ten minutes of any horror movie, ever. I had no idea Drew Barrymore's character was going to die, I thought she was the star (and I've read recently that that was the whole point, Drew was offered the role of Sidney but wanted to play Kasey instead to throw the audience off and have them realise anyone could die). And die she did, in circumstances I can only describe as my worst nightmare. When her parents came home and she was around the side of the house trying to call out to them, I was screaming ""throw the phone at them, throw the PHONE!!!!"". After that we meet Sidney, played very well by Neve Campbell, very believable as the tortured victim who just can't seem to escape the drama. Although I rolled my eyes when she was home alone, getting prank calls, and went out on the front porch after the man on the phone told her he was on...her front porch. And I am still a little bit confused as to why she went to that party at the end, I mean she was attacked in her home, the killer called her friends house, she was attacked again in the school toilets, so she goes to party in the middle of nowhere with one dopey cop as the only protection? Then has sex with the prime suspect. I must admit I didn't guess the killers straight away. I thought it was Billy for awhile, but then when they arrested him halfway in I assumed they wanted you to think it was Billy but it wouldn't be, then he got ""stabbed"" by the killer and I instantly thought it must be Randy, then when Stu said he was going to get a beer and he never returned, I realised it must be him, otherwise he would have seen his girlfriend hanging in the doggy door and raised the alarm. My mother guesses every single killer in every movie. She said Billy and Stu shared ""a look"" at the fountain, a ""look"" in the video store, and a ""look"" when Billy turned up at Stu's party. And when I watched it again, I realised she was right, it was pretty obvious. Overall, a great horror movie, I loved all the sequels including the fourth movie that I saw recently.",Scream

Also, The way they mention other horror films let you know that they are in the same world as you. I think the acting is great. Also, the terror is mixed with comedy! It is a smart movie but only horror fans can really appreciate it! Every little scene is mad scary no matter what. It is a great movie and i would give it a 10. However, to be fair i gave it a 9.",Scream
547,Halloween1247,A Return To Greatness For Slasher Films,9,14 November 2015,"Scream directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, the film that brought slasher films back from the brink.Nearly one year after her mother's murder, Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) is stalked by a man in a ghost mask who is obsessed with horror films.The movie starts off with a high school girl (Drew Barrymore) preparing to watch a scary movie when she receives a phone call from a person who appears to have the wrong number. The call starts off innocent enough, until the man on the phone has kidnapped her boyfriend and tells her that she has to answer horror movie trivia if she wants to live. This man is revealed to be none other than.... another random guy in a mask, who (surprise, surprise) kills her.This may sound like almost all slasher films, but I assure you that there is something different about this film. The Scream series is most well-known for its self-awareness. Since all the classic horror films exist in Scream, the characters makes a lot of references to horror films. A character name Randy (Jaime Kennedy) who works at a video store, only exists to point out all the clichés in horror films for some laughs.Neve Campbell gives the best performance as Sidney. Sidney has been a depressed teen ever since her mother died a year ago and so she is not the most cheerful character around. When her mother was murdered, Sidney got Cotton Weary arrested.Now that a killer is going after her, she is beginning to think she might have made a mistake. The anger and is Campbell's performance gives Sidney an intensity that is good for a final girl archetype. The Scream Series is about Sidney and not the killer, which makes the Scream series unique in that way. Sidney is also smart when it comes to running from Ghostface and uses her brain in the chase scene. Most of the time...Ghostface himself has two different sides to him. Phone Ghostface (Roger Jackson) sounds like a genuinely threating character. However once you see him in action, he is really clumsy. I guess you can't have that great of vision with a mask like that, so not being perfect adds a sense of realism to the film. It is just disappointing when you hear this menacing voice and then there is this guy in a cheap Halloween costume that is just not good at killing. Ghostface wears a black cloak with a hood and a white ghost mask. He also does this really cool knife cleaning trick.The other characters are pretty good. Randy is the best supporting character, being the movie geek of the group and all his movie references really make the movie. Matthew Lillard plays Stu, the goofy class clown and Skeet Ulrich plays Billy Loomis (Sidney Prescott's boyfriend) who seems like he just wants to do it with Sidney. There is also Sidney's close friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) who really is just there so Sidney has someone to talk to.Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) have a romance going on in this film, but it is not explored much until the sequels. Dewey is not very good at his job and does not really protect anyone from the killer. Gale Weathers is a pushy news reporter, who is always trying to get a news story out of Sidney and just comes off as annoying.Craven does a good job imitating Carpenters style, making the ordinary seem sinister and mysterious. This tactic however makes some shots look lazy, like when Sidney is in a car and Ghostface tries to strangle her from the backseat. This shot is exactly the same as the car strangling scene in Halloween, and although some people would call this homage, I think that it is just a rip-off.The music score by Marco Beltrami does its job in making the viewer uneasy and has a mystical quality to it. The score is not nearly as iconic as other horror themes like Halloween or Friday the 13th, but it sound really good.The movie does not have that big of a body count like other slasher films. Only 6 characters die and there roles are very minor, this is because Scream was written to be a trilogy, so only certain characters are expendable. Unfortunately, because of so few kills in the movie, there is a lack of interesting kills. The only kill that is particularly memorable is the garage door kill. The movie ends with a party at Stu's house, and there the killer kills and injures some people. Sidney is chased around a bit, ending with the killer being revealed as Billy AND Stu. It turns out that Sidney's mother had a thing going on with Billy's dad and when Billy's mother found out, she moved away, leaving Billy behind. So Billy and Stu killed Sidney's mother and pinned it on Cotton Weary, and now they are planning on blaming these new murders on Sidney's father. The mess up this plan and get themselves killed, ending the movie.Billy has a pretty simple but good motive, but Stu has no real reason for going along with this plan. It is stated that he dated Drew Barrymore's character, but why would he have killed Sidney's mother in the first place? Or why would he stake out in a bathroom, hoping that Sidney would go in there, when there plan hinged on her death being on the next day? No matter the flaws that this movie has, it is still a great film. It makes the characters self-aware AND still stays true to the slasher genre ( unlike Scary Movie ). It also introduced a new generation to classic horror films, something it still does today. A Must See 9/10",Scream
548,tomferlito,Actually lived up to the hype,9,12 October 2019,"I was skeptical of this movie from the start but it seriously lived up to the hype - especially how it continues to poke fun at the horror genre to this day. It's meta in its commentary on horror tropes, and proves its criticism of the genre to be true by doing the exact opposite of what is expected. It walks the line between predictable and new, generalized and unique. I wish I had seen it in it's time but it still provides a reference for good horror even now.",Scream

I do a lot of studying on serial killers and such, and I can't stand the way that there are so seldom any killers that follow any known psychological profile. So I try to look past that, but I can't like a movie that is supposed to be scary but doesn't scare me. I could easily watch this at one in the morning home alone to use it to fall asleep.

551,Milo Jerome,"This isn't horror, but it certainly is horrible.",3,6 February 1999,"Lame. That's how I sum this up. Facile, dumbed-down to the nth degree. First of all, this isn't a horror movie and neither are the 'classic' 'horror' movies it thinks it's taking the p*** out of. They're teenagers' date movies and with one or two exceptions they aren't scary at all. None of this film's supposedly original spin seemed at all new to me. Why? Because these films have been taking the p*** out of themselves (and their audiences) for decades. 'Scream' is like a slasher-movie version of Trivial Pursuit captured on film. This is the sort of movie applauded by people who think that horror films are beneath them, who couldn't possibly enjoy something that wasn't sufficiently 'postmodern.' They watch films like 'Scream' because critics who should know better called it 'clever,' 'intelligent,' 'witty.' These critics don't get out enough do they? Personally I'd rather watch the decidedly un-postmodern 'Anaconda' fifty times than sit through a trailer for this thing again. And for those of you who think that Wes Craven is suddenly 'postmodern' and sophisticated enough for you to claim to like his movies, remember this is the man who made 'Shocker.'

The ending left me cold and feeling sick.  Perhaps that's what Wes Craven wanted.  To all the people that ""loved"" this movie: you really need to ask yourselves what you loved about it.  You need to think about it very carefully and do some serious soul-searching. Personally, I actually felt violated after watching it.  One of the few movies I've actually regretted watching.  There was simply nothing positive to be gained from it. Moreover, I honestly believe that this is one of the most dangerous and irresponsible movies ever made.  The studio never should have released it. How anyone could ever voluntarily sit through it more than once will be an eternal mystery to me.  The most frightening thing about it was that it was a big hit.I know people will accuse me of ""misunderstanding it"" or other such crap, but let's examine the facts: what this movie is really about is greed, abo ve all else. Wes Craven's sick and horrific fascination with intensely graphic images of human guttings and dismemberment is truly shocking. He tries to sugar-coat it's stench with a little humor mixed it.  He knows that makes it more palatable. He markets this dangerous mixture to impressionable youth, not caring about the consequences.  Not caring that the human mind (especially a young mind) becomes desensitized to violence the more it's exposed to it.  He wants this movie to be ""cool"" and seen over an over. He know he can achieve this by making it extremely violent and horrific. Rebellious youth will flock to it. They do, and he succeeds, not caring who he's harming, as long as he's getting rich. That's practically the definition of evil, if you ask me. To Wes Craven: shame on you!Maybe I'm just some old-fashioned, backwoods moron who's really uncool and beyond all hope... but will somebody please explain to me what's so entertaining about watching young people getting graphically hacked to pieces by a knife-wielding maniac?  Why is this supposed to be funny?  Why is this considered by so many people to be ""cool""? This attitude embodies everything that is wrong with our society.  I'm not a fascist, nor a religious right-wing republican in favor of censorship, but this type of garbage just should NOT be made.  It's as simple as that. No good can possibly come from it.I would never recommend this movie to anyone - even to a mature adult with a strong stomach.  Truly horrible!",Scream
553,yoda-43,"Scream is funny, hip,and scary. What else could you ask for.",10,2 June 1999,"Scream was definitely more than I thought it was going to be. I thought it would be typical slasher movie with the killer who never kills twenty people, and the one person left alive has to come back and destroy the killer in the ten other sequels. I was amazed at how great the script was and hot well it was acted. I felt the screenplay should have won an Oscar for best movie and screenplay. The dialogue in this movie is exactly the same as a what a teenager would say. (I should know because I am one myself.) Because of all the plot twists, you never know the outcome of the film or who the killer is. I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.",Scream

Now i think i know what it was. It's so damn pristine! I mean look at all those fresh-faced teens. They 're so trendy. They 're so hip! So much that you absolutely have to Know What They Did Last Summer (come to think of it where was jennifer love hewitt when they were casting for scream?). They're media fodder. So come on! This is supposed to be a frat horror flick. Where are the losers? Where are the geeks? Where are the jocks? Where are the flunkies? All been replaced by GAP material. But above all where is the gore?

Also, even if you have watched just one horror film in the past, the rules stated in this movie will make perfect sense.Scream is one huge guessing game, and you can almost guarantee your first and second guesses wont be correct. Another great thing about Scream is that it catches you off guard with the comedy it has in between death/chase scenes, and in some cases, comedy during these tense and on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes.Overall, its a complete must see for a slasher/horror fan of any level, as it is a surprisingly brilliant masterpiece of a horror flick.",Scream
562,Showtime31PB,Classic,10,29 March 2004,"Edgy Horror movie...This is the movie some say transformed the horror genre into a phenomenon or a piece of crap...The 90's where an all new low for Horror movies not that many were made and than Horror fan freak Kevin Williamson wrote ""SCREAM"" the movie started out slow at the box office and than became a huge hit and weeks went on it got bigger and bigger. Scream is about a group of teens that are being stalked by a killer and not one person has a clue who is behind all this madness. I think Scream is a very entertaining horror movie its very clever the thing that stands out the most is the outstanding characters this is a solid cast everyone does a great job with the acting and Wes Craven does what Wes Craven does and that is direct great Horror movies.Overall, Scream is a fresh Horror movie so many people dislike it because of what came out after Scream so many lame teen slasher flicks it was never ending, But IMO Scream stands on its own and is a Horror classic.9.5/10",Scream

564,Mr-Brightside,Parody at its apex.,9,20 June 2007,"A movie that so many people, including a reviewer on this very website, fail to properly comprehend or get, and one that I'm sure will be looked upon far more affectionately as the years pass. From beginning to end it's one huge tongue in cheek exploration into the conventions that follow and define the slasher movie genre. Never does it take itself as seriously as many of it's viewers do, and never does it lull you into taking it seriously as a plethora of overt clues (the big star death in the opening scene; the movie geek who predicts everything that happens before it actually does; the fumbling underdog who becomes an unlikely hero; the ridiculously overdrawn murder sequences etc) crop up throughout the film time and again just in case those pretentious little twits among us ever get the urge to place this alongside Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" or something as equally outrageous. The habitual camera winks the script and the performers give and encourage (Particularly the brilliant Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy) are what sets this apart from many other feeble attempts within the genre and this arrogant form of film-making is probably what made many viewers misconstrue just what the film aims to do.Yes, this movie could be considered horror (""slasher"" is the ridiculous term more commonly abused), but to pigeonhole as such is to do one of the 90's greatest parodies/black comedies an immense disservice. If I could hyperbole for a second: not since Shakespeare have comedy and tragedy met in such a dynamic concoction; and rarely has a film captured the imagination of the its viewers so firmly that it's actual premise and concept have been completely ignored and misinterpreted to a point where it has been taken far more seriously than the writers, the director and or the script ever intended it to. That's the beauty of this most wonderful film. So clever it hurts. In fact, it was so good, it still, to this day, continues to be taken seriously. Magnificence personified.",Scream

Not a single dull moment in this flick, just pure fun.",Scream
566,Gizmo386,Pathetic.,1,1 November 1999,"""Scream"" is the most pathetic attempt at creating scares that I have ever scene. It relies on pop-culture and humor rather than scares.

Stay clear of this and rent ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", a true horror movie.",Scream

When I first saw that, I gave a standing ovation and everyone else watching had to yell at me to sit back down again. Scream is a great satire on the horror genre with an intelligent and witty screenplay by Kevin Williamson; low and behold, it also features the first film directed by Wes Craven that doesn't suck.Unfortunately, Kevin Williamson then went on to create Dawson's Creek and subsequently lost all respect I ever had for the man. Not even killing off Drew Barrymore makes up for that atrocity.",Scream

569,wackjumgirl,What is it trying to be?,5,27 May 2000,"After everybody else on the planet had seen this movie, I felt I should give it a try too. My decision came too late and I had to rent it on tape.Well the experience at the theaters would probably have been the same. There were a few parts where I jumped but aside from that, nothing really stood out about this movie.Scream tried to be a mystery in a way since the villain was never revealed to the audience until the very end. In most horror movies, the audience gets a third person perspective that's privy to almost everything. So Scream doesn't do that and therefore, it's a bit like a mystery. But the storyline never gave the audience enough information. When the movie finally reveals the killer, I got the feeling I was cheated since I probably would have been able to figure it out had the movie given more info. The motive the killer gave really sounded tacked on too.Scream also tried to be a horror movie but it got its' thrills through cheap ways (like loud and sudden noises). Nothing about the movie itself was really scary. There was gore, but that's not scary. Scream's stuff doesn't make you spooked from bumps in the night.So Scream isn't a horror movie, and it's not a mystery movie. I think it's more a drama but the vague character development (everything we learned about the main character's past was pretty much from the last 15 mins of the movie in the killer's big ending speech) doesn't qualify it for that. This movie gets low marks in my opinion.",Scream
570,In_tru_der,This one is a real classic,10,26 December 1999,"OK, I watched this movie already six times, and it still scares me off. It's one of the horrorclassics of the 90's, maybe even from all times. The movie is a parody on the many other teen slashers, but you really don't see that. I saw it like a good teen slasher movie, not as a parody on the genre.I rated it 10.Now, what makes this movie so great is the opening scene...Drew Barrymore plays Casey Becker who gets dead pranks from a real psycho. This scene lasts 10 minutes, it starts slow but comes to a great finale which isn't only a gore scene.It's also very difficult to know who the killer is, I didn't know till the end. Many horrorfans (I am too) hate this movie, but I think it's a real classic in the genre. So, give it a try (or another) and terrify yourself. The only sad point on this movie is the sequel: it's just a comedy. So, I have my high hopes fixed on Scream 3",Scream

Honestly, I thought horror was stupid and really did not have any story, just a bunch of people getting killed. Yes, I know that that is stearotyping. Scream is different. I was amazed at Kevin Williamson's masterpiece. It is very intelligent!Scream is about a group of kids that get terrorized by an unknown masked killer. It will keep you guessing who the killer is until the end!After Scream I became a horror movie fanatic!

This really set the score for the teen-slasher genre, and honestly it hasn't been beat to this day, and probably hasn't even came close to being beat.

The fact that it makes tribute to all the great horror films, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, I Spit on Your Grave, Prom Night... I could go on. Needless to say this film is simply amazing, not too gory or fake, and a perfect homage to every horror film out there. The character Randy I can perfectly relate to, and thanks to this film, I know the rules, and if ever I am unfortunately in the state of being attacked, I'll know what not to do.

Wes Craven kept the suspense till the last moment of the movie. There were many scenes in the movie that were really scary and some were totally useless. David Arquette, Rose McGowan and Skeet Ulrich performances were excellent and the first murder was breath taking. There were somethings that are missing from the movie such as Maureen Prescott(Sidney's Mother's) murder and all the cotton weary thing. Overall this movie is great and every one must see this movie. Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers and Matthew Lillard as Stuart were not so good as compared to the other cast especially Drew Barrymore whose part was the best part of the Movie. Above 8/10",Scream
579,Horrorbuff7193,What can I say?: My favorite movie of all time.,10,5 July 2007,"Scream (1996) is one of the biggest, if not the biggest influence to the horror genre. Many people will mark the rating down just because it gave us a really bad decade of 90s teen slashers (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend). Don't blame a movie for that. Blame the producers for making the lame movies.I'm not saying that Scream (1996) is the best movie ever made. What I am saying is that it made a huge influence on the horror genre, and I find it one of those movies that I never get tired of. It was one of my childhood favorites, and I always have a hard time getting rid of those.The movie starts out with one of the strongest scenes in horror film history. I don't want to spoil anything, but that scene is something I can watch over and over again. It truly still scares me. The rest of the movie is the same way.Scream also launched the careers of a group of young stars that we probably wouldn't have today if it weren't for this movie.

Under the first scene with Drew Barrymore being stalked via the phone and she cried, I had my finger up in my nose.The kills are nothing much and predictable (since almost everyone is stabbed to death), and when finally that was a creative kill (the garage), I still had my finger up in my nose.Basically, this movie is boring and long from scary.

583,hessianmercenary,A milestone in its genre.,10,4 September 2000,"No doubt, Scream, a splendid work of Wes Craven- Kevin Williamson cooperation, was really a milestone in its genre both owing to its very original plot and the imitations made after it was released in 1996. Well, you may laugh, but in my opinion, Williamson should have been - at least - a nominee for the Oscar for the best original screenplay that year. I simply admired the plot, and its originality. It rested on the idea that while it made fun of the basic rules of horror films, the events were based upon the same rules! Terrific!.. ( Warning: Spoiler) For instance, while Sydney (Neve Campbell) was talking to the killer on the phone for the first time, she said about scary movies:""...they're all the same.Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can't act and is always running up the stairs when she should be running out of the front door; it's insulting.""  However, when she came up against the ghostface, she tried to run out of the front door but she could not do so because she had just locked it.Consequently, she necessarily ran up the stairs in order to escape from the killer like the""big breasted girl"" she had just mentioned. What fun!! (Spoiler END) Apart from being extremely original, the screenplay was also a brilliant achievement due to the perfect concealment of the killer. ( Major SPOILER!) In the first hour, I highly suspected of Billy and was sure he was the killer. But all my suspicion died down when I saw the ghostface and Billy together in the bedroom in Stu's house. How could I have known that there were two killers indeed?! Besides, the characters were great! I especially loved Gale Weathers, who was ready to do anything in order to do her ""job"", and Randy, the young expert in horror films. (Spoiler END)As for the acting, I think Drew Barrymore was the best although her role was quite short. She acted Casey Becker so impressively that the most scary scene was hers, which was full of suspense and horror. The music was also fine, adding much to our suspense during the pre-murder scenes.In conclusion,this movie was simply a must see one that made the teen slasher movies popular in the late 90s. Actually, it was both Craven's and Williamson's outstanding achievement which made this movie a milestone in its genre.",Scream

It's fun, intriguing, and action packed. It contains twists and turns that you don't expect and definitely has no lack of gore.

587,lynnblake1108,"Ehh...nicely done, but it drags.",7,20 June 2011,"Scream. Now, I must admit I walked into this movie expecting a lot of humor and predictable scenes. For the most part, I got what I expected. From the very beginning, I knew Billy was going to be a key piece in this movie. Once he was so over-zealously stabbed, I knew that from there on out, it was nothing but corn syrup and make believe. As far as humor goes, the allusions to all the classic horror movies and nineties colloquialisms built into the lines made me chuckle out loud. I personally found it hilarious when Gail went to shoot at Billy, and the safety of the gun was on. It was just kind of like ""really? You couldn't check that BEFORE you busted in there? Clearly, you were waiting at the door, ready to seize the perfect opportunity, yetyou didn't think to check if the gun was ready."" It's that type of stupidity that makes this movie worthwhile.The only piece of this movie that really stuck with me is that both Casey and Sydney were both intensely watched by the killers previous to their murders. That's the only thing that actually scares me. I'm not a big fan of ""cheap horror"", you know, jumping out and saying boo. I much prefer psychologically disturbing movies. Before seeing this film, I had only seen one other horror movie, and wouldn't you know that it too, was directed by Wes Craven. The best thing about his movies is his straight-forward decisions. Whether they directly impact the plot or not is irrelevant, it's the mere fact that he took the time to sit down and really concentrate on choices. One thing that really stuck out was the constant popping up of labeled bags and cans of food products. I get it; it's good for funding and whatnot. Howsoever, is it really necessary to having a can of Coke in every scene, or a bag of Ruffles always chilling in the corner? The eyes of the audience are drawn to the products, they aren't just subtly used. It literally looks like they were digitally enhanced to pop out at you. I watched this movie with my two best friends, and one of them is still arguing with me for my obnoxious commentary on this very subject. It bothered me that I'd be trying to focus on a murder, when ""Oh, look! They had Dunkin' Donuts in the 90's!"" No. Wes Craven, you are a genius, but that particular choice (no matter how pro-active you were trying to be) drove me crazy.One thing I didn't like about this movie is that it's sort of an open interpretation. While we know that Billy and Stu are directly involved with the murders, we don't know who specifically kills who. Sometimes, I'm really in the mood to do a little detective work and figure out all the little mysteries along the way. However, in the case of Scream, I really did not feel like going to great strides to decide which psychopath killed who. At the end of the mystery movie, I feel like there shouldn't be room for discussion. A mystery is all about two things; the evidence and the perpetrator. Therefore, I think it's only fair to present the audience with a dry, clear cut ending. At least then they can properly judge the storyline and the way the clues were presented all along.",Scream

Her dramatic squinty face on screen just one too many times. Rose McGowen plays Neve's best friend and she is incredibly hot.As a typical slasher/mystery it had its moments, I wasn't terribly scared at all during the movie. I wouldn't even rate it as a horror film. I would call it a mystery/slasher.Worth watching one time through, after that it loses its charm.",Scream
589,darthgeekhi,Innovative Horror,8,16 October 2016,"The story takes place in a small town called Woodsboro, where the high school stereotypes flow like honey. Everything seems to be going well, until Drew Barrymore and her boyfriend get sliced open by a mysterious killer with a costume from the five-and-dime. In the next 20 minutes, we meet our main characters, who consist of Sidney, the leading lady, Gale, a conceited news reporter, Dewey, a somewhat incompetent police officer, Billy, Sidney's boyfriend, Tatum, Sidney's best friend, Stu, Tatum's boyfriend, and Randy, a film nerd who has a crush on Sidney. The killer action ramps up, and the movie comes to a bloodbath climax. The killers are revealed to be Stu and Billy, Billy wanting revenge for Sidney's mom having an affair with Billy's father, causing Billy's mother to leave. Billy brought Stu as his accomplice on this killing spree. Sidney uses her wits to take out Billy and Stu, and we live happily ever after... at least until the sequel.This movie had what other horror films back in the 90s didn't exactly have, and that was suspense. We were on our 9th Friday the 13th film and our 6th Halloween movie, and we were just getting the same blood and guts we did every other slasher movie. But this film pushed the boundaries of slasher films by taking it's clichés, and bend them like rubber. The plot can be a little confusing sometimes, but the fun kills and twists can make up for that. This is the most fun I've had with a horror movie in a long while. 8/10 stars.",Scream

But the fact that this movie is quite dumb yeah, that's where this movie loses its touch. Like for example, the whole movie starts out with a girl who dies from the scream guy in her home and her parents find her outside hanging by a tree. Like that's how they start the movie, then the other chick I think who is Sydney goes and gets a phone number just like the other chick and a phone number is just a bothering number for real. And there's this annoying news girl who's like half the movie. Remember it's an ""okay"" movie just some parts of it are plain stupid for real I'm not lying. Like at the end of the whole movie you figure out the killer is these two guys and then they die by the news reporter and Sydney.",Scream

My opinion is that true horror films do not use blood and guts alone to make it a block-buster. Take an old Alfred Hitchcock movie, lets say Psycho for an example. Sleek, thrilling, magnificently creepy, a huge twist at the end, and totally controversial for it's time (Even though it spawned a whole bunch of crappy sequels, but hey, what horror movie doesn't?). To me, this was not a true horror film, but a bucket of meaningless blood and gore passing itself off to be horror. But again, this movie might be or some of you fans of ""new age"" horror flicks, but for us fans of the old Hitchcock classics like the Birds and Psycho this movie is not our style.",Scream

Nothing more nothing less!!! People can't just enjoy a good movie for what it is, they like to act like once everyone else say's it's great that it sux........and that's usually not the case..........there's so many people out there that can't admit that movies that most people like .........like Scream and Titanic, were great!!",Scream

In a mystery movie, when everything seems to point to a solution, people tend to believe the solution is the exact opposite. Master Wes Craven and Kevin Willianson seem to know that and many other things about the viewers thoughts, and they play with that perfectly. It's like they're reading your mind. For horror movies, SCREAM is a reference, a whole writing and directing class. A must-see for everyone who claims to understand about cinema. Like that is not enough, SCREAM brings us the great talent of a rising star called Neve Campbell.

That is the ultimate recipe for scary movies.Drew Barrymore's performance is gut-wrenchingly real.  The actors in this movie portray terrified and confused teenagers with endearing realism.

The characters are wonderful- you will probably relate to someone in the movie. There's Sidney Prescott, the seemingly average high school girl, except that her mother was raped and brutally murdered; Randy Meeks, the geeky horror-movie buff and a friend of Sidney; Billy Loomis, Sidney's boyfriend that's kinda creepy; Tatom Riley, Sidney's best friend; Stu Macher, Tatom's boyfriend and friend of Sidney; Dewey Riley, the Deputy of Woodsboro and older brother of Tatom; Gale Weathers, the sneaky self-centered news reporter; Cotton Weary, the guy that's suspected and arrested as the killer of Sidney's mother one year ago; Casey Becker and Steven Orth, two high school seniors from Woodsboro High School. Take all of those characters, a psycotic killer that makes phone calls to most of his victims, some great surprises, a little comedy relief, and a town setting like Woodsboro, and you get one hell of a movie.........

600,bernie369,A very well reinvented parody,7,10 July 2005,"The idea of serial killer who slaughter teenagers is maybe not new, but director Wes Craven has put the film to a whole new level. It' s much more than a normal horror movie, which provoked a huge amount of splatter-movies, which all tried to copy the idea of Scream. But Scream, as I see it, is also a parody of the older movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th which are both even mentioned by name in the movie.The characters and their attributes aren't surprising but advisedly and well chosen. Sidney Prescott (legendary played by Neve Campell), the main protagonist, is the typical young pretty high-school teen. Her obligate best friend (acted by a very cute blonde Rose McGowan) and her nerving older brother, who is additional the ""good cop"" (lovely staffed with David Arquette) can also be found in this movie. Of course the role of the unsuccessful sensation-seeking reporter (Courtney Cox, with a estranging hair-styling) has been established by Wes Craven.When you watch Scream at night and alone it will probably quit frighten you but if you have some friends around you, or you just love to watch horror movies, you will be amused by this ""blood-red"" humor, which is personalized in the character Randy (peak performance of Jamie Kennedy).Scream is definitive a ""must-have seen"" of the nineties. Watch it and scream !!!",Scream

This film is thriller with a overdose of the 'teenybopper' essence, you know what I'm talking about, whose going out with who, he dumped her rubbish.This type of film, and others like it (IKWYDLS, Urban Legend) are defeating the real horror genre.I hope somebody, somewhere understands.",Scream

I had avoided it up 'till then because I had thought it would be just your average slasher movie. I was wrong. It was a failed attempt to parody a slasher movie.Firstly, it didn't frighten me at all. Maybe it's not my kind of horror, but I still jumped in Halloween. There was just no atmosphere in the film, and the attempts at parodying the genre only served to lessen the impact of the film. Not that the jokes were all that funny, unless you were actually paying attention to any of it.The whole motive thing was a severe let-down. I ended up having to ask my friends why they did it because I thought I missed it in all the talking. When they told me I thought 'Wasn't that just an excuse to go around killing some teenagers with no real plot in mind?'I never rate a film awful because they all have something to offer, and Scream does. There are some good moments in it and some smart directing in it, yet its best attribute is probably giving Scary Movie something to make fun out of.",Scream

605,carmackdaddy,Better now than when it came out.,9,19 December 2002,"I've heard a bunch of crap lately about how ""The Ring"" is SOOOO scary. About how it's the first great horror film since ""The Exorcist,"" and how it blows ""Scream"" out of the water. Well, folks, I've seen both films, ""Scream"" many times, and ""The Ring"" twice, and I have to say, ""Scream"" is better. By a longshot. Fans of ""The Ring"" gripe a lot that ""Scream"" was an over-rated teen slasher film. I will give them that. It is over-rated, maybe because when it came out, there had not been a good teen slasher flick since ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" although I'm not really a fan of that title. Also, it seemed cool; it was in that mid-90's cool dialogue trend, where every movie thought it was written and directed by Tarantino or Kevin Smith. So when this thing came out, hey, it was cool. It was cool to see a teen slasher movie MAKE FUN of itself. It was also good to see Wes Craven finally get a good movie, probably his best, and to see Neve Campbell light up the big screen with her radiant smile and perfect ""girl-next-door"" mannerisms. And it was over-rated. Like many other over-rated flicks of the 90s, ""Titanic,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""The English Patient,"" it was forgotten in about 6 months. The sequels didn't help. While they weren't bad, not bad at all really, they sort of insulted the superior tone of the first film by cashing in on a statement AGAINST such actions. And of course, we got ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Valentine,"" ""Urban Legend,"" and dozens of other movies EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE that all pretty much sucked. But I watched this movie again the other day. And you know what? It's better now than when it came out. Like ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween,"" this movie is the best of its particular sub-genre. We're watching the BEST way this type of movie can be made. We saw the sequels. The rip-offs. ""The Ring."" Now we see how much better this movie is than those, and we see it in a whole new light. ""Scream"" is not a great, great movie, no: The story line goes haywire at the end and wayyyy over-the-top. But it's a lot of fun.",Scream

It really keeps you guessing.This movie also did not get all of its fame from famous actors/actresses because most of them in the movie weren't famous then.  The movie actually takes you of course with the help of the actress/actor.I recommend this movie entirely along with Scream 2 and Scream 3.  The whole trilogy is excellent!",Scream
607,deadthevideo,Horror like no other,10,8 October 2008,"Scream is a horror movie like no other. Of the long-standing crop of teen horror movies, this is a real standout as it is a film which, to quote a UK advertising slogan, does what it says on the tin. It makes you scream, as I found when me, my dad and my sister, who love these movies, watched this one. At one point, my sister ran across the room screaming. As for the film itself, Neve Campbell emerges as the star of the show. As Sidney Prescott, she captures the character's sense of fear perfectly. Courteney Cox is also great whereas David Arquette is well, David Arquette. Where Scream succeeds is the way it turns every horror cliché on its head. You know who the killer but you don't know they have an accomplice. The numerous pop culture references are also great including the references to different horror movies - wouldn't it have been ironic for there to be a reference to Miramax's first major feature, The Burning? Anyway, this is a great horror movie which makes you wish that Scream 3 was an afterthought.",Scream
608,sturedman7,the slasher flick that turned the genre upside down,10,4 July 2009,"Easily the greatest slasher film since ""Halloween"", ""Scream"" is the film that bends the rules and breaks them into smithereens, leaving the viewer spellbound and begging for more.Directed by horror master Wes Craven, it tells the story of a killer on the loose in the picturesque town of Woodsboro. The viewer is introduced to some genuinely likable teens, including Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan and the hilarious movie geek Jamie Kennedy. Together they must try to stay alive in this cat and mouse movie of gut-wrenching proportions.The performances are great, (particularly Jamie Kennedy) the soundtrack rocks, and the theory behind the film is genius. (""Cops don't watch enough horror movies, if they watched ""Prom Night"" they'd save time, there's a very simple formula, EVERYBODY'S A SUSPECT!"") Highly recommended to all horror fans, as it truly is a masterpiece.",Scream
609,jacqueline-sherlock,Awesome Slasher Movie!!,8,22 August 2013,"Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up ""Sliced and Diced"" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of ""It's him""....""no no, He's the killer"" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)",Scream

613,horrornerdsdotcom,Self Parody Can Still be Screamingly Scary,8,2 January 2013,"Scream is what happens when you combine the world-weary, cloyingly experienced direction of Wes Craven, and the creative talents of a (then) young and hungry screenwriter, Kevin Williamson. Scream received a lot of ink upon its debut for boldly parodying the genre, turning dialog and plot developments (usually unbearably trite) into something witty and unpredictable.However, Scream achieves greatness whereas many other B-movie horror spoofs fail in their attempted hipness, solely because it manages to remain a disturbing, hurtful movie taking place within the bounds of reality. Despite its comic relief, every scare in Scream still feels real. The film doesn't so much mock itself as it merely suggests that even serial killers can have a sense of humor. The film's black hooded crank caller graduates to movie-icon status, thanks to some wonderful cinematography and editing techniques by Craven, who still knows how to force a jump out of his audience. David Arquette, on the other hand, achieves icon status for his inept character of Dewey Riley and will become the butt of many jokes because of some effective stunt casting. (i.e. ""Scary Movie"")Even if you are sneering by the final plot twist, it's hard to deny that Scream does the unthinkable by making a really funny movie this dark and disturbed.Horror and GoreFairly graphic, at least by Wes Craven standards. Wes Craven seems to particularly enjoy destroying beauty, so don't expect anyone to survive on looks alone. There is a nice balance of bloody goo meets cat-and- mouse thrills, and the killer's ominous voice is perhaps the most violent blow of all. The fact that various characters are self-aware throughout the film, and still scared stiff by their horrific demise, emphasizes the point: just because you're smart, doesn't mean you're smart enough to survive what's coming.How to Watch ItWatch this murderous playground with friends and make sure the lights are on and the phone line is free.

The last time I watched it I was home alone, and I was looking over my shoulder every few minutes because I was so scared.It's well written, with an exceptional cast. The director broke away from the heavy set men who walk to their victims with the suspenseful music every time you see them. The killer actually ran, and he was a normal sized teenager. That, although it made me mad at first, makes me happy now.It truly is a frightening movie. I found myself burying my face in a pillow and plugging my ears a great deal of the time.

616,Blackhawk1989,Overrated and criminally dull,4,29 October 2013,"'Scream' hit theatres in the mid 90's, and alongside 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction', quickly became a shrine for smug Generation X teens to gather around and worship as visionary new icons of cinema. Of course the irony was that all of said films simply thrived on stealing scenes and ideas from older films the creators had dug up on VHS. The difference is that whilst Tarantino and Smith crafted their films as loving tributes to what had been, 'Scream' is content to just pretend to be clever.The set-up is the typical slasher fair, teenagers are getting knocked off one by one and there is a very vague plot about one of them being the killer. What stood out at the time was that occasionally, one of the characters would reference a classic slasher movie, stopping just short of staring into the camera and winking. It's a lousy attempt at being self aware, and does little more than con the audience into believing that what their seeing is a satire rather than a rip off.Our actors are a typical mix of unlikable, drop dead gorgeous teens who make it absolutely impossible to see them as anything other than victims in waiting. There's few with any personality or emotional impact, and shamefully most don't even die in interesting ways.Production wise it's all well and good. Wes Craven knows how to direct a film and there was clearly a budget to this. The problem is that the world feels far too glossy. Even the worst slasher films that crawled out from beneath the 80's felt raw and intense. This film with it's hyper clean look and flawless inhabitants is too fantastical to take as horror. Even the gore is lit in just the right way to show off the actors.Overall it's really just boring. Now that the self aware horror film has been beaten to death, resurrected, and beaten some more the whole fascination with 'Scream' is gone. If you were a teen in the 90's you might find it a bit of gleeful nostalgia, but for Generation Y it's a stale formula with a head-scratchingly large following.",Scream

Scream also manages to make some deaths more than the normal 'stab and the body goes down' kills, with a few imaginative final scenes for characters. An example of this is when Tatum is seemingly going to be stabbed by Ghostface just like the other victims, only for her 'death by garage door'.

The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is terrifying. It is heart pounding with the scenery and the blue of the TV screen giving a eery light to the set. On another high note Drew's blonde wig is fabulous looking and it is a shame that she is killed off so early, but it does catch you off guard, similar to what Janet Leigh did in ""Psycho."" It is suspenseful and filled with exciting chase sequences and clever kills. With the exception of the first scene there is not too much gore which makes this a good movie for people who like suspense but not so much blood. The not yet married Courtney Cox and David Arquette offer comic relief as the lovable Gail and Dewey! Now the down side. The whole movie is supposed to be a tribute to horror films. ""Halloween"" is constantly referenced and Jaime Kennedy's character has an uncomfortable obsession with Jaime Lee Curtis. In the end the charchter's reveals their motives where to be like charchters in the movies. He references some of my favorite horror films such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Carrie,"" ""Psycho,"" and ""Silence of the Lambs."" What is so bad about it is that they overdo it with the movie references. It gets to a point where it actually kills all those other movies for me.

The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer. Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before? Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat? Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect. And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target. Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully. He doesn't spoof any of them. Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling. He occasionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including ""The Ricki Lake Show"". Meanwhile, he adds the occasional teen humor that relates well to that age group. Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films. He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own. He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense. Horror film commemorations include ""Friday, the 13th"", ""Halloween"", ""Carrie"", ""The Exorcist"", and his own ""Nightmare On Elm Street"". Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor ""dressed as"" Freddy Krueger. Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted. Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask. While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality. Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining. They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes. Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from ""Halloween"". Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer. The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling. ""Scream"" begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time. Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first. Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline. This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.",Scream
622,leisalhastings,Lame acting but scary film!,7,6 October 2018,It was corny even for its time but i have to say...the original Scream is really scary to watch even today. It's a gory film and definitely not for the faint hearted but you'll definitely be on the edge of your seat! The ultimate slasher.,Scream

624,Snowman-6,Good fun but not scary,10,19 December 1998,"This is an excellent movie, with plenty of action and comic moments. However, it does lose it's ""scariness"" after the first few minutes - although the point where Drew Barrymore is being chased around the house browned my pants.  Don't watch it if you're squeamish of blood, as this is the goriest movie I've seen. I'd rate it in my top five films ever.",Scream
625,darrens5,Resurgence,10,27 April 1999,"I hadn't seen a horror film for a few years 'till I came across this.My initial reaction was, what a treat it was.The genre was pretty much dead before this, so things obviously had to change. There has been a lot of criticism of this film from the horror enthusiasts due to its somewhat 'user-friendly' style, but I don't see that as a problem.Times have changed now and film making is much more sophisticated than 1978 when the awesome Halloween graced our cinema screens. This was as much a parody of horror films as a horror in its own right, it also doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is......which is a refreshing change. The writing and directing were excellent, and the acting was better than you will find in any other film in this genre in my opinion. There was not any point in the film that I was scared (which was a bit of a disappointment), but then I've seen so many that I don't know if I can be anymore.Also the storyline and whodunnit factor suck you in to the point that you are too busy concentrating on the killers identity and looking for clues to take in the horror.....as my friends have pointed out. There are also a lot of jokes in it that you MIGHT miss if you are not a horror regular......but then you might not. All in all I think that this is a fantastic film whether you look at it as a genuine horror film or a mystery/thriller/suspense type of film, and much more satisfying than the sequel. I just hope that now this has been such a big success that another wave of horror might soon be upon us......you never know, some might even be worth seeing!",Scream
626,ABYSS-5,it's the greatest horror movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,6 June 1999,"Scream it's the most perfect horror movie. The directing is great and the story is great,and Neve is beautifull and she acted very very very very well.but there is a lot of blood.",Scream
627,k3wi,What a film!!!!!!!!! (No spoilers),10,12 November 1999,"It begins with a terrible murder that is now a classic.  Sydney Prescott is a teenager who goes to school with her many friends.  She seems normal but she is not.  Her mother have been murdered and raped one year ago and a killer tries to kill her.  The phones rings and people screams and everybody's a suspect.This movie allows us to discover a new genius: Kevin Williamson.  His script is totally wise and original.  The character are not cliché and stupid, they seems to me realistic and they are great, all of them.  The story itself is extremely good and original.  The ending petrified me with the revelation of the killer.  I thought that all the scenes are extremely good and breath taking.  And a thing that is wonderful is all the movies references in the movie.  I am a horror movies fan since my childhood and I grow up with Nightmare on elm street, Friday the !3 and Halloween and it was a pleasure for me to see that the characters in the film also saw those films.  It was a big fun also to find all the references.  This movie does not take us for dumb teenagers.The interpretations are very good.  Neve Campbell is wonderful and great. Her character is not a dumb girl.  I think that she is one of the best actresses of her generation.  David Arquette is very funny and he is perfect in his role.  When I saw that Courteney Cox was in the film, I was worried because of her last films but she impressed me a lot.  She is one of my favorite actresses.  For the others, they are great too, especially Billy and Stu.  For those who saw the film know why.Wes Craven made most of the film that I watched when I was a little kid. This one is his best I think.  The actors are pretty well directed and everything is good.  I can't wait to see Scream 3.There are a lot of people who blame the film for violence in our society because of his realistic violence.  I think that it doesn't influence badly the teenagers or adults or whatever.  The violent scenes are not funny or light.  The first scene is totally terrible and it does not make me wanted to kill blind girls.  The rest of the film is like that.  Murders are terrible and I think it's a movie that takes it seriously.  Not like Steven Seagle or Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies where murder is as important as dirt on a roof.  Also the movie explain a lot how the American filmmakers do their horror film.  We learn that they make them do drugs and have sex just to kill them.  It's insulting and totally stupid and pathetic.  This is clichés of horror film.  The end explain it very well, the killer also, in a fascinating scene.Well SCREAM is my favorite film of all time.  The not cliché horror film are too rare.  We have to explain Hollywood man that having sex, being black or gay is not a reason to be killed.  It is not good for our generation to be insulted like that.  Scream is not like that and His writer also and that is good news for the teenagers or for others who are bothers by the messages from Hollywood Movies.",Scream

It was scaring most of the time (there's a lot of slashing going on), but humorous just in time not to make you switch to another channel. The end I found actually kind of reassuring, because a murderer with a face is absolutely less scary than one without (I suppose it's the other way around in real life). Looking back, the things in the script that didn't seem to fit while watching fit perfectly once you know who the killer is, so rethinking the film is nice too.A side-show was seeing how cute 'the Fonz' (remember?) still is looking now that he's much older!",Scream

It can't get much better than that. I won't tell you where the movie leads, but I will tell you it was funny, it was thrilling, it was freaky because it wanted to be.

636,kcollis1985,postmodern mainstream horror movie classic,8,20 February 2007,"Scream is a genuine postmodern mainstream horror-movie classic; Scream impressively manages to reward sophisticated viewers whilst offering pleasurable mainstream horror movie fluff. Its neatly balances mainstream appeal, by obeying the fundamental conventions of horror, with sophisticated satire of the genre's clichés and tendency for conservative discourse.When viewed retrospectively, the efforts of successive films in the genre, and the parody of it in the (at best) sporadically charming Scary Movie, may lessen the impact of this film. Nonetheless, this potential criticism itself stands as testament to Scream's influence and its legacy of having reinvigorated and informed what had become a tired and clichéd genre.",Scream

638,kookytree,Passable,8,31 July 2003,"""Scream""'s opening, with Drew Barrymore being toyed then destroyed by the masked killer, is surely now legendary, and indeed the only scary part of the film. The best realised part is Drew being dragged away from her torturously close parents, trying to scream out to them, but not able to. It's actually quite touching. But it all goes downhill from there.Firstly, ""Scream"" isn't scary. It actually works a lot better as a comedy than it does a horror film, as writer Kevin Williamson has a much better affinity with one liners and comedic rants than he does actual horror- but it was right to pitch this film as genuine horror, as otherwise it would have been farcial. Essentially, there are only two death scenes- the opening and the stretched out finale- and so through the rest of the film we are left to concentrate on the characters. This is always risky for a horror film. Luckily, though, the protagonist is generally interesting, and played by a capable actress- Neve Campbell. Her character Sydney faces an interesting and indeed scarier inner conflict than a frankly clumsy killer in a cheesy mask: what if her dead mother, enshrined in her memory, was in fact not the person Sydney would like to pretend she was?With this sort of pseudo-hip flick, cast is everything. Luckily it's not too bad. Courteney Cox is impressive and genuinely funny (in a very non-Monica way) as Satan in lime green heels, Gail Weathers. Rose McGowan plays Sydney's spunky best friend, and while personally I don't seem to enjoy her as an actress or as totty, she shines in this role(particularly in the exchange between her and Sydney just befoe the party, when McGowan's character is in the awkward position of trying to break something painful to a close friend- Sydney's mom was ""maybe a very unhappy woman""). And at least she's a more interesting choice than some bland Sarah Michelle Hewitt flavour of the week.Skeet Ulrich is a little over the top in this, and is frankly just bad at the climax. When he screams the line ""Movies don't create psychos- they just make them more inventive"" you squirm, because he's not the sort of actor who can pull of incandescent. I was surprised to find I enjoyed Mathew Liliard's performance, as normally I can't stand him. He still has this mind numbingly irritating habit of sticking out his tongue like some inane drunken snake from time to time, but his manic, over the top persona suits the role perfectly, and gives personality to the most underwritten of ""the kids"". Jamie Kennedy is excellent as the comedic heart of the film, and gets one of the most sympathetic characters, while David Arquette, as Deputy Dewey, is annoying for any time over a minute, but funny in small doses (""Hello?..."").The plot? Well, while usually in Hollywood teen fodder plot is minimal, there's lots of plot in this- it just doesn't make sense. At all. Why does Liliard's character pretend to kill Ulrich's? It's ridiculous to think the pair would wait a whole year between killings if they're this het up. And so on and so on. But hey, it's a popcorn horror film, no one cares.As for the idea of it being taboo busting or groundbreaking in any sense- I think not. It proclaims that it breaks the horror rules, but it never does. Sydney might technically loose her virginity, but she does so with integrity, love and trust shining in her heart. Figuratively, she's still ""The Virgin"" of the piece, so her survival, despite having had sex, isn't groundbreaking at all, and is utterly predictable. Indeed, ""Scream"" is a lot more conservative than most horror. All the bland/sympathetic characters survive. Cox plays a bitch, but we see her sweet side, so she lives. McGowan's character was too spunky, cynical, and self assured to be guaranteed a sequel card. Keeping HER alive and killing off Randy or Dewey (or both) would have been truly original, but oh well.As for the famed pop culture references- I personally find them jarring. In other pieces of entertainment- for example ""Buffy""- they work, because they used for comedy and not mere name dropping for the sake of it. When Sydney says that her town under curfew is like some other horror film, it's unnecessary and takes you out of the film. Some of the references are witty, though- the Tori Spelling line even got paid off in the sequel (which also has a frightening opening followed by an hour and a half of nothingness).Overall, a good cast, lots of good (and some bad- the constant use of pop-psychology is lazy and grating, and cheapens the only interesting issues) dialogue, and an intruiging protagonist, leads to a so-so film that doesn't entirely work (as either a comedy or horror), but is fairly enjoyable.",Scream

641,paula-sweeney9,My Favourite Film..EVER,10,16 March 2010,"Hey, well i've seen so many films being a film fanatic but for me its got to be my favourite film of all. Horrors are so difficult to make, shown by the failures of so many horror films since and thats largely because Scream set the bar at a whole new level. The story is a who done-it within a idyllic little American town with a past story that has to be unravelled to get to who's responsible. The music is really memorable but it still is the ways in which people get killed that make it such a great horror. The characters are fantastic and although for me Sydney is probably the least charismatic and endearing, mind you her background probably made her that way, the star studded cast gives Scream characters that you feel like you could know. Scream is such a brilliant template for a horror and it has seldom been topped since and despite it being 13yrs old it still has bits in it that get you to flinch. Quality. Definitely doesn't feel as old as it is. Brilliant acting. Great Story and a great script. The greatest horror of all time but for me my favourite film of all tied with its sequel and the trilogy. 10/10",Scream
642,spotlessmind03,Clever Horror Comedy is Craven's Best Work,8,4 January 2011,"Director Wes Craven delivers the best film of his career, based on a rather sly screenplay by Kevin Williamson, and boy did it pay off in 1996! ""Scream"" is the most sophisticated and well crafted work Craven has ever done, in terms of style, performances and, most of all, effective scares. The simple plot capitalizes on media influence to great effect, and the energetic script, not to mention the cast, brings what could have been a routine slasher to life with verve. A young girl (Neve Campbell of ""Wild Things"" and ""Party of Five"") named Sidney Prescott finds herself the main target of a psychotic slasher who appears to his victims wearing a Halloween ghost costume, tormenting them with sadistic phone calls before going in for the kill. Sidney, who has a tragic past involving the murder of her mother just a year before, is forced into a paranoid position of suspicion against everyone in her life. Aided by her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) and bumbling deputy Dewey (David Arquette), Sidney also has to deal with the likes of such shady characters as bitchy reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and affectionate boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich). As her friends are picked off one by one, Sidney realizes the psycho killer in question has been inspired by a long slew of slasher films, and many are mentioned throughout the film.""Scream"" wisely draws upon the rules established by earlier entries in the genre including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"", a clever gimmick to let the audience know that the film itself is aware of its place as a teen oriented horror film, therefore throwing the viewer off guard with a good dose of turning the expected clichés upside down and injecting some real character development, so that we actually care about these kids before they start dying. Self referential humor aside, ""Scream"" still manages to be dreadfully scary, especially the harrowing opening scene in which a young girl receives several calls that she first assumes are from a harmless prankster but gradually begins to realize she's not safe in her own home. The actors are wonderful, especially Neve Campbell as the smarter than average heroine and Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers. You want these people to live and it's all the more thrilling when they come face to face with the killer.Williamson's script is chock full of references to other horror movies and unexpected twists, and Craven is at the top of his game, setting up the scares just right and keeping the mystery of who's behind the mask genuinely hard to solve until the surprise climax.",Scream
643,pburressrules,OK... better than what we have today,6,3 February 2004,"""Scream"" was OK and somewhat scary, considering the fact that every ""Horror"" movie out today is either not worth it or is just ""funny"", not ""scary"".There were some parts in the movie that were sort of stupid... before the party, how does the killer get into the grocery store and watch Sid and Tatum?... without being seen. And when Sid shoots the killer in the very end, right after Randy says he will get up for one last scare... the way he gets up doesn't even look close to him wanting to kill somebody.
The cast was perfect for the parts. Neve was great at playing Sidney.The killer is pretty easy to identify in the middle and at the party in the end. For one thing, after Tatum dies, Billy comes running from the side of the house... the same side the garage is on. And Stu does tell Tatum to go get him a beer in the garage... hmmmm. I wonder.The first 10 minutes and the last 25 are the best. And the bathroom scene in the school is pretty good, too. Check ""Scream"" out instead of ""Halloween: Resurrection"". Way better results.",Scream
644,matt-764,Cravens last great movie,8,22 October 2015,"The recent sad passing of Wes Craven gave me a reason to look at some of his back catalogue, with The last house on the left and Nightmare on Elm Street being 'classic' Craven films, but I thought I would try Scream, which after its release in 1996 spawned 3 further sequels and has never really been spoken with the reverence of Cravens earlier output. Classed more as a 'slasher' as straight out horror, Scream played as a slice and dice of young, attractive American teens terrorised by a ghost faced masked killer stalking all those at Woodsboro High school, centring on the central character Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is still coming to terms with her mother's murder a year before. What made Scream stand out and grab the attention was the beginning. Having at the time it's one A list star brutally killed off in the first scene was a real statement of intent that no one was safe and instead of characters that you didn't care too much about who you could predict would be picked off we had a group who all were potential victims but also could hold the potential killer. Craven weaves the story around Prescott throwing curveballs as the guessing game as to who is next grows with a great supporting cast including Cox and Arquette as the older protagonists, but the key to the whole movie is its self-reverence about the 'rules' of horror movies almost played tongue in cheek for laughs at times. Craven himself turns up in a cameo as a caretaker dressed as Freddie Kruger. I always thought Neve Campbell was set for greater things. As the central character and main focus of the killer, whenever confronted with danger reacted as a survivor and not as the victim or standard fodder for the killer. She was dubbed a new Jamie Lee Curtis and the 'scream queen' but apart from reprising the role for the sequels, never really went on to bigger and better which is a pity, but time is on her side. Scream spawned a number of imitators including franchises 'I know what you did last summer' and Urban Legend, cashing in on the success of Cravens latest genre movie, upping the gore and more intricate slayings, but none as clever or with the subtle wit and execution of Cravens last great movie. https://moviemayhemsite.wordpress.com/",Scream
645,jakeu1701,Good Suspense Trilogy I,8,28 December 2004,"The story centers on ""Sid the Victim"" and the friends around her that are being killed by a ghost masked serial killer. There is also a back story that changes the suspects and Sid's reality.

I did not know who most of the cast was before seeing this film, however, I do not believe I could have picked a better ensemble. You will probably recognize the names in the cast listings. Matthew Lillard (Scooby-Doo, 13 Ghosts) brings a comic style to the screen. Neve Campbell (Craft, Party of Five) adds her beauty and strength (she was\is a dancer) which she needed for some of the scenes.

I think it's a mix of the slick storyline, dark humour, clever cast and the great chemistry between the characters! Each character offers a vital and funny part to make this movie really work. The relationships between the characters is fantastic and each actor brings emotion yet dark comic humour to this movie. Neve Campbell is neat as main target Sidney, who brings just the right amount of emotion to the story. Rose McGowan brings dry humour and a fantastic supporting role. And Courteney Cox is brilliant as reporter Gale Weathers. The actors are cool and convincing and David Arquette rocks as quirky cop Dewey Riley. Whereas Skeet Ulrich carries off his character perfectly. Overall i just can't get enough of this Scream and suggest if you haven't seen it you all go out and buy it.

The downside to this film in my opinion was the fact that there is nearly no acknowledgement of Rose McGowan or her character Tatum on the cover of the VHS/DVD or in many of the trailers. She was, to me, one of the star characters of the film.The special effects aren't the best I've seen, though the blood looks real in parts, but certain deaths do look like they really could have happened.

The plot has it's sad times, it's happy and funny times, it's suspenseful times and it's who done it times.In my opinion this is the greatest movie ever, this is one of those sorts of movies that you can watch over and over and over again, but thats just my opinion.A well deserved 10/10",Scream
651,peterantrobus,The redefining of the Horror movie,10,10 October 2015,"******SPOILER FREE***** Scream must be applauded for what it did. It made a credible horror movie that got people interested in a film genre that by 1996 had all but died a death. It made the slasher movie relevant once again, and remains the best of its genre, despite a myriad of copies and similar styled movies.I can imagine the annoyance felt by Drew Barrymore, who I don't think they that it would spurn 3 sequels.Each sequel that's followed has dipped in quality to its predecessor, the forth installment was poor, the second good, and the third watchable.This first film is funny, scary and energetic, no wonder it was a huge success. Neve Campbell is great, Sydney is also the most interesting character in the movie.Is there any horror fan that's not seen it? can't be..",Scream
652,Nepfew33,Best slasher in years....,10,19 February 2007,"Hands Down! Scream is a parody in itself filled with laughs and scares. The movie starts off in the very dark and atmospheric home where young innocent Casey Becker(Drew Barrymore) awaits her boyfriend's arrival. What she does not know is that he won't be coming at least not in the way she predicted.What I really LOVE about this scene is the suspense of the first scene. It actually ran chill bumps down my back. Drew was terrific in this scene and so was Roger's menacing voice. I also love the part where she can't talk but she's like 10 feet away from her parents. That's what movie creativity is all about my friends. On the sad side Drew ends up getting it, she gets it BAD and so does her boyfriend. I do believe this is one of the best opening scenes in horror movie history(behind Halloween and Black Christmas'74).Later in the film Sid now realizes that the guy who killed her mom is the same guy who took out Becker. Another thing I like about this movie are the characters. Never in my viewing of horror movies have I said ""I like everyone in this movie"". Tis true, Neve Campbell gave an amazing performance and was a great heroine. Skeet Ulrich was great as the red herring boyfriend. Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy added that comedy spice to this film that I love. Rose McGowan was terrific to as a hot best friend of Sid. Even the Kenny The Camera man was cool.I also enjoyed the very creative death applied to this such as Casey's and Tatum's garage death. The ending is still one of my favorite parts. I craved to know who was the killer in the Randy and Stu scene. Then we find out the killers. That's right there's more than one folks, it's Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. Billy Loomis was all ticked off because Sid's mother had an affair with his father causing his mother to abandon him. Stu Macher....well....Stu was just out of his mind. I like these two as a combo. I found Stu to be hilarious and Billy looks really psycho. I really like the Norman Bates line revealing Billy is the killer and I liked Stu's as well.Buy Scream on DVD. It has twists and turns that will leave you filling like you've just got off a roller-coaster after it's done.",Scream

658,Fiorno68,A fresh spin on a dying genre,7,9 July 2000,"Here is a film that is so saturated in Kyro-syrup, so over the top with media-savvy jabs, and so cynical, that it almost topples from it's genre-bending tendencies.  Yet on most accounts, it succeeds.  There's no denying that it helps to be a fan of the genre.  However, the clever craftsmanship of this film should provide an entertaining experience for anyone in the mood to be scarred.  The film starts out on a high note, with an extremely effecting opening sequence.  Unfortunately, Kevin Williamson's script looses its punch towards the ¾ mark, suffering from an overly long (and gory) finale.",Scream
659,dzero,References,10,8 July 2000,"When I first saw ""Scream"" I was not a horror/suspense movie fan, but the film really hook me up. The first scene let me breathless and I was thinking it was all a joke, until I saw the first murder. That was enough to keep my eye watching it all carefully. And the story, how everything lead to the end - and what an ending scene! And I thank my cousin for rent this video.Unfortunately, I can't tell much about the movie, but there something I can tell you: when you watch the movie, follow its ideas and look for some horror movies as ""The Exorcist"" which is one of the many sources of this movie - if you haven't looked yet.Many people can tell this movie sucks for a reason or for another, but one thing is certain: at least the new moviegoers like me who liked the movie will have an encyclopedia about horror movies. It's up with us read it or not. And, again, I thank my cousin, 'cause she loves scary movies, most the oldest ones.",Scream
660,dbrown-4,Neither scary nor funny,4,31 October 1999,"First of all, I should say up-front that I'm not a horror movie fan. Horror movies have never appealed to me much, and I find most of them rather boring.  There are a few horror movies which I do think are excellent, for instance Poltergeist, The Exorcist, and Silence of the Lambs.  In general, however, the appeal of the horror genre is a puzzle to me.With this in mind, I rented Scream with an open mind.  I knew nothing about the movie itself, except that it had gathered good reviews.  I wanted to be scared and entertained.  As it turned out, neither wish came true.Scream is a movie ABOUT movies and the people who watch them. Specifically, Scream is a movie about horror movies and the people who watch horror movies.  I didn't know this beforehand, although it became clear soon itself.  A killer is on the loose, and Neve Campbell appears to be the primary target.  Of course, this isn't what the movie is all about.  The plot is merely a vehicle for the main characters, who all seem to be extremely knowledgeable horror movie fans.  Throughout the film, they endlessly discuss and remark about horror movies, making references to famous films and well-known devices in the horror genre.The satire didn't work for me.  I'm sure this has something to do with the fact I'm not a horror fan.  Or perhaps the satire worked too well.  Within minutes of the first scene, I was certain I was watching a ""movie within a movie"".  When the credits never rolled and the lights never rose on a sea of teenage moviegoers, I realized this was satire.  I sulked and hoped for the best.Unfortunately, even the humor which I understood well seemed heavy-handed and spoon-fed.  Then again, some of the cliches and devices of the horror genre are so glaringly obvious that it might be difficult to satirize them at all, without appearing heavy-handed in the process.The main characters painstakingly point out all the ""mistakes"" which the characters in horror movies typically make.  Then, they go on and make the same mistakes themselves.  I suppose this is in keeping in line with the rest of the satire, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining story. When Neve Campbell undresses for her boyfriend, she fails to reveal her top to the camera, and this exception only serves to highlight the rule of how closely the main characters mimic the characters they see.  After all, as is pointed out, ""there's always a *** shot"".Many people describe this as a ""scary"" movie.  To be honest, I've been more frightened at the thought of an upcoming topology midterm than I was frightened by this movie.  It was anything but scary.  In order for a movie to be scary, anticipation must be built up.  As Hitchcock said, (modulo a slight paraphrase), ""Terror is achieved by anticipation of the event, NOT the event itself.""  Scream is all event and no anticipation.  There's nothing scary about watching teenagers get chased around and hacked to bits.This is just my opinion, of course.  You should take into account my lack of interest and knowledge in the horror genre in general.  If you're a great horror fan, and you know a lot about horror movies, you may very well like this movie.  Myself, I'm not a horror fan, and I found it quite boring and tedious.  If you're interested in a movie ABOUT the movies, I would recommend The Player, which was far more clever.  If you're interested in being scared out of your wits, watch the original Dutch version of The Vanishing.  Now THAT'S a scary movie.-- 4 out of 10 stars",Scream
661,unagie,The best suspense thriller ever made,10,26 March 2001,"Scream is the strong hold of the rival of teenage flick, although scream maybe the first it also lines up as the best of the crop.
i really enjoyed the solid and gripping performances by Courtney Cox & Drew Barrymore. but you cannot forget the ever funny Matthew Lillard. Each and everyone of these cast members give the performances of their careers and they have Wes Craven to thank for that.People maybe quick to smack the film because of the sequels, but we have to remember that they where planed from day one along with the original.
I really hope Miramax does not make a fourth film or if they do i hope the cast don't agree to participate because it works perfectly as a trilogy and out rivals any other horror trilogy in history.Scream will definitely out last Halloween, the exorcist & psycho for it's originality and revival of the genre.

And if you like this movie, then Scary Movie makes a great parody of it and, to tell you the truth, makes you seem to like Scream even more. But don't take my word for it and see both of them yourself. If you want my opinion, it is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. You definitely need to see it.

The way everything twists in the end is one of the things that I loved about this movie and I think I'll love until the day I die. Why will we talk about the classic (yeah, classic) introduction with Drew Barrymore's murder? THAT IS THE MOST FRIGHTENING OPENING SCENE EVER!!! I think that if you want to be really really scared with this movie, you have to watch it ALL ALONE. It's a great movie and it's still considered great, not just me, but millions of people and Scream fans around the world.I say go ahead and buy it or rent it or steal it, but you MUST watch it!",Scream

If you are a horror fan, all the winks and references to seminal horror of the late seventies and eighties (ie Halloween and Friday the 13th) should be very enjoyable.

I also think that the suspense was amazing and it really kept you on your toes.

It's fun to watch and see the clues that we were given, and really should have paid attention to during the first time around (when viewing). This movie was pure genius. A lot of movies have come out trying to duplicate the style that Scream introduced. Most have failed. Those that have succeeded, still haven't come close.",Scream

I stopped the movie calmed down invited a few friends over and we all had a slumber party.David Arquette (Dewey) plays a lovable cop not like the other movies with the cops that don't do nothing and you can't stand No Dewey is very involved in these murders and may even be a victim.Neve Cambell (Sidney) plays the main character, a teenage virgin whose mom was attacked and bruttally butchered supposedly by Cotton Weary. Her Mothers murder was one of the hottest court cases and her life gets turned upside down Campbell played this character with depth and emotion you feel sorry for her when she sees her mom's picture your heart bleeds for her.Campbell gave that a wonderful touch.Courtney Cox (Gale) plays an annoying reporter who admits to saying that Sidney has falsly identified the killer and that the killer is still on the loose. Cox gave off this gave a mean attitude whenever Cox would appear on screen you would just get a touch of hatered.Matthew Lillard (Stu) plays one of the offbeat teen . Lilliard's character is half the comedy in thois movie. Towards the end of the Movie the suspense digs up and to loosen us up is Lillard.Rose McGowan (Tatem) plays Sidney's best friend and Dewey's little sister and Stu's girlfriend. Although Sidney and Tatem have one or two arguments here and there they are great friends Dewey and tatem however can barely stand each other as we find out when they first appear together. Stu and Tatem don't have much screen time but when they do you can tell it is chemistry. McGowan brought to this Character reason the one arqument her and Sidney get into it is tell Sidney you know this is what is really happining. McGowan's performance overall doesn't really seem all to great but then again this is her first horror movie.Skeet Urlich (Billy) plays Sidney's boyfriend When we first meet him we see he loves his girl but then we find out she won't put out all because of her mothers murder last year. Urlich brings a dark side to Billy if you look very closely his grins are shocking.Drew Barrymore (Casey) plays a seventeen year old victim. First of all Barrymore is a wonderful Screamer she is the opening scene What better way to open a movie and to find a hot young almost adult get terriozed by a guy in a ghost mask? Barrymore's experience and talent and performance brought us to sit on the edge of our seats.Overall the movie was One Clever Thriller",Scream

There are a lot of reasons for the series' success.  For instance, the cast worked great together in all of the Scream movies, it was like a family type atmosphere.  Number two, the plot and the story were fantastic and enjoyable, it wasn't just some pointless teen slasher movie, you could really get into it. Finally, the third reason why the movie was so great was because the movie(s) had some comedy, action, drama, and romance and not just horror.The first Scream is my favorite even though the entire Scream series is fantastic.

674,stevensullivan1988,scream review,10,27 December 2013,"The killer Ghostface is terrorizing a small town, killing off the people who dare break the 'rules' of horror movies. His victims are mostly teenagers, but he has his eyes set on Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell.) Everyone is watching.Scream was released in December of 1996, before many people had seen it they were calling it DOA. It was during a time were slasher films where starting to die, and only seeing the light of a VHS release. Scream came out and single handily saved horror. Become the 16th highest grossing film of 1996 making over a 100 million at the box office, to mainly positive reviews. It made Neve Campbell a household name and showed the world that Wes Craven still is and always well be the master of horror. Scream blew the doors back open to slasher films and paved the way for the likes of I know what you did last summer, Urban Legends and many many more.Scream has one the best and most shocking openings ever. For 15 minutes we sit on the edge of our seats as we watch a young Casey being harassed as Ghostface keeps calling her on the phone. All he wants to do is play a game, sounds simple enough. Only he is outside her window watching her, and his game is horror movie trivia, a game that always proves to be deadly. None of the viewers seen this opening happening, some of us couldn't believe it was happening. It sets the tone for the whole movie and makes us wonder if they open like this, then wheres the ride going from here? Well my friend put your belt on nice and tight because this ride does not let up.We meet our main girl Sidney Prescott. We find out that her mother was killed just a year before. The man who did it in jail. When Ghostface puts his sights on her she is quick to learn that running out the front door doesn't always work. On top of this Sidney has to put up news reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox.) Who wrote the book about the murder of Sidney's mother. Gail seems to put Sidney though more hell than Ghostface, but she well get whats coming to her. Sidney's boyfriend Billy don't really seem to understand her drama filled life to make matters worse. Of course we also have the hot blonde played by Rose Mcgowan, your film geek played by Jamie Kennedy, and you stupid cop played by David Arquette. Only they are all very real in depth people. Scream puts every horror rule ever made in your face and then breaks them. It's a tongue and cheek horror film with some laughs but a hell of lot more scary's and blood. The most clearly written teen horror, its packed with lots of turns and drama. Wes Craven is a great story teller with how he tells the camera move, It is so slow well pasted that its very creepy. You just sit back and watch it unfold. There is lots of conversations that just make your blood flow cold, Wes makes this very intense by his use of close ups on the speakers face I found myself holding my breath at times. The last 20 minutes of this movie is filled with great surprise. You wont see any of this coming I promise you that.Scream is a very important film to horror, and the history of horror, and it is one of my favourite films. It paved the way for so many. If you have not seen this film you really should. It well not let you down.",Scream

677,theendisnear1985,"""This isn't a movie. This is life."" Really? You wouldn't know it by the script.",3,6 May 2010,"Tell me, if you're a writer who writes a cliché, predictable story, can you excuse your bad writing by having your characters state, within the movie, that they know it is cliché and predictable? This is my problem with Kevin Williamson's script, and this movie in general. You can't excuse a tired plot by having your ""hipster"" characters acknowledge every cliché from previous movies in the genre. It really is for five year-olds, there's nothing subtle about it at all. The viewer is beaten over the head in this film with constant references to other films in the genre. This self-awareness has been called new and edgy, instead of what it really is: a total cop-out. Why write characters so self-aware of all the genre pitfalls, only to have them execute the same bad decisions in their own reality? Such a waste.""Scream"" was heralded for being different from the pack because it was the first mainstream horror movie to parody the characters' situations and point out the flaws in the genre, but really, the idea was very simplistic. ""Scream"" differs from other genre films only in the fact the characters talk as if they're in a horror movie, while the rest of the film is just as predictable as any other movie in the genre. Changing one small ingredient in the recipe doesn't affect the end result that much. A child could have conceived the idea.The characters exist in a world where horror movies can happen just like in the fantasy of motion pictures--the killer can seemingly be everywhere at once, the heroine can elude her pursuer until the film's finale, and other characters conveniently find themselves in situations where they are far too easy for the killer to pick off. Of course, real life is a bit different, which ironically the main character says at one point in the film, right before we get treated to every horror cliché in the book before the grand ""finale"", which plays out just like a movie. Such a shame more of an effort wasn't made to create a better movie that sent a more believable message about the genre as a whole: that the killers aren't superhuman, not everything will go according to plan, the heroine will not always survive, and not everything plays out like a scene from a movie. That would have been a far better message than what we ultimately get here.",Scream
678,oasisnl,What's your favourite scary movie?,10,8 May 2018,"Scream was one of the first horror movies i saw and is still in my top ten best horror movies, it still holds up and basically gave an adrenaline shot in to the heart of horror. 
The story follows Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who's mother almost a year ago got murdered. Sidney testified that Cotton Weary raped her mother then killed her and he is sent to jail for it. Suddenly murders start and has sidney questioning her sanity did she put the wrong person away? 
The film has a mix of fun and red herring characters and at times you forget your watching a horror and just enjoy the conversations of the characters.Courtney Cox plays news reporter Gale Weathers a women who is always looking for an angle for the story, a real bitchy character and yet when she gets with Dewey your heart melts.
Deputy Dewey Riley is the sweetest character in the movie a lot of the kids are really savvy but he's an adult and yet is probably the most innocent man.
Neve Campbell as sidney is a great horror heroine.
Rose Mcgowan Plays Tatum Dewey's little sister is feisty carefree teenager.
Jamie Kennedy as Randy the ultimate movie geek in the best way possible.

It's the movie that made slasher movies scary and original again. It has a great storyline, great acting, and the famous voice of the ghost-face killer will send a chill to the bone, every time you hear it.

681,lestedu29800,Simply revolutionary.,10,31 August 2012,"Let's go back in time : we're in the middle of the 90's, and Horror (as a genre) is wheezy and sickly, filled with cheesy and predictable slasher-films. Wes Craven's Scream kind of came of out of nowhere, created a ""worldwide surprise"" and had a massive box-office success. Then, what makes Scream that different from a goofy or classic slasher-movie ? First of all, the script. When you talk about Scream, you cannot NOT praise the amazing story written by Kevin Williamson. He has the cleverness to write a love letter to the genre, without forgetting to show its limits and flaws. There's always a great balance between parody and pure terror and it gives an incredibly fluid rhythm to the film. Plus, the characters are developed and it is something quite unusual in Horror flicks.Scream as also some cult suspenseful sequences such as the unforgettable opening or nice chase scenes between the main character and the Ghostface killer. But to make those scenes believable, we need good actors. And oh my gosh, the all-cast is over the top. From Neve Campbell's neurotic portrayal of Sidney Prescott to Drew Barrymore's epic bravery moments in the opening, everything feels great. Finally, filmmaking is stunning, Craven outdone himself and created lots of tense and mythic moments.To sum up, Scream is a revolutionary film, that has definitely changed the genre, or at least it woke it up. Easily one of the best horror films ever made.",Scream

In all of the three parts there were some really scarry moments. I thing the movie is great. There are many good actors in it. I didn't manage to guess who the killer was in the movie. And I was very surprised that there were two people involved in the murders. While i was watching the movie almost all of my suspects died. I guess I wouldn't be a good detective. I specially like Courteney Cox. I was a little surprised that Drew Barrimor died in the beging of the movie. The killer was a real psycho. I think that the character of Matthew Lillard - Stuart had no motive. Anyone who hasn't watched the movie should do it right now.,Scream
684,kimberlymendez,One of the best classics,9,31 October 2015,"Scream is a classic horror movie with a twist. Throughout the movie, it makes references to other horror movies of the time and mocks them, making it stand out simply by that. A big difference of Scream is that it does something no other movies does. When the movie was promoted, Drew Barrymore was the face of the movie, she was supposed to be the leading role. To everyone's shock, she dies within the first few minutes of the movie! This is something few movies do, making Scream stand out even more. The storyline is self adds to twist of the movie. Sidney's mother was raped and murdered a year ago. And it just so happens that as the year anniversary approaches, a serial killer targets Sidney. The biggest twist is when one finds out who the killer is. Throughout the entire movie, one is led to believe there is only one killer, and the biggest suspects are Sidney's father because he is missing, and Billy, Sidney's boyfriend. Billy was initially taken to jail because he showed up at Sidney's house right as the killer failed to kill her, but then is found innocent. The twist is that there are two killers! Billy and Stu, Stu being one of Sidney's close friends. Then one finds out that Billy and Stu killed Sidney's mother because Billy's father was cheating with her. On top of that, Billy & Stu had kidnapped Sidney's father. All these elements make Scream one of the best classic horror movies. While still including the elements that all horror movies have; the teen romance and parties, with the killer targeting them all, with the intricate story lines and twist that make you jump and scream like all horror movies should.",Scream

This movie is one of the few that have never ending suspense and some laughs to go with it. There are some classic scenes in it like when Tatum is in the dog door a scream opens the door on her. The scare factor is 7 out of 10, plot 10 out of 10, acting 10 out of 10. This movie has got to be one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to people who liked Urban Legend or any other movies from Wes Craven Rated R, Graphic Violence, language, Sexual Situations.

Scream is nothing like that; Scream is a nice horror flick to watch over and over again.*SPOILERS* But, I should tell you that if you haven't seen Scream yet, and want to watch Scary Movie 1, you should first watch Scream, because than you won't be able to scream without laughing in every scene.Scream is a movie for all generations, my mom even watched it, and I saw the first movie when I was 8 or 9.The actors are great. In what movie can you watch Courtney Cox as a cocky reporter, Or David Arquette as a clumsy cop, or Rose McGowan as Sidneys best friend! The characters are really great: Gale Weathers- a cocky reporter that will do just about anything to get a story! Tatum Riley little sister of Dewey Riley(David Arquette) is portrayed by Rose McGowan and is perfect in this movie. Dewey Riley the cop and a good friend of Sidneys.It has an expected twist at the end.All out of all, I'd give this movie 10 out of 10... One of my favorite movies!",Scream

688,nazaryakovets,"'Behind you, behind you!' a.k.a. funny way to make a perfect slasher",9,19 July 2021,"From my perpective 'Scream' is the best or may one of the best horror movies I've ever seen just because it can make laugh of itself.Nowadays most young people grwing up watching such 'horrors' as 'Conjuring', 'Astral' or maybe 'Ring', which are predictable, taking everything too serious and sometimes of course based on true story. Watching such emotional rollecoasters can give you nothing, but an imression of haphazard action with no actual plot in it and really pathetic motivation of a killer. Actually, when I watch anything familiar to 'Nun' or maybe Saw 8 I see it as more of a comedy then a good scare.That's why, when I saw 'Scream' I was treamedosly satisfied with a mix of irony and sarcastic cliché that Wes put in his motion picture.He make laugh of heroes never looking behind them, of necessity of being a virgin to survive a horror movie, he even brakes the 4 wall, when one of the main characters says that it is a good horror movie.Despite all satiristic allusions Cravens tries to say to as that the killer can be not only some ugly boy with some 'revenge motive', but also the one who no one will suspect. It can be anybody.P. S. Craven took the real story that happened in Gainesville, where Danny Rolling allegedly killed 5 students during 1990. And Craven not even tried to put 'based on true story' line to his film. He wanted people to guess and understand afterwards, not before the film starts.",Scream

The first 10 minutes were very good and they almost actually frightened you - sadly the same can't be said of the rest of the film which gradually descended into more unfunny ""in-jokes"", ridiculous plot developments, criminally bad acting (almost saved by David Arquette) and non-scary scary scenes. Okay so maybe I'm missing the point, maybe that is the attraction of it all but surely if it was so good I would have enjoyed it just a little and I can't be the only one who thought the ending was one of the worst ever in a movie. I admit it did have some funny lines, some moderately scary patches and enjoyable scenes but does this warrant the scores of glowing reviews everywhere?The real irony is that it's a movie that thinks it's great attempting to send up other slasher pics that think they were great but weren't. What I'm saying is do see the film but don't believe the hype or you'll be genuinely disappointed. Watch with an open mind, suspend disbelief and you may just like it.",Scream

691,U-turn,Best movie ever made,8,17 December 1998,"rating (* to *****) : *****To me, Scream is the most wonderful movie ever made. Me liking scary movies, it satisfies me, but it's also from time to time hilariously funny. Especially the opening sequence is brilliant. It kicks off really gently (someone's made a wrong phone call to a teenage girl), but suddenly, things start to get creepy, and tension is accumulating. Moreover, it's not only scary and funny, but it's also a parody on late '70's/'80's slasher movies. All the main characters know that the killer is following the common rules of those scary movies, and Wes Craven is constantly showing us several horror clichés and meanwhile scaring us to death. I had never seen a Wes Craven movie before (except the weird Swamp Thing, which looked really messy to me), and this movie showed me his qualities very clearly. I think he has viewed a lot of horror material, and he knows how to use it, combining it with his overall scary movie directing experience. David Arquette is quite alright, although a bit awkward in his acting. First time starring in a box office smash hit is really something of course. I've seen Scream 2 as well, and I thought his acting in that movie was really bad, but here, he manages. I always regarded Neve Campbell as a soapy bad actress, who's just lucky she got the Sidney Prescott role. But she is unexpectedly great, her character is interesting and after me viewing her in the cinema I had a lot of respect for her. Courteney Cox is good, she seems quite fit for this over-the-top role of obnoxious tabloid TV reporter, and it requires no special acting abilities. Matthew Lillard was great. He was funny, but he also managed to show some real acting skills. Rose McGowan does an excellent job, I've seldom seen an actress liking her part so much. She's Neve Campbell's best friend, and she brings life into her funny character. Skeet Ulrich is okay, considering he just has to stand there, talk like a normal high school guy, and be handsome. I think he could do better in other roles. Jamie Kennedy is, although somewhat annoying, great. He's very convincing as the horror movie genius. Finally, it's not really fair of me to review a Drew Barrymore movie, considering she's my favourite actress and mere idol. But she was lovely! Although she dies after five minutes, she manages to portray a real character. Oh, she's fabulous!",Scream

There are many things that appealed to me about Scream but the most important is the sheer comedy and smartness. All my friends saw Scream and loved it but they never guessed who the killer was. Scream is a roller-coaster of screaming, blood, gore, beautiful characters ( Neve Campbell--Purr!!!!) and not forgetting laughs. Her friends are kooky but that is what makes the film so smart and appealing.I give Scream, 2 THUMBS UP. But What about the sequel............................................",Scream
694,LFBLuver,Um...THE BEST!,10,4 April 1999,"Without a doubt. 'Scream' made me excited by movies again, particularly horror. I had thought I'd never be scared by a film again because one, I'm older, and two, horror sucked! Too much was relied on gore than actual terror. Yet from it's first opening minutes to the end credits, 'Scream' made me feel tension, laughter and exhilaration. Much to the thanks of writer Kevin Williamson (my new idol) and director Wes Craven.Since pretty much everyone living outside a cave, knows at least OF 'Scream' and it's plot about a nut-job in a mask who taunts victims with horror trivia before dicing them up. I wanted to concentrate on something rarely focused on in horror. The acting.Since 'Scream' went from the little film that could into a teen blockbuster, not enough credit was given to it's extraordinary cast. All of whom turn in strong, solid performances.In what are usually throw away roles, Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy grab their limited screen time and run as the almost cool, almost handsome but seriously funny Stu and horror buff geek Randy. Skeet Ulrich is intense but always creepy as Billy. David Arquette ads his own quirky appeal to the Barney Fifish deputy Dewey.As for the lovely leading ladies, Drew Barrymore (who just can't seem to be bad) as Casey, is both tragic and phenomenal in her limited run. Courteney Cox surprises all with her very convincing portrayal of tabloid vixen Gail Weathers. In what is usually a thankless role of heroine's best friend, Rose McGowan takes the usually bimbo-esque(in any 80's slasher) character of Tatum and adds genuine sex appeal, smarts, and feistiness.As for the heroine herself, Sidney Prescott,(a seriously underrated Neve Campbell) she is without a doubt one of, if not the most realistic characters you're likely to find in this genre. Strong, intelligent, resourceful, this is a character that would flourish in any film. Provided the beautiful Campbell is the one to infuse her perfect handle on teen-angst.As for the film itself...EXCELLENT!...;o)",Scream

698,radioheadvoices,"Clever and funny... oh, and also scary!",8,12 June 2000,"First of all, Scream is without a doubt my favorite film. I have always been a big fan of slasher films, but most of them are absolutely horrible even though they might be a lot of fun. However, when Scream came out in 1996, I became absolutely fascinated with this genre and went to my video store to rent all of the Halloween series and the Friday the 13th series. There is no doubt in my mind; Scream is one of the very best, up there with the first Halloween.Sure, not everyone will recognize this fact right now, but believe me, in a few years, people will look back at this film and consider it a horror classic. One only has to look at the life it put back in the genre, as a ton of very bad imitations came running on the screens, trying to cash in on the horror madness. (One only has to think of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, and Halloween - H20.) Obviously though, not one of these movies has been able to reach the height, the standard that Scream has set.The film is both clever and funny. A lot of people might be inclined to say that I'm exaggerating, and I will let those people attack me and Scream as long as they have noticed the very subtle reference to the second most famous scene in Psycho (the one where the detective gets killed). It has to be one of the smartest references in cinema history, and if you can see it, you can truly consider yourself a horror fan.All in all, I gave it an 8/10. In a few years, most people will probably think I should have given it a 9.Feel free to send your comments to me.",Scream
699,dr6684,A Total Rip-off of the Slasher Genre,1,19 July 2000,"This film uses common suspense tactics from other slasher films and uses humor to fill the gaps between them. Scream was funny at times, and chilling at times, but I don't believe that it can really be considered an original film. It lacks what slasher films and many other horror films include: a gripping plot that will not be flaky throughout the film. The only advice I could ever give to the writers is to be original, and not rip-off what other people patented in their movies, and to also not go overboard on the weak humor.",Scream
700,Immaculate-2,A top scary film!,10,20 July 2000,"Scream is a fantastic film. This sleeper was very successful and went on to spawn two sequels that grossed even more money at the box office. It not only skyrocketed the careers of screenwriter Kevin Williamson and its star Neve Campbell but this movie also did wonders for director Wes Craven and Drew Barrymore. Barrymore has a Janet Leigh/Psycho-like part in the film but you'll have to check it out for yourself to see what I mean. It also features cameos from Craven and Linda Blair. And you can't miss Henry Winkler as the principal. It's a movie that revitalized a brand of scary movies that had been dead since the 80s and it started a whole revolution of teen films for the 90s and beyond, not just scary ones. If not for Scream we might not have movies like American Pie or that whole new group of popular teen actors.

702,JacksonPike05,Wes Craven Strikes Again with Another Gut Clenching Horror Movie.,10,11 November 2019,"What a movie! Wes Craven just took the limits and broke it in half with no remorse! Scream is the normal run-of-the-mill slasher at first glance, but is it really? Not really. While yes, Scream IS about the final girl being chased by the creepy masked guy trope we've all seen throughout the years, but scream takes on a more meta approach and adds more humor along the way. This movie predicts itself in a lot of places, but stills add a bunch of new and creative ideas, such as the kills.The kills and the scares are one reason to watch this movie, and it's a good reason too. The kills are AMAZING in this movie. Their creative, gory, gut-wrenching, but most importantly, scary. The movie captivates you with the mystery of who the killer is and what they plan to do next to our protagonists, which are also a good reason to watch this movie. The characters are not bad at all, they're fun to watch them do their thing and see how they react to their upcoming demise, which sounds dark but hey, it's just a movie.It Overall Scream was an instant classic and scared many when it first came out and still scares people today. I even found myself on the edge of my seat while watching. While it's good scares, great actors, good scares, great kills, amazing killer persona (Ghostface), and what matters most, a damn good twist. This movie will stun you and keep you on your toes every step of the way and will continue to scare many people for years to come, this is a must-watch if you're looking to be scared during any time of day.",Scream

704,pammer1,Best slasher movie ever. Peroid.,10,27 January 2008,"'Scream' is a great movie. Yes, it did resurrect the 'teen slasher' genre, which isn't exactly perfect, even though I love the slasher movie genre, most people don't. Now, the plot seems simple enough, a masked killer is stalking, then sadistically killing teens in a town called Woodsborro. Now, it seems like an ordinary slasher movie, but the twist is, these 'victims' are fans of horror movies, they grew up watching them, and are basically self-aware. I won't spoil much, but the scariest parts are the beginning and the end, it's spectacular. The characters are actually Likable which is a must for good slasher movies. Now, for content, the movie is EXTREMELY bloody, in particular the beginning (w/ Drew Barrymore) and the end. Also, the language is pretty bad, with many bad language, such as f-bomb, sh**, and other unmentionables.I recommend everyone watch this movie.",Scream
705,hip_priest,"unintelligent, lacking innovation...but watchable",3,27 March 2002,"Its hard to understand why everyone considers this movie to be so ground-breaking. It is not being creative and original to use a tired, cliched plot and garnish the script with 'ironic' self awareness. You could achieve the same effect by sitting through a regular slasher movie with a group of friends discussing and laughing at its cliches with them. Theres no real innovation here, same old characters, same old twists, and despite Craven's attempts to achieve an ultra modern feel, it will seem as dated as the camp slasher horror movies of the 70s in 20 years time. So many movies in the horror genre fall in to the trap of being too 'of the time', and this is no exception.You almost get the feeling that the jokes about genre cliches and the intertextual references are there simply to cover Craven's back from criticism - as if he wanted to make a slasher movie but didn't want to face the film being denounced as an unoriginal piece of trash, so acknowledged how bad it is within the script. While it is likely that Craven's motives were probably less simplistic than this, it certainly seems that this is the majority of fans reason for liking it - they want to watch a slasher movie and feel smart doing it. Which doesn't seem likely.On the plus side (i hate reading one sided reviews criticising movies i like, so i better be fair writing this) the film is fairly well directed and acted throughout, and manages to capture the atmosphere of the films it was inspired by. The tension is well established, and its good for the odd scare. It's certainly watchable, its just a shame that a director so clearly aware of how stagnant the horror genre has become can only point and laugh at the existing cliches rather than try to come up with something ground-breaking to revitalize the genre.If you want to see a good horror comedy, steer clear of this and go for Evil Dead 1 or 2, both of which are funny and scary through their innovation and spectacular visual techniques rather than through pretentious self mockery (who'd have thought self mockery could ever be pretentious?! and yet Craven managed with this!). While neither are intelligent films, they dont aim to be, merely to entertain, amuse and terrify - which they achieve, and this is a real rarity.I give this movie a 2/5, simply because to give it a 1 would be to say it was as awful as its sequels, or even the dire 'Scary Movie', and it deserves (a little) more respect than that.",Scream

It may seem a bit weird but it has a really good plot, the way it's written is very good because it entertains you throughout the whole film and the speech is good; not ""she died"" more like ""she got brutally murdered"". If you buy it on DVD then, like me, you may get bored of it and like any film, you will watch it again and again and again! I seriously would say watch it people! Its on SKY MOVIES SCI-FI & HORROR a lot lately. The actors are good in it. The plot is interesting. PLOT: Casey gets a mysterious phone call, she answers the phone all calm but THEN! a man says hello. She says hi, wondering who it is?. Casey (Drew Barrymore) says why do you want to know my name, then the mysterious man says ""because I want to know who I'm looking at"". Casey then kinda screams (hense the mane SCREAM). Anyway, the killer on the phone jumps through the window and then starts chasing her then she says arrrrrrg! Then she dies, she gets killed obviously, murdered (oh no!) Then strange things happen in the High School she goes to or should I say went to. If this makes you want to watch Scream then either wait to watch it on T.V or buy it on DVD.",Scream

GRRRRRRRRRR! Being the HUGE fan of Halloween that I am, I was annoyed at this comment.The whole 'who's the killer' thing was good to begin with, but then it got really boring. The best thing about Scream was Jamie Kennedy, who played Randy the horror buff. The whole 'rules' thing was very good and I liked it, but that was about all. I give this movie about 5 out of ten.Despite this, I saw the two sequels. I thought Scream 2 was marginally better than the first, and Scream 3 was the best out of the three, because (a) of Jamie Kennedy's neat appearance, which was very clever, and (b) it tied the films together, and had new plot developments, something that horror movies alot of the time forget.

It left such a huge impact on me primarily because, being 15 at that time, I actually thought that it was very well-written.  What got me from the beginning was Drew Barrymore.  Having been a fan of hers for so long, seeing her in a scary movie (pardon the pun) was quite a pleasant surprise.  And for a horror movie with interesting plots, twists, and dialogue, the humor still prevailed, thanks to Matthew Lillard (my fave because of Hackers) and Randy (forgot the actor's name, sorry).  Neve Campbell was okay as Sydney, she could've been a little less glum.  I mean, given that she had just lost her mom and everything, but still.

Although, I see it as more of a murder mystery than anything, that doesn't make it less than enjoyable. My advice: Watch this movie alone or with many friends, and you're in for one heck of a ride!

I have always loved horror movies and it would be extremely unfair not to regard this title as the one which brought this genre back from wherever it went in the late 80s and early 90s. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is one of those moments which you can never get out of your mind... horror, blood, screams and much more horror. It is entertaining and frightening, it includes hundreds of meta-references -like much of what Kevin Williamson writes- and its characters are generally well-played. I really loved the female roles in the film -Neve Campbell's, Rose McGowan's, Courteney Cox's-, but Jamie Kennedy's and Skeet Ulrich's performances are also worth mentioning. David Arquette, however, seemed to overact, but it does not really matter with such an excellent cast standing by him.On the whole, I don't think I could ever get tired of watching this movie. I can't wait to see the new chapter -Scream 4-, but I'm pretty sure that it can never equal this one or, worse, I fear it can get to disappoint me. Despite this, ""Scream"" is exactly what the 90s needed. Teenagers -attractive cast- being chased by a masked, crazy killer amidst a very nice soundtrack. Highly recommended.",Scream

I was never a great fan of horror films, I always found that their plots were too predictable, but scream changed all that. It takes the horror genre we all know, and turns it upside down. This is done by an exciting and unpredictable plot which was excellently portrayed by such people as Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard, who each added a certain something to the already brilliant storyline.

No matter where Sydney seems to go, everyone around her begins to die.  When the killer is revealed, you'll be shocked.  Something you can't help but love about Scream is all of the quotes and references to older slasher movies.  Scream can be just as funny as it is scary, and can be enjoyed by just about anybody.  My only problem with Scream is the dragged out climax, but overall a real thrill. 10/10",Scream

Sydney's mom was murdered and one year later the murders start again, wow. Funny, scary, suspenseful, and fun (don't forget violent). The scene were Tatum is trapped in the garage door is suspenseful and disturbing. Fantastic killer, with so many kids dressed as him/her for Halloween. I love this film. When deciding whether, or not to let your little ones see this, remember the intense horror violence (was originally NC-17) strong language, drug and alcohol use, and some mild sex (mostly talking) Watch this movie, I'd recommend 14+ (know your kids).",Scream

Neve Campbell delivers a consistent performance and by consistent I mean boring and predictable. Jamie Kennedy hits us over the head with the reminder that we are watching a ""horror"" movie. Rule #1 of a good movie: Don't take the audience out of the experience. Make them believe it is real. Overall: No real terror or dread is conveyed. Some OK scenes of the killer chasing people and losing but then winning the upper hand. A few scenes designed to make the viewer jump. OK twist and revelation at the end.

Yet, I'm not sure nowadays audience would really be scared. What we find scary changes over time--'Alien' was considered very scary when first released in the late 70s, yet today I doubt it would really scare any adult viewers ('The Thing' is another example). It does not prevent 'Alien' from being widely praised as an excellent, classic film. The same applies to 'Scream'. The opening scene remains one of the most memorable in film history. Cleverly written, witty, well acted and shot, 'Scream' is a masterpiece that reintroduced talent to the then decaying horror movie industry (compare it with series like 'Friday the 13th' for instance). Sadly, it is also its own victim as all the goofy parodies have resulted into depreciation of the original film.

As the film progresses, we get all kinds of film references and the characters themselves are aware of some of the clichés that famous movie horror characters in films like ""Haloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" have been subject to.It helps that the film is also filled with strong performances from a notable cast, including Campbell and Arquette.

Well I thought he had his character down pretty good. And t top it all off it had the horror master Wes Craven direct it. When you have Wes direct it and you have that star studded cast you already know how good the movie will be. I will never get tired of watching this movie since i am such a big horror fan.

It stars Neve Campbell who plays Sidney Prescott, a young girl in high school is suddenly terrorized by a faceless killer. The days that she is being attacked are the same days that her mother was killed the year before. There are also all the cliché horror characters like the boyfriend (Billy Loomis), the dumb couple (Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard), and there is the overly obsessed movie freak (Jamie Kennedy). There's also the protective cop (David Arquette) and a young ambitious newscaster (Courteney Cox). This movie speaks about other horror movies the whole movie like: Psycho, Carrie , and The Town That Dreaded Sundown just to name a few. This movie also introduced a new classic horror villain, Ghostface. Ghostface is supposed to resemble the painting The Scream by Edward Munch. He may not be as scary or gruesome as Freddy or Jason, but he would still be a very frightening figure to see in the middle of the night.

At times it seems to be even too severe for the young generations, but, as it must be, it never gives advises of possible changes.

You can give Scream credit for injecting some much needed life into the horror genre, and credit that to the geniuses of Craven and Williamson.  This film successfully satirizes just about every horror cliche, while maintaining a very scary plot at the same time.  You can either watch this movie as a straight horror flick, which it is very good at being, or you can watch it as a very entertaining look at the history of the genre as well as a look at where the future of the genre is headed.

738,gosmith19,"Success commercially, failure film-wise",2,16 February 2000,"After reading a few reviews, I decided to register just to able to write my own. I cannot believe that such a dumb movie can get so much praise. I don't even know where to start. Firstly, if you haven't seen this movie and if you're older than 14 - avoid it! The cast is filled with the so-called upcoming stars, which do a pretty average job. The scenario is full of ""holes"" and barely holds itself together. You'll be wondering why the action took place or why the phrase was said and it won't be clear even after the movie is over. It is very sad to see that Wes Craven, the maker of the first ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" a truly original and superbly made horror movie, is involved in this pathetic show whose only aim is to gain as much commercial success as possible. The following sequels serve as an undeniable proves for this. One of the amazing things I found is that one version of the slip-sleeve packages says ""starring Drew Barrymore."" (I am not saying that she's an awful actress, but to me saying that she ""stars"" is great exaggeration.) In this movie she hardly ""plays,"" as she appears doing nothing but screaming and saying only a few words, and this lasts less than ten minutes. But this, most likely, was another commercial trick. So my advice would be - unless you have free tickets, do not waste your money and time. (With the free tickets you may go ahead and check it out - just to know what this ""commercial"" fuss is all about.)",Scream
739,polosport4u,Best Horror ever? = ),10,9 July 2000,"Scream may not be the best horror ever by critics but by me? its surely one of my favorites. I've been in tons of arguments (that I've won like everytime!) that scream is not a horror that it is a spoof/black comedy.  my argument is this, Slasher was dead in the mid 90's, Kevin Williamson (creater/writer) came along and wrote a movie called 'Scary Movie' (Later changed to 'Scream') and it hit! it hit like crazy, the first scream was definitely a horror, and that ignited a flame back into the genre that I so dearly love of horror: Slasher and then all the 'Scream' Ripoffs came just like the nike ripoffs came trying to make money, trendy unrealistic movies aka : I know what you did last summer, The faculty, etc etc. Movies like this trashed 'Scream', serious horror fans dislike Scream so much its not even funny but you have to agree every horror has a trendy teen who loves beer/and drugs in it. Not saying there were any drugs in scream but you catch my drift, sure there were a few JOKES in scream but what horror doesn't have the teens making jokes, Halloween, F13, and TCM had jokes! Scream is a better script and higher production that is the main reason why it hit, it actually had good actors/actresses in it! and that isn't why you should dislike a movie, that is just my opinion!",Scream
740,shadowflame,Slasher done right,9,9 April 2001,"Scream is not an excellent film. It's a good film, and an excellent slasher. It stands above every other film in the genre for several reasons.Firstly, it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a good humour and the irony is not as overdone or as irritating as some people claim. It stops the audience from grumbling about the unlikeliness of it all, and so shields criticism in that sense.Scream also has characters that you actually care if they die or not. Although, from the offset, its quite easy to tell who'll die and who won't, it still works. Thankfully, the cast do justice to the characters their given.Neve Campbell is fine in the 'scream queen' role, but it is the more minor characters that are played best. David Arquette is good as dopey Dewey, Matthew Lillard's overacting suits Stu, Courteney Cox and Jamie Kennedy are ideally cast, while Rose McGowan is impressive as the gutsy best friend.Scream is also well directed by Craven, with well-timed shocks and some excellent set-pieces.Williamson's script is what makes Scream special, but although it looked like a new talent had been spotted, with the cash-in that was I Know What You Did Last Summer, it seems that he's a one-note writer with little imagination.But Scream, although it's tarnished by the inferior sequels and the floods of truly awful imitations (Urban Legend et al), remains an example of how slashers should be done - more than just an excuse to cut up busty teens, it's a smart and funny film.9/10",Scream

This is how it can be self-deprecating in a really endearing way. It still has intrinsic scares; it is not explicitly a movie about moviesit carries the self-reflexive thing just as far as it needs to and uses it in just the right way. The most obvious example of this from the movie is when the guy lays out the rules of a horror movie and predicts what will happen next. When I think of Scream, these are the ideas immediately present in my mind: pure play in fright, the garage door scene, the archetypes, the self-reflexive attitude, epitomized by that one scene in which a character lists aloud the rules of the horror genre.",Scream

With a cast of the industry's up-and-coming teenaged stars, Scream is a film concerning a group of students whose obsession with horror movies is practically deranged. The murderer is difficult to pinpoint due to the fact that suspicion is placed on many of the characters, particularly Billy Loomis, who is played by Skeet Ulrich. The deaths are brutal and gory, especially the first death. Matthew Lillard is spectacular in his role of Stu--the hilarious and inappropriate boyfriend to Rose McGowen. The plot flows smoothly and contains many witty lines that definitely add something to the film.

And I guess if you put yourself into the position of the characters, the film could be quite creepy and for people who plan on watching it, it will probably make you jump first time around The first scene is a good opening: A killer calls a young girl and eventually ends up killing her when her parents are meant to be visiting. In the end of the sequence we see her disembowelled on a tree.The ending sequence is also quite good, although the killers were suspected throughout the film, I think it kind of worked as they played the double bluff. (Made you think they were the killers which makes you think 'no they won't be' but in the end they actually are).So... despite it being an 18 and in the horror genre, I think this film is more a comedy with it's sort of 'cartoon violence' and funny moments.But... good film, watch it if you already haven't.",Scream

The things people in real life know as in other movies like I know what you did last summer they had no clue about horror movies.I only gave it a 9 because i just don't believe that Billy and Stu could do all that by themselves.

Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Pinhead etc.. no one expected Ghostface to be the new icon for the horror genre.The film is perfectly setup with a brilliant opening sequence featuring Drew Barrymore. Despite her notoriety these days Barrymore had yet to achieve the wholesome image she would attain just a few years later. Still, no one expected to see a former child star brutally murdered in the opening scene. Pay close attention to the advertising. Barrymore was being marketed as the films star. This made for a much greater shock when viewing the film upon its release. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox were busy working on television. Campbell was still an up and coming star having worked a few seasons on Party of Five. Courtney Cox attained a following for her role as neat freak Monica on beloved sitcom Friends. Both actresses were able to sink their teeth into more complex material. Kevin Williamson's script gleefully pokes fun at the genre while simultaenously expressing adoration.A masked serial killer gleefully stalking his victims and using horror movie trivia to threaten them provided a unique self aware approach. Scream launched a whole new cycle of slasher cinema. The self aware style was innovative and highly regarded at the time. The film itself has fallen victim to parody over the years but it will forever be regarded as a suspense classic. Wes Craven brought his expertise to the camera and Kevin Williamson provided the witty dialogue. A perfect recipe for success.",Scream
759,ScottyAF,My Favorite Movie,10,31 May 2015,"It's only fitting to write a review for my favorite movie, the movie that reinvigorated the slasher genre. Satirizing the horror genre and the many clichés that were prevalent in the 80's horror movies while successfully throwing the audience through a loop in the first ten minutes. I think one of the reasons the movie has been so successful has been the cast, using already established actors like Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore. My first viewing of this movie brought a mix of excitement and fear as Ghostface flashed his haunting mask and tilted his head. The story has a meta feel to it, the characters can recognize the presence of other horror films and know the dangers of being a teenager in the situation. You spend the whole movie trying to decipher who the killer is and even when presented with a red-herring and as the characters start dropping, you still are perplexed with the result. The film offers comic relief and characters that you can become invested in; whether it's Dewey the lovable deputy, or Randy, the geeky horror movie guru.",Scream
760,KeepsGettingBetter,What's your favorite scary movie? Easy: Scream,10,5 March 2012,"This movie is amazing. Great cast. Great writing. Great director. Great characters. I recommend this to everyone. This was my very first horror movie and it really got me interested into the genre. There are plenty of scares and jumps throughout the film and it has its fair share of violent acts done by the killers. The first time I saw this movie I caught the last 40 minutes or so, so I didn't have any clue what was going on and I didn't even really know what the movie was about. So I was glad to see it again all the way through, really appreciating the movie. Now its one of my favorites! The character development is great, so you really care about who dies/ doesn't die and the one-liners are funny, bad-ass or just plain wrong. Kudos to K. Williamson for his original, groundbreaking script. And kudos to the cast, particularly to Matthew Lillard (HILARIOUS), Neve Campbell (my favorite Scream Queen), and Courteney Cox (favorite actress ever-played ruthlessly ambitious Gale to the T), for their wonderful acting. NOW GO SEE THIS MOVIE :)",Scream
761,laicepsworld,Terrible movie.,2,18 May 2015,"This movie sucks. Although it is just one rung above Unwatchable and the the Happening it doesn't really say much about the level of movies it is better than. After watching this movie again, I was Highly disappointed and will never give it another chance. Just terrible beyond words. I understand that some my not like my opinion about this movie as well as the other two mentioned. Well that is your opinion and this is mine. Take for what its worth this is a movie for a ten or thirteen year old at best. They should change the rating system just for this movie, not suitable for people older than 13 or you will be angered.",Scream
762,etopup,Screeeeeeeaaaaaammmmmmm,9,17 August 2012,"""Scream"" is completely entertaining and totally terrifying. In a time when horror was losing its touch, Kevin Williamson wrote this clever script and Wes Craven brought it to life beautifully, reinventing the modern slasher and still remaining better than most of the films that followed it.Neve Campbell is Sydney Prescott, a shy girl who's life is turned upside down when somebody begins murdering her friends. In comes Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and a hilarious reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, the best character in the film) to investigate the murders and stay alive.The movie is funny and scary, with homages to famous older horror classics the entire way through, and the climax is excellently tense. A horror movie that started a legacy.Make sure you watch!",Scream

The cast was amazing (besides Shaggy from Scooby Doo, and it ruined my perception of Shaggy for a bit). I hate all the other Scream movies as they aren't cohesive with the first one... so I am not going to even bother with them. This movie is fantastic, and if you haven't watched it, you are being deprived of life. If you wish to see a thrilling movie that kept one hand over one eye, this is the movie for you. It's main character Sydney, was portrayed beautifully by Neve Campbell, I actually believed she was connected to her father extremely well, and wasn't distant.I overall loved the movie, it was great!",Scream
764,ahaugen107,Favorite movie....,10,25 August 2004,This movie completely changed my view on horror films.... Before seeing Scream I would never watch anything might make me scared because I hated horror movies... when i saw Scream it completely changed... It also introduced me to Matthew Lillard who I had never heard of before... Now he is my favorite actor! This movie gave so many young actors and actresses a chance to make it big.. Courtney Cox was great in this movie as well as the sequels and after seeing this movie I became a FRIENDS fanatic... This movie also completely changed the horror genre and every scary movie thats come out since takes a little something from Scream... I will always remember the first time I saw Scream... It really captivates its audiences.ITS A SCREAM BABY!,Scream

766,hhenke-14,Simply put: One of the greatest horror movies of all time!,8,3 August 2013,"Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although ""Scream"" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be.There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in ""Scream"", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life.Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make ""Scream"" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard.*Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading!Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history.Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives ""Scream"" its signature style.If you haven't seen ""Scream"" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting!Plot: 8.5/10Acting: 8/10Cinematography: 6.5/10Script: 7.5/10Style/Originality: 9/10Overall: 7.9/10",Scream
767,ernie4152-1,Nicely done,5,13 June 2005,"Tame, by the numbers slasher film still manages to earn some big scares and features an appealing cast. A group of teenagers shortly after graduation accidentally kill someone. Fearing police charges the kids take matters into their own hands by getting rid of the body. Flash forward one year, now the kids begin to receive threatening letters and are starting to disappear cause of a person who Screams. Rated R; Violence, Profanity, Mild Sexual Situations.The biggest failing of the film is the performances. The murderer is not as effective as ones like Ghostface or Freddy - partly because he lacks screen presence but also because we all feel sorry for him - after all he's not crazy, he's only taking revenge. The teens in question make it worse - with the exception of Love Hewitt and maybe Prinze they are pretty unpleasant people - spoilt brats mainly. From the start onwards you want them to be killed - it makes it even harder to care about what's going on when you don't care if the characters live or die.Overall this is a rather tame horror movie - low on bodycount and gore, only some action scenes are tense and exciting but most things you can see coming a mile away. The red-herrings are left unexplained at the end (why is Ray the only one not targeted?) and the end is both lazy and insulting - and of course leaves it open for a sequel. Great.",Scream
768,Invaderraine,Billy and Stu 4ever!,10,22 April 2005,"Okay so along time ago I saw this movie and did not really pay it that much attention, however the other day I got the opportunity to see it again and i was totally amazed. I loved it. Billy and Stu would make the cutest couple! Sorry bad slash habit. Lol. I loved the whole blood look on the two of them. Billy being the killer just made him like 20 times hotter. When he is biting the knife. Ohhhhhh!!!!!!! And when Matthew Lillard goes up behind billy and they are both covered in blood and that was like way hot. No matter how good this movie was though i would not even think of ever watching the second or third movie ever again. They both sucked. I have not stopped watching the first one yet.If you want a really good movie then you should most certainly watch this movie.",Scream
769,Etwo,Some people don't get it...,9,14 March 2006,"Some people think it's just a typical 90s slasher. It isn't, it's a satire which (i understand) can be a little confusing sometimes. This movie is meant to be funny: making fun of slashers but at the same time it is a slasher, so it uses irony as a form of comedy. Anyway it's very funny in outlining horror clichés and using them at the same time. I think all 3 Screams are great but the best is the third which has one of the funniest things I've ever seen in it and I think to enjoy the Scream movies you need to have seen some horror movies and perhaps be a little sadistic (ok maybe not) but anyone who tells you this movie is bad really doesn't get it. Also, Scary Movie is very stupid... They spoofed a spoof and they said ""we're just saying, 'this is how stupid you looked in those horror movies'"" so they obviously didn't get it. (Just thought I'd add that)",Scream
770,siagabriel,Very well-made!,10,6 January 2017,"Great story and acting. It started what is definitely one of the strongest horror franchises. Neve Campbell is an excellent choice for the 'Final Girl'. Courtney Cox and David Arquette work well together. The killer reveal is unexpected. Even 20 years later, which saw the release of three sequels and a TV series which has Season 3 coming out this year, the film still holds up well, and is up there with other classics like Halloween(1978), for example. It really has replay value, which is very nice. The Ghostface costume is still a classic, and one of the most popular choices for Halloween even now. I am still hoping a fifth film will be made to officially end the original series, but Scream 4 is a strong enough book-end anyway and does justice to the first movie, in my opinion.",Scream

The reactions were dumb. I cannot believe anyone likes this film. The characters were so thin. The one idiot just kept stick his tongue out and laughing like an idiot, like he does in every film he is in. The ending was moronic. This has to be the worst film of all time. This is supposed to be a tribute to the classics like Halloween and nightmare on els street, but it was so bad, it hurt. Wes Craven, you should be ashamed of yourself. Skeet Ulrich, Johnny Depp called and he wants his soul back. I didn't expect this movie to be this bad, but it was worse than I thought a movie could be.",Scream
772,eddiespence43,scream changes your view of the entire genre forever!,10,28 July 2005,"This movie revived the genre, with it's clever analysis of other horror movies and the simplicity of the revenge plot. This proves that you don't need to lay it on thick, with the gore and mountains of corpses to produce a clever, entertaining and truly terrifying horror movie .The original and very scary telephone calls create more suspense than music,lighting or strange noises ever could . This ""anticipation of death is worse than death itself"" philosophy is very apparent in a lot of craven's work, but non more so than scream.""the rules"", the focus of the movie are genius , they add purpose to a tart trying to crawl through a kitty door when she should be beating the crap out of the injured killer.the rules change the way you look at all horror movies and this art imitating life imitating art is what makes this movie great.a truly perfect substitute for all that gore. In sum,Scream is the daddy of all horror movies!",Scream
773,van_ecko,Doomed to mediocrity by its own merits,6,1 November 2005,"I have to give Kevin Williamson credit. His attempt to revive a dead genre is entertaining, but any script - even an intelligent one like Williamson's - that is based on parody and smack-you-in-the-face horror film references is by definition unoriginal. I admit I enjoyed patting myself on the back during various parts of the film for understanding the winks and nods, but as I became more focused on catching the script's sub-references I inevitably became less interested in the plot and its characters. I know that it's supposed to be a fun, don't-take-me-too-seriously kinda movie, but I just thought it could've been better. Especially since the film started out with such promise. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is slasher cinema at its best. Young girl, home alone, cue creepy phone caller, etc. The best way to instill fear in filmgoers is to make them believe that IT could happen to them, and it was easy to empathize with Drew as she became a prisoner in her own house to someone she couldn't see. The rest of the scene while not perfect (I thought it would've worked fine without the boyfriend's involvement) is a testament to Barrymore's acting ability. In five minutes she was able to make me care whether or not she survived the scene, which of course she doesn't (the scene's end in particular was one of the best parts of the movie).Unfortunately, though, that scene was director Wes Craven's only highlight. The rest of the movie devolves from a horror flick with potential into a Franken-film made up of slasher clichés that are supposed to be rendered fresh simply because the script is self-aware. And I have to say it just bugs me that Wes repeatedly has the killer chasing a victim from inches away at high speed only to be thwarted, oftentimes temporarily, by some sort of Keystone Koppish maneuver. Totally unnecessary and totally not scary. Even more so if it was a conscious attempt to parody chase scenes from earlier films.If you're a fan of slasher films then this movie is a must-see just so you can feel good about your knowledge of the genre and its conventions. If you're looking to be scared, however, then stick to the classics.",Scream

My cousin rented it at Movie Gallery and we watched it at home. Even though I was just six, I remembered watching the girl getting her head crushed in the cat door built into the garage door. I always thought that she was hot. I never even knew anything about her. I am now fifteen and I thought that I should rent the movie to find out more about it. I watched it at least fifteen times. Now that I'm older, I see that Scream is the greatest movie on earth. It's killings are well thought out. (Congrats to Kevin Williamson's assistant for thinking of Tatum's death scene...it was amazing!) Scream isn't like any other movie. Rose McGowan (Tatum Riley) was my favorite character. Now that I've seen Scream, I have become more interested in Rose McGowan. I never was before. I had no idea who she was. I'm also interested in Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, and Drew Barrymore. I don't believe in sequels, but Scream was so awesome, that I think I will definitely rent both Scream 2 and 3.

What scream does well is it's tension and creativity which makes it quite unique. It also is a comedy, horror which can lead to funny scares.

Well, when I walked out of the movie I have to say, Craven and newbie Williamson did a great job. What I thought would be a horror spoof turned out to be a chilling real life horror movie. Not the cliché unstoppable killer (i.e. Jason, Freddy, Michael, etc.). The movie takes place in a small fictional California town, called ""Woodsboro"" I can't say too much without giving some of the movies secrets away, so I will just say the movie is about a killer who starts stalking Sidney Prescott (played by Neve Campbell) and threatens to kill her and takes credit for her Mothers murder the year before. As the movie continues, the killer continues to knock of a few people and along them, some of Sidney's friends. From the opening sequence to the ending sequence, this movie is DEFIANTLY worth a look.

795,IloveEmusandCCA,Unbelievably wicked! - the best horror-thriller thing in years!,10,19 April 2006,"Scream is amazing. Cool, funny and with some jumpy moments (at least in the dark), Scream has everything that a good horror/horror spoof needs. All the cast are great, and Drew Barrymore - even with her small role - is particularly memorable. Courtney Cox is great too, and Neve Campbell is awesome as the lead character. I suppose it really shouldn't have been any good; the mask at first seems a bit naff and the whole psycho killer thing is (or at least was) getting old. But somehow Wes managed to make a great film.This is definitely the best horror movie ever! (Although saying this it's one of the only ones I've seen but oh well) If you don't see it you are missing out - and if you choose not to you are a complete loser! And see if you can spot any in-jokes, though hard to spot they will make you smile. Now go see Scream!",Scream
796,imaginationeinstein,A comedy slasher that's actually good!,8,4 June 2019,"First, a funny comedy and satirical parody on typical slashers.
Second, a fun movie to watch with friends because of the meta jokes.

797,bjb5859,the best movie ever,10,5 July 2006,"out of every movie ever made, this is the best movie made. if you like violence, this is the movie for you. it has guts, slit throats, and stabbing, with much more. its worth two hours. as I've said, I've seen almost every movie, and this is still my favorite.the DVD is loaded with features too. it has commercials, bts, and outtakes, with like 10 more things. the story is your typical slasher movie. someone is stalking kids and even some adults. but this movie beats newer slasher flicks like Texas chainsaw massacre remake and Freddy vs. Jason by a long mile, and i highly enjoyed those movies. it even beat see no evil by a lot, and i thought that was a great movie. this is a very enjoyable movie, so watch it!HIGHLY Recommended! 11/10",Scream
798,edelapi,"Overall, pretty good movie!",8,30 October 2019,"The ""Scream"" wants to play a game. Who will be next? The horror movie ""Scream"" was filled with suspense and intrigue throughout the entirety of the film. It drew the viewer in, and it was almost as if they could feel what the characters were feeling. The music was even more unsettling because it led the viewer to believe the eeriness of the scene. The special effects will catch the viewer by surprise-just wait. Do not stay home alone, or die.
Wes Craven was a brilliant director in this thriller about teenagers being horrified beyond their wildest dreams. It all started when Sidney Prescott, played by Neve Campbell, witnessed the horrible death of her mother, and almost a year later the same tragedy was occurring around her again. Sydney so badly wanted to revert back to the time when she and her mother would spend time together with no worries. When the news arose at school of the deaths of two teenagers in her town, Sydney felt like she was getting jostled around by students questioning her. There were many occurrences where the killer tried to wrangle all the teens to try to kill them. The ""Scream"" wants to play a game. RING RING! ""Don't hang up or die"" Those were the infamous words of the feared villain. A curfew was set; if only they had headed the warning. The teens thought they were invincible to the wrath of the killer. Little did they know danger is lurking around every corner.
The music to the movie makes the viewer want to jump out of their seat and scream along, out of the pure fear of what is being portrayed on the screen. The music definitely makes the viewer think about the suspense of the film. The viewer can already tell by the sound that an intense part is approaching. As soon as the viewer hears the high-pitched sound of a violin, it is inevitable that the killer is hovering close by.
Even though the movie itself was entertaining, the special effects were subpar. The blood running down the characters' bodies looked like fruit punch. There was not much to believe, except for the emotion the actors portrayed, which really helped captivate the audience. Although the observer saw ""blood"" spewing out of the victims' bodies, the viewer never actually saw them being stabbed to death. Then the victim would magically appear dead in the next scene.
Overall, ""Scream"" was an excellent thriller that left the viewer speechless with all the spontaneous killings by the ""Scream"". Pay close attention to all the foreshadowing in this epic motion picture. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.",Scream
799,audreyfkl,i love scream,10,12 August 2006,i thought this movie was awesome and scary i love scary movies of course who doesn't i think you should make more of them there awesome my favorite part was when that chicks boy friend was caught by scream and tied in a chair and scream said turn out the lights and she did and heard a noise so she turn on the lights and her boy friend had no stomach that part was so cool i hope you come out with a whole lot of more scary movies in the future you make the best I'm am such a big fan and the only reason I'm still writing is because i have to have 10 lines to post this comment and i am running out of things to write well like you really care you are the one who said so.,Scream
800,axelblaze269,Why wes why?,1,20 July 2006,"in a genre that wes has helped to create and build upon why does he seem to feel the need to spoil it. scream seems like more of a micky take then anything. its unimaginative the storyline has been done 100s of times and the mask just looks stupid and more funny then scary. Possibly the only thing worse is scream 2 where the killers are unrealistic. especially the male who has absolutely no good motive at all he is just put in so you cant guess who it will be. did wes make this film to try and make a mockery out of this genre to make it harder for the future generation as wes has moved on from horrors now. This film annoys me so much because i had so much respect for wes with such classics as,hills have eyes,last house on the left and of course nightmare on elm street.this is my opinion and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree but I'm also sure a lot of old school horror fans will see where I'm coming from.anyway i still have a lot of respect for wes but i am extremely disappointed with these films and its a pity they didn't flop.",Scream
801,nickbassett1,The Film That Rewrote The Horror Rules,10,28 April 2001,"Scream is one of those films that took everyone by surprise. Wes Cravens previous films hadnt gained the attention that he had scored in the eighties with the Nightmare On Elm Street series.But in 1996, Scream opened and took a huge box office..Miramax's most successful film a the time(It has since been beaten by SCream 2, Scream 3 and SCary Movie)..That alone suggests that people keep coming back for more because Craven and Kevin Williamson (Dawsons Creek) have created characters that the audience warm to. The casting is also perfect. Drew Barrymore makes her big comeback following a dead patch in her career and proves that she was right to turn down the lead role in favour of that of Casey Becker. The opening scene is amazing and although the rest of the film doesnt match it, it still maintains an excellent pace and quota of slicin' and dicin'! Campbell slips nicely into the shoes of Sidney Prescott, a teen who is still coming to terms with her mother's untimely murder which happened nearly a yr ago to the day. As the anniversary of the death approaches she finds herself the victim of a stalker who dons a scary mask and starts cutting up all her friends! There is a great supporting cast with impressive turns by Rose McGowan as Sid's best mate (Tatum Riley), David Arquette, the local deputy sheriff (Dewey Riley) and Jamie Kennedy as movie buff, Randy Meeks. However the most impressive acting comes from Courtney Cox as fame hungry news reporter, Gale Weathers. Proving that she can do other stuff as well as being ""friendly"", Cox creates a character that is entirely her own! After watching teh film you cannot imagine anyone else taking her role.. As the killings increase, Dewey, Sid and Gale have to unite and track down the murderer and start to discover that it is a little bit too close to home..This film is absolutely amazing..It started a new trend of teen slashers and also kicked the careers of several young American hotshots back into action..(McGowan, Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard). It is also hysterically funny..if you know your horror films look for in jokes and references to Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday 13th. Also you may spot cameos from Liev Screiber, Henry Winkler and Wes Craven (playing a caretaker called Fred who looks spookily like Freddie kruger!)Watch this film..There arent many as good as this!10",Scream
802,darkzoneproductions,Totally predictable and a step backwards,1,14 August 2006,"When I first sat down to watch this movie I was told that, even though I had become so jaded with horror movies, I would never guess who the killer was or see the end coming. That was something that I had learned to enjoy because of a classic like SE7EN andTHE USUAL SUSPECTSand thought that MAYBE a horror master like Wes Craven could pull it off (and save his own career in the process)...but when I saw ""Sidney's"" (Neve Campbell) boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) come through the window looking like he'd just gone through Hell, that was the dead giveaway to me as to who the killer was. I will admit that it took me a little hwile to realize Matt Lillard was the accomplice, but with the way he was always bashing the 'rules' it became obvious he was in on it as well.A total and complete failure in horror, and a complete let down for suspense films. I suggest going elsewhere for your horror/suspense fix.",Scream
803,Tarap13,Why Scream is so Good!,4,21 September 2001,"I absolutely love scream, and the rest of the scream movies, this one is my favorite though, I am a huge fan of the horror genre, I guess what attracted me to this movie was the simplicity of it, plus the characters and the actors who played them. also the gore was a plus, and the mind games between the killer and the victims that first 12 minutes is the best  part of the movie. Also it pays to tribute to several awesome horror movies, such as Halloween, Carrie, and Psycho. Overall this is a great movie and I urge everyone to go and see it.",Scream
804,ellie b,The Best Movie...EVER!,10,30 May 2001,"Okay, I have a problem and I can't help myself. I've watched it over a hundred times, I've memorised to entire script, I dream about it and make sure everyone within a ten-mile radius of me has seen it. I admit it-I'm addicted to Scream.Everything about this movie is genius. The extravagant death scenes, the witty humour and the on-the-edge-of-your-seat' excitement, all add up to make the greatest slasher movie of all time. In my opinion, Wes Craven should be crowned and made King of the World. He created the classic Nightmare On Elm Street and then went and conquered the horror genre once again with Scream. Combining his incredible directing and Kevin Williamson's expert writing, Scream was sure to be a winner right from the beginning.I think I'll side with the majority and say that my favourite scene is Casey Becker's part. With, once again, brilliant acting from Drew Barrymore, she manages to get away with such a long dying scene without it getting tedious.But it's not just the brilliant direction, writing and effects that make Scream so good, every one of the actors deliver a professional and convincing performance. Jamie Kennedy's movie geek Randy Meeks was particularly good. Also Neve Campbell's character was one of the few leading women in scary movies, that didn't make you want to slap her.I could fill a whole website with good things about Scream, but I won't. Instead I'll just say-GO SEE IT! It'll be one of the best movies you've ever seen!",Scream

To me this is the best movie ever created except for Superman of course. I know that not many people think its scary but the thing that makes its scary is that she trusted all of her friends and they just turn out too be crazy and the scary thing about that is that something like that could happen to anyone you never no who you can trust. I don't know its strange but something about that trilogy just does something to me. Its funny, and brilliant yet its scary in a way.",Scream
806,brianhackman,The updated teen-slasher movie that laughed at the genre while at the same time helped usher in a new generation of sleek horror films.,10,9 February 2011,"""Scream"" is a horror film that is a modern day horror movie that is terrifying roller-coaster ride of murder and black-hearted laughter. The director, Wes Craven, presents almost a reboot on the teen-slasher movies that were made popular in the 70s and 80s (such as ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). There are classic elements present within the film that give the audience a fright while at the same time address many clichés found within the horror genre.As portrayed in a great many horror movies, specifically teen-slasher movies, there is a surface theme of lost innocence. The protagonist, typically a woman, is pitted against a monstrously twisted (metaphorically or literally) antagonist that wants her dead, and her friends, and her family, and any pets. The protagonist has to quickly go from meek teenager into a mature woman in full survival mode if she wants to stay alive to see the credits roll.Sidney Prescott, portrayed by Neve Campbell, is our leading heroine whose friends and family fall victim to a serial killer who shows an affinity to horror movies. Her troupe of friends include: boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), along with friends Stuart (Matthew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy). Along with a well rounded support cast the plot of the film revolves around Sidney as the killer begins to slaughter those around her, with Sidney being the final prize.The antagonist in ""Scream"" is a serial killer that uses a common grocery store Halloween costume to mask his identity. This concealed identity provides the major engine for the plot to move forward, keeping the audience guessing as to who the real killer might be. It also provides the core theme presented in this film, trust. Specifically, when everyone around you could be a killer, who do you trust? This simple costume gives the film its menacing face, with ""ghost face"" becoming the symbolic and iconic face of this film's franchise.Early scenes in the film showcase the themes of trust and lost innocence. One scene in particular early on in the film between Sidney and Billy highlights the aforementioned themes. Sidney is emotionally charged having just survived her first brush with the killer when Billy crawls in through her window, seemingly to her rescue. Clever use of dialogue, props (a cell phone), and coincidence presents the audience, and Sidney, with the question of whether or not Billy is her savior or downfall. The scene presents Sidney's loss of innocence by having just survived her would be murderer, having to deal with the repercussions of that alone, along with a boyfriend whose questionable arrival time in the scene leaves her wondering if he could be the killer.On the classic 1 to 10 scale, I would give this movie a 10. ""Scream"" is a sleek and modern take on the old teen-slasher movies, and horror in general. The clever dialogue addressing the genre within the movie, the well shot scenes, and iconic killer make this film the ultimate horror movie of the 90s.",Scream

Kevin Williamson was a genius in the 90's, then he spread himself too thin and lost his edge. I guess he got what he wanted in the end, but I wish he would have stuck to the horror genre.

They were both excellent movies but I'm here to comment on the first one. Wes Craven (director)is a genius with horror movies. I think it was his genius along with an awesome cast and crew. Neve Campbell was a perfect casting as Sidney because she was actually stalked herself when she began acting so the part would have been quite easy to get used to. Jamie Kennedy played Randy just as he was supposed to be portrayed.Matthew Lillard was a hilarious Stu and Courtney Cox Arquette couldn't have been more of a b*tch if she tried!Of course, that was her character. David Arquette made it a perfect case of ""opposites attracting"" as sweet,slightly stupid,Dewey Riley. All in all, a movie masterpiece that is not given as much credit as it should.",Scream
811,landev-81721,Amazing movie the kept you in the edge of your seat,10,4 November 2020,"""Scream"" written by Kevin Williamson and produced by Cathy Konrod and directed by Wes Craven is a horror movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat for many reasons.
Basically, the movie starts off with the character, Casey Becker, played by Drew Barrymore, sitting home alone in a suburban town of Woodsboro, California and receiving a terrifying and threatening phone call. The person on the other end of the phone, has threatened her boyfriend's life if she does not correctly answer some horror movie trivia questions. Casey misses some questions, and she finds her boyfriend shortly after, dead on the back porch. She tries to escape, but she is attacked by the caller and slashed to death. Her parents find her hanging on the back tree when they arrive home. The special effects used here were very effective and breathtaking. They certainly heightened the fear factor.
This killing sends the neighborhood into a state of shock and fear. Shortly thereafter, a high schooler, Sidney Prescott, played by Neve Campbell is attacked in her home by someone wearing a deformed mask. In fact, this mask took on a life of its own, but It was so menacing that it is often used for Halloween to this day. Sidney manages to escape even though the odds seemed preclude and goes to the police station to report it. She leaves there and goes to her girlfriend's house and then receives a phone call. Unbeknownst to Sidney, the audience recognizes the voice as that of the killer. The sound director also made good use of putting in background music to add to the eerie feel as well. This is a good example of dramatic irony, therefor the viewer knows something the character does not. She hangs up and luckily nothing comes of the threat. However, the following day, the high school principal is ambushed at work and killed. School gets canceled and a curfew is put into place, but a group of teenagers have a party at the house of Billy Loomis, Sidney's boyfriend, played by Skeet Ulrich. A reporter, Gail Weathers, played by Courtney Cox, has placed a camera inside the house to watch the party. She sits in her van out front of the house. Gale had taken this case as she had covered Sidney's mother's murder the year before. Before long, the masked killer appears and slashes to death each person there except for Sidney and Gale who has come into the house. He painstakingly attacks each victim singly and the audience vigil from the victim's point of view. This sequential development of the plot increases the suspense and level of horror.
Sidney thinks Billy has been killed as well. Gale manages to get out of the house but does not go far as she is injured and servile. The murderer takes off the mask and standing there is Billy's best friend, Stu. However, it does not end there. Suddenly, Billy comes down the stairwell and his facial expression and body language let all know that he was in on it too. The directing is well done here as it is a point where the viewer's opinion of Billy drastically changes.
Before Sidney can even ask Billy why he has done this, Billy explains that it was Sidney's mother who was the reason his parents had gotten divorced and he wanted them to pay. This is an example of situational irony because the writer has used a romantic relationship to seek revenge for Billy's father's romantic relationship with Sidney's mother. Billy and Stu then bring out her father, who was supposed to be on a vacation. He is tied up and gagged. Billy's intention is to frame Sidney's father for all the killing by placing the voice changer he had used in the phone calls in the father's pocket. To make the whole scene more believable, Stu and Billy slash each other to look like victims. Gale reappears through the door and she and Sidney collaborate to fight Billy and Stu and reduce them enough to call the police and end the nightmare.
Considering the feeling one is left with at the movie, they can appreciate the title of ""Scream"" as you will be on the verge of screaming throughout the movie. As a viewer, I feel this film meets all the requirements of a horror movie and that it was entertaining, engaging, shocking, and a frightening movie. It told a story with not only surprising events but also spectacular special effects. In fact, others must agree as they have made six sequels to this movie.",Scream
812,montezinoo,The best slasher ever created.,10,26 January 2021,"🍿SCREAM (1996)This is the only movie that fights with A Nightmare On Elm Street for my favorite horror movie of all time spot. Let's talk about it!DIRECTING
Wes Craven is my all time favorite director, and there's a reason for it, he builds storys like no one else, he tells entire storys just on his camera moves, and I love it. This movie is beautifully shot, and has a giant budget feel, even with a not to big one (14 million).SCRIPT
Kevin Williamson was a genius writing this, smartly making homages to the horror genre, classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and pretty much every other classic ever. And this script is not only good because of the references, is so smart while giving fake clues, and having what's rhe best revelation ever imo. And of course Sidney, the best final girl ever.SOUNDTRACK
The soundtrack here, although not mentioned a lot is so freaking great! Even if you don't notice while eatching the movie, if you listen the score somewhere random, you'll know that's the scream soundtrack, and that's awsome, the score sets the tone of the movie basically, and this is one of my favs.ACTING
The acting here is top notch, and is the best acting in slashers by far. Every actor delievers a stelar perfomance, specially Matthew Lillard, Stu is one of my all time favorite characters, and my favorite Ghostface (next to Billy), Neve Campbell as Sidney is a perfect match, it's honestly shocking how great every single character is. I can't imagine other actor playing Stu, or Billy, or Randy, or Sidney. It's almost impossible for me.SPECIAL EFFECTS
The special effects are not what the movie is known for, like The Thing or The Fly, but for what it has in it, is flawless.DID I LIKE THIS MOVIE?
Do I really need to say? Of course! Scream is the only movie that can battle with A Nightmare On Elm Street for my fav of all time position, and that's saying something. Is directed by my favorite director ever, that's a win on it self, every character is amazingly awsome, specially Sidney and Stu. The score is iconic and one of my favs. I love literally every single second of this movie, and it's the one I have more fun watching.Total ⭐ SCREAM Gets a 10 out of 10",Scream
813,Tyler_Gast_13,"Perfectly Encapsulates The Genre, While Also Improving On It",10,10 November 2021,"Scream is one of those rare movies that you can always come back to and enjoy countless times. From the opening stinger to the ending plot twists, this film perfectly encapsulates the slasher genre, while also adding its own meta tropes and gags throughout. The characters are near perfect, and the setting is so believable that if you were shown a picture, you'd swear you lived there, and the meta humor builds this movie as one of the best slasher movies ever conceived. The fact that horror movie cliches can determine your fate puts a spin on the genre as a whole, and allows us to take a fresh look at the latest in blood and guts.

ANYWAY this is the best movie ever. My favorite character in the original was TATUM. she was funny. i was mad when she died. i think she should've survived for the sequel. For some reason Parker Posey's charactor Jennifer in part 3 reminded me of her. The last movie isn't written by kevin williamson. i was surprised when i found out.

824,arrtia,An amazingly creative yet somewhat generic movie,9,3 November 2021,"Wes Craven is an astonishing Director who had an extreme amount of work on horror films and had directed several of the most iconic horror films of all time, one of them being a creepy slasher-horror film that follows the lives (and deaths) of teenagers in Woodsboro, California. Wes Craven has done an amazing job on the movie ""Scream"", but he could not have done it without the writer Kevin Williamson. Williamson is great at developing a horror story quickly, with ""Scream"" having a lot happen in a short amount of time. At the start of the film, the viewer is introduced to Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore), a teenage girl just getting ready to watch a movie late at night home alone. Next thing you know, she's getting a phone call from an unknown number, which later turns into multiple phone calls, which leads to a trivia game of death. Williamson quickly puts a character in danger with his writing, not even five minutes into the movie. Craven does such an amazing job with this scene that it deserves plaudits, taking Williamson's writing and making it into the horrifying deaths of Steve and Casey that leave people shaken up. We get to see this scene from an outside point of view, better known as 3rd person. The camera angles tend to follow the action of who, or what is moving, rather than the main character of the scene. In the following scene, we are introduced to the main character Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), as he sneaks through her window, scaring her in the process. In the next few scenes, we get introduced to even more characters, one of the most important being Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard). Stuart just so happens to know how to gut a person and can explain it clearly when being asked right on the spot, which really doesn't look good for him. All three of these characters continue to be developed by Craven throughout the course of the movie, all the way to their final moments.The set of ""Scream"" has a very generic horror movie setting, 4 teenagers houses, along with their high school, in which we only see a few rooms. The lighting in certain scenes throughout the film makes some of the deaths as gory and gruesome they can be, as in bright light, some wouldn't be as believable as they are in darker. The most significant place in the story would be Stuart's house, a ranch house that was packed with unsuspecting teenagers at a party. There was no way any of the characters in the movie would know what is yet to come while at Stu's house, but the viewer may due the music playing in the background. The music score of ""Scream"", composed by Marco Beltrami, can be a key factor in dramatic irony throughout the movie. The music is extremely creepy and sets the mood for most of the deaths throughout the film. With the pace of each song increasing and decreasing, along with the sound level, it creates some extremely terrifying foreshadowing of what is to come.The movie's ending is a decently creepy, maybe even psychotic way of ending the film. It is learned by Sidney that both Billy and Stu were collaborating on the killings. Both tell Sidney their plan to frame her father and be the final two that were just left for dead, however, they end up wrangling each other, fighting about how deep each of them stabbed one another. After that, they get confronted by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), a churlish news reporter. They ended up being able to knock her out, but by the time they did that, Sidney was somewhere else in the house. In the end, Sidney, Gale, and another character, Randy, were all able to live to tell the tale of the Woodsboro Massacre. ""Scream"" ended how one would expect a horror movie to end; the killers are dead, and a ""final girl"" didn't fall victim to the killers.",Scream

827,alexgrady121,Non stop edge of seat thrill ride,9,24 March 2007,"I was initially quite sceptical about this movie. The image of a masked killer hunting down screaming teenagers as they run through their parents mansions trying escape just didn't appeal to me. However, from the moment Drew Barrymore picked up the phone in that incredible intro I was hooked. The pace and intensity so obvious in the opening is maintained throughout the entire film, which is due to Craven's excellent direction and of course Williamson's fantastic script. But the film also has another dimension for the more experienced horror film lover, it knowingly mocks past horror films in a very 90s this-is-so-lame-but-I-am-aware-of-that sort of way. Old clichés seen throughout the genre are repeated here, tongue firmly in cheek. In all, this film is entertaining from start to finish and I would recommend it to anyone, horror film enthusiast or not.",Scream
828,lmarsya,it was o.k,8,19 May 2007,i liked this movie because of some of these reasons the first one is that the story was excellent and also had a twist to it. but i expected a major body count instead of 5 people dying.Another reason this movie is o.k is that the Sidney's mom thing was boring.Although the characters in this were pretty brilliant.I like this because there was a lot of suspense.I loved the fact that Wed craven directed this movie.Iliked this one better than the third one.But the second one was the best.I also liked the movie cursed.I give this movie a 8.5 out of a 10.THis movie just completely rocks!.It was one of the most original movies i seen in years.I give it two thumbs up.,Scream
829,rootsbamboo,Perfectly constructed Film!!!,10,30 March 2002,"Scream is one of my favorite all time films! Everything about just rings perfect, the cast, the direction, the script. Yes, it did spawn other evil teen horror movies that sucked incredible crap but that shouldn't strike any points against it, it is time a remarkable film. Purposely blurring the lines between reality and fiction it comments on our society's obsession with the media. Neve plays it wonderfully straight, David Arquette creates one of the best characters in horror cinema history and Courtney Cox is a wonderfully bitchy back-up to the whole cast. Even Matt Lilard and Rose McGowan are wonderful! Scream is one of those rare movies where everything about it just gels instantly creating a film that hits all the perfect notes. It's scary and funny as hell and I just looove it.",Scream
830,HoRRoRCritic316,Probably the Best Horror Film Of The 1990s Easily,8,20 August 2002,"Looking back on Scream(this is now 6 years later of course),I realize what a true gem this movie is in the Horror Genre,along with the fact that it pretty much saved and brought back the slowly eroding Horror Genre,which had pretty much died in the early 90s. To Sum it up............. The acting was good-to-great in many standards.The leads(Neve Campbell,David Arquette,Courtney Cox) were great,and flat out well casted,although most of the Leads were not really established yet in Hollywood,but thats what made the film so fresh,and new. The supporting Cast of Jamie Kennedy,Skeet Ulrich,Matthew Lillard,Rose McGowan, and Henry Winkler were great as well,as they serve their purpose throughout the movie. Another Thing I liked about the movie,was that the characters really werent stereotypical characters like we have seen in many,many previous Horror Films,especially the 80s.Everyone was pretty much their own character,which is always nice to see,especially when the Hollywood of today insists on having a production factory based on stereotypical characters in all their films. The plot was well executed,and contsructed brilliantly in great syncronization.I wont go into any details,but I must say,I loved the plot,especially because its something knowone really has seen before in this Genre,or in any other Genres all together,it was different,unique,which is why it succeeded. The Direction from Wes was great,as can be expected of him,although I would heavily criticize the work from him on Scream 3,but thats a whole other story. Overall,This movie is great,different,and an unexpected roller coaster that keeps you guessing whats gonna happen until the end.Alot of people can appreciate this movie for what it is,but there are those(and I mean alot of them),who cant stand this movie,because of what was produced in the aftermath of the film,which were horrid imitations like I Know What You Did Last Summer,Urban Legends,etc which is absolutely correct,and I will agree with them,but if they look past all the Horrid movies that came after,they can truly appreciate what Scream did for the Genre,which was saved it,but again its a double edged sword,because some will say it ruined  the Genre. Oh well,thats my two cents,I reccomend to any who havent seen it,rent it,then decide if you want to buy it or not....... Bottom line,in my opinion,a true gem in the Horror Genre,any fan of the Genre should check this atleast once..... I'd give it a 8.5-10",Scream
831,coolschoolpine,Scream is a fun flick,10,28 July 2009,"Scream was not only scary, but it's also one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. From the terrifying opening sequence to the shocking twist ending, the movie was brilliant from start to finish. Unlike most horror movies, this had good acting from it's strong cast, especially from Drew Barrymore and Neve Campbell. Jaime Kennedy, David Arquette and Mathew Lillard were all hilarious in their roles. A lot of people give this movie flack because it brought in a lot of bad horror movies like Urban Legend and Valentine, but I thought this movie was really well made and at times pretty scary. Scream 2 was also pretty good, and in some ways even a bit better. Scream 3, however, wasn't very good. It had it's moments, but it just didn't work. If your looking for a fun and smart thriller, watch Scream. It's funny, well acted, scary and very original. The first twelve minutes are a Scream!",Scream
832,maynard011,Wez Craven-the mother of all slasher films,9,2 November 2008,"Scream- the mother of all slasher films. And it is the master of the slasher genre, Wes Craven, who once again hasn't failed to deliver with originality and style. The films twisted plot line incorporates everything that typically wouldn't be expected of a horror classic- humour, sex and gore. The consequences of each character is predictable, but nothing can prepare the audience for the unforgettably shocking beginning to the film. Take Drew Barrymore, the most famous actress in the film. A typical teenager, pretty, flirtatious and a love of scary movies. Butcher her boyfriendtelephone and mess with her head...then hang her from a tree, gutted inside out in the front garden all within the first fifteen minutes. Why not?! Scream turns what is expected upside down, making it more addictively special. Undercover killer on the loose, we are left racking our brains to uncover the truth. We are fed clues to the identity of the masked killer, and just as we think we've cracked who's responsible, there's another twist and we are thrown into the unknown again. As characters are killed off, the more suspicious we become of those who remain, ensuring guaranteed surprise at the end.Highlighting the dark secrets within an idyllic neighbourhood, Scream shows no one is safe, dropping the audience straight in, with the horrific beginning and leaving with a cliff hanger at the end. But above all, Scream leaves the audience with constant fear of the infamous phone callwho will be phoned next?...",Scream

I was one of those people who thought scary movies were disgusting and very pointless, however, after my friend and I watched Scream at his house, my mind was changed. To stop right there, I still found most of those other movies still very unentertaining. I fell in love with Scream because it certainly redefined the horror genre. Some say it is the child of Halloween, but after recently watching Halloween for the first time, I can now say that that is totally untrue. Halloween was all bark and no bite, period. Scream, though, is very funny, thrilling, suspenseful, and quite thought provoking. Since seeing it I have seen tons of other horror films and none of them live up to Scream, at all.",Scream

It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Lots of movies have copied scream since but back when it opened it was original and not what anybody has seen before. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore is still one of the most memorable movie scenes for me. The acting in this movie to go with the writing are on the of the reasons this movie will be a classic. If you like to see well acted, and well written edge of your seat stuff. Go get this movie on DVD, guaranteed you won't be disappointed.",Scream
836,teddygunn,Scream!,10,22 April 2011,"The most unique teen slasher flick ever made, Scream is easily Wes Craven's best slasher movie. Starring Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, and with a special appearance by Drew Barrymore, Scream has a well rounded cast. Despite a relatively simple plot, this film manages to captivate the audience with excellent acting and suspenseful, well-crafted scenes. This film may not be for everyone, as it does contain some strong violence and features mainly teenagers as the central characters. Scream expertly fuses slasher-horror genre, comedy and suspense thriller, which could have been a messy experience, but instead creates an exciting, enthralling movie that both revives and parodies the slasher genre.",Scream
837,shln4,Horror movie? More like a light-hearted comedy.,7,31 October 2015,"I had high expectations before watching this famous horror movie, and as I don't usually watch movies from this genre, I was a a bit scared that this will be too frightening for me.It turned out that it was completely unnecessary for me to be worried. There wasn't a single moment in the movie which made me scream, and the jump-scares were predictable even for someone who isn't familiar with the genre. Most of the acting was worse than what we see in a home video, and it wasn't hard to guess who the killer is, although the ending gives a little bit of a twist to the plot.On the contrary, the whole movie seemed like a parody, and if we look at it this way, it is quite a funny film, with lots of laugh-out-loud moments. The movie has some comedic characters who are witty and fun to watch. It is also excellent for a drinking game: drink whenever someone dies, screams, a phone rings, and a horror movie is mentioned. All in all, I would recommend you to watch this movie with your friends. Don't expect to be scared, but expect and enjoyable evening.",Scream
838,jackahern007,Great horror movie and a great satire,9,29 April 2011,"This movie is one of my favorite by Wes Craven if only because of his ability to know every cliché' he uses in his own movies. It is amazing that this movie can be so scary, a suspenseful who-done-it, and a hilarious spoof all in one. The body of this movie is about an 8 and the great beginning and ending pull it up to a nine in my book. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good slasher, however, I feel like people should see some other classic horror movies (eg. Nightmare on Elm street, Halloween, Friday the Thirteenth, etc.) to enjoy this to the fullest because the little things in this movie create hilarity sometimes. See this movie when you have a genuine knowledge of horror movies but it is also still great if you don't.",Scream

But the man calls again, this time to apologize for his previous error. Minutes passes by and Drew talks to the man on the phone, thinking he's kind of fun. They even flirt a little with each other. But soon the man starts getting more and more creepy and aggressive. The first so innocent phone call turns into a total nightmare.The reason I love ""Scream"" is that it's such a great mixture of excitement, horror and comedy. It's impossible to guess what's gonna happen next and the actors are phenomenal. It's scary, funny and you are on your toes the whole movie through, guessing how it all will end.

I'm a very restless kind of guy by nature and virtue of my sign (not that I believe in astrology, but Sagittariuses never believe it) and couldn't go through the whole movie uninterrupted by a snack, a beer and an occasional pee. So I decided to watch it thoroughly not long ago and make up my mind what all the hype was about. I got seriously disappointed. Having enjoyed some of Wes Craven's works, including the original Nightmare on Elm Street(and the only one of the sequels worth watching twice), I expected the 'this movie resuscitated the dying horror genre' marketing strategy to live up to the hype. But to no avail. First off, let me get this straight: the 'horror genre' never died or has been sent to the ICU. Not since Halloween and Alien gave it a definitive boost, drove a spike into the heart of the 'B Movie' stigma and catapulted sci-fi and horror to their rightful heights. So I never bought the flat out lie that sells this mediocre movie and franchise as 'new flesh in the dark heart of cinema'. There's nothing new, nothing original, nothing worth wasting 1 hour and a half and the only heritage this movie may have spawned was a hundred miles of expensive film rolls in the form of 'I know what you did last summer' and a dumbing down of horror movie standards proudly carried over by the cult followers of bad taste. 2/10 for the effort.",Scream

Now her and her friends (Tatum, Rose McGowan, Billy, Skeet Ulrich, Stu, Matthew Lillard, Randy, Jamie Kennedy, and Casey, Drew Barrymore) will have to fight for their lives.

However the juvenile gags (""liver alone"") and the dark humour give the film multiple contrasting ways of making the audience lose all control of there bladder. Admittedly I am one of very few people who think that scream's best aspect is its humour, but surely no one can say, honestly, that they didn't laugh at least 5 or more times. Scream manages to capture a realistic view of teenage culture, however simultaneously juxter supposing teenage culture that we (teenage audiences) can relate to, with the flaws in teenage culture and the ideals we possess (whether 100% factual or not).

Excellent acting, tension, music, and death scenes, make this one of Wes Craven's masterpieces!

Never drink or do drugs. 2. Never have sex. 3.

Then you are transported into the life of the main character (who's mother died a year early by the way) and follows her reaction to the killings then suddenly her attack from the ghostface killer. Following her tribes and tribulations of the attack and so on, we are pushed further into the world of scream.

849,wildbanchichik,Scream is awesome!,10,16 March 2005,"Scream is one of my all time favorite movies. As a fact most most rated R horror movies are trashy as h*ll. There is always nudity and sex scenes i mean come on. I thought it was a really good story line. It keeps you guessing until the very end. Wes Craven plays it out so everybody is a suspect. It was a good mix of cast and characters as well. I though Neve Campbell did a great job as Sidney! The Innocent victim and sole prey of a physco killer. The movie starts out at the house of 17 year old Casey Becker. A deep, creepy voice calls and threatens to kill her and her 18 year old boy friend Steven Orth.Even the first few minutes caught my full attention. The next day reporters and cops are sweeping the area for any clues and information. Unfortionatley for poor Sidney this is all but to familiar. Just less then a year ago her mother was raped and murdered by... Cotton Weary. Now she isn't sure anymore. And Tabloid Twit Gale Weather is out to prove his innocence and get the latest scoop on the story, no matter who gets hurt in the process. A group of 5 friends find their way into the middle of the bloodbath. The anniversary of her mother's death is approaching. Her father goes out of town and Sid is left to stay with her best friend Tatum Riley. who's brother, Dewey is a cop in Woodsboro. After being nearly killed, Sid'd boyfriend appears and the killer disappears. Billy spends a few nights in prison. She still gets a call from the killer that night at Tatum's. By this time my eyes were glued to the screen. Who is the killer and why do they want Sidney dead so much. Was it the same person who slaughtered and raped her mother the year before? Was it Randy Meeks the virgin who is obsessed with horror movies? Tatum Sidney best friend? Stu (the best character!) Tatum's awesome boyfriend. Billy Loomis Sidney boyfriend and right now the only suspect none to the police? Dewey Riley Taum's brother and cop for Woodsboro? Gail Weather the reporter who will do ANYTHING for a story and has no feelings for anybody? Or Sidney's dad who is no where to be found after the killings started.

I love how the scenes aren't to bloody except for the ending scene. This movie is so awesome I love Kevin Williamson for writing such a great film. Also I love Wes Craven for directing it . I love his movies.

This movie is so good I Bought the box set and everything.There is a lot of hints in this movie that is similar to Halloween.......like go to the Makenzies is in both Halloween and scream. I also like how all the screams tie together to create the trilogy ... like roman causing it all and how him and Sidney share a moment at the end of scream 3. I also enjoy how old cast members appear in the other screams like Stu Macher(Mathew Lillard walks by in scream 2 when he is supposed to be dead and randy (Jamie Kennedy appears in scream 3 in the video to explain the rules to Sidney and Dewey..Once again I really love this movie and I hope everyone else does too,Scream

852,gettingsarianna,scream is one of the best slasher films o date,9,27 November 2015,"Going into the viewing of this movie, after watching 2-3 horror movies previously, I had a certain picture in my head of what a horror movie would consist of. After viewing the movie Scream, I was surprised to say the least. Not only is this movie completely different from the basic horror slasher films, but it is different in a way that pleases the audience. While this movie does have the same characteristics, such as the tropes and the last girl who survives, it also has numerous unforeseen plot twists and a humorous aspect. While in previous horror films, whether I had seen them previous to watching them in my college class or not, there is a well known killer in each (ie, Michael Myers in Halloween, Freddy Kruger in Nightmare on Elm Street), we don't have this in Scream. Scream starts off with a teenage girl being alone in her home making popcorn and receiving a phone call that soon turns intensifying. This call thus leads into the death of the girl's boyfriend and her own death while her parents are merely a couple feet away. The film transitions to the girl's high school, where things are chaotic over the death of these two people. Fear sets in and people are on edge at all times, even with the constant police presence. While seeing all this chaos at the school we meet the main character, Sydney, who we meet in a scene where her boyfriend sneaks in her window, is the virginal character. The movie continues to strike fear in the audience when we hear the phone ring and we see the killer attack Sydney. Throughout the movie there are many plot twists but the ultimate plot twist is when we figure out who the killer(s) are and what their motives were for killing all those people. Also, this movie was a good start to many, now famous, actors and actresses careers. While this made things a little less scary for me, as I am familiar with Matthew Lillard playing Shaggy in the Scooby Doo movies and Courtney Cox from Friends, it made me more interested to watch the movie as I knew the people in it. Overall, this movie will definitely be one of, if not my number one, favorite horror film.",Scream
853,imanialyse,If you are looking for cleverly crafted thriller Scream is most definitely for you.,7,3 December 2015,"Scream is often disregarded as just another cheesy slasher film to those who have not seen it, or are not a fan of the horror genre. Though yes Scream is considered a slasher film it marks something different for the horror slasher genre. I admit I entered watching this film with an expectation of slasher trademarks, bad acting, easy kills, bad decisions made by the main characters, a masked killer. Let me say I was more than pleasantly surprised by the artistry in this film in comparison to its predecessors such as Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. Wes Craven has been credited with the classic film direction for Nightmare on Elm, but Scream takes you to another level of creativity. With a sense of mystery as well as the gore of a slasher it makes for an enjoyable experience.The movie acts as an interesting double narrative, allowing the watcher to become invested in a murder mystery, while also getting a commentary on prior slasher film conventions. Characters are found making direct references to previous slashers sometimes even making fun of them. There are also several visual tricks used in reference to past films. One of the easiest ones to pick up on is one of the characters in Scream Billy's striking resemblance to Johnny Depps character in, you guessed it, Nightmare on Elm Street. There are also several other little nuances lovers of classic horror can pick up on , from cameos to name similarities.If you are looking for cleverly crafted thriller Scream is most definitely for you. It is a movie that continuously keeps you guessing with just the right amount of jump scares and red herrings. The twist ending will leave you wondering what clues you may have missed even prompting you to watch again. I know I would.",Scream

856,zakster90,What is the greatest Slasher of the 90's? Its right here!,10,15 August 2016,"For the record, this is less of a review of the movie itself, and more of a review on the entire idea behind it and what to expect.What do you get when you pair up the master of suspense Wes Craven with a upstarting writer with a fresh idea? Some would say Hollywood gold, and it did do that just fine, but more important is taking the genre and flipping it on its head.This film is a masterpiece of its time. Some would regard the movie as a bit goofy, but it really comes down to its reality based, unpredictable nature. This film will put you in a situation where you are involved with something that impacts your emotions in ways you are not used to. From the brutal violence, clever dialogue, and a story that will mess with your mind over the course of its 4 film saga.Its not your typical film, which is one reason why it did so well at the box office and has stuck around as such an iconic horror film. This was the beginning of the end of Wes Craven's career, with Scream 4 being his last ever film. He really did pull out all the stops and hat tricks he learned over the years and put all his eggs in this basket.As each film builds, you see how the story evolves with the times and with the characters. Its so rare to see a saga span such a long period of time with the same cast and the same crew and be executed with perfection.Without getting involved with what happens in this film as I want to keep this spoiler free, go into this with an open mind, (remember this was 1996 so cell phones were still not the norm like they are now) and watch the story grow from one film to the next as everything unfolds in a way that was not intended originally, but ended up being one of the most perfect horror film franchises ever.",Scream

858,xScReAmx,Truly a Classic,10,12 April 2006,"Scream without a doubt can be considered a cult classic in the horror genre. It's sarcastic humor, extreme gore factor, and creepiness combined make Scream one of the best, if not, the best horror movies of all time. It's strong ensemble, probably the best ever in a horror movie, consisting of Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Skeet ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and drew barrymore all bring out their characters in an unbelievable way (considering horror is not a genre known for its great acting) The script written by Kevin williamson is probably one of the best parts of the movie especially the sarcastic humor as it refers to other movies of the genre and the suspenseful and witty dialogue undoubtfully along with the great acting. Let's not forget suspense master wes Craven, who pretty much created the death scenes and shocking violent movies that truly made this movie one to be remembered.",Scream

860,KRudd708,A masterpiece,10,24 August 2019,"The greatest teen scream of my generation and Wes Craven never disappoints. Scary at a time when not everyone had a cellphone and shows the real true meaning of scary. And putting other horror genre in the mix with the storyline..... just incredible. Scream is the Psycho of my generation. A completely ""could happen to you"" scare. And a plus..... the sequels stayed true to its original and are just as amazing",Scream
861,jduval-76485,Nostalgic Film,10,27 October 2017,"I am a Huge Wes Craven fan! I mean there has not been one film I have seen of his that I have not been impressed with. Any one who knows me, knows that if I am choosing the movie, it is going to be a Horror Movie. For as long as I can remember Scream has always been my #1 Favorite! The cast that was picked for this movie could not have worked better together. Still after all the years that have passed & new Horror Movies have been released, I still find myself wanting something as good or better then Scream, I have not found myself very impressed! There will always be something so nostalgic about this film that can never be replaced!",Scream

I was so, so upset I wanted to play the SCREAM QUIZ, but I couldn't!! Someone should seriously make a SCREAM board game!! I would have so much fun with the game!!! I have the movies totally memorized even thought I only watch them like 4 times a year!! When I first got the trilogy set I used to watch them every night before bed, but now I don't have the time!! Too much work and school, lol!!!",Scream
864,g-amp-eharding,Scream is FINOMINAL!,10,26 January 2006,"Scream is my favorite movie along with Scream 2 and 3. It offers some laughs, it is full of scares, and an excellent plot. Very original, a great and smart twist. Definitely great materials for a movie. Neve Campbell is a beautiful and extremely talented actress. She plays the innocent, ""sexually-anorexic"" Sidney Prescott in the town of Woodsboro. One night two body's are found, one gutted, another hung. There is a killer on the loose, and body's keep piling up. Along with David Arquette as Officer Dewey Riley, Courtney Cox-Arquette as ambitious reporter Gale Weathers, Rose Mcgowan as Tatum Riley; Sidney's best friend and Dewey's younger sister, Skeet Ulrich as suspicious boyfriend of Sidney's; Billy Loomis, and Matthew Lillard as Tatum Riley's funny, party-hosting boyfriend, Stu. They all are great actors put together. This movie and the second and third movie are all well-deserving 10's.",Scream

867,sophscharlottevilla,Avoided for years! Massive misjudgement,8,30 October 2018,"I honestly avoided this film for years thinking it was just another teen slasher like all the rest. Boy was I wrong.
The film is so aware of itself and the horror genre as a whole which now in 2018 is commonplace but back then must have been so ahead of its time.It's not without its faults but it has fast become one of my most enjoyed horrors.",Scream
868,jesssakura,"Scream, from a new fan!",10,17 October 2018,"Kathy Conrad and the rest of the production team collaborated to create the brilliantly captivating horror movie, ""Scream."" This classic film describes an original storyline of four high school students experience when a psychopath killer is on the loose. As the film begins, Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) is in a predicament. She is on the phone with a mystifying man, who is holding her boyfriend captive. News quickly spreads that the young couple were murdered. Sidney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) mother was coincidentally murdered around this time last year. Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), who is a news reporter, is convinced that Sidney's father is in fact the killer. As the story progresses, one of Sidney's friends hosts a big party at his mansion. Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) also attends the party alongside Deputy Dewey (David Arquette), who stands guard. This is where the story evolves and escalates. The theme of this film, which is revenge, is very compelling, realistic and original. The story flows well and unfolds through the action of the film. When the killer is about to kill a victim, the scenes transitions are abrupt and will make the viewer shake with anticipation. The stories timeline is sequential which creates apprehension. The film is believable because the horror is psychological, and the revenge motive is common. When the audience and Sidney find out who the killer is, the audience is left speechless. The perplexing and discordant plot twists leave the viewers in awe as Conrad, Wes Craven, and Kevin Williamson shock the whole audience. 
Mark Irwin, John K. Adams, Mark B. Byers and Peter D. Flanagan created the setting for ""Scream."" The setting is a small town in California called Woodsboro. The creepy mansion is a typical setting for a horror movie because the kids were isolated and far from the heart of town. The small town sustains an uneasy feeling throughout the film. Creepy music starts to play whenever tension builds up between characters or when something bad is about to occur. For example, when Sidney's friend was alone in the garage and started to hear strange noises, music started to play, which indicated that she was in trouble. The sound levels rise and fall according to the scenarios in the film. The volume increases when something dramatic happens, and decreases when the drama ends. Byers's special effects are effective at enhancing the horror and suspense. These effects add to the feeling of consternation after a character is murdered. This leaves the audience terrified. The foley is outstanding and does not detract from the action. All of these elements of horror work together to make the film a perfect blend of technical and artistic qualities. Wes Craven flawlessly executed these elements which is why the film received many plaudits. ""Scream"" successfully evokes a natural response from the audience as if they were really witnessing something horrific. From gasps, wincing and increased heart rates, this film will shock the audience with a perfect horror representation.",Scream
