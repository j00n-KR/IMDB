0,TheLittleSongbird,Pointless remake,1,1 October 2011,"I have nothing against remakes in general, some are great, some are good, some are quite, some are both awful and pointless. The remake to the classic Halloween(1978) isn't only awful, as a remake and on its own merits, but like the Psycho, Nightmare on Elm Street, Wicker Man and Stepford Wives remakes it is also pointless.Not only is it awful, pointless and not scary at all, but it is the complete opposite of the original in every way. Sorry about the comparing, but in this case it is inevitable.The film is not cheap as such, but just not atmospheric. The camera angles do get obvious after a while and the editing gets a little frenzied. Some of the music was nice, but the cues like the camera angles seemed obvious in how they were placed and it isn't successful at enhancing the mood of the film.Halloween(2007) does also have some awful dialogue, particularly in the Loomis and Myers scenes that are ridden with clichés. The story is just not very interesting this time round, it is timeless in notion for sure but not in execution. The film feels more like a very dodgy homage and Rob Zombie fails to re-create what made Halloween work so well(the primal fears, the truly demonic characterisation of Michael Myers and how the scares are used). Also the film does take too long to set up and the sexual talk gets too much and disturbing after a while.Also disappointing is how Halloween(2007) incorporates its scares. Instead of the suspenseful atmosphere and genuine jolts that the original had, this remake does something that the original cleverly avoided, using excessive gore and treating it in a cheap fashion.I didn't care for the characters either, all of them are badly-underwritten, especially McDowell's Loomis. The character of Michael Myers also disappoints greatly, it is not demonic enough with the potentially unnerving characterisation completely stripped bare and I agree contradictory in an attempt to explore his background.The acting is pretty awful. Malcolm McDowell is a great actor and has saved a not-so-good-movie more than once, but seeing how weak his character and dialogue is, not this time. Scout Taylor-Compton can't do anything with her role either, and while I blame the script more than anything else Tyler Mane comes more as a badly-written greasy-haired psychotic killer rather than a personification of terror. The less about Sherri Moon Zombie the better, for my money she can't act if her life depended on it.In conclusion, pointless and very disappointing. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween
1,SnoopyStyle,a beautifully ugly and brutally violent run-on sentence,6,25 November 2015,"It's Halloween, Haddonfield, Illinois. Disturbed 10-year-old Michael Myers murders the school bully, his mother's crude boyfriend Ronnie, his older sister Judith and her boyfriend Steve. His stripper mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) returns to find Michael with his baby sister Angel Myers. He is sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium and Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). His disturbing behavior and murderous ways continue. Deborah commits suicide. Fifteen years later, Michael escapes. Best friends Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris) and Lynda Van Der Klok (Kristina Klebe) go through their day on Halloween while Michael stalks them.I really love the child Michael and his cold detached personality. His white trash dysfunctional family is great. Honestly, this could be the entire movie. Rob Zombie could have rebooted Halloween by essentially doing a prequel. Instead of a concentrated story, it feels more like a run-on sentence, a beautifully ugly and brutally violent sentence. Laurie Strode only comes on midway through the movie. I love Danielle Harris and her connection to Halloween but she's too old to play a teenager. Rob Zombie would be better off leaving Laurie to the second movie and Danielle Harris should play an adult now.",Halloween
2,claudio_carvalho,"Great Beginning, Annoying Conclusion",5,28 September 2009,"In Haddonfield, Illinois, the nine years old Michael Meyers (Daeg Faerch) is raised by a dysfunctional family: his mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper in a night-club; his foster father Ronnie (William Forsythe) is an alcoholic bum; his sister Judith (Hanna Hall) is a easy girl; and he is connected to his baby sibling. On October, 31st, after an incident in school where he is bullied by a schoolmate, Michael overhears the conversation of the principal and the psychiatric Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) with his mother. They had found pictures of Michael torturing animals in his backpack and Dr. Loomis would like to send Michael for psychiatric evaluation believing that the boy is deranged. This revelation triggers Michael that escapes from the school and kills the bully, Ronnie, Judith's boyfriend Steve Haley and his sister Judith. Michael is held in custody in the Smith's Grove Sanatorium under the treatment of Dr. Loomis. Eleven months later, during the visit of his mother, Michael kills his nurse and his stressed mother commits suicide. Fifteen years later, Michael (Tyler Mane) escapes from the mental institution leaving bloodshed behind, and heads to Haddonfield in the Halloween's night. This prequel of ""Halloween"" has a great beginning, giving a good explanation to the behavior of John Carpenter's character Michael Meyers (I hope that the cult-director John Carpenter has agreed with this origins of Michael Meyers). I liked this movie a lot until the moment that Michael escapes from the sanatorium. When the annoying Laurie Strode appears, the story is destroyed with stupid and exaggerated scenes, like for example, Michael is shot by the police officer, stabbed in the shoulder by a dagger, receives three shots of Magnum 357 and he does not feel anything. Only the hole of a Magnum 357 would suffice to kill him or at least provoke a serious hemorrhage. Jamie Lee Curtis in the original movie was the ""queen of the scream""; unfortunately Scout Taylor-Compton is extremely annoying. No police officer or car arrives at Michael Meyers' house despite the blood bath in the other houses and the abduction of Laurie. Last but not the least, the movie is a collection of clichés of the genre. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Halloween – O Início"" (""Halloween – The Beginning"")",Halloween
3,nogodnomasters,I want to do it with the mask on.,8,30 October 2019,"Young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) has been abused as a child by everyone. Malcolm McDowell is the psychologist who tries to help him and stripper Sheri Moon Zombie is his mother. He is bullied and abused by a crippled William Forsythe who lives with his mother. He snaps and then we go 15 years later, escape and you know the story.This is the Rob Zombie horror-porn version of the story. What is great about the production is that it includes the ""A"" listers of ""B"" horror which also includes: Clint Howard, Brad Dourif, Udo Kier, Bill Moseley, Leslie Easterbrook, Dee Wallace, Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Sybil Danning, Danny Trejo, and Monkee Micky Dolenz to name a few.Decent remake.Guide: F-word, rape, sex, nudity (Kristina Klebe, Hanna Hall, Danielle Harris and not Sybil Danning)",Halloween
4,Sleepin_Dragon,I find it hard to fault.,8,13 November 2020,"I've previously been critical of Halloween follow ups, and some of Rob Zombie's films, but this, I thought excellent.The original is one of my favourite films, certainly my favourite horror film, it was a game changer. I had always shuddered at the thought of it being remade, but this, nowhere near the quality of the original, but it's a cracking movie.I'd call it quite a respectful remake, they of course out a new spin on it, but they keep some scenes, they even keep some of the music, I suppose they knew full well that some things were worth keeping.I loved the backstory of Michael, we see him go from troubled child to brutal killer.What it certainly is, is violent, not so much in terms of suspense, there are no scares, or those moments when you see him appear from a shadow, you get some brutal scenes, as you'd expect from Me Zombie.Nailed it, 8/10.",Halloween
5,jboothmillard,Halloween,6,4 November 2014,"I was rather sniffy around the time this film was released, I really didn't think a remake of the John Carpenter classic was necessary, but I saw relatively positive reviews for it, so I braced myself to watch, directed by Rob Zombie (House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects). Basically in Haddonfield, Illinois, ten year old Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) has a very troubled life, his mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) works as a stripper and has constant fights with abusive boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe), and he is bullied at school. Michael slowly shows signs of psychopathic tendencies, with child psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) showing evidence, photographs of animals he has tortured and killed, it is on Halloween that Michaels wears a clown mask and beats school bully Wesley Rhoades (Spy Kids' Daryl Sabara) to death. Later that night Michael's older sister Judith (Forrest Gump's Hanna Hall) refuses to take him trick or treating so she can have sex with her boyfriend Steve Haley (Adam Weisman), while Deborah is out Michael savagely kills Ronnie, Steve and Judith, sparing only his baby sister who he cradles afterwards, he is convicted of first degree murder and incarcerated in the Smith's Grove mental hospital. Dr. Loomis treats Michael, he cooperates but claims to have no memory of the killings, Deborah visits him weekly and he begs to go home, after months of unproductive treatment Micharl starts wearing handmade masks and talks much less, then he snaps and kills Nurse Wynn (Sybil Danning), distraught that his son cannot be helped Deborah commits suicide. Fifteen years pass and adult Michael (X-Men's Tyler Mane) has become completely mute and his face remains hidden behind the masks he makes, locked in a sanitarium Dr. Loomis finally decides to give up treating him and moves on to write a best-selling book about the mind of a killer from childhood to now and the evil that cannot be helped. When he gets his opportunity, being prepared for transfer to maximum security, Michael escapes his cell, killing sanitarium employees, including janitor Ismael Cruz (Danny Trejo), stopping at a gas station to kill truck driver Big Joe Grizzly (Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree) for his overalls, and he returns to Haddonfield, arriving on Halloween at his old abandoned home, recovering a kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night of the murders. In the town are student friends Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), Annie Brackett (Halloween 4 and 5's Danielle Harris) and Lynda Van Der Klok (Kristina Klebe), Laurie throughout the day sees Michael watching from a distance, that night she is babysitting Tommy Doyle (Skyler Gisondo) at the family residence. Lynda meets her boyfriend Bob Simms (Nick Mennell) at the Myers house, Michael murders them, he then heads for Laurie's house and murders her parents Mason (Pat Skipper) and Cynthia (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial's Dee Wallace), by this time Dr. Loomis has been informed of Michael's escape and heads for Haddonfield, with a handgun, and he tries to convince Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif), he tells Loomis that Laurie is Michael's baby sister. Laurie meanwhile is convinced by Annie to babysit the girl she was supposed to be watching, Lindsey Wallace (Jenny Gregg Stewart), so she can have sex with her boyfriend Paul (Max Van Ville), Michael kills Paul during sex and attacks Annie who is left barely alive and bloodied, Laurie finds this while bringing Lindsey home and calls the police. Michael appears, attacks Laurie and chases her, while Sheriff Brackett and Loomis respond to the police call, Michael then kidnaps Laurie, approaching her and trying to show he is her brother, presenting photo of the siblings with their mother, she is unable to understand and grabs his knife to stab him and escape. Michael is not dead, Loomis shows up and tries to intervene, but Michael attacks him, Laurie grabs Loomis's gun and the chase by Michael continues, to the point that both are on the top floor of the house and are knocked over the railing, Michael appears dead, but Laurie aims the gun at his head and pulls the trigger repeatedly until it fires, just when Michael grabs her wrist. Also starring Richard Lynch as Principal Chambers, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective's Udo Kier as Morgan Walker, Clint Howard as Doctor Koplenson, Tom Towles as Larry Redgrave, Bill Moseley as Zach 'Z-Man' Garrett, Micky Dolenz as Derek Allen and Sid Haig as Chester Chesterfield. McDowell is a good choice for the character originally played perfectly by Donald Pleasance, Taylor-Compton is not as effective as Jamie Lee Curtis was and the new Michael Myers is still menacing. The key elements of the original remain, such as the killer's white mask and John Carpenter's iconic music, but what makes this remake a revamp also is the clever idea of finding the origins of Michael Myers, seeing how he became evil in childhood, perhaps in a way trying to make him more human, but of course he is still seemingly indestructible, it obviously cannot compete with the outstanding original, but this is actually better than you may expect, a watchable horror. Good!",Halloween
6,ma-cortes,"Michael Myers portrayal from his childhood, sanatorium breakaway until arrival to Haddonfield",5,22 April 2009,"This eerie film based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill starts on Halloween 1963,Haddonfield, Illinois. In a house happens a massacre by an estranged little boy named Michael Myers against his stepfather(William Forshyte), sister and boyfriend, while his mother(Sheri Moon married to Rod Zombie) is working in a night-club. 11 months later the mentally unstable Michael is interned into Smith's Grove prison and attended by Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell).15 years later Michael(Tyler Mane) breaks out doing a carnage. Myers returns to Haddonfield looking for his baby sister.Meanwhile Dr. Loomis attempts to warn Laurie(Taylor Compton) , a police agent(Brad Dourif) and residents remaining ,before Myers does. Again Michael sports a mask and executes an interminable body-count.This chiller contains grisly killings, disturbing horror, scabrous violence, shocking, nudism and lots of blood and gore. The horrible assassinations are extremely gory and nauseatingly violent with abundant shots showing stabbing, punch,beheading and gruesome deeds. Appear a plethora of secondaries actors, as cult's actors(Udo Kier,Richard Lynch,Sybil Danning), cameos(Clint Howard,Danny Trejo, Ken Foree,Dee Wallace) and Rod Zombie's usual(Bill Moseley,Sid Haig),among others. Habitual creaky and classic leitmotif musical by John Carpenter, adding frightening musical score by Tyler Bates. This is one of the best Halloween series along with the original film by Carpenter and Halloween II(1981) by Rick Rosenthal , the successive and never-ending sequels are inferior. The motion picture well produced by Dimension Films(Harvey and Bob Weinstein) and Malek Akkad, son of the producer Moustapha Akkadd(produced all movies) whom is dedicated this film, he died at 2005 in Amman , Jordan by injured sustained terrorist bombing caused by Al Qaeda.",Halloween
7,BA_Harrison,"Stick to grind-house horror, Robyou're better at it!",2,10 October 2007,"With its precise direction, slick cinematography, talented and likable cast, and excellent use of a particularly menacing score, John Carpenter's Halloween was a highly polished exercise in perfection. In contrast, Rob Zombie's 'reimagining' of the Michael Myers mythos is an ill-considered mess, delivering the director's grungy 'white trash' aesthetic, an incongruous soundtrack of rock classics, lots of gore and nudity, a raft of characters one couldn't give a damn about, and very little in the way of originality.And perhaps, worst of all, Michaelthe personification of evil in the original movieis given a back story that robs the character of his status as 'the bogeyman'. He is now, like so many other movie killers, simply the product of a poor upbringing (his sister is a slut, his step-dad is a foul-mouthed drunk, and mum is a stripper). As a lank-haired ten-year old, poor little Michael is bullied, both at school and at home; one day he snaps, butchers his tormentors, and ends up incarcerated in a mental institute where he falls under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). There he remains until adulthood, too dangerous to ever be released.Not only is all of this twaddle completely unnecessary, but it is far too long in the telling, and, by the time Zombie has finished trying to make us feel sympathetic towards his psycho, a good 40 minutes or so has passed. It seems like much longer.Anyway, Michael eventually manages to escape (thanks to a particularly dumb guard who is, for some reason, unafraid of 7ft tall mass murderers that are built like a brick outhouse), and legs it to his home town of Haddonfield to look for his baby sister Lauriethe only remaining member of his family.From this point on the film gets even worse, as Zombie introduces his audience to the now grown-up Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton)a thoroughly annoying and obnoxious teen with an even more unlikeable circle of friendsand proceeds to (loosely) follow the original's plot, stealing chunks of dialogue verbatim, whilst adding his own (mostly crap) touches and choosing to omit some of Carpenter's finer moments (the excellent closet attack scene is missing, for example).After much screaming and bloodletting, but practically no atmosphere or scares, sole survivor Laurie is rescued by Loomis, who unloads his revolver into Michael. The End. Thank goodness.Halloween '07 is pretty much a failure on all levels: it's ugly to look at, boring to watch, and insulting to horror fans. What this film does do successfully, however, is drive home the fact that some classics should never be remade. Especially by Rob Zombie.",Halloween
8,paul_haakonsen,"Behind these eyes one finds only blackness, the absence of light...",6,17 August 2017,"I do enjoy horror movies and slasher movies, but always found Michael Myers to be inferior to the likes of Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger respectively. Why? Well, Jason has a personality despite being a silent killer, and Freddy is just cruel and toys with his prey, while Michael is just a nondescript killer wearing a mask.Now, I do enjoy Rob Zombie's music, but his foray into directing has been a somewhat up and down experience; some movies have been quite good, while others were just downright bad. However, for the most part of his vision of Michael Myers and the early years that formed him was quite good.Most of the movie takes place during the childhood years of Michael Myers, and this is where Rob Zombie shines as a director, because the character gallery here is just phenomenal and the dialogue is very suited for the characters. However, once Michael is grown up and finally dons the iconic mask, then Rob Zombie sort of loses the edge and the movie doesn't have the same punch to it, seeming more like a deflating balloon of sorts. Why? Well, because the killer just randomly shows up at places and mostly just observes people. And the last 30 minutes or so of the movie is just one prolonged chase scene. Now, I do believe that having chase scenes is a must for a slasher movie, of course. But a chase scene that lasted for about 30 minutes and wasn't even all that thrilling? Nah, it just didn't really work out for the movie and it felt like a drag to sit through.What really blew me away here with this 2007 ""Halloween"" movie was the immensely impressive cast list. Oh boy, Rob Zombie really managed to get together a whole bunch of iconic actors and actresses. It was a particular great treat for the horror fans to see people like Malcolm McDowell, Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Udo Kier, Clint Howard, Danny Trejo, Ken Foree, Sid Haig and Dee Wallace in the movie. Now, IMDb lists Bill Moseley, but he was only in the theatrical cut of the movie, so I guess I didn't see that version because I didn't see him in here.Rob Zombie's 2007 ""Halloween"" was more of a background builder for the Michael Myers character, a prequel to the series in a way, but then again, not entirely a prequel. It was indeed a great addition to the franchise.For a slasher movie, then there weren't all that many deaths, and the brutality and severity of those scenes that were there just weren't in your face outstanding from so many other slasher movies.All in all an entertaining movie, but be prepared for more character Building than slashing.",Halloween
9,Quinoa1984,a 're-imagining' from Rob Zombie that confuses gore and exploitation theatrics (and loads of exposition) for real thrills and chills,4,9 September 2007,"The main problem in doing a Halloween remake is that the original is so much still, nearly thirty years on, in the public's movie-going consciousness that it holds its ground. John Carpenter took a very ambiguous approach to the slasher movie, of making a 'boogeyman' out of a mute psychopath, and filmed it in a manner that, as Ebert pointed out, could be comparable to Hitchcock. Rob Zombie doesn't take that route. His style mixes the slapdash 70's B-movie splatter-movie throwback approach he used in The Devil's Rejects with the conventions of Halloween, and very quickly it becomes a deterrent to whatever he's trying to do in the script. Once or twice it almost seems as if he might try and improve as a director in some scenes, but then he falls back on shaky hand-held camera-work and lots and lots of gore ('gotta see the killing' must have been Zombie's motto on the set during the slaying scenes). But that's only one gripe to have, and probably not even the central one.Probably the biggest flaw in Zombie's construction of the film is in making the ambiguous not only nil, but juxtaposing a new theorem to Myers psychology. Gone is the long point-of-view shot that opens the original Halloween, where the perspective has to make the viewer fill in the blanks at will. Now there is forty-five minutes of filling in the blanks, the whitexploitation way: Myers may be a psycho, but it could've been fixed, couldn't it, had he just had the right parents who weren't a waste of space redneck ass**** and a stripper mother? Just hearing Myers talk and get bullied on is a mistake; unlike in Devil's Rejects, where there might have been a purpose (albeit sort of lost on me) in making the antagonists the renegade heroes, Myers doesn't need explanation or, dare it be suggested, sympathy for his downfall into madness behind the mask. It's ironic that the producers decided to opt for Zombie's version when originally they planned on making a prequel about Myers's childhood years. If I wanted to get some real psychological insight into a stalker-of-the-night I'd re-read the Watchmen comic-book on Rorscach.And yet the idea of trying to put a new spin on a slasher film of the classic likes of Halloween with a more twisted spin isn't lost on me. On the outset, one's expectation could be at least that the remake might do one better than the recent spat of sequels. But Zombie still lags in that same pool of franchise product, despite his best intentions, because he doesn't project the necessities of suspense, of real horror of the un-seen. A few times Michael Myers will enter into someone's house through the front door (Laurie Strode's parents are one example, as well as with one of Laurie's sexy and sexed up friends), and it could be more interesting if the shot of the door slamming would be the end of the scene. But then we have to go inside, to see the brutality in all of Myers's thrashing and stabbing and choking and so on. It turns to tediousness, which even in the lessor sequels wouldn't be too strong of a factor against it. And Zombie also crams in the information that wisely was left until Halloween 2, originally, which draws out the narrative until one just wishes that it would end already.It wouldn't surprise me if some day Rob Zombie makes a credible work of film-making, but so far from what films he's made only Devil's Rejects comes close (and not by a whole lot even) to showing any promise of him as a writer (maybe more-so) &/or director. Gone in Halloween are the little bits of scathing humor that populated his past work, and also gone is a reverence likewise to the underlying wit in some scenes that Carpenter presented (the 'ghost' scene is now more about the naked girl than about any real scares). It's not a failure, but it's no great shakes at all for the horror genre either. However, if you think that this might be the end of the franchise, it could be by the looks of the ending...",Halloween
10,Coventry,Behind the mask  EVIL in all its purity and glory.,6,1 October 2007,"From all I've read and heard about Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"", it's not supposed to be just another senseless and redundant remake of a classic horror milestone, but the re-imagining of a groundbreaking premise and an expanded elaboration of the original concept. This may very well all be true and admirable, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee a great horror film. John Carpenter's original movie, released in 1978, is unquestionably one of the most important and influential genre films ever accomplished. Although not really the first in its type, it set the standards for teen-slashers and a large part of the gimmicks and tension-tricks first used in that film are still extremely popular today. Topping Carpenter's classic would be a total utopia, but (luckily enough) I don't think this ever was Rob Zombie's intention. He's clearly a big admirer of the original and merely just wanted to share his interpretation of the ""mystery"" surrounding Michael Myers' persona. As long as your expectations aren't set too high, ""Halloween"" is certainly an enjoyable and sardonic stalk & slash feast. ""House of 1.000 Corpses"" and especially ""The Devil's Rejects"" surely taught us a couple of things about Rob Zombie as a director. He may not be Hollywood's most talented storyteller, but he damn well knows how to shock, disgust and creep out even the most experienced horror fans. If anything, ""Halloween"" is on exciting and non-stop spitfire of brutal violence, dark & unsettling scenery, eerie sound effects and graphic make-up art that don't leave too much to the imagination.The so-called ""re-imagining"" is actually just applicable on the first part of the film and, to a lesser extend, the climax. Zombie devoted a lot of scripting time into Michael Myers' social background and childhood. I'm sure everybody remembers Carpenter's original, in which the viewer simply witnessed Michael killing his sister at age 6 and then the events immediately cut to his escape from the mental institution, fifteen years later. He appeared to be an average and ""normal-looking"" 6-year-old, and absolutely nothing indicated his tendencies towards maniacal behavior. In the 2007 version, it's um  slightly different. Young Myers' family could not possibly be any more dysfunctional and disturbing. His mother works as a strip dancer, his stepfather does nothing all day except for drinking and insinuating Michael is a homosexual. Nobody seems to pay any attention to Michael's obsession with killing small animals and the daily visits to his school's psychologist are considered a simple routine. Michael then snaps permanently and his youthful killing spree here is slightly more dramatic than the one in Carpenter's original.The whole 'raison d'être' of this new Halloween version (I think) was to give the monstrous Michael Myers a face and perhaps even a soul, but this entire effort simply vanishes once the events move 15 years forward in time. All of a sudden the tender & blond boy develops into a massively postured man who doesn't speak a word and fills his days making morbid masks to cover his face. From the moment he escapes the institution (whilst sadistically butchering a couple of guest stars from Zombie's previous films, like Bill Moseley, Tom Towles and Leslie Easterhook), the film nearly is a shot-by-shot remake of the original. Michael goes after his youngest sister Laurie, with Dr. Loomis on his tail, and massacres everyone who's unfortunate enough to come near him. The final showdown is different, but only to avoid further sequels. Nonetheless, despite the quite large number or flaws and shortcomings, ""Halloween"" is a pretty cool and genuinely hardcore slasher-flick and I see no reasons why genre fans  whether or not die-hard fanatics of the original  should hate it. The gore and brutality are plentiful, the atmosphere is dark and thoroughly creepy, the music is loud and a whole lot of horror veterans pop up in small roles.",Halloween
11,michaelRokeefe,Halloween...the remaking of a classic.,9,1 January 2008,"Rob Zombie re-invents John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN. Zombie writes and directs this remake of the 1978 slasher masterpiece and turns it into the ultimate stab-a-thon. The director really goes out on a limb successfully as he shows us how Michael Myers became one of the most memorable psychopaths on screen. We witness a young Michael(Daeg Faerch)as a child killing his mother's(Sheri Moon Zombie)worthless boyfriend, Ronnie(William Forsythe), his older sister and her boyfriend. Not to mention beat the daylights out of a bully from school. Years of therapy with Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell)does little for the institutionalized Michael(Tyler Mane). After his escape, the masked maniac goes on a bloody rampage that will thrill most hardened of horror fans. Bloody-disgusting. The most violent HALLOWEEN you've ever seen. This retelling of something so familiar is well worth the effort. Faerch is absolutely amazing. Also in the cast: Danny Trejo, Scout Taylor-Compton, Brad Dourif, Leslie Easterbrook, Clint Howard, Danielle Harris and a bit part for Micky Dolenz.",Halloween
12,preppy-3,Pointless and sick,1,31 August 2007,"I USED to like Rob Zombie. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" rocks and ""The Devils Rejects"" disturbed me. THIS however is just horrendous. It's a disastrous redo of the 1978 classic. Here it's explained why Michael Myers was a psycho. The first 40 minutes or so are good (if disturbing). We see Micahel at the age of 10 and why he became a killer. Sheri Moon turns in a wonderful performance. Then it cuts to 15 years later. Michael escapes...and the movie falls to pieces.The original had three teenage girls who were funny, intelligent and likable. This one gives us three girls who are foul-mouthed, obnoxious and just thoroughly despicable. Laurie (the ""good"" girl) is introduced making a joke about molestation! You want them dead! In the original you cared about the characters--not here. Also--remember the restraint in terms of violence in the first one? Forget about it here! Zombie pours the blood and gore on to a ridiculous degree. Also I get the feeling that Zombie hates women. Lynda (Kristina Kleba) is totally nude when she is killed. Annie (Danielle Harris) is topless and we get at least FIVE views of her topless bloody body on the floor! Does Zombie really think we need to see nude women getting killed to enjoy a movie? The misogyny in this film is unbelievable. And Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) is chased and threatened a LOT. The final chase takes forever to finish. Zombie said he was doing his own version of the tale. Fine--but why does he take full portions of dialogue verbatim from the first AND doesn't even have the courtesy of naming Carpenter in the credits! He also shoots some scenes the same way Carpenter did too.This manages to be sick and boring at the same time. The acting was OK I suppose--the script was so dreadful I couldn't think straight. Malcolm McDowell seems to be enjoying himself. Having Harris in this (she was in ""Halloween 4 and 5"") was kind of cute and I caught most of the cameos from other actors but I still hated this movie. He actually makes Eli Roth (Hostel 1 and 2) look good! The good opening 40 minutes were just destroyed by what followed it. Stick with the original classic and skip this one. A real travesty here.",Halloween
13,poolandrews,Re: the Unrated Director's Cut. Rather long & uneventful remake.,5,29 February 2008,"Halloween starts in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31 where abused & psychologically disturbed 10 year old child Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) goes postal & murders his stepfather Ronnie (William Forsythe), his sister Judith (Hanna Hall) & her boyfriend Steve (Adam Weisman) not necessarily in that order. Michael is convicted of murder & incarcerated in Smiths Grove Sanitarium & treated under the supervision of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). Jump forward fifteen years later & Michael hasn't said a word in that time, he is now just an empty shell of pure hatred & evil. Two guards attempt to rape a female patient late one night & Michael is given an opportunity to escape which he happily takes killing anyone who tries to stop him. Michael heads back for Haddonfield where he intends to find & kill his last remaining relative Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) who is blissfully unaware that she even has a brother...Written, co-produced & directed by Rob Zombie (real name Robert Cummings) this remake of John Carpenter's widely considered classic Halloween (1978) continues the recent trend of Hollywood studios remaking classic horror films such as Dawn of the Dead (2004), The Fog (2005), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), Black Christmas (2006), The Wicker Man (2006) & The Hitcher (2007) to name but a few of the more recent ones. These remakes are a bit of a mixed bag some being great while others are plain terrible & I would say in my opinion the Halloween remake is somewhere between the two, I didn't like it that much but I didn't flat out hate it either. Like most films are these days Halloween went to theatres as an 'R' rated version & subsequently released on DVD shortly after in an 'Unrated' director's cut which not only lasts for twenty minutes longer but has many scenes changed & altered including Michael's prison break which is totally different in the two versions to the extent even different actor's were used in the sequence. Carpenter's original Halloween is considered by many as one of the finest tension filled slasher films ever, it's simple basic self contained story of a psychopath out to kill Laurie. With the remake Zombie has decided to go into Michael's head & give him lots of background & reasoning behind what he does & who he is which I must confess bored me. These explanations offer nothing new or any sort of significant motivation other than he had a difficult childhood. The first forty odd minutes of Halloween sets the Michael character up, the protracted killing of his family, scenes of his treatment & breakout. Carpenter's efficient & economic original did the same in less than half that time. I didn't like the character's that much, Laurie in particular was very annoying & by the end I was rooting for Michael & hoped he would just kill her if not just to stop her irritating screaming.Director Zombie goes the modern route & instead of nice long establishing shots & camera moves there's plenty of quick cuts & shaky hand held camera movement. Not overly pleasant to watch. It's undoubtedly well made but it's shallow, forgettable & at just under two hours far too long & drawn out. It's always a bad sign when you are sitting watching a film & you keep repeating 'please just finish' in your mind for the last thirty minutes. There's some blood splatter but not much actual gore, there's an impressively bloody slit throat but little else. The nudity count is very high with Zombie never missing an opportunity to undress his actresses & show some breast. In fact he even kills two of his character's off while they are naked. It gives the film a certain sleazy & cheap feel which may be a recommendation for some on it's own.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Halloween is well made with good production values but at the same time is almost instantly forgettable. There is nothing here for instance to match the long continuous point-of-view shot of Michael putting his mask on, walking through the house, picking up the knife & stabbing his sister as seen in the original. It was nice to hear the classic John Carpenter Halloween theme used here. The acting is alright & there are several familiar faces including McDowell, Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Richard Lynch, Udo Kier, Clint Howard, Ken Foree & Danny Trejo who all should be familiar to seasoned horror flick fans.Halloween is an average slasher film under any title & in trying to pit itself against what many consider to be the finest slasher film ever (not me though) it was on a hiding to nothing before it was even released. A passable modern slasher flick but nothing else.",Halloween
14,dbborroughs,"Remake exists in a twilight world of originality and pure copy never manages to find its own voice, the result is really bad movie movie with a few great moments",3,11 September 2007,"Remake/rethink of the classic John Carpenter film is a mistake. Granted in these days of redone 1970's horror classics and not so classics a remake (after 7 sequels) was inevitable, but however this got made it shouldn't have. It's too unreal to ever work and too referential of the original to ever not be compared. I'm hoping that Zombie was forced to do the film a certain way by the money men since I would hate to think that the man who gave us House of 1000 corpses and Devil's Rejects made some of the choices we see here.The problems here start with the rethought idea of Myers as a chunky fat kid with long hair. It continues on with his foul mouthed white trash parents who's steady stream of profanity was such I have to think its a bad joke. Shall I go on to the anachronistic settings and props that mix time periods (and when is this suppose to begin anyway?) By the time Michael goes home we have about an hour to compress the events of the original, which then gets told in speedy fashion. Ultimately, as many have said, and as Thomas Harris found out about Hannibal Lechter, the whole idea of explaining the evil takes away the terror.What really annoys the hell out of me is that as bad and as lazy the narrative restructuring is the individual sequences are top notch. In all seriousness some of the sequences where Michael kills are dynamite. The stabbing death of his older sister is frightening (and whats with that little shape. Creepy) and the escape from the basement by Laurie is masterful frenetic film making. Actually most of the killings are mini masterpieces that regrettably have no gallery to properly show them in. Once again its clear that Rob Zombie is a director to be reckoned with, just so long as he can go his own way. (And I have to say its great to see all the great 1970's name b-movie actors once more).Not really worth bothering with, this is at best 3 or 3.5 out of 10. Recommended only for those who want to see some fleeting moments of really cool film making in an otherwise crappy film.",Halloween
15,Bunuel1976,"HALLOWEEN (Rob Zombie, 2007) **",4,27 October 2007,"Even if I was pleasantly surprised by the two previous Rob Zombie horror efforts, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this rehash of a recognized classic; has any of the recent spate of such remakes been really any good (for the record, I have now watched only three of these revamps)? Anyway, I agree with others who have already commented about the film that the decision to go a different route (at least during its first and last thirds) was commendable if not exactly successful; however, it really falters when lamely mimicking Carpenter's original (such as Michael Myers' pursuit of Laurie Strode in the street, her best pal's constant uttering of ""Totally"" and the latter  and her boyfriend's  death, which are an exact replica of the relevant scenes from the 1978 version). One of the worst things about the remake, then, is that the teens here are extremely annoying  including Laurie herself  so that we never truly care about their fate! The opening section  detailing Michael's childhood  is watchable not so much for what it tells us about the character but rather for the creepy screen presence of the boy playing him, and the equally notable contribution of his disillusioned mother (Sheri Moon Zombie, the writer/director's stunning wife) valiantly trying to make ends meet in a hopeless environment. William Forsythe as Michael's foul-mouthed wastrel of a stepfather is amusing at first, but is such a clichéd characterization that it soon becomes just as boring as anyone else! The TV clips from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951; whose 2-Disc SE on R2 I have just acquired, incidentally) during this section, however, are a neat tribute to John Carpenter's own idol, Howard Hawks.I also share other HTF members' view that the frequent cropping-up of familiar faces  it's great, however, that many of them were around during the 1970s  was more of a distraction than anything else: I was particularly surprised by the presence of Richard Lynch and Mickey Dolenz (of ""The Monkees""). Udo Kier's cameo was silly and, despite his not inconsiderable screen-time, Brad Dourif isn't given anything especially interesting to do (other than diss psychiatrist Malcolm McDowell's insistence that Michael Myers is the devil incarnate, that is, until he happens upon the slashed body of his own daughter, after which he all but disappears). Also on hand, for one brief bit, is SPIDER BABY (1964)'s Sid Haig  already a regular of Zombie's work; Ken Foree, however, is good for a few chuckles as the badass trucker who falls foul of Myers in a grimy rest-room; Danny Trejo's compassionate asylum attendant (who has looked after Michael during his tenure at Smith's Grove) was a mistake, though, since his eventual fate at the hands of his favorite charge is too cruel for no reason at all. Without any sympathy aroused for either victim or deranged perpetrator, what's the point of watching  other than as a voyeuristic exercise in gratuitous sadism, which is far less stylishly handled than in the original anyway? Still, McDowell himself isn't bad  and he must have cherished the opportunity of playing such an established character, even if he was to follow in the footsteps of Donald Pleasence (who had made Dr. Sam Loomis his own in the franchise which sprung from the original); his demise at the end, though, means that it will be just a one-off for the actor. As for Myers himself, I couldn't quite reconcile his hulking and emotionless 'killing machine' persona with the troubled kid seen in the prologue; after going the extra mile to beef up his backstory  a device which, ultimately, works against the film because it effectively destroys the character's prior ""Boogeyman"" mystique!  Zombie then still lazily relies on his imposing physique and featureless mask for menacing effect (the original lean Michael cuts a much creepier and a potentially more dangerous figure in my view).Which brings us to the recycled ""Halloween"" theme (still chillingly effective, but should perhaps have been used more sparingly throughout) and the flaccid new ending, which opts for a pervasive sensation of nihilism a' la THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974)  an approach which worked in a backwoods environment, but seems misplaced within the context of a small American town!",Halloween

17,zardoz-13,One of the Best Remakes in Hollywood History!,10,26 August 2009,"You'll have to look long and hard to find a remake more reverential to its source material than director Rob Zombie's version of the 1978 John Carpenter classic ""Halloween."" Before Zombie took on the daunting task of making ""Halloween,"" he had two fairly decent but horribly depraved epic under his belt with ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects."" I preferred ""Corpses"" over ""Rejects,"" and I didn't have high hopes to the blasphemy that he would visit on the first Michael Myers outing. Surprising, Zombie's take on Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is just about the best remake that anybody could have dreamed. ""Halloween"" doesn't even look like it was helmed by the same guy who made either ""Corpses"" or ""Rejects."" Sure, Zombie made some heavyweight changes to the story, but everything comes together without a hitch. Despite all of the freaky problems that Zombie recounts on the commentary track to the unrated & uncut ""Halloween,"" this remake should make John Carpenter feel great and anybody who like the original ""Halloween"" should have a soft spot for Zombie's remake that he not only directed but also wrote. The casting choices for the new ""Halloween"" are right on the money, too.The original ""Halloween"" contained a brief prologue about murderous Michael Myers, but Zombie devotes almost 40 minutes to setting up the action that takes place some 15 years after Michael breaks out of person. Actually, apart from the extended prologue that scrutinizes Michael's early years, Zombi doesn't make any radical departures from the John Carpenter & Debra Hill screenplay. As the story unfolds, we find ourselves in a battlefield of a household with Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie of ""The Devil's Rejects"") preparing breakfast for young 10-year old Michael (Daeg Faerch of Dark Mirror""), her second husband Ronnie White (William Forsythe of ""Once Upon A Time in America""), her teenage daughter Judith (Hanna Hall of ""Forrest Gump""), and her infant daughter Laurie. Ronnie is a foul-mouthed reprobate who cannot give his stripper wife a hard enough time and he has nothing but contempt for young Michael who he constantly refers to as a faggot. Although Zombie doesn't go into details, Michael slices up his pet rat in the first scene before Deborah dispatches Judith to bring him downstairs for breakfast. If the merciless barrages of profanity that Ronnie launches at him are not enough, Michael has to endure ridicule from school bully Wesley Rhoades (Daryl Sabara of ""Spy Kids"") who shows him a newspaper strip joint clipping about his mother and makes several sickening comments about her to his face. This fracas in the boys' restroom attracts the attention of school principal Chambers (Richard Lynch of Cyborg 3"") and Chambers later discovers a dead cat in a plastic bag in young Michael's locker.An angry Deborah comes to the school at Chamber's request and refuses to believe that her angelic son could be a sadistic little brat who tortures helpless animals. Later, Michael stalks the slimy Rhoades and attacks him the woods with a big stick and beats him to death. Back at home, Michael wants to go trick or treating, but nobody wants to take him. Mom has to strip at the joint and Judith wants to make out with her boyfriend. Again, Michael must suffer through another profane barrage from the evil Ronnie. Eventually, Ronnie runs out of steam and falls asleep in his recliner. Zombie does a splendid job of showing young Michael's dejection as he sits outside the house and watches other trick or treat while his mother has to strip to support her family. Zombie uses the pop tune ""Love Hurts."" Michael snaps, goes back inside, duct-tapes Ronnie to his recliner and slashes his throat. Meantime, Judith's boyfriend shows her his Halloween mask, which is a replica of the one from the original ""Halloween."" Later, Michael stabs the boyfriend to death and finishes off his sister. Naturally, Deborah is devastated when she comes home. Earlier, at Michael's school, a psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell of ""If"") had been called in by Chambers.Michael is sent to a mental asylum where he endures hours of interviews with a sympathetic Loomis, but Michael gradually retreats behind the masks that he makes rather than discuss his life. Deborah gives up all hope and commits suicide while watching home movies of Michael. At this point, about 40 minutes has elapsed and Zombi has done a simply brilliant job of providing Michael's back story. Fifteen years elapses and Loomis has to throw in the towel where Michael is concerned but not before he authors a book about the evil that is Michael. The next time we see Michael, he has grown into a powerful, seven-foot man. Mind you, in the hands of anybody else, this sudden transformation into a walking redwood tree would be hilarious, but it actually works for Zombie. Michael (Taylor Mane of ""Troy"") escapes after a couple of crazy redneck attendants invade his room with a catatonic female inmate and brutally rape her while calling virginal Michael a faggot. Michael snaps again. He kills both of them and then massacres everybody else, though we never see him kill the female patient. Any sympathy that we might have conjured up for Michael vanishes when he kills the one orderly, Ismael Cruz (Danny Trejo of ""Con-Air""), by drowning him. Michael sets out to track down Baby Boo who has grown up to become Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton of ""Sleepover"") who lives with her foster parents, Cynthia Strode (Dee Wallace of ""10"") and Mason Strode (Pat Skipper), back in Haddonfield.The last 20 minutes are simply tour-de-force with Michael stalking Laurie and Loomis hot on their trail. The cast is superb, even in the minor roles with ""Monkees"" star Micky Dolenz playing a gun salesman and Sybil Danning as the asylum nurse that young Michael slaughters with a fork. Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" is nothing short of brilliant and he deserves to have praised heaped on him.",Halloween
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I guess this is what one should expect from a heavy metal musician,5,28 October 2010,"A review of the Unrated Director's Cut. One night, 10-year-old Michael Myers snaps. He kills several people and is institutionalized. 17 years later, he breaks free. This is a remake of John Carpenter's classic, one of the greatest of the genre. I will not be comparing them much. Basically, whether this tries to stay true or not, it fails. The familiar score is wildly out of place, creating a downright unpleasant contrast. We get backstory(sort of... MM is a psycho right from when we first see him, though), the very thing that eroded the series before(not that sequels to the original was ever a good idea) and the ""bogeyman"" myth aspect is phoned in(as are other things left in for no reason). Characters have the same names but, well... they are all obnoxious(with no positive traits, spending the majority of the time shouting, whether or not they're being threatened... it's not so much that we hope they'll die as that we just feel an overpowering urge to turn this off, as we get sick of them instantly... the ones we're meant to like aren't even the ones we hate the least, and we certainly don't care about *anything* that happens to them), mostly white-trash, and about half the males have long hair. I can't stress the following enough; this is completely removed from any reality we can recognize... I'm rather cynical and *I* found this to be without any semblance of credibility to it, devoid of anything that can be recognized as belonging to the realm of what might exist in any universe we're familiar with. Maybe this is how Zombie(who should perhaps stick with his rock tunes; I understand this is how all his films are, and I am not planning on making a habit of watching them) views the world. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that, or that he's alone in that. Know what to expect, that's all I'm saying. I imagine few *will* like this. Please, Rob, don't make it so easy for those arguing that horror movies lead to real-life violence. The brutality, blood and gore aren't particularly effective(this also has constant strong language... while it doesn't bother me in the slightest, it is clear that this mainly aspires to being controversial and offensive, and it utterly forgets to build an atmosphere or be scary and tense). I'd go with Piranha 3D over this any day, and they're somewhat similar in approach(gratuitous). Oh, and there's sex and nudity in this, as well. In fact, when this cuts to a new scene, it's likely to contain death(little of it shocking, equally because of no attachment to anyone on-screen on the part of the audience and that they, frankly, aren't that exciting... this had been topped years before it came out, for example by Freddy Vs. Jason) and/or the act of procreation. Attractive? Well, if you like it slutty. On that subject, let's have a moment of silence in honor of Danielle Harris' dignity. Honestly, she started her career portraying an unlikable, intolerable little brat who whined non-stop, once she grew up, she, well, did that some more, at least on Charmed... and it took this flick to do it. And it's not like she, then or now, is lacking in the talent department. Heck, the acting in this isn't bad. The children are fine. McDowell is enjoyable, as usual(not enough to excuse 112 minutes of this). How do you waste Udo Kier? And Brad Douriff gives the least memorable performance of his career(through no fault of his own)! The hand-held camera is OK. So, other than upwards of half an hour of running time, explanations that we should not have at all(taking up so much of the whole that what we saw in the 1978 version is rushed through in the last half of this... forget creepy stalking), recognizable faces and bodily fluids aplenty, does this add *anything*? And should you consider this for a single second if you can go with JC's vision? No. And I hear the next one is worse. My rating is purely on account of it not being incompetently put together, and the obvious skills of the players. The DVD comes with a fairly interesting director's commentary track. I recommend this solely to fans of the man behind it. 5/10",Halloween

(Dir: Rob Zombie)Evil Returns To Haddonfield ReduxWhy is it so necessary for Hollywood to insist on restoring a dead franchise in pursuit of the almighty dollar? I realize this is a redundant question and don't expect a real answer but frankly I'm stumped why oh why do they insist on doing so with unmitigated masterpieces such as John Carpenter's fearfest ""Halloween"" which solidified itself as a modern-day horror classic that has been re-awakened again and again in one turgid sequel after another.Well it seems ultrafan and self-professed horror film freak Rob Zombie decided to write the ultimate return with a re-imagining of the Michael Myers mystique  not unlike say ""BATMAN BEGINS""  but without a real rallying cry for new blood to be pumped into the maniacal madman.While Carpenter's original premise of an unstoppable bogeyman returning home to the scene of his heinous crime some 17 years earlier as a child slaughtering his teenage sister and being held under observation in an insane asylum by a dedicated  if not a bit batty himself  psychologist, who pursues Michael back to the tranquil suburban fictitious Haddonfield where he terrorized his hometown and subsequently his long-lost little sister.Now Zombie re-visits the old homestead depicting Michael at age 10 (Faerch) as a love- starved yet deeply disturbed young boy whose domestic situation is a cry for help not unlike the case studies of an atypical broken home: his stripper mother (Zombie's better half, Sheri) is shacked up with an abusive, drunken lecherous pig (Forsythe again proving to be a sickening lug he has cornered the cottage industry on for himself), and his promiscuous older sister Judith (Hall). Michael is made miserable by the taunts of the school bullies, the shame he feels by his elders and the curiosity factor of how living things die. Add all this mindless psycho babble and young Michael in his beloved clown costume wreaks bloody havoc on those who've betrayed him and send him into the arms of his appointed shrink Dr. Loomis (McDowell a good replacement for the late, great Donald Pleasence), who ultimately will cash in on his subject/patient by writing a best-seller yet fail his trustee in the long run.While the first half-hour or so is strenuous at best Zombie's decision to see what makes Michael Myers tick may be the biggest mistake of any horror auteur to make; do we really need to know why Evil is Evil?I should state that Zombie does employ a keen eye for the camera set-ups and knows how to put in a good shudder here and there (Myers stealth has never been so undetected as it is in this film where he literally almost appears to pop up or materialize suddenly out of the shadows  i.e. in the living room of one of the babysitter's charges) but it seems a tad ridiculous to have Myers as a hulking brute (Mane fills in for the adult version nicely but seems looking for a WWF match in the process) which makes him, AKA The Shape, a new definition to his demeanor.Sadly Taylor-Compton fails to register as the plucky Laurie Strode that her predecessor Jamie Lee Curtis filled to a t. The remaining cast is like a Who's Who of previous Zombie films (i.e. his DEVIL""S REJECTS & HOUSE OF 1,000 MANIACS pop in with cameos) and some nice trivial choices (Harris returns to the fold as Laurie's doomed gal pal but was in HALLOWEENs 4 & 5 as a distant relative of Michael's)Although the blood runs deep and the body count impressive, ultimately it feels like a useless exercise in futility  not exactly the sacrilege of Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake of Hitchcock's classic ""PSYCHO"", however just as unnecessary in the long run. Nice try Mr. Zombie but let Evil just be Evil.",Halloween
20,view_and_review,Nice Reboot,7,6 April 2021,"I would proffer that Michael Myers does a community service. He does cleaning that the rest of us in society can't do.So many annoying high schoolers, so little time.""Halloween"" (1978) was a classic. Its cherished name was sullied with the sequels after part two. As much as I hate reboots of classics, Halloween '07 couldn't be much worse than the sequels that came before it. If you may remember, the real Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was killed in ""Halloween: Resurrection"" back in '02. In that same movie Michael went on to kill some people using his house to stream a Halloween show. It was awful. Halloween '07 has rebooted the franchise with more of a focus on Michael, and I like it. We see more of what made Michael the psychopathic killer he came to be.Kid Michael and adult Michael were equally savage, it's just that adult Michael was as strong as an ox. All of the years of work put in by Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) had no effect. Michael just got more disconnected and stronger. Then, just like in the original, Michael broke out of the insane asylum, known as Smith's Grove, and went looking for his sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) in Haddonfield, Illinois. This time we got to see his full jail break. There were a lot of bodies he had to go through to get to poor Laurie, and go through them he did.The plusses of Halloween '07 were A.) the music, B.) Michael's step-father Ronnie (William Forsythe), C.) Michael (young and old), and D.) the bloodletting. The music was the same classic tune John Carpenter produced in 1978. There was no need to mess with perfection. Ronnie was hilarious. He was a foul-mouth pig, but he was hilarious. As I said, '07 Michael was more savage and director Rob Zombie specializes in savagery. He was bigger, more menacing, and even his mask reflected a more intense Michael.The minuses were the new Laurie Strode and the new Dr. Loomis. I know JLC was largely unknown in '78, but it's now hard to have anyone less than a star in that role. And even though Malcolm McDowell is a star in his own right, Donald Pleasance was made for the role as Dr. Loomis.After totaling it all up, the outcome is a net positive. Halloween '07 is a cool reboot for the horror genre fans in general and the ""Halloween"" fans in particular. Kill count: 20.",Halloween

We learn of his obsession with inflicting pain, his pole dancing mother, her abusive boyfriend, his sexually expressive sister. First act is not bad but from there it is hack and slash after Myers break out of Smiths Grove to return to Haddenfield. Tyler Mane appears as a bigger Myers who returns home in search of his sister. Malcolm McDowell plays Dr. Sam Loomis in a role perfected by Donald Pleasence in the original. While his final scene is a bust compared to that of Pleasence, Mcdowell still fares well as the maddening doctor who treated Myers the longest until it was no use. Shari Moon Zombie stands out as Myers mother whose lifestyle was sleazy but she loved her son. She commits suicide when it appears that her son will never go free. William Forsythe was terrific as the Sheriff in Devil's Rejects but as Zombie's boyfriend he is merely a very profane abusive target. Brad Dourif plays Sheriff Brackett whose daughter is friends with the heroine. The teenagers are flat with bad story alterations, particularly Scout Taylor-Compton who is no Jamie Lee Curtis.

Among the numerous problems here is the inane decision to make Michael less of a mystery, which is a huge mistake as the more unknown the killer is, the better off they are when it comes to being scare of them. Being a giant, hulking brute with a mask and a knife isn't all that's needed to make a killer creepy, it's just part of the equation and this one throws that all downhill by throwing as much as this does into his home-life for his back-story. Not only is that utterly uninteresting or enjoyable in general but also the mystique of him is all shattered irrevocably by ham-fisting such a lame story at us, going overboard to showcase the troubled mother relationship or the different authority figures at home and school that is all so overbearingly obvious that the arrival of his psychopathic state comes as no surprise and none of this is all the exciting to go through. Likewise, these scenes are just so overlong that even if the actions and storyline plots imposed during the time would've been interesting the section would still be knocked down for just taking so unbearably long to get to somewhere exciting that it would've been problematic regardless as he pace is just so off it's hardly enjoyable anyway. The pacing issues continue on into the later parts of the film as scenes of the girls' hanging around the school or together for their slumber party that it really shows up in how excessively long this is alongside the excruciating first half. Also really hurting this one is the utterly disastrous editing done through the actions scenes within this that makes the sequences nearly impossible to make out, a trait all too common throughout the film. These here are barely enough for the few positives in here which mostly centers on the effective display of the Grindhouse atmosphere present throughout, with an effectively grimy atmosphere here wrapped in the body count and kills along with the rampant nudity featured throughout here. The only other positives here are the rather fun action scenes throughout here when they can be seen, which starts with the hospital escape rampage and features the enjoyable house encounters where he goes after the group with some admittedly- effective stalking scenes. While not nearly enough to counterbalance them, these do make it watchable against the flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Nudity, Graphic Language, several sex scenes and drug use.",Halloween

Because Bay hasn't touched it, it hasn't been watered down to appease the teen market, and most of all Zombie has made the film his own.The story is the same, and there are key scenes from the original, and of course the soundtrack, but has Zombie written all over it, and it's as dark as a horror movie as you could wish for.It's strength and it's weakness though is the opening act. It's good to see Myers as a normal(ish) young boy, and to see a human side, but the original told no one that Myers was Strodes brother, he was just a shape, who killed for no reason.The cast are great, and Harris ans Mcdowell bring some gravitas to the proceedings.It has some very disturbing moments throughout, and although it's not a patch on the original, it's a masterpiece compared the the turgid sequels.",Halloween
24,Aaron1375,"Very fast paced with the kills, however the first part is the more interesting section of the film.",8,7 September 2007,"Yes, this is a remake done by Rob Zombie so expect lots of kills and nudity and such. However, what I did not expect was the opening showing Myers as a little boy. Granted the first and original movie showed his first kill, but this one goes a lot further showing the home environment and school more and his time in the institution under Dr. Loomis's care. So this was by far the more interesting part of the film and it was nice to see the makings of a killer as it did not solely blame outside factors, but also what was inside the mind of the boy himself. After that we have a rather lengthy scene of Myer's escape and then we basically get to the remake portion of the film which flies by a bit to fast with the plot seemingly rushed to get us to the kills. I am not saying this section is bad, just not as well developed as the first part. You do get to see a lot of nudity, and kills so we are in the basic slasher movie at this point and I do have to say that the girl playing the sheriff's daughter is extremely cute. You get your stars in this one, no one to big, but you know who they are. McDowell is rather good as Loomis, not quite as over the top as Pleasence was. There is a bit of a surprise at the end, well not really...I have seen to many horror movies to be surprised by what happened. As for a sequel, I think there could be one made, however if not that is fine. Actually, I would prefer there not be one, Rob Zombie should make more horror movies in maybe a different genre of horror, I am thinking a zombie movie might be interesting. So for a horror movie/slasher that is a bit different in the beginning and more basic in the end, this one is a real killer.",Halloween

I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as Zombie's previous two films, and like most people I'd have preferred him to follow them up with something original; but he's applied his brutal, in your face, style well to the Halloween franchise, and while it's not going to win me many fans to say so: I prefer this remake to the original. Halloween (2007) is really a film of two halves, with the first half of the film Rob Zombie establishes the character of Michael Myers, first showing him as an angry child at school and building into the famous sequence where he murders his family on Halloween night. We then see Michael as he is committed to an insane asylum, his obsession for masks grows and the second half of the film is more like the original as Michael escapes and goes after his one surviving relative.The first half of the film is far more interesting than the second. Zombie does a good job of making the character of Michael Myers interesting (my main gripe with the original was the fact that Myers isn't interesting). By the time it builds into something that more closely resembles John Carpenter's original film, the events that unfold mean more as we have some background on the killer. The film has been criticised for 'not capturing the spirit of Halloween'. Hailing from the UK, I don't even really know what 'the spirit of Halloween' is, so whether or not this film captures that spirit doesn't matter at all to me. Zombie does manage to give the film a savage and brutal atmosphere and he also manages to keep the action all the way through the film, though the final chase scene does go on a bit too long. I'd be hesitant to call this film a 'slasher' too: Zombie has made it more of an exploitation flick, and I won't complain about that! Zombie has put together a good cast of horror favourites, including Malcolm McDowell, Udo Kier, Clint Howard, Danny Trejo, Brad Dourif and Dee Wallace, as well as his own regulars: William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and of course his beautiful wife Sheri Moon. The young performers do well too: especially Daeg Faerch in the role of the young Michael Myers. Overall, this is not a great film and I'm disappointed that Zombie followed his earlier successes with a remake rather than an original film; but this is certainly a brutal and entertaining modern horror film, and I enjoyed watching it.",Halloween
26,trashgang,Rob's view on Halloween,7,19 November 2010,"How many Halloween fans were shouting that this remake would be trash. Even as they haven't seen a trailer or whatsoever. But knowing Rob Zombie I gave him credit on his personal view on Halloween. What he did was looking more toward the person Michael Myers. It starts with Michael being 9 years old. We see what he has done as a kid and what happens at school with him so being annoyed by it he loose control of himself and beats one of the kids to death. I really was into the movie and okay, you can't refer to the original one except some necessary scene's, the killing of his parents and the search of his sister and of course the famous scene with the sheet and the glasses. It's all filmed in a brutal gory way. There is a lot of nudity even some frontal of Kristina Klebe as she's been killed by Michael. There are a lot of famous actors in this flick most of them I met at Weekend Of Horrors in Germany. They all signed my DVD sleeve even Rob's on it. Nevertheless, it was worth watching.",Halloween
27,mm-39,Disturbing,8,3 September 2007,"Rob must have a Ph D in trailer trash. I hate to see what he has experienced in life for the film is very close to what I really know. I live in a city in Canada which has it share of domestic disasters and crime. Haddonfield must be a gritty steel town, for there seemed to be no balanced people in the film; just rude and crude people. The film was very disturbing, a couple of people left the theater which was a good idea. The movie is gory, but not in a violent way. The home Michael grew up in was cold, abusive, (verbally) full of shame, no morals or respect, and no one cared. I learned from the neighbourhood I grew up in, and my life at the plant that people snap or break. Hell, creates anger and rage. The emotionless mask is the persona of a hallow man eaten away by anger and rage. The only outlet or expression for Michael is violence. A movie of a sick town, which knows only sex and violence. No love or compassion in this film. To close to real life. Bullies do cry when they get beat up. 8 out of 10. This film is like seeing too much of real life.",Halloween
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Halloween,5,20 October 2007,"I had not watched the original Halloween, so sadly I can't do a comparison of Rob Zombie's reimagination of the horror classic by John Carpenter, about a psychotic killer hell bent on a mindless rampage when he escapes from the mental institution, with his doctor hot on his heels. Michael Myers ranks up there with Freddy Krueger (of the Nightmare series on Elm Street), Jason (of Friday the 13th) and LeatherFace (of Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and of late, these characters have been on the recycling mill, with the latter having a prequel made, and the former two combining forces in a movie.Wrestler Tyler Mane takes over the mantle of Myers, and Zombie's movie goes quite far back into the time when Myers was a kid, and how he got institutionalized. But it's more of an formality and an exercise in routine, as we've seen enough demonic kids (Omen, Joshua and also in Whisper, now showing in theatres) these days and nothing of similar nature would excite. But credit to Zombie, he goes for the jugular (pardon the pun) from the get go, and you get what you're looking for early in the movie (and there was one lady who deemed it too much, and walked out at this point).However, the reimagination didn't steer clear of tried, tested and tired clichés, such as getting the same old blondes being targets (somehow, everyone here is spotting long hair, mostly blonde), plenty of gratuitous nudity where almost every actress here had their clothes shed, and you guessed it, everyone had sex on their minds, though we know what that means in the horror genre. But what was a tad interesting though, was that Zombie made you abhor the characters who die early in the film, thus providing you an avenue to cheer(!) Myers on as he dispenses his own brand of justice from a mean looking kitchen knife.Classic characters from the original return, with Dr Samuel Loomis now played by Malcolm McDowell, and Brad Dourif having a bit role as Sheriff Lee Brackett. But the gem in the Halloween movie is who gets to play the role made memorable and propelled Jamie Lee Curtis as the Ultimate Scream Queen, and here, the part of Laurie Strode went to Scout Taylor-Compton, whom I thought didn't scream enough. Anyways, fans of the franchise would be pleased with Danielle Harris taking on a role in the movie, having appeared in two other movies in the franchise.Some might say this is yet another mindless remake, giving opportunity for Rob Zombie to make yet another blood lust slasher movie. Definite must watch for fans though, as Zombie elevates Myers to almost god like invulnerability here, but almost(?) closes the door on possible sequels. Then again, no one can stop from being imaginative enough to yank Myers from Hell and back again, if the box office clamours for it. What is indeed a classic instead, is that unforgettable signature tune of the Halloween theme composed by John Carpenter himself, while not at all frightening, does give you a sense of impending doom.",Halloween
29,HumanoidOfFlesh,"Not as bad as it's reputed to be,but Carpenter's original is still better.",6,16 September 2007,"The first half of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" covers Michael Myers youth,where he was a long-haired blonde kid who liked to torture and kill animals.On the Halloween night Michael kills his scumbag stepfather,his sister and her boyfriend,then he is placed in Smith's Grove Sanitarium where he spends a long time visited by the his psychiatrist Dr.Loomis.After 15 years Loomis moves on Myers escapes and the slaughter in Haddonfield begins...Every horror fan knows exactly the plot of John Carpenter's horror classic ""Halloween"",so I won't be wasting my time describing it in detail.Rob Zombie's remake differs from it in some aspects:the atmosphere is dirty and grimy,the characters are sleazy and the killings with a butcher knife are quite gory.Zombie also likes his nods to the horror genre:black and white movies like ""The Thing From Another World"" and ""White Zombie"" pop up on television sets,finally Blue Öyster Cult's ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" and The Misfits ""Halloween"" adorn the soundtrack.Overall,if you want to see somewhat vicious and mean-spirited remake of an instant horror classic check it out.5 out of 10.",Halloween
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Rob Zombie, I am a forgiving person, but this is going to take a very long time",2,1 September 2007,"OK, now my problem with Halloween(2007) is this is a film that DID NOT need to be remade. Halloween('70's) was absolutely perfect in every aspect, in my opinion, it's the scariest movie of all time. But when I heard that Rob Zombie was on to direct this movie, I actually thought for a minute there was a possibility this may be a good remake. I saw it this morning at the theater, I am in absolute disgust. Just it's not like he just re-made the movie into his own idea, no, he took some of John Carpenter's excellent ideas and just made them into crap. Now I'm separating this from the original, Halloween(2007) was actually by itself a bad film. Which really disappointed me since The Devil's Rejects was done so well, this was just a typical stupid unoriginal slasher movie. Now, Rob had a good idea where he developed Michael's character in the beginning, where we had a better idea on why he became Michael Myers. But after that, everything went downhill, because Rob just rushed all the other IMPORTANT characters, so they got no development what-so-ever.Mike Myers is a tormented kid, his mom is a stripper, his step dad is an alcoholic jerk, his big sister treats him bad, and he is picked on at school. But he kills small animals as well, leading him to go onto bigger things, like humans. He massacres his family, excluding his mom and his baby sister, he is taken to a mental institution and escapes 15 years later and is going after Laurie, his baby sister who is now grown up and is preparing her and her friends for a night of hell.The acting on the teenage girl's parts was just horrendous, like extremely bad, I was actually hoping for them to get killed, how sad was that? Laurie was just a whiny little priss, not at all likable like Jamie's performance, same with the other two girls, they couldn't live up to the other performances. These girls were just annoying, not likable at all, while the other actresses at least had that going for them and made them likable vicitims. But it just seemed like they wanted their 15 minutes or some kind of big break, because it didn't even take them 10 minutes to take their tops off. On a movie on it's own, it's just too unoriginal and I'm disappointed in Rob because I thought he was really improving. Comparison to the original Halloween, perhaps Rob should have read the tag line THE ONE, THE ONLY, HALLOWEEN, because this was a huge slap to John Carpenter's face on his brilliant classic.2/10",Halloween
31,blanbrn,A new look and different take on the horror classic legend. Well done by Rob Zombie.,7,2 September 2007,"Just saw ""Halloween"" the new and let me say improved modern version that any horror film buff fan will enjoy. The film is certainly well done a thumbs up for Rob Zombie, though his direction and take is much different from John Carpenter, as Carpenter produced a classic in 1978 that brought chills and thrills mostly with the dark shadows and creepy music. The chills and thrills are still present with Zombie's version with only more blood and guts that's done in a very gruesome and violent manner the slasher scenes are rough and bloody. Yet the biggest difference is Zombie goes into more in depth telling of the story about the start and beginnings of Michael Myers, unlike the 1978 version which only brushed upon the beginning and showed flashbacks mainly. You as the viewer see the young Michael as a small child we learn his family life was strange and complex as he had a dead beat step dad, and it's revealed his mother earned a living as a stripper, plus his school life he was ran over by bullies. So the film goes in depth and deep into the characters early development from childhood that too gives some closure as to why he became a future monster and psychopath. After the showing of a troubled development stage in the films start then Zombie takes it off in a much similar fashion like the 1978 original with his murder of his family and then the stay in the mental institution, till the escape and terror he brings upon the town of Haddonfield, Illinois many years later. The big differences here are Zombie clearly shows more violence as the killing scenes are very gruesome with blood and splatter, and plenty of T&A is present as the doomed teenage characters make out. Really one of the better made remakes it's nice to see a horror classic done so well by Rob Zombie it made it a winner when he showed more about the psychopaths development and it was in depth a big thumbs up for Rob.",Halloween
32,MovieAddict2016,Rob Zombie tries to give a monster a soul.,4,31 August 2007,"On paper, a ""Halloween"" remake looked interesting. Zombie tries to go back to the character's origin and reinvent him - it's a recent trend in Hollywood (""Batman Begins,"" ""Casino Royale,"" the upcoming ""Incredible Hulk,"" etc.), so it's not quite surprising that Hollywood greenlit the project and it got the push it received.But the problem that arises while doing this with ""Halloween"" is that it comes into conflict with the concept of Michael being purely evil. Although I can understand what Zombie was trying to do by exploring Michael's background, it contradicts the whole point of the original. By providing a reason and displaying a human character on screen, you give the character a soul - and despite what Zombie may claim, this does NOT make Michael scarier. It makes him an average movie serial killer: a guy with a messed up life as a kid who snaps one day and goes on a killing rampage.Is it scary? No. Gory? Yes. Realistic? At first. And if it were a movie about a serial killer, it would work. But it's not. This is a movie about a monster, a soulless creature; a boogeyman, as per the original film. Monsters aren't scary when we know they're flesh and blood.Carpenter had a way of framing the action in the original movie. Michael stalks Laurie in her hometown, but we never see any real flesh behind the mask, we never really see him moving around like a normal human being. But we do here. He stands in the middle of an open road, in front of three teenage girls walking home from school, and they all see him. He stands there for a few moments, then trudges away off-screen. We actually see him walk away, instead of just appearing and disappearing as he did in the original film. Which method is scarier? The answer is clear.Zombie spends 40 minutes or so building up Michael's character before he escapes from the ward. We see him killing animals as a child (and torturing them, too), a stupid subplot with his mom as a stripper and a typical school bully, and a promiscuous sister. The sexual talk is frank and disgusting - the mom's boyfriend (husband?) is talking about how cute her daughter's butt is, and at this point in the film we're not sure whether he might even be the father. It's just shock for shock value. Zombie has a tendency of this - blunt violence and blunt dialogue combined - and in a film like this, it seems cheap and fake and unnecessary. The heavy emphasis placed on the swearing - and I mean this literally (as in, the actors place a noticeable emphasis on the profanity they use) is almost unintentionally funny. Zombie cast his wife in the role of Michael's mother, and she can't act at all.Donald Pleasence got stuck with the most unfortunate lines from the original film, but we were willing to forgive bad dialogue because of how well-made the film was otherwise. Here, Malcolm McDowell gets the worst of two worlds: he gets to handle an under-characterization with bad, bad, BAD dialogue AND a generally weak film to boot. The sequences with McDowell's version of Loomis are all completely clichéd - Zombie clearly writes his dialogue based on other films' dialogue. The ""intimate"" scenes at the mental ward between Loomis and Michael are awful. McDowell struggles with typicalities of the genre, such as the Dr. Who Wasted His Own Life By Devoting It To Someone Else's (he explains to Michael that his wife left him and he has no friends because of how involved he became with the case - and the dialogue itself is straight from any cop-vs.-killer flick). The recent film ""Zodiac"" had a similar theme of men losing their personal lives due to obsession over a murderer, but it was handled better. The whole Loomis character should have been dropped from the remake if all Zombie wanted to do with him was use him as a deus ex machina, by the way.Overall, this feels like a redneck version of ""Halloween,"" which is going to offend some people, but I can't think of any better way to describe it. It's trashy, vulgar, and silly - and hey, that's fine, if that's Rob Zombie's motif and he wants to make movies pandering towards that sort of audience. I have nothing against it, and I think it may work with some films - I can imagine him making a good re-do of ""Natural Born Killers"" (although I hope it never, never happens!).However, when you're remaking an iconic, legendary, incredibly influential horror film - don't cheapen it by ""reimagining"" it with horror movie clichés and shock-value material. The very worst aspect of this remake is that it simply isn't scary at all - it's a typical slasher flick, a homicidal-man-on-a-rampage flick, which ironically is exactly what Zombie said he wanted to avoid.The first film was eerie, spooky, and unnerving because Michael's motivations were cloudy and we weren't sure whether Laurie was right or wrong when she said he was the boogeyman. We only knew one thing: he wasn't entirely human.But ever since that original movie, the filmmakers have attempted to keep expanding upon Michael's history: the second film developed a motivation for his killings (Laurie was his sister), the fourth offered more clues at his background, and now we come full circle with a complete remake of the original film.Michael's true demonic core - the natural horror element of the series - is stripped bare and all that is left is a disturbed, abnormally tall redneck with greasy hair who hasn't showered in years wearing a silly mask going around killing people because he had an abusive family life as a child. Some things are better left unexplored.",Halloween
33,Rainey-Dawn,Nice Remake,9,3 July 2014,"I Loved John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). I never thought it could be remade well enough to suit me. And I figured if it was remade then it would be more violent and bloody - a very cheap version of the original film that took out all the mystery and trills leaving us with only a gore-fest. Then I heard that Zombie had a version of the movie which surprised me - it is good! I liked Rob Zombie's re-visioning of the original and the added backstory on Michael Myers. The original saga had 7 parts to it (8 parts but I can't count ""Season of the Witch""). Basically I feel that Zombie took all 7 Michael Myers stories and *basically* summed them all up in one film. No not completely but basically.AND who better to play Dr. Loomis in Zombie's film than Malcolm McDowell?! Wonderful choice! To rate in comparison Zombie vs Carpenter then I would give Zombie an 8 and Carpenter a 10.To rate Zombie as a completely separate movie - not compared to Carpenter then Zombie gets an 9.5.So I guess totaling up it all up I will have to rate Zombie's Halloween (2007) a 9.9/10",Halloween
34,disdressed12,i liked it a bit more than the original version,7,6 November 2007,"prior to watching this movie,i'd heard people say that director Rob Zombie had butchered the franchise with his take on the Halloween lore.i don't share that viewpoint.i though the movie had a lot of good points to it.i thought the casting of Malcom McDowell was genius.he plays his character tongue in cheek,and really i think that's the whole tone of the movie.and it worked for me.there are some serious parts and the movie even has a moral,but it doesn't hit you over the head with anything.the violence is more sudden and a bit more graphic than the 1978 version.the acting is better in this movie,i think.the actor who played the grown up Micheal Myers(the psycho) is very convincing.and the child who played young Michael Myers is perfect for the role.the movie does tend to be slow in spots,but i still think it is a better movie than the original version.there is a lot of crude language in the movie and a fair amount of nudity,so be warned.for me,Halloween (2007)is a 7/10",Halloween
35,KineticSeoul,Remake of a horror icon with some good visuals but overall sort of boring,5,25 February 2011,"Now I haven't seen the Halloween 1978 version, but from what I read this version has more of origin aspect to it for Michael Myers but doesn't have as much of the tension compared to the 1978 version. This is basically a slasher flick and Michael Myers is one of slasher flicks icons and has cult following, so I decided to see this out of curiosity. And because the 1978 version is known to be a horror classic. What it turns out is this is a very straightforward slasher flick with a little origin story to it with hardly any psychological aspects to it. The development of how he became a killer isn't well done, it's like Rob Zombie the director for this movie was more going for the vibe of it all than anything else. I guess more of the mystery behind the 1978 version made the movie a bit more thrilling, cause I was sort of bored in this one and the kills weren't anything special with hardly any scares. I don't know how Michael Myers was portrayed in the other version, but in this one he is built like a wrestler and sort of kills like one as well, he is also a stalker and a peeping tom, even if his motives maybe different from most who does that. Some hardcore fans of the franchise might like this one, although some maybe disappointed at how it tries to humanize Micheal.5.6/10",Halloween
36,OllieSuave-007,Freak of nature.,4,2 November 2014,"A remake of the 1978 original Halloween, dangerous pyschopath Michael Myers escapes from the mental institution where he was committed since he was 10 to find his baby sister, Laurie, making victims to those unfortunate enough to cross his path.This movie is full of screams, chases, and bloody carnage, typical of a slasher movie. There are a few moments that will make you jump, and enough terror and suspense, with a pretty solid plot to follow, to keep this movie an edge-of-your-seat experience. Yet, director Rob Zombie went a overboard on the gore level, the crude sexual references and profanity. The cinematography is washed-up and the much of the cast of characters, especially that of Michael Myers and his family, look like reality-disconnected, trashy and degenerate hippies of '70s.It appears Zombie took this horror classic and gave it his twisted spin, resulting in nothing imaginary and having no redeeming qualities -especially an unsympathetic cast of characters including that of the freak-of-nature Michael Myers at age 10, and his snobby, foul-mouth and trashy older sister.Like the verdict of many movie remakes, stick with the original! Grade D",Halloween
37,sddavis63,"Not Bad, But It Doesn't Hold A Candle To The 1978 Version",6,21 October 2013,"Sometimes I wonder why Hollywood bothers with remakes of classics. Classics are, after all, classics for a reason. The 1978 version of ""Halloween"" was in my opinion the absolute classic among the slasher films. In '78 John Carpenter did a brilliant job of putting together a slasher movie that was surprisingly non-violent. It was atmosphere and creepiness that made the original version so good. This version is so different. And that's fine. I mean, if you're going to go to the trouble of producing a remake, you better give it some sort of fresh feel. Otherwise, it's hardly worth the effort. This did have a fresh feel to it, but it was also nowhere as good as the original.Rob Zombie directed this. He has a style very different than John Carpenter. Much of this was a very typical, 21st century slasher film. In other words, it has a lot of blood, a lot of gore, and a lot of naked young women in it. These things are required for a modern slasher flick after all. But I didn't find this as ""satisfying"" as Carpenter's version of the story. It was too much what you would expect from a slasher flick. It was good enough, and it was even frightening at times. But to me, it simply lacked that atmosphere that Carpenter created and was filled with the above mentioned blood, gore and nude women instead. Zombie also spent far more time exploring Michael Myers than Carpenter did. I had a mixed reaction to that. The picture painted was of a troubled home life, and of a young boy who tortured animals and was himself the object of bullying at school. In fact, much of the first hour of the movie didn't go much past Michael's childhood. The return to Haddonfield takes a back seat to that character development, and Michael's sister Lori is much less front and centre than she was in 1978.I will give credit to the cast. The cast of this movie was quite good. Malcolm McDowell was an inspired choice to play Dr. Loomis. I thought it would be difficult to take over a role that I so heavily associate with Donald Pleasance but McDowell did well with the part. Scout Taylor- Compton also more than held her own as Lori, once the teenage Lori was introduced to the movie. She was very effective at playing the terror Lori felt as Michael stalked her and moved into for the kill. Young Daeg Faerch very effectively portrayed a very troubled 10-year old Michael.So, there's a lot to like about this movie. It's certainly not a disaster by any means. For me, it just suffers when compared to the original version by John Carpenter. (6/10)",Halloween
38,thesar-2,"So full of rage, so full of patience, evil is.",8,27 August 2009,"From the opening seconds of Rob Zombie's 'Halloween,' Zombie sets the tone beautifully, albeit gruesomely. You'll see the ideal dysfunctional family and you'll quickly learn, there's not going to be a redeeming character in this film. In fact, you'll not just get flawed characters, you'll simply get a-holes. Heck, even the kid, Tommy, is no saint. Unfortunately, this leaves no one to root for, not even good ole Dr. Loomis or Laurie Strode. I guess Zombie was trying for realism, not heroes, but it's an unfortunate quality of this reboot. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this reimaging, and as the original 1978 'Halloween' remains as my favorite horror movie of all time, I can actually avoid comparisons and see this as a stand-alone movie that happens to mimic scenes, lines and score of the original. Other than that, it very well could have been a brand-new movie, and if it had been, it would outshine most modern horror/slasher movies made. I would believe a new horror icon was born, I'd be an instant fan and here to stay for awhile, and that wouldn't disappoint me. Zombie did an excellent job at writing, directing and making me truly feel fear of that child, ""Mikey."" So much so, that as an adult and going after his sister following his escape, I saw that kid's face in front of the mask. The movie's not perfect or void of flaws (9-1-1 is used at one house, but they show up at another and Laurie's screaming in Michael's arms one second and silent the next, etc) but the mood was set, Michael was truly a monster (completely proved throughout – see the orderly's death), soundtrack's excellent and of all eight Michael Myers movies made, it had the creepiest and most realistic ""Michael in the background"" shots.Side Note on some additional unfortunate flaws: I'm not a lawyer, so I can't quote the law, but isn't Dr. Loomis breaking doctor-patient confidentiality by spilling everything he's learnt on Michael in a book, even after dropping him as a patient? Also, Zombie, though as good of a job I thought he did, really couldn't make me feel sorry for little Michael in the opening when he couldn't trick or treat. 'Love Hurts' though a good song, didn't make me shed tears that he couldn't go. Perhaps it was the boy, despite doing the best range he knew how and was creepy in some segments, wasn't all that good of an actor to pull emotions out of the audience. And I've been passed out drunk before, even blacked out – but it was the hardest thing for me to buy that a rather large man can be duct-taped down without waking, including the mouth.Another Side Note: I just finished watching all 9 'Halloween' movies made. And I challenge anyone who criticizes this movie to do the same. An avid Michael Myers fan growing up, I found watching all 9 in a row (over 1 week) an unfortunate eye-opener. Of the 9, only 3 are worth watching, or only 33%. Six range from duds to disgustedly horrid and ludicrous. I think Zombie loved the original, took 30% of that, including dialogue and actual scenes and made the rest his own. I think the end product, though not 100% perfect, was refreshing (again after watching the previous sequels – not including 'H20' which was the only redeeming sequel) and made me honestly believe in the magic, horror, suspense and fear of Michael Myers. I look forward to Zombie's 'Halloween II.' And that's the reason I revisited this series (mostly) based in Haddonfield, Ill. Bring it on, Zombie.",Halloween
39,bensonmum2,"Good, but far from perfect",7,5 September 2014,"I originally wrote this back in 2007 after seeing the movie in the theater. For whatever reason, I never posted the review. Here it is:Unlike some other fan comments I read on the internet, as soon as I heard the news that Rob Zombie was going to remake Halloween, I was ecstatic. Halloween has always been a favorite of mine. In fact, I've probably seen it more times over the years than any other horror movie. As for Zombie, I loved both his first two movies (yes, I loved what I consider to be the very underrated House of 1000 Corpses). The whole project seemed like a sure fire winner to me.Overall, I enjoyed Zombie's reinterpretation of John Carpenter's classic quite a bit. It's not perfect, but it's a damn good effort. While I appreciate the fact that Zombie followed the basic storyline of the original, he threw in enough of his own ideas and scenes to keep it original and keep the audience guessing. One thing that makes me laugh are the comments I've read that complain the movie has too much foul language, too much violence, and too much nudity. What were these people expecting? It's a Rob Zombie movie! The final chase scene is for the most part expertly handled. The old Myers house becomes more of a focus and I enjoyed the chase going through every conceivable room and level. And just when it seemed the chase was over, Zombie's inclusion of false endings really caught me off guard. I was very impressed with the direction of this portion of the film.Other highlights for me included some of the acting. Daeg Faerch is surprisingly good as the young Michael Myers. He has an innocence about him that he plays to his advantage. I'm also surprised at how effective Sherri Moon Zombie was at playing Michael's mother. After her husband's first two movies, I thought of her as little more than a one note actor. While she will never get near an acting award, she did show a little range with her performance in Halloween. And Malcolm McDowell is . . . well, he's Malcolm McDowell – a wonderful actor. I don't think there's much more that need be said. The music was a real asset in the movie. Zombie used Carpenter's original score to great effect and mixed in some nice period pieces. I've seen some on the internet complain about the inclusion of the song ""Love Hurts"" at a particularly key moment in the movie. Well, I loved it and thought it fit perfectly. Finally, I've just got to say I loved some of the casting decisions, particularly the cameos. Some seemed quite natural – Danny Trejo as an institution worker, Clint Howard as a doctor, and Sybil Danning as a nurse. But Micky Dolenz from the Monkees as a gun store owner? How cool is that? Freakin' Micky Dolenz! Okay, enough of the good. As I said in the opening, the movie's not perfect. But I'm not going to sit here and pick the movie apart, so I'll limit this to three of the most obvious faults I saw in the movie. First, the opening 30 minutes that detail Michael's childhood before the killings start goes on far too long and takes away from the mystery of Michael. Too many movies try to explain away everything. Zombie, unfortunately, falls into this trap. Next, I've got a real problem with the way Zombie chose to present Laurie Strode and her friends. There's no real attempt to make them more than one dimensional characters. Who are they? Why do they do the things they do? Why should I care about them at all? Finally, and this is a biggie, I have a problem with (and though I've tried to limit the comparisons with Carpenter's movie, this one has to be mentioned) the lack of atmosphere and subtlety in this version of Halloween. Zombie seemed to be rushing the last half of the movie and missed out on what made the original a classic. How many times did Michael materialize out of the shadows in the 1978 movie? Man, was that ever creepy or what? Zombie seems content to let the audience know exactly where Michael is at all times. And if you do lose sight of him, be patient – he's bound to come crashing through a wall at any minute. It really lessens the mystery and suspense.But when it gets right down to it, regardless of the strengths and weaknesses I see in a particular movie, it's all about entertainment. Did the movie entertain me? It may sound shallow, but that's the most important factor for me. And when it comes to entertainment, Rob Zombie's Halloween was very successful. I had a great time in the nearly packed theater and I think the others did as well. It's been awhile since I've seen a movie where people clapped when it was over. And about half the crowd did just that at my opening night showing. I may change my opinion after repeat viewings, but for now I'll give it a 7/10.Good going Rob! Looking forward to seeing what you come up with next.",Halloween
40,Robert_duder,Who else could screw this up besides Rob Zombie?,5,16 September 2007,"I personally love remakes, I'm all for them...remake anything you want and I'll go see it. The thing is...Halloween is the first film that I can think of that I actually grew up watching, LOVING, it started my love affair with Horror films...that I am now watching a remake of...makes me feel old. And who would have to be the one that they choose to remake the classic 1978 Carpenter Horror Classic that shaped my movie watching life? One of my most hated film makers if you want to call him that, and music makers. Why couldn't they find someone who truly respected the film and the characters because I still think Carpenter and his partners made something far more intelligent than just your average hack and slash blood fest that actually had legend to it and a story and a back story and more!! Now is this new remake completely trash? NO!! That's the good news but the unfortunate news is that it doesn't even come close to giving us or a new generation the scares or chills of the original. Zombie went all out in making sure the film was gory and blood drenched and in the process left out all hope of being creeped out, chilled to the bone by the anticipation and not the action of Michael Myers.Now the funny thing is...the first thing I thought about a Halloween remake would be who could possibly play Dr. Loomis? No one could ever replace the amazing Donald Pleasence and when they announced the actor my heart dropped. I admit I have never liked Malcolm McDowell and I always find him campy and over acted and the funniest thing is...one of the biggest things that DIDN'T bother me about Halloween (2007) is his performance as Loomis. Now it was quite different from Pleasence and Carpenter's Loomis but even still he did a very good job. I would be pleased to have seen him do the role again in the future. Former professional wrestler Tyler Mane takes over as the larger than life role of killer Michael Myers and does a terrific job. I mean Myers seems like an easy character but everything is told through his movements and his actions and Mane nails it and is menacing enough. The guy is towering and almost too big to be Myers but he does a good job. Scout Taylor-Compton is hot to look at but completely uninspired as Laurie Strode-Myers. She doesn't even hold a flame to the film icon of Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie. Maybe it's the script or the director because all of the actors never seem to really hit any sort of stride with their characters and are pretty boring. Danielle Harris, who I was very excited to see as Sheriff's daughter Annie Brackett because she was little Jamie Lloyd (Laurie Strode's biological daughter) in Halloween 4 and 5. Harris actually does an alright job but still doesn't manage to really impress as the character. Sheri Moon is overzealous and ridiculous (as always) as Deborah Myers, Michael's stripper Mom who is devastated at the loss of her family and son. Everyone else is meant to either get gutted viciously or show off their breasts or both.Now the one thing I give director Zombie a thumbs up too was the attempt at giving a complete background to Michael Myers and the story of what happened. Unfortunately it's obvious Zombie moved away from Carpenter's story making the Myers' family white trash to the core, and although we see plenty of Michael as a young child and his first killing and the first Halloween night we still get absolutely no explanation to why he did this or what happened to him. And although he's a regular size kid the adult Michael Myers is a towering beast of a man with supernatural strength. Why couldn't Zombie create a reason for all this and really put some effort into it and maybe even do away with the remake part of the film and stick with a full fledged prequel? With the right writer that could have really been something. It has it's pros and cons and the majority of them are cons unfortunately. For every question answered (and he does answer some even if they are implausible and don't fit the original story) he adds yet another question that will likely never get answered. This installment might be worse than the dreaded Part 6 or Part 3 of the Halloween franchise...hmmm 3, 6, 9...curse anyone? 5.5/10",Halloween
41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Imperfect but still a much needed update of a classic horror,7,5 October 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Classic though John Carpenter's 1978 original was, it was still a low-budget horror film made in the late 70s, right down to Michael Myers's legendary scary mask (which, in case you didn't already know, was actually just a Captain Kirk Star Trek mask painted white!) and as such was starting to show it's cracks a bit to a modern day audience. It needed to be up-dated a little. Which is just as well since if another sub-par sequel was made I might have gone as mad as old Michael himself. It's a great film that deserves to be appreciated by a modern audience and so we have this slick new version.It's not so much a re-make as an extension of the original story, telling the back story of how Michael became the psycho killer we all know and love. We see him as a young boy in small town Illinois, with his pole dancer mom, abusive alcoholic cripple of a step-dad, mean older sister and cruel bullies at school. It all proves too much for poor old Michael who, after some disturbing displays of behaviour, goes in for the kill (ITP) and takes out all those family members he can't stand. Needless to say, he finds himself sectioned and secured in a mental health unit for many years. Until he breaks out, many years later and returns to his home-town to finish his work. The despairing Dr Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), is in hot pursuit, along with the small town's police force to stop the maniac before it's too late.With The Devil's Rejects's Rob Zombie at the helm, the blood/gore factor is reliably pumped up to factor 10, unflinchingly nasty at every turn through-out the film. However, he's also taken creative licence with some of the elements from the original film, meaning the Michael we see in this just isn't quite the Michael we remember from the original. Plus by the time the back story we never saw or heard about in the original film has finished, we're left to re-live the plot line from the original film and somehow towards the end it's all started to drag on a little, with some you-think-he's-dead-but-he's-not moments tacked on that just serve to add to the nauseam that's already started to creep in.Still, this is a slick, stylish, polished update of a modern horror classic that has Zombie's unmistakable style stamped all over it, a modern version with modern gore, modern scares and modern style, but with some pretty big flaws that stop it from being really great. ***",Halloween
42,MLDinTN,a remake that's still scary,7,3 May 2009,"I thought this was a pretty good scary movie. The first 45 minutes was the better part of the film as it told the story of Michael Myers as a kid. It shows his first killings on Halloween. Especially disturbing was when he beats up the bully with a tree branch. Just seeing a young kid be that violent and bloody up another kid's face was just wrong. Michael also kills his mom's boyfriend, his sister and her boyfriend. He doesn't harm his mother or baby sister. Michael is sent to a psych ward where he is studied by Dr. Loomis. He claims he doesn't remember any of it. After another violent outburst, flash forward 15 years. This is when Michael escapes and the movie is not as good. Once he gets his famous mask, he's just scary to look at on screen. Rob Zombie throws in some naked girls and one final long chase scene as Michael is after his sister. One main problem I had, how did Michael know exactly where his adopted sister would be. Simple, he wouldn't.FINAL VERDICT: Some good gore, scary moments, a good chase scene. Worth watching for horror fans.",Halloween
43,ericstevenson,Happy Halloween again!,6,31 October 2017,"I figures it would only make sense that I would celebrate Halloween by watching what else, the movie ""Halloween"". Well, not the original. The remake. This film is notable for being the longest slasher movie ever made. Yeah, I was wrong about ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"". Well, it's really hard to pin down. The version I saw was two hours long whereas most versions are just one hour and 49 minutes long. I'm going to count this as the longest because it technically is. This movie spends the first thirty eight minutes showing Michael as a child. His actual kills do appear do make up for half of that running time, so it's pretty well paced.We do get nice callbacks to the original film. It was nice seeing those elements from such a good movie. I'm going to admit I'm probably being kinder to this film than I really should because it's really not that good. I still praise these people for making a well paced story out of such a lengthy horror film. It is kind of annoying to see Michael's origin make up such a large portion, but it's not bad. It was interesting to see him talk as a kid. Boy, do I love that theme music. Well, that's it for Slasher Month and thank God I'll never have to do that again. Hey, it's November.

44,cricketbat,"Seriously, who hurt you, Mr. Zombie?",4,29 October 2021,"There's something wrong with Rob Zombie. His adaptation of Halloween is grisly and unpleasant. It relies on blood and gore to frighten the audience, rather than actual suspense. Also, his exploration into the backstory of Michael Myers weakens the character overall. The original Halloween movies have their low points, but at least they were fun to watch--this movie wasn't.

46,Bored_Dragon,"Next time I see that Myers pussy, he's dead!",7,29 April 2019,"The remake of the cult horror film from 1978 is a true refreshment from the original franchise. Thirty years after the original film, screenwriter and director Rob Zombie, better known as the frontman of the metal band White Zombie, turned barely mediocre slasher into quite good psychological horror thriller.While the original film is a two-dimensional slasher in which Michael Myers is an inexplicable and indestructible embodiment of evil, the remake brings us a background story that gives this character a face and a psychological profile. The old ""Halloween"" begins with Michael's murder of his sister, for no apparent reason, and hospitalization in a mental institution, and then immediately jumps fifteen years into the future, where Michael escapes from an asylum and begins his frantic manhunt. Zombie adds a lengthy introduction and shows us Michael's childhood, dysfunctional family, problems at school and early signs of mental disorder, from which somewhat logically follows the rest of the story. In the original franchise, the main characters are Michael's victims and Dr. Samuel Loomis, while Michael is a faceless, mysterious and brutal evil that lurks from the shadows, incomprehensible, inhuman. Rob's vision does not bind us to teenagers ""condemned to death"", but instead moves spotlight on Michael himself, who takes on the lead role, so we follow his transformation from a seemingly cute child to a relentless killing machine, while his victims are now somewhat depersonalized and essentially irrelevant.In the first part of the film, young Michael is played by twelve-year-old Daeg Faerch, who quite skillfully balances between the sweet 10-year-old trying to get through an unhappy childhood and soulless psychopath on whose face is reflected the abyss of evil. In the second part, the film returns to the original story and becomes a classic slasher, essentially no better or worse than the original, but somewhat better shot. If you do not like the original, like I don't, here is your chance to look at the story from a different angle that may suit you better.7/10",Halloween
47,ironhorse_iv,"Was that the Boogeyman? As a matter of fact, it was. He's just not as good as the original one. That's for sure.",5,31 October 2017,"It's Halloween; everyone's entitled to one good scare. I just wouldn't pick this remake to watch. This horror movie directed by music artist Robert Cummings AKA Rob Zombie, just wasn't as entertaining, it should had been. Don't get me wrong, while, this ninth slasher movie in the film series was financially successful at the box office, its reception among critics and fans were very mixed. For me, I didn't like it, at all. While, I'm willing to give it, some praise for, trying to do, something new, & not being a shot-by-shot remake like director Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake of filmmaker, Alfred Hitchcock's 1960's masterpiece murder mystery, 'Psycho'. I just couldn't get, with the idea of Zombie turning, the main villain, Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) into a tragic sympathetic figure. It goes against, everything that the original creators, John Carpenter & Debra Hill, was going for. He's isn't supposed to be, love or like. It's not like Frankenstein's Monster. Myers is supposed to be pure evil. He's supposed to be, the mythic, elusive bogeyman who can't be killed, reason with, or even captured. In the original 1978 movie of the same name, Michael (Nick Castle)'s goal is to terrorize and murder, everybody in Haddonfield, including Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). His motive for terrorizing is supposed to be unknown. It makes him, a lot scarier. Here, his motive are somewhat clear. He comes across, as a killer with standards. Only killing those, whom threated or mistreat him, in anyway. He rarely kills any innocent people. Most of the victims, he depose off, here were violently unlikeable, that he come across, as an anti-hero, more than villain. If he does kill somebody, innocent. He show a lot of guilt. To add insult to his evil persona, his escape from the sanitarium, was just a genuinely attempt to try to reestablish a brotherly relationship with his estranged sister, Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) rather than, just plain old killing spree. In the end, while I get Zombie's nurture over nature approach to the source material. It really does kinda ruins the mystic of the psychopath, big time that Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) was trying to paint. One of the reasons, why I love the original movie, is how little, we know, of him when he was little. For starters, he really seem like a normal kid, living in the middle class neighborhood, who just happen to snapped. His odd behavior seem to come out of nowhere, leaving more suspense and mystery on why he did it. Here's, in this remake, it's pretty obvious & stereotypical with his abusive, poverty-stricken family that Michael would grow up to have problems. It's a little more predictable & dry. It's also far too gruesome and visceral exploitation for my taste. Look, I know, that the family scenes are meant to be unpleasant, but 40 minutes of hearing loud annoying yelling, is not entertaining. It's just plain old obnoxious & somewhat unwatchable. He took it, too far. Zombie could had, lighten up the whole film, a bit. After all, he did make one of his actresses, Kristina Klebe, break down, mentally, during filming. Not only that, but he did crap on the fans, by having actress, Danielle Harris, brutally stab to death in the nude as Annie Brackett!? That was really uncalled for, seeing how many of the horror fans was rooting for her as the likable, Jamie Lloyd from 1988's 'Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers', as a child actress. That was a bit distasteful. Not, everything in this movie, needed to be 'in your face' shock value. Sometimes, less is a lot scarier. It really need to know, how to be subtle. The original movie was scary enough with seeing an unknown dark presence stalking you with the sinister soundtrack, playing in the background, it didn't need gruesome and visceral depictions of rape, animal cruelty and suicide, with oddly time music to get the fear, across. Because of this, the remake come across, as a little too gimmicky. It tries too hard to be, disturbing, that it forget to be, entertaining. It even forgot, to be, realistic. The film has a lot of really dumb decisions like the way, Michael escape & how the William Shatner's mask was introduce. All of those kill scenes are also highly, over the top & clichés. Often done to death, in previous, Rob Zombie's horror flicks, such as 2005's 'The Devil Rejects' & 2003's 'House of 1000 Corpses'. Like his other movies, this remake does have Unrated 'Director's Cut' version. However, it's really shallow. It's just more unoriginal gory kills, than anything with substance. It honestly really not needed. Just stick to the Theatrical Cut, even if the last third, is a rushed version of 'the Babysitter Murders' sequence from the first movie, with lousy badly-written version of Laurie whom come across, as more mean-spirited than the original one, fighting off, somehow, a being who looks more like a steroid-fuel, Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th film series than a normal guy without the mask, could be, your neighbor. What was Myers, doing in the mental hospital!? Lifting weights! Was Dr. Loomis; his spotter!? Gees Louise! The guy is over the top, jack! Mane was over-casted. Talking about casting. I did like McDowell as Dr. Loomis. I like how they fit, more on him, in the movie. I just wish, the movie went with a schizophrenic approach with Myers, rather than the abusive angle. I want it to be something in the same vein as 1973's 'The Exorcist'. In short, I can concede that a good kid snapping is more shocking than an at risk preteen. Overall: While the first movie popularize, the Slasher Movie genre and inspired other similar franchises. I really can't recommended, watching this reboot. It's not good at all. It will forever, live in the shadows of the original film. That's for sure. Ready to disappointed, those who become aware of its presence.",Halloween

The sequel Halloween II (2009) is scarier. Halloween II (1981) is also better. The sixth Halloween movie Halloween the cures of Michael Myers is also better. The seventh Halloween movie Halloween H2O is also better. But still this is very good movie. A lot better then Halloween III season of the witch. That movie is just crap. Halloween 4 the return of Michael Myers is good movie. But this remake is better. This one is also better then Halloween 5 the revenge of Michael Myers which is pretty good. This is a great improvement from the eight Halloween movie. Halloween resurrection which is not very good. This one is great. I consider this horror fantasy because Michael is a Warlock. This movie is a must see it is very scary. People who like this movie need to speak up I know that it got 7 out of 10 it the ratings. It is true the original Halloween from 1978 is better.

50,paulclaassen,"After the first half, the film offers nothing new.",3,16 October 2018,"Since we all know all too well what Michael became, it was interesting to see his childhood. Its even more demented seeing a child committing the brutal killings. Daeg Faerch was very good as the 10-year old Michael, although I found his acting once in custody a bit cheesy - possibly because he wasn't given anything interesting to do and the idea that he ""couldn't remember anything"" was a bit stupid. It removed the evil aspect. Sheri Moon Zombie was good as the Mother. I did not enjoy the new Laurie Strode character (played by Scout Taylor-Compton). This character was the complete opposite of the Laurie we know and loved from the original Halloween (played by Jamie-Lee Curtis). Once the film reached the halfway mark, I might as well have turned this film off and watched the 1978 version, as it was so identical (even the dialogue) with very little vision from director Rob Zombie. The original was more effective and this 'modernized' version concentrates more on swearing and sexual connotations that seems so forced it was annoying, to say the least. It is also hard to believe Danielle Harris - who was so good in 'Halloween 4 & 5' - could resort to this cheap pornographic acting. The film became an excuse to show boobs and flesh. Brad Dourif was an interesting choice as Sheriff Brackett. Maybe he should have been Michael Myers instead...The editing was so choppy that I at times felt I was missing some of the action. Rather watch the first half of the film to familiarize yourself with Michael, and then continue with 1978's 'Halloween'.",Halloween
51,sol-,Behind the Mask,7,30 October 2016,"Incarcerated since he was ten, an escaped murderer return to his hometown for the first time in over fifteen years, reeking havoc while trying to reconnect with his sister in this ambitious remake of both John Carpenter's original 'Halloween' and its sequel, 'Halloween II'. The film is directed by Rob Zombie and with much grisly violence, Zombie's vision never matches the original for pure suspense, but as a narrative it is much tighter and flows better than watching the 1978 and 1981 films back-to-back. The big difference is that all the exposition happens early on here and we are curiously positioned to emphasise with Michael Myers, whereas the original films come from the perspective of Michael's victims, clueless to his motivations. This approach is not without its drawbacks; all the focus on Myers renders Laurie Strode rather bland (and Scout Taylor-Compton's inappropriately sassy performance is no help), however, there is a lot to like with how Zombie plays around with whether Michael should be feared or pitied. Amidst all the horror, there is a touching moment as he offers a photo to Laurie, only for her to remain heartbreakingly oblivious to his benign intentions. The film also benefits from playing tribute to the original movies. Carpenter's iconic score features predominantly in the second half and even 'Mr. Sandman' from the second film gets a whirl while the characters wander the exact same streets from Part 1. Sure, Zombie's favouring of brute violence over the pure creepiness of the original is disappointing, but this is a more worthwhile film than one might expect.",Halloween
52,zkonedog,Don't Compare; Just Enjoy,10,3 March 2017,"Whenever a really popular movie is re-made, opinions on the necessity will always vary widely. Some will love the ""fresh take"", while others will compare it to the original and not be able to fully immerse themselves. In the case of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"", I hope you will be able to fall into the former group and avoid the comparisons. Not only does Zombie do a great job of re- imagining the franchise, but also fills in a lot of gaps along the way.For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween"" opens on a young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) living with his trailer-trash father, stripper mother, slutty sister, and a young baby. After being denied a night of trick-or-treating on Halloween, Michael's anger issues get the better of him and he murders his sister and father in cold blood. He is quickly taken into the custody of psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) for many, many years. As an adult, Michael is being transported to a new facility when he decides to make his move, breaking out of his imprisonment and wreaking havoc on his old home town of Haddonfield. For reasons not initially understood, he targets young Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), along the way running into Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris) and Lynda (Kristina Klebe) and leaving a wake of destruction in his path.There are two primary reasons why Rob Zombie is able to make this movie such a success:1. It fills in the cracks of Michael's past, which (up until this point) had only been explained in previous monologues by Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis. Actually seeing the ""inspiration"" for Michael's psychotic nature makes for some visceral, compelling drama.2. It truly is an ode to the original, from the general plot line to the music all the way to the casting (Danielle Harris in a key role). This is where the critics (or those who idolized the original) may get turned off, but I loved the original and can still appreciate this new imagining. To me, sometimes a story is so compelling that it can be told in multiple formats across many years. For example, take ""True Grit"". The John Wayne version is a western legend, while the Coen Brothers put a completely new spin on the same exact tale. Both are great films...just different. That is how I look at this Halloween. I love the original, and this one was a way to experience the same story just from a fresh perspective.Simply put, ""Halloween (2007)"" is the best film in this franchise since 1981's ""Halloween 2"". That isn't saying much, I know, as so many stinkers were in between, but it is the truth. For years, directors/writers have tried to squeeze every last ounce out of Michael Myers, and pretty much did, turning the franchise into a joke in the process. Zombie (the unlikeliest of sources, if I may say so) managed to breathe new life into the proceedings by going back instead of forward.You may still watching John Carpenter's original on October 31st, but once you watch this effort it may also become a staple of your scary-movie viewing.",Halloween

Some, in fact, deserve this kind of ""second chance"" but others end up not deserving that. This is the case of ""Halloween"" 1978. This remake of 2007 brings nothing new and this is a problem, along with the simple fact that it fails totally as a horror movie, not being able to scare us. The actors' work is decent enough. Although we never see him in the face, Tyler Mane (and sometimes Daeg Faerch, when he's using his mask) did a good job playing the monstrous Michael Myers, and Malcolm McDowell's strong presence (as Dr. Loomis) is equally important and noteworthy. Although the actors struggle, some dialogues and scenes are bad because of the material given to them. It seems that screenwriter was obsessed with profanities and sex, two things that are too present in the film, without any purpose with this excessive presence. The worst of this film, as far as the actors are concerned, is Scout Taylor-Compton, who has always been too histrionic.So, this movie is a horror disaster. It never freaks us out and even becomes funny. But it works best as a light thriller, with touches of slasher movie.

It's Michael whom we see as an misunderstood and abused, by his classmates, young boy who turns his anger and frustration out on the world at large at the tender young age of 10 as he goes on a murder spree against all those who've been kicking him around. Having murdered some half dozen people before his 12 birthday Michael is sent to the Smith Grove Sanitarium for pre-adult offenders where he's assigned Doc. Samuel Loomis as his personal psychiatrist. It's Dr. Loomis who over time realizes that the young boy is pure evil and should be kept from society for the rest of his life and have his brain, while alive, dissected for future study to see just what in it makes him tic as well as murder. Michael also develops a fascination with masks that he makes himself out of paper and cardboard to keep anyone from viewing his face and dropping dead of fright from seeing it.The story plods along for some 15 years when Michael now an adult with supernatural powers-He works out for hours at a time in his jail cell- breaks out of his confinements and heads straight for home-Hoddonfield-just in time to celebrate Halloween-his favorite holiday-and take care of some unfinished business. That by murdering those he feels did him wrong over the years including family members while he was a resident there. There's also the fact that Michael's kid sister Laurie Strode still lives there and, after murdering as much as half the town, wants to start a new life together with her as brother & sister.***SPOILERS*** By the number horror flick with a new and improved as well as deadlier Michael Myers doing his thing-murdering-far more people then in the 1978 version.

As for the thankless Dr. Loomis he ends up being one of Michael's victims when he tries to talk him into giving himself up to the police as well as the men in the white suits before he ends up murdering the entire movie cast.

It is also a shame that the 70s have become a breeding ground for remakes of tepid, tame, and familiar horror films that really don't nor should be made again. Halloween is indeed no exception, but...yes, there is a but...Rob Zombie is a fan and he brings a bit more to the table than most. He also brings gratuitous vulgarity, nudity, foul language, and some truly disgusting plot threads to his film. That is unfortunate for him. It is a blessing in that it brings home the money from an under-aged audience who has been desensitized to violence practically from the womb. He is already about to come out with a sequel to this film if that can be believed(unfortunately I CAN believe it!). It is a curse in that he overshadows the talent he does have as a film maker. Zombie has scenes in all his films which stand out as wonderful examples of film-making, performance, and suspense. The whole first part of this film, minus the unnecessary things previously mentioned, was really good I thought as Zombie focused on the young Michael Myers and his mental state, his relationship with his mother and Dr. Loomis, and his childhood. The film then abruptly follows the original script for the most part about a third or so in and is nothing more from that point than a pale copy - and one that did not need to be remade. I will say this for Zombie - he does stay true to the source material not just in details but also in spirit. This is one of the biggest differences between Zombie and those others with less talent and respect. The acting is pretty good overall. Malcolm McDowell was pretty spot-on playing a role defined by Donald Pleasance. Everyone else was respectable and Zombie, of course, gives little character parts to old genre folk like Dee Wallace, Danielle Harris, Sid Haig, Brad Dourif, Leslie Easterbrook, Udo Kier, and many others. Standing out for me were Ken Foree(from Dawn of the Dead - the original) who looks pretty awful but gave one heck of a cameo in a very funny, disturbing, and disgusting scene and the other was a brief cameo Sybil Danning - still looks SO hot! If Zombie had just focused on the first part and moved on that rather than do a senseless remake then this film would be a whole lot better than it is and it would have a better reputation. Despite all this Zombie's Halloween is not great not particularly good but not bad either.",Halloween

However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

59,insomniac_rod,Zombie (go)re-invented Michael Myers. A new millennium boogeyman.,7,7 December 2008,"Rob Zombie is among the most popular newcomer Horror Directors of the millennium because of his innovative directing style based on surreal/nightmarish images, extreme gore, plenty of colors, and best of all, distinctive character development.Zombie didn't have a lot to do in order to create the proper atmosphere for a Halloween movie. Let me explain myself... 1) John Carpenter created the PERFECT and only Halloween atmosphere experience with a boogeyman lurking a peaceful neighborhood where you never expect something bad to happen. The boogeyman, the darkness, a chiling plot, and score created the experience. Zombie just had to ""copy and paste"". 2) Zombie just added the gore and ""extreme"" violence factors. There you go, you have a remake with at least two aspects that the original didn't have. The plot is well known by everybody except that this time we learn about Michael's horrible childhood and motives for becoming a silent killing machine. Then, Zombie goes further and gives Myers gruesome killing methods that show that he has lost mercy and everything that deals with human nature.Zombie also adds his favorite actors to this new experience and that's what it makes it more like his previous works and doesn't adds a new feeling of new actors. Also, the heavy metal soundtrack fits perfect with the classic Halloween theme we love. Zombie's last addition is the sexuality aspect that is absent (at least graphically) on the original. There you go, we have all the well known Rob Zombie elements put on a classic. So this remake is only about non-stop violence, sexual situations, and gore. I can't say anything more because if you have seen Zombie's previous works before ""Halloween"" you will PERFECTLY know what to expect. Nothing more, nothing less. Expect the classic Halloween elements with gore and profanity.Zombie's Halloween is exactly that, Zombie's idea of Carpenter's Halloween. Give it a chance only if: 1) You are a fan of Rob Zombie's work. 2) You love anything that has to do with the original Halloween.",Halloween
60,matthewssilverhammer,A Dark Misunderstanding of What Makes Halloween Great,4,25 August 2019,"There's certainly some noble boldness to Zombie's first entry (the expanded back story is actually better than I would've thought), but the way it breaks so many of Myers' crucial rules is hard to forgive (overly humanizing Michael, too often showing his face, allowing him to speak). Also, this new Laurie is a travesty; annoying, cliched teen movie damsel with little agency or strength to speak of. It all leads to a stupid, abrupt, and unsatisfying ending to an oppressively dark remake.",Halloween
61,videorama-759-859391,"Zombie's apology accepted here, to which has evolved, a fashioned masterpiece",7,14 August 2013,"With it's striking poster, this famous horror remake is very well handled in terms of story. Before becoming a faceless psychopath, we see the young Michael Myers, an object of verbal abuse by his Stepdad, (William Forsythe), and physical abuse by peers. Michael getting his bloodthirsty revenge on them, had me howling and cheering. Forsythe, a great character actor, marks a much welcomed return, one of these underrated stars worthy of Academy Award status. There are some other great character actors in this, I won't mention, but this is somewhat one of the better remakes. I was just so impressed here, with the handling of the Zombie. It flows beautifully as we step in Myers shoes, and really get a taste of this infamous character, before he just becomes a faceless maniac. Mcdowell is great as Dr Loomis, he was a worthy asset here. At nearly two hours running length (it didn't feel that way) it had enough scares and jolts, to make thrilling viewing, plus of course the more bloodier, overdone violence than tops the originals, especially in this new horror age, where Wolf Creek lit the fuse. The drawn out ending was a bit irritating, but worth the surprise that comes out of not knowing if Michael'S really gonna die here as compared to Jason's survival in Friday the 13th, though we both undoubtedly know, these two will come out winners. Zombie has done a great job here, and I accept his apology in wake of that horrible horror letdown, ""House Of A Thousand Corpses"", though I haven't seen ""Rejects"". If more remakes followed Zombie's example here, instead of going straight for the gore, with less time story plotting, we'd have better remakes. This is one feature Zombie should be proud of, with a great poster I'd be more than happy to pin on my door. Trivia: the Halloween remake came out exactly 28 years to the day and date of the original here in Adelaide. Freaky huh. Spawned a straight to DVD sequel here, of course.",Halloween

63,FiendishDramaturgy,Surprising,9,7 September 2007,"I was reluctant to embrace a remake of Halloween. There, I've said it. I could not imagine anything that could effectively endear itself to me without changing my love of the original. Also, I must say I am a fan of neither The Devil's Rejects, nor House of 1000 Corpses, as I found them both to be too close to another beloved franchise: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And, while I loved Grindhouse, the only portion he was responsible for is the Werewolf Women of the SS segment.This film is startling - much more so than the original. It is NOT for the feint of heart, nor for the kiddies. This is more for die-hard Halloween fans, as it does not attempt to retell the same story, but instead, delivers a whole new perspective to the Halloween franchise.In telling the story of Michael Meyers, rather than rehashing the story we already knew, Rob Zombie has allowed himself to become elevated in the annals of movie-making, especially among horror fans. This isn't your standard horror movie fare, and while it won't endear itself to people living in the shadow of an abusive alcoholic, it effectively demonstrates the making of a monster in a graphic and extraordinary way.Now, will I say this bests the original? No, I can't say that. But what I CAN say is that this is a definite must have for horror fans who love the Halloween franchise, as this movie fits snugly as a prequel, at the beginning of your set.Outstanding job, Rob Zombie! I hope to see more of your work, especially if you can maintain the higher quality achieved here.All in all? This is a GREAT Friday/Saturday night flick, but NOT for the kiddies or the easily queased.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Halloween
64,elshikh4,Proud Bankruptcy !,1,16 November 2011,"Halloween (1978) received mixed reviews when first launched, with some critics arguing that the main character was one-dimensional crazy guy. This (2007) remake came to solve this problem by looking into Michael Myers's history, exploring his psychological depth, and assuring that he is nothing but one-dimensional crazy guy!Director / Scriptwriter (Rob Zombie) declares, at the intro's board, that Michael is a runaway evil soul from hell, the worst kind that is. So calm down the thinkers, and get ready all the lovers for a ride of endless nonsensical BLOOD!Absoluteness is the perfect ore for the exploitation movie. So as an always hungry for sex lead in sexploitation, this one's lead is irredeemably hungry for slaughtering. The movie is so aware of its nature, and so frank about it. It even goes beyond. It honors the sub-genre in its own way, rewarding the first Halloween with a new copy of it!This remake's method was easy. It's plainly-repackaged pure album of killings, done in a carnival sense, with relevant predictability. It's like one man celebrates his 29th birthday by saying: ""Hi"" to himself in a mirror. And all what this movie did was manufacturing the mirror. As you see, Myers isn't the only crazy out there!Now Michael's stepfather is the ultimate jerk, Michael got 2 bullets in the back and yet acts like they were 2 nips of mosquito, and to top it all the 10-year-old Michael has sexual ideas about his sister; that's the translation of ""screwed up"" in this movie's head! Do you think I'm complaining about any of that? No, with more of that stuff, the movie could have been Razzie watchable!Actually it has no super factor, not even a surprise along the way, just some dark atmosphere anyhow, and many gallons of red color (and maybe tons of nudity also, but I can't say, since I watched the edited for TV version). So what did exist was the very cheap, learned by heart, structure filled with zero new, or distinct, things. Hence the real horror of it was its intended poorness. But it was - in the same time - the movie's reason of boastfulness.It replays its originals shamelessly. And why the shame since the slasher's antecedent fathers did it many times, all the times, before. While being extremely less creative, this movie could be more interesting than parodies, and other remakes, because it is, one way or another, incredible black comedy in itself. Someday Hollywood would watch and cry.. out of laughing!Halloween (2007) remakes an already worn-out formula, in worn-out way. Being bankrupt, and so proud of it, has many names in Hollywood of today: a tribute to, or a remake of, an original. While the impotence to beget any originality can't be denied at all. Nevertheless, (Michael Myers) got to be an ideal hero for Hollywood of today. Because his boring, and dumb, absoluteness insures blood, money, and sequels. And this movie's sole merit is its corroboration that nothing could be done to stop the same old, completely sanguineous, Michael Myers, Halloween movies, and the rest of the similar exploitative series.It is not ""Michael Myers Forever"". It's rather ""How to sell the same movie Forever!"". Hollywood is no fool, it makes a living by taking you for a fool!P.S: Dedicating the movie to the original's late producer Moustapha Akkad is good and bad. Good as it's a sign of loyalty. And bad as it's not a movie worth dedicating to anybody!",Halloween

66,generationofswine,An Honest Review,2,1 July 2017,"Well it has Malcolm McDowell, and he delivers in the master of accents kind of way.But....1 star for being a reboot, out of principal, especially a reboot of a slasher film that, well, I always thought the deal with those was to keep adding and adding until you have to look up the Roman Numerals in Encyclopedias to make sure you're numbering them right.Halloween MCMLXXVIII You know, that sort of thing.But we will add one for Malcolm McDowell just because, yeah, he delivers.So two stars: ** And then it seems like Zombies idea was to show a lot of nudity and especially a lot of naked women getting killed by a horrible male monster after committing the sin of fornication.So three stars: *** And that is because he MIGHT--with a really big stretch on that--have been trying to do a satire thing of the slasher genre with all the naked murdered women.But...he could have also been going for mainstream snuff porn.I'm honestly not sure which way to go on this one...so We are back to two stars: ** Just because it really might not have been an attempt at satire and I sort of want to be sure.And we can't add any more because well...It was already made and when it came around in 1978 it was moody and atmospheric and, well, it really looked a lot like Halloween, only a nightmare version of it.Zombie's remake feels more like a cheap version of Halloween and really, the outdoor shots that are supposed to give you the seasonal feel remind me more of Thanksgiving pick-up football games. They look and feel less like a nightmare version of Halloween than Season of the Witch's small Southern Town atmosphere.And the horror parts, really, ANY slasher movie and, by the way, since when was Halloween about T&A? I thought Friday the 13th owned that stereotype and we went to Halloween for, you know, atmosphere and scares...at least in the first 2 films.So really, I guess my point is that it has Malcolm McDowell and that is slightly redeeming. He's always fun to watch...even in his bad movies...like this one.",Halloween
67,Polaris_DiB,"Runs hot and cold, not in a good way",4,6 September 2007,"It took me a long time to really appreciate Rob Zombie for what he is--a musical equivalent of camp B-horror movies. It only follows that he would then go on to produce said camp B-horror movies, and though I haven't seen either of his previous two works, I still have faith that Rob Zombie can be successful in his own way. Halloween I had faith in as well, but in this case he reveals more what he should avoid than what he's actually good at.The beginning and ending scenes are brilliant. The dialog and verbal accosting in the first few scenes are written equivalents to the stylized gore and horror of Michael's life, and once the actual killings begin, the progression is very much understandable and related. The more tempting parts of these earlier scenes is the fact that many of them relate all too easily to things that have actually happened--a kid once DID beat his bully to death in the woods, dysfunctional families like that do tend to exist in all too comfortable areas, etc.Then, however, Rob adds something entirely new to the Halloween franchise--little Mikey's experiences in the asylum, scenes that were not only pointless, but if put up in comparison to the original Halloween, ruin one of the primary horrors of Michael Myers: his unearthly, deadened silence. Indeed, it was hard enough to accept the little boy Michael talking and occasionally screaming as it was, but the fact that it continued well into the asylum scenes removed pretty much most of the point of the original series. From that point on, then, I suppose it's kind of useless to compare the two except to point out that Michael Myers of this Halloween is much more of a burgeoning tank of aggression than the sexualized voyeur of the earlier movies. Zombie is trying to create something different here.The problem is that that realization immediately precedes some of the most mind-tearing painful exposition I think ever shot on film. If it wasn't for the overall strength of style in the earlier moments of the film, I would have just left during the introduction moments of Laurie Strode and friends. First of all, Laurie Strode doesn't fit any kind of virginal hero--she may be a virgin, she may be the hero, but she's not virginal, and she and her friends are almost chaotically pornographic in their approach to sexual relations. This isn't high-school realizations with hormones, and it isn't post-feminist realizations about the enjoyability of sex, it's disturbing and I would even say pornographic dialog. It might fit Zombie's sense of humor, but the delivery is so bad and the actors do it so poorly that it's the cinematic equivalent of fingers across chalkboard. Worse, Zombie cast girls who all look really small and under-aged, making their subsequent nudity even more disturbing than usual because it honestly felt like the audience was being shown under-aged nudity for sexual arousal. I know that technically, it fits in that high schoolers have sex and they do when under-aged. But the fact that we, the majority of the audience which should be over seventeen years of age, are watching it disturbs me, and no tropes of horror genre really seems to excuse it for me.Luckily, it isn't that long (made longer by the irritation, but still short enough) before Michael gets back with it and it turns into violent slasher tropes. Violence should be more disturbing than nudity but in this case even the disturbing violence comes as a relief after the pain of the earlier scenes, and once again Zombie is back in his element of hyper-stylized gore which has its own sense of craft and beauty. Sure, it's relatively ludicrous how many tight spaces Laurie manages to squeeze herself into, but who can say no to the final moment with the gun? It's here that Zombie's half-realized concepts of before get washed away in what he should have been keeping going with in the first place.Also, I have to applaud Zombie for the good decision of offing Dr. Loomis so early on--may he not return. Dr. Loomis has a very important role to play in the series, but he's also a character with the potential to become really obnoxious. He served his purpose in this film and hopefully that will be that as far as (inevitable) sequels are concerned.In the mean time, I really do wish this movie was released over Halloween, as I think it was successful and even well-done enough to deserve the holiday over which it is titled, and I would also like nothing more than to see something genuinely compete against that awful and impotent Saw series.--PolarisDiB",Halloween
68,strong-122-478885,"Mikey, Murder And Mask-Making Therapy...... BORING!!",1,20 April 2014,"Hey, Rob Zombie, you big, stinking, self-loving, narrow-visioned phony, there's more to horror than just gore, you know! Yeah! So, get with it, you F.N. A-List A-Hole! Like, who the hell did Rob Zombie think he was with his sniveling, brain-dead attempt to enlighten the viewer on understanding the workings of a seriously deranged mind? Ha! As though Zombie cared! But, hey, according to Zombie (being the supreme authority on such things as a fragile psychosis), it directly stems from being raised in a totally hateful, bullying, cussing, white-trash household where mommy-dearest may be a cheap, slutty ho, but she will always love her precious sonny-boy to her last, dying day.You know, I think that it's really-really peculiar, indeed, that Zombie clearly makes direct ties between the act of sex and the act of one committing the most brutal, savage, cold-blooded murders imaginable.It's true. I actually lost count of how many times a young, horny couple had promptly been given the full ""Michael Myers"" treatment within mere minutes following a good, old-fashioned fukk.I mean, talk about ""screwy"". (Ha! Get the pun?) And, speaking about the tie between sex and violence, I thought that it was just like Zombie to have the security guards at the mental institution being the type of low-life scum who love to brutally rape the female patients.About the only thing that I can applaud Zombie for in this movie is that he saw to it that Michael Myers murdered Danny Trejo's character. (Hooray, for that!) All-in-all - This frickin' Halloween remake was F.N. trash that took the meaning of the word ""awful"" to a whole new level of awfulness. As far as being a director/screenwriter of horror, I consider Rob Zombie to be nothing but a fart in the wind.And, finally - When it came to the category of ""Most Annoying, Over-Used Line Ever Spoken In A Horror Movie"", Halloween's ""No! Please! No!"" line certainly got my vote for a well-deserved Oscar, without question. This line was used so much in this picture that it totally desensitized me to the Myers' victims who were screaming it. And, because of that, I couldn't have cared less about what was happening to them. It just grated on my nerves, like you wouldn't believe.",Halloween
69,Stevieboy666,"Part prequel, part remake",6,1 November 2019,"Firstly I am a Rob Zombie fan, both in film and music. He is a total horror super fan, something to which I very much relate, I love his passion for the genre. And in every film that I have seen of his he delivers it by the bucket load in his own, trademark way.His version of Halloween plays for the first half as a prequel, we see a young, bullied Michael Myers start off by killing small animals, then progressing to murder and incarceration. This for me was the better half, Daeg Faerch did a really good job playing him. Then the second half plays out as a remake of the original classic, only no where near as good.At 6ft 8"" Tyler Mane does make an incredibly imposing Michael.
Halloween (2007) is an enjoyable watch. It has all of Zombie's trademark ingredients - a great cast of familiar horror genre names (though most are mere cameos), plenty of gore and violence, nudity, a great rock based soundtrack and a trailer park trash vibe. I know that the film industry is just that, it's about making money. But remaking/re-inventing classics rarely comes anywhere near to the original and this is one such example. I enjoyed this upon its first viewing but am reviewing it on a second and sadly I saw more faults in it this time round.",Halloween
70,dfranzen70,Don't fear this reaper,8,2 March 2008,"To tell the truth, I expected this update of the 1978 John Carpenter slasher classic to be just over-the-top, mind-boggling gory. Rob Zombie, long known for fronting the heavy metal band White Zombie and having recently jumped into the movie business, seems to be the sort of director who favors viscera over volition; subtlety ain't really in the mix. But I was surprised at Halloween, because it's faithful to the tone and vision of the original without going overboard on blood and guts. You're not grossed out just to be grossed out.The movie takes us from Michael Myers' early childhood in the 1970s, with older sister Judith, stripper-mom Deborah, mean-and-in-a-cast-drunk stepdad Ronnie (William Forsythe), and baby sister Laurie. Michael is pushed around by bullies and lives in a tumultuous household; although his mom loves him dearly, his stepdad hates him and does everything he can to destroy the kid's psyche. On the outside, Michael seems like your typical quiet, reserved ten year old, and the only hint we get that something might be amiss is when he confronts two heinous bullies in the school bathroom, which gets him into some trouble. But even a short time later, as one of the villains is being bludgeoned to death by the mask-clad Michael (it's Halloween, of course), we're still not sure what's going on beneath the boy's cool facade - does he know what he's doing is wrong? Is he even cognizant of his actions? The movie takes its time explaining a bit more of Michael's backstory, attempting to explain - but not fully reveal - how he came to be the unthinking killing machine that we see in later movies. But a word of caution: This is a reboot of the series, so it's possible that things that happened in the original won't happen here, and vice versa; it's as if an alternative timeline were being created. That's good, actually, because it restores the potential to be surprised.The atmosphere of the seventies and early eighties is truthfully realized, I think, complete with a, shall we say, lessened interest in child safety. The movie feels like it belongs in the same universe as 1981's Poltergeist, not to mention the original Halloween. Not always easy to do when you have a huge budget to work with, as Zombie did, because sometimes the added effects overcomplicate scenes instead of returning us to a simpler time. (Yeah, the seventies were simpler! Look, parents let their kids wander up and down the streets alone on Halloween to get candy from strangers!) I enjoyed Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, as he's more restrained than usual and seems more like a clone of Donald Pleasance (who played Loomis in most of the original movies), which is good. And there are plenty of familiar faces in the movie: Brad Dourif plays a sheriff, Clint Howard is a doctor, Sybil Danning is a nurse, Danielle Harris (who has been in three of the films, not as the same character) is one of Laurie's friends, Dee Wallace is Laurie's adoptive mom, and Sid Haig is a gravedigger. Kudos to Zombie for using so many expressive, interesting actors in his film.The movie doesn't completely avoid horror clichés. For one thing, teens who have sex die almost immediately thereafter. And if you're a bad person (bitchy teen, grouchy drunk), you'll die. And perhaps it's not always a good thing to really hope that certain characters die, but in the horror world, it's almost expected. As you watch Halloween, you just know which characters are gonna get it. But then there's a curveball in there: Because this is a reboot, Zombie doesn't telegraph whether or not people are gonna be offed; major characters that made it through the original first movie might not make it through this one. That makes the entire experience fresh and inviting, open to all sorts of possibilities.Overall, Halloween is a very good remake/reboot of a time-tested classic. It doesn't have the gore of, say, a Saw or Hostel, but it does have more blood than the original Halloween, so beware. And there's plenty of nudity and sexual situations and profanity. So yeah, don't let the little ones watch it.***",Halloween
71,dee.reid,"An unhappy ""Halloween""",4,29 October 2009,"The 21st century has not been a good time for horror movies. On top of that, you have one pointless remake after the other of classic horror movies coming out of the woodwork. (When and where will it all end?) ""Halloween"" was one of the first, and worst.As a die-hard fan of John Carpenter's 1978 original, I've spent the last four days watching ""Halloween"" over and over again and finding something new to love about it each time. So with this mind, you can of course expect that I would be skeptical of a remake of a classic horror film. On the surface, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" has some promise. It traces the roots of one of horror's most iconic slashers: Michael Myers. It could be nice to learn for once this mysterious figure's dark and twisted origins. But, intended or unintended, this opens up a lot of doors for Michael Myers that were better off closed.As stated earlier, Zombie's take on a classic chiller is to explore the previously unexplored regions of Michael Myers's history. He devotes at least the first hour of his film to Michael's back-story, before moving into the more familiar territory of his carving up teenagers on Halloween night after escaping from a mental institution, where as a child (Daeg Faerch) he had been receiving treatments after killing his older sister Judith and his abusive stepfather 17 years before, and now Dr. Sam Loomis (poor Malcolm McDowell) is trying to have him locked up for the rest of his life. To be fair, even if you don't buy this elaborate setup, it is nice to see what Myers's childhood COULD have been like, and Zombie is good in exploring the nature of his early life and transformation into the cold-blooded and emotionless killer he was to eventually become.I think Zombie would have been better off doing a straight-forward remake of Carpenter's original, rather than wasting time doing all this back-story stuff. (Additionally, the film combines story-telling elements from both the original ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II."") The biggest problem here is that Michael Myers was way scarier when we DIDN'T know anything about him (he was referred to as ""The Shape"" in the ending credits of the original film). With this avenue, Zombie actually de-mystifies the character, completely destroys everything about him that made him so scary in the first place. Here, he's been reduced to your stereotypical white-trash redneck serial killer from a bad background, he tortured small animals as a kid, and was abused by his mother, sister, and stepfather. What's paramount, is that there is another unintended consequence of exploring Michael's history: sympathy is created for an unsympathetic character, a character who by no means deserves ANY sympathy for the simple fact that he is a cold-blooded mass murderer, a horrific physical manifestation of pure, inhuman evil.Zombie also makes the mistake of making this incarnation of Michael Myers (now played by Tyler Mane) seem almost superhuman, which the original character was not; the original character was simply, evil - pure, unbridled evil. And then we move into the more familiar territory of the original, with teenage babysitters Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris, who previously appeared in two films from the original ""Halloween"" series), and Lynda (Kristina Klebe). Here is where the movie really falls apart. I can honestly say that I did not like either one of them, and that I did not care if they lived or died.The reason here is that they are all unlikeable and stupid, and give into the very genre stereotypes that Carpenter's original gave birth to 29 years earlier. Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis, and P.J. Soles will all be sorely missed for their lively and likable portrayals of lively and likable characters. Taylor-Compton's Laurie Strode seems cruel and selfish - I disliked her the most - whereas even though Curtis's character was chaste and brave in the face of inhuman evil, you cared for her for the simple fact that she was responsible, sweet, and able to fight back against her tormentor. The other two are unlikeable for the same reasons, they talk and act like valley-girl sluts, and of course they obey the typical - albeit timeless - slasher movie rule of ""sex = death."" So, they deserved to die.Lastly there's the gore factor. I haven't seen Zombie's director's cut yet, but one can probably assume that there's even gorier goodies and a higher body count there to make his movie even more unpleasant (although it's hard to imagine that anything could have been cut out, considering what was left in). The original film got by on a minimal budget, with minimal blood and gore. What was implied rather than what was seen was what made the original movie so scary; you used your imagination to fill in the gory gaps. Additionally, Carpenter relied more on the precision of his direction, his use of lighting, shadows, cinematography and camera-work, and the actions and reactions of his cast of characters. In short, he got by on sheer film-making talent, while Zombie's film merely glosses over Carpenter's earlier achievements and is yet another indication of how today's horror movies think that blood & guts can be a substitute for trying to scare your audience.I can say that Rob Zombie was better off going along with the straight-forward remake, rather than an unneeded explanation of a classic horror icon's bloody roots. I honestly have no idea what he was thinking when he decided to make this movie. His choice to remake a horror movie classic seems to go along with the rationale nowadays that today's audiences are totally incapable of thinking for themselves, much less making up their own minds about how a slasher should be made.4/10",Halloween

I not sure how I feel about the back story too Michael Myers, it kinds good thing for the movie not just scene from scene remake other added it took kinda of mystery away from. I did find the back story in trusting to watch and the kills at the start of the movie were very brutal and Nasty, i think it was bit to nasty for Halloween movie. i did enjoy those nasty gory scenes. I did seem find the movie little dull at times, as is tad to long for slasher movie but the ending and yet still ending felt a little rushed. The acting was really good in this movie from everyone, I just did not find Michael Myers scary at all in this movie and i found more brutal, it felt more like he was bit Jason then Michael Myers.I liked this better then Sequel and i did enjoyed this better Halloween 6 and 8. I give this remake 6 out of 10",Halloween
73,JoeB131,Unnecessary remake!,3,30 December 2007,"The problem with remakes is that if something was made wrong the first time, no one cared about it enough to try to remake it. If something was truly good enough to be a ""classic"", then it was just fine on its own and didn't need to be messed with.This is the problem with Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. He tries to deflect from the point by reminding us that John Carpenter remade ""The Thing from another World"" (Putting on background TV TWICE during the film, just so we didn't forget it.) Carpenter, however, took the whole concept in another direction.Zombie does ""Michael Myers, the early years"". The thing that made Myers so horrifying is that he was just a normal kid where something had gone horribly wrong. Zombie decides to give him a full background with a stripper mother, an alcoholic loser father and a slutty sister, so you understand how he becomes the town psycho. It's a lot of unnecessary exposition, and he eats up half the film with it.The Jaime Lee Curtis character is played by someone who has almost no screen presence. You don't care what Michael does to her in the end, which reduces the amount of suspense in his remake of Carpenter's work in the second half.Finally, you have the ever so creepy Malcolm McDowell playing the Donald Pleasence character. His attempts to get through to Michael are so lame you can't believe this guy is even trying to practice psychiatry.The rest is a Zombie gore-fest, not even worth watching.",Halloween
74,meeza,Give me something good to see! This one is it as far as scary movies this year!,8,18 October 2007,"HALLOWEENMike Myers is back! No, not the Austin Powers/Shrek one, or the one who used to pitch for the New York Yankees (never heard of that one, you must say now, but he does exist). I am referring to the creepy ungentle giant who adores hockey (c'mon, it is all over his face) and definitely is the poster boy for ""anger management gone wild"". Director Rob Zombie has revitalized Michael Myers in a new film version of the classic horror flick ""Halloween"". And after seeing its tricks and treats, I must concur that it is more of a treat than a trick. This guilty pleasure flick does include several suspenseful scenes that gave me the willies, as in the original. Zombie did adequately present Myers as the walking zombie who wrecks havoc in the world of suburbia. Zombie also showcased Myers' childhood, which presented the origins of Myers' maniac behavior. Yes, Myers favorite song as child was Michael Sembello's Flashdance classic ""Maniac"". Kid Myers uncompromising behavior displayed some innovative fatal ways to deal with bullies which McGruff the Crime Dog would not be too proud of. Scout Taylor-Compton stars as Laurie Strode, the modern version of the Jamie Lee Curtis scream queen. Strode is the main prey Myers is after, but not to have his way with her but instead to protect her because poor Laurie happens to be Myers' sister; talk about ""Oh Brother!"" However, Michael will destroy anything or anyone that is an obstruction to stop him from being ""Big Brother of the Year"". Legendary actor Malcolm McDowell also stars as Dr. Samuel Loomis, the child psychiatrist who tries every therapeutic plan in the ""How to Save a Lost Mind"" handbook in treating Myers as a child. When Myers escapes from his cell as an adult, Loomis reaches for the ""How to Capture a Lost Mind"" handbook in order to save Laurie and her gullible peeps. Sherri Moon Zombie co-stars as Deborah Myers, Mike's grieving mom who also finds no resolute answers in her handbook ""How to Parent a Lost Mind"". I must say that Mrs. Zombie could ""moon"" me anytime! What a body! Sorry, Rob! Please do not get all zombie on me. Anyway, ""Halloween"" slashes away its competition to be helmed as the best scary movie of the year. **** Good",Halloween
75,MBunge,Rob Zombie has incredibly made a film that doesn't stink on ice,5,3 September 2010,"This film is about a billion times better than Rob Zombie's other movies, House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. Of course, all that it means is it's passably watchable instead of being a godless waste pit of cinematic excrement.A remake of John Carpenter's horror classic, Zombie does find something legitimately different to do with the story. He spends the entire first half of the film focusing on Michael Myers. We see pudgy little Michael (the unfortunately named Daeg Faerch), his white trash stripper mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), her jackass live-in boyfriend (William Forsythe) and Michael's skanky sister (Hanna Hall). We see Michael's first acts of violence, leading to the slaughter of his family. We see Michael in the insane asylum, being treated by Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). And eventually, we see him break out of the asylum and head back to Haddonfield, Illinois for another killing spree on October 31st.Revealing the ""secret origin"" of Michael Myers was not a bad idea. John Carpenter made the character unknown and unknowable and that mystery extended to Dr. Loomis. Filling in those blanks could have made for a very interesting story. Unfortunately, Zombie has nothing interesting to say about Michael Myers. He has no explanation for who he is or why he does what he does. So, the result of the first hour of the film is to put Michael Myers on display until you're so familiar with him that he's less creepy, less disturbing and less compelling. The film makes allusions to Dr. Loomis exploiting Michael for Loomis' own benefit, but that goes nowhere in the second half of the movie.That second half is essentially just the original Halloween with everything sped up. It's all reasonably well done but you can't ever be scared or anxious or excited for more than a few seconds before the movie is done with one scene and off to something else. Zombie does try and establish Michael's future victims as real people, but they're almost all really annoying people and they have to show off their personalities so quickly it's like they're all hopped up on meth or something.The most effective moments in the remake of Halloween are when Zombie's over-the-top brutality is retrained by the more suspenseful essence of Carpenter's story. It gives structure and meaning to the acts of violence so they're not the equivalent of Daffy Duck getting his bill blown to the back of his head by Elmer Fudd's shotgun.The first half of this movie is too slow and never amounts to anything. The second half is too fast to be more than marginally effective as a horror story. Taking all in all, however, this is not a terrible film. I know that seems like faint praise, but when you consider how awesomely putrid Zombie's other movies arenot being terrible is an amazing accomplishment. The remake of Halloween is occasionally shocking, somewhat scary and has a decent amount of naked female flesh. It's nowhere near as good as the original or even the first sequel. It's probably not that much worse than anything from Halloween III on, though, so let that be your guide in deciding if you should watch this movie.",Halloween
76,estebangonzalez10,Halloween is more of a prequel than a remake (& horror prequels always suck)!,4,1 September 2008,"This remake of John Carpenters 1978 classic Halloween is much inferior and lacked a lot of the fear that the original film had inspired. The problem with this movie is that Rob Zombie made this more of a prequel then it was a remake. So this version of Halloween, sins in the same way The Texas Chainsaw massacre The Beginning or Hannibal Rising do. The problem is that by presenting the past of these famous villains the intrigue of who they are and the mystery is vanished. Micheal Myers is just the latest victim as Leatherhead or Hannibal Lecter were in those films. By presenting us their story and background all the mystery and suspense is gone, as is the darkness of the characters. The film goes from the unknown (which is what is supposed to make these films frightening) to trying to explain to the audience why the villains became evil and by doing so the mystery is gone. There was an interesting dialogue between the doctor and Micheal that may perhaps help me explain my point. Micheal tells the doctor that his favorite color is black and the doc tells him that actually black is the absence of color so therefore black is not really a color. In the same way in the original Halloween Micheal Myers is that absence of color. We do not know much about his past or understand the reasons why he kills his family. He is an unknown and feared character. But in this version Rob Zombie gives us his background, the reasons he becomes evil, he humanizes Micheal, he gives us color where there should not be any. Films in this genre work much better when these villains are unknown and cannot be reasoned with because if not all that is left is a movie in which we do not care for the victims, which only has gore to offer but no scares, and which has confused the purpose of a horror film which should be that of scaring the audience and not just trying to gross them out. The concept has become transversed and that is why this film doesn't work just like most movies in this genre have these days.",Halloween
77,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Rob Zombie triumphs with a killer good reimagining, very underrated",9,21 November 2015,"Let me get this clear right off the bat: I'm a huge, huge fan of Rob Zombie's Halloween reimagining. Love it. At the time it was announced I was super fanatical about the original franchise, and when I heard that Zombie, who's films I was a huge fan of at the time, was remaking my favourite horror film of all time, I had a conniption. Then casting news began to pour in and when I saw at least eight names on the lineup who are all time favourites of mine, I was immediately, unconditionally sold. Good thing the guy didn't let me down. He went his own way with this one, while at the same time still staying true to its mystical roots in Carpenter's minimalist catalyst masterpiece. Yes, Zombie has has a certain pervasive flair for really crude dialogue and characters that would make both the Addams family and he Beverly hillbillys cringe, but that's his style, and love it or hate it he's brought it to Haddonfield and then some. He mostly stays true to the blueprint of the original film, yet adds a fascinating for five minute opening act that greatly expands on Michael's early years, both his tumultuous home life and subsequent years in Smiths Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Loomis. Malcolm McDowell makes a stellar replacement for Donald Pleasence, updating Loomis by bringing humour, hurt and humanity to a role previously rooted in archetypal theatricality. Newcomer Scout Taylor Compton carries herself well as Laurie Strode, and Danielle Harris, who played Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4 and 5, plays ill fated Annie Brackett. Rob Zombie has a knack for finding underrated character actors who don't always get the chance to show their stuff outside of the genre niches and blasts them to the forefront of the drama in career best roles. Such is the case with Brad Dourif here, a criminally underrated dude who plays kind hearted Sheriff Leigh Brackett. He's got a down to earth jive (Thanks to Zombie's writing once again) that liven up the film a lot. There's an unbelievably cool roster of talent including Danny Trejo, Udo Kier, Adrienne Barbeau, Dee Wallace, Tom Towles, Bill Moseley, Daniel Roebuck, Pat Skipper, Richard Lynch, Clint Howard, Sybil Danning, Leslie Easterbrook, Ken Foree, Sheri Moon Zombie in a surprising sympathetic turn as Michael's poor mother, and William Forsythe in an absolutely hysterical cameo as his extremely verbally abusive, endlessly vulgar stepfather. That cast though. Still in awe eight years later. People railed against this remake for being crass, bloody and brutal. Pish. Zombie boldly steered the franchise into uncharted territory and actually made an effort, which is more than I can say for any other horror remake I've seen. Supremely stylish, down to earth, casted so well I can't even right now, and tough as nails in the fright department.",Halloween
78,drownnnsoda,"Decent As A Remake, But Quite Good In Terms Of Slasher Movies.",7,31 August 2007,"""Halloween"" focuses on Michael Myers, a young boy who lives in a dysfunctional, abusive household. His mother is a stripper, his stepfather a mean drunk, and his older sister a promiscuous teenager On Halloween night, the violent Michael slaughters his entire family while his mom is at work, but sparing his mother's newborn baby. Fifteen years later, after years of therapy with Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), Michael's violence and rage has gotten stronger. On Halloween, he breaks out of the sanitarium, and goes in search of his baby sister, a now-teenage girl named Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton), and anyone who gets in his way is in mortal danger.The original ""Halloween"" - John Carpenter's 1978 classic. Who would dare remake it? I don't think many would even want to attempt. I have to give a little credit to Rob Zombie for just attempting to remake this film, because it's obvious from the start that die-hard fans of the original won't be happy. And plus, can you really do anything to improve the original ""Halloween?. Not much, really. Personally, I don't mind remakes. They are often unnecessary, but I still like to see what the filmmakers have done with the story and I continue to watch them. And, above all things, I can say that this isn't too bad, compared to some of the really poor remakes that have been done in the past. This is one of the better that I have seen.Rob Zombie essentially has taken the original story and built an entire first-act that elaborates on the Michael Myers character, his life, and what has driven him to do what he does. It then continues in a similar fashion to where the original movie began it's story, with Laurie Strode. The ""back-story of the villain"" thing is a trend in remakes, and these remakes often give a lengthy history of our killer, while the original film hardly touched on it. I usually find it scarier when we don't entirely know the killer's motives, but I can say that Michael's back story was handled fairly well. We get a look into his abusive and horrible childhood. I felt bad for the kid, even though he committed unspeakable acts of violence. The classic scene where he murders his sister in the original is done in a different (and brutal) manner this time, and Michael ends up slaughtering almost all of his family along with her. The rest of the story focuses on Laurie and her friends, which also differs from the original.I surprisingly enjoyed the first act that explained Michael's life as a child, and thought it was done well, but a bit lengthy. Then again, this is a different film from the original and I understand that Zombie wanted this to be a big part of it, and I suppose I enjoyed the creativity and the handling of it - it was something different. The last half of the movie was also interesting, and I was really engaged and anxious to see where the film was going to go. This version is very action-filled, but it was well-handled & memorable, and there were some great little bits thrown in that only those who have seen the original would be able to connect with. Quite a few scenes pay homage to Carpenter's film, and it was nice to know that Zombie wanted to include those to assure the fans of the original that he knows the story well. Cinematography was nice, and I was pleased that the original ""Halloween"" score was used throughout.Now, I do have some gripes with the film. While Michael's back story is fairly interesting stuff, it seems to take up too much of the movie. It's pretty lengthy, and it felt like by the time Laurie had been introduced, there wasn't enough time to develop her and her friends before the onslaught begins. The girls are developed well enough, but I felt there could have been more done because they begin to die quickly. The back story's length also interfered with suspense-build, and there wasn't nearly as much as in the 1978 film (which was mostly about suspense and atmosphere), which is vital to a good horror flick. The gore is also extreme and unnecessarily graphic at times, but then again, this is Rob Zombie.The cast was good. Daeg Faerch is creepy as young Michael, and Sheri Moon-Zombie (Rob's wife) is really strong. Also well-cast was Hanna Hall as his promiscuous, ill-fated sister. Malcolm McDowell was brilliantly cast as Loomis, and he fills Donald Pleasance's shoes respectably. Scout-Taylor Compton plays Laurie well, even though her personality differs from the original. She's cute and likable, and she can act. Danielle Harris, of ""Halloween"" 4 & 5 was good as Annie. The rest of the large cast was good as well - overall the acting here was solid. As for the film's final act and the ending - it's different, but it was really intense and not quite what I was initially expecting.Overall, Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" is worth seeing for fans of horror films and of the original alike. It has enough in common with it's counterpart to keep the die-hard fans of the original movie pleased, but there are enough differences to keep a fresh and modern spin on the story for a new audience. My biggest problem with it was that the back story of Myers interfered a little with the present-day events with Laurie, but all things considered, I enjoyed this movie. As a remake of a genre classic, it's decent enough, and better than most remakes. But if you look at it just in terms of slasher movies, it's really quite good. I still enjoy Carpenter's version more (as many likely do), but I thought this was an interesting take on the original story. 7/10.",Halloween

I think this movies main problem is that it just doesn't give enough effort, The dialogue is pretty lackluster and to be honest, the actors just don't seem like they're trying to all. I was very disappointed with Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, his performance was very cheesy and almost laughable. Actually you could use those words to describe just about every single performance by every actor in this movie. There are a few different things about this movie compared to the original. It adds a little bit more into Michael's background. The beginning of the movie shows the horrible murders that Michael committed as a child and his being institutionalized. I did like seeing into Michael's background, but right after that the movie really is just dull, cheesy, and 100% run of the mill/predictable. I give Halloween (2007) a 5/10. Honestly this horror movie is not worth your time, and if you think for a second Rob Zombie leaves anything to the imagination then think again. Buckets of blood in every killing and a good bit of sex with a lot of female nudity. Just letting you know in case that kind of thing bothers you.",Halloween

Now Michael stalks her and her two friends Annie (Danielle Harris) and Lynda (Kristina Klebe) on Halloween Night.Written and Directed by Rob Zombie (House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects) made an effective prequel/remake to the excellent Classic ""John Carpenter's Halloween"". The first act are the strongest moments in the film, where he get to know Michael much more and what makes him an unstable person. Faerch plays the young Michael Myers extremely well, Moon Zombie gives an sympathetic performance as the caring mother and the adult Micheal Myers played by Mane gives an menacing performance. Zombie's has strong leads here with an terrific B-Movie supporting cast. McDowell and Taylor-Compton gives different competent performances from the original. Zombie's third film offers some genuine scares, a few good scenes here and there with some dark humour. Zombie's manages to give tribute to the original ""Halloween"" film with some in-jokes here. Bit parts by Danny Trejo and Ken Foree make their small roles memorable as well.But of course, there's some problems with Zombie's screenplay. Some of his characters are strong in the film but i would love to see more of the characters of Annie, Lynda, Tommy Doyle (Skyler Gisondo) and Lindsey Wallace (Jenny Gregg Stewart). Which these characters were so memorable in the original. Which it was written by John Carpenter and the late Debra Hill. I felt that some scenes were cut and lacked character development as well but i felt the ending is great (Which is completely different from the original). I noticed in the poster that Andrienne Barbeau (Which is Carpenter's ex-wife) seems to be in it but her character got cut from the theatrical release. Which Zombie made some changes after his work-print cut got into the internet.There's two different DVD Versions of the picture. Which both versions are two-disc sets. One is the R-Rated theatrical version and the other is the Unrated Director's Cut. Perphas the difference of the two cuts of the movie. That some scenes were changed for the R-Rated version (For example, when Michael Espace from the institution from the four police guards. It's completely different scene in the Director's Cut.) Some characters from the original theatrical release are not in the Director's Cut. Director's Cut seems to be a different version altogether. DVD from the R-Rated version. Disc one has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an fascinating commentary track from the director. Disc 2 has Deleted Scenes (Which some are quite good) with optional commentary by filmmaker, Alternate Ending with optional commentary, bloopers (Which McDowell and some cast members seems to be having a great time making this movie), featurettes and more. DVD from the unrated Director's Cut is actually an improvement over the R-Rated theatrical release. There's more character development in this version, especially with Dr. Loomis and the young Michael Myers in the first half. There's more scenes with Laurie's family and a few more babysitting scenes as well in the second half. Some of the actors, who had bit-parts (Who were seen very briefly) from the original theatrical version does pay-off in this version. I think, it would have been cool for the DVD Version. If it had the original theatrical version and the unrated director's cut both on the same disc. Which some die-hard fans of Rob Zombie's version will probably buy both versions on DVD. Although the DVD Extras are quite the same, expect for different cuts on both films on separate editions.The Blu-Ray version includes all the bonus features from the Unrated Director's Cut. The new feature on the Blu-Ray is the 260 minutes documentary of the making of this remake.Still, i feel that ""Halloween"" is surprisingly good remake. At least Rob Zombie tried to do something different with this one. Which he succeeds most of the time. This has good cinematography by Phil Parmet, an fine music score by Tyler Bates (See No Evil, Slither, 300), good production designs by Anthony Tremblay (Army of Darkness, Return of the Living Dead 3) and of course, Carpenter's memorable music theme from the original is used as well in some key scenes. Moustapha Akkad (Who produced every previous ""Halloween"" movie) died before this film got made. His son Malek Akkad is one of the three producers of this film. Zombie is also one of the producers. Don't miss your chance to miss, this re-imagined movie at the big screen. Super 35. (*** ½/*****) for the R-Rated Cut. (****/*****) for the Unrated Director's Cut.",Halloween
82,JoeKarlosi,Halloween (2007) *1/2,4,3 September 2007,"I don't know which is harder for me to conceive -- that there is now this needless remake of the classic HALLOWEEN in existence, or that I actually went to the theater to see it. Just to give an idea of where my head was while going in, I am generally against these pointless modernized remakes of past films that are already well established as ""good movies"", although sometimes (if rarely) I have been pleasantly surprised. While I acknowledge John Carpenter's classic original as a good and important horror film, I never thought it was ""excellent"", and that was partly why I didn't mind checking out Rob Zombie's variation. I also gave Zombie the benefit of the doubt because I was completely knocked out by his film THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, which I thought nailed the feel of '70s exploitation schlockfests. But this new HALLOWEEN just may be the definitive example of when an unnecessary remake has no real artistic reason for being made, save for the obvious almighty dollar and box office appeal. The best thing about having seen it was that I have been running Carpenter's classic over in my mind, and it now fares stronger than ever in comparison.HALLOWEEN 2007 can be summarized as two halves: the first tries to cover all-new territory by showing us the dysfunctional family life of adolescent Michael Myers, and how he deteriorates into becoming a deranged killer; he's got a stripper for a mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) and an abusive bum for a father figure. The kid is routinely teased in school and takes his aggressions out on small animals before graduating to people. Later on, we advance 15 or so years to when Myers is in his 20s and escapes from his mental hospital and heads back to his hometown for more carnage, with his personal psychiatrist in hot pursuit. For starters, this could have been a stalk and slash flick about any screwed up child with a harsh past who goes wrong, and he need not be Michael Myers. The continuous cursing and ""F bombs"" went way overboard, and the script was not well written. I didn't care for all the misplaced rock music throughout the movie, though one fine exception was when the chilling ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" was placed into the mayhem (the same song worked in the original too, and is rather ""Halloween Friendly""). But it was a sin to have the patented ""Halloween Theme"" (plus other standard cues) and ""Mr. Sandman"" strewn about, as if to remind us that this was supposed to be like the other movies.The first half where we follow Michael's predictable path to becoming a full-fledged madman is the more interesting one, and at least Zombie attempted to try something different; yet at the same time, with so much back story of Michael's upbringing and the various clues as to why he became a demented slasher, doesn't that give us too much information and take away the mystery we've come to associate with this ""Boogeyman""? Are we to actually sympathize with this Michael Myers? The second half just felt like the director had to go through the obligatory motions by featuring duplicate scenes straight out of the first HALLOWEEN, and even dropping familiar dialogue and key names here and there like ""Ben Tramer"", just because it's what fans of the original may remember. None of these ""homages"" were directed with 1/10th the flair which Carpenter demonstrated, and the characters were also not nearly as well defined, unsurprisingly. Babysitter Laurie Strode and her two girlfriends are just stuck into the proceedings because it's a HALLOWEEN remake. One of these ""teens"" is now played by former child actress Danielle Harris, who was previously featured in Halloween's 4 and 5 as Michael Myers' niece Jamie. Malcolm McDowell is no substitute for the obsessive Donald Pleasence as the obligatory Dr. Loomis, but it's not so much the fault of the actor as it is the weak writing and having to follow in the footsteps of an already established and patented characterization.I hated all the cute cameos too. They're distracting as we play the game ""who can we spot next?"". Brad Dourif enjoys quality time as the sheriff, but Udo Kier has one dumb line and would have been missed if you blinked. Hey, look - there's Ken Foree of DAWN OF THE DEAD! And Clint Howard and Sid Haig -- but both with hair! Umm, isn't that old lady who's playing Laurie's mom Dee Wallace?? Hey, Hey, it's Mickey Dolenz of The Monkees playing a redneck gun salesman! I can see that near the climax of this thing, Zombie tried to take over the reins himself once again and get off the track of repeating the original film to end it as his own baby. But none of that worked at all, and it was a fatal case of me just getting bored and wanting the whole thing to finish up so I could leave. Too much blood and gore, too much prolonged nonsense, and a final scene before the credits which really was a lousy way to wrap up the whole picture. Just a terrible and empty conclusion. There is said to be a longer ""work print"" with a different ending which could possibly show up on a DVD one day, but I won't be bothering. In an attempt to try and find something positive to say, I thought there were some good kill scenes now and then, and the boy playing young Myers was pretty good. The large actor who takes over as a hulking adult version of the boy was truly imposing, and his famous ""Shape Mask"" was probably the best-looking since the first film. But so what? What's it all for? At least Carpenter's classic gains even more respect as a result, as this is just not needed. *1/2 out of ****",Halloween

I thought the little boy was great, and scary as heck,, i know i wouldn't wanna run into him in a dark alley,,, he came from a messed up family,, drunk step-dad,, stripper for a mom,, a big sister, who wouldn't even take him trick or treating,, no she'd rather do it with her boyfriend,, he get 's picked on at school, by the bullies, because of his stripper mom,, played by Rob Zombie's wife,, Sherrie Moon Zombie,, who is very sexy in this movie. This movie doesn't concentrate on Laurie ,, which i'm glad,,Dr. Loomis role is played by Malcolm Mcdowell,, w ho did a very good job,, although he is by no means a Donald Pleascence.. i loved this movie very much,, and really can't find anything wrong with it... cheers to Rob Zombie on this one.",Halloween
84,fertilecelluloid,Tricked out of $10 bucks for zero treat,1,1 September 2007,"Clearly, Rob Zombie has no grasp of what made the original ""Halloween"" so effective, so he ""re-imagines"" it with his white trash aesthetic. It still doesn't work. Zombie's ""Halloween"" is a boring abortion of a movie that has a decent first half hour that depicts the abusive nature of Michael Myers' upbringing. That was never the point of the original, of course, because THAT Michael Myers was spawned in middle class, suburban smugness. Still, I was willing to go with Zombie's mythology if he could make it convincing. He can't. The film is predictable, illogical and insufferable. The last hour is a dull carbon copy of everything that happened in the original without the suspense or subtext. I wanted this movie to end so badly. The film's slaughter scenes are vapid, Zombie's dialog is idiotic, and The Shape possesses no mystery. Zombie can not write real people; he can only write trash talk and abuse. Since ""Halloween"" requires that there be real people in its storyline, the film is a colossal failure in all departments. Zombie's version of Laurie Strode, the role originally played by Jamie Lee Curtis, is an annoying, squealing cut-out. Malcolm Mcdowell's Dr. Loomis is an embarrassment. Lots of horror movie veterans make an appearance, but who the f__k cares? I'm really sick of horror directors thinking it's cool to fill their films with actors from past classics. It merely reminds us of how great things used to be before hack directors like Zombie were canonized as horror genre gods. I liked ""The Devil's Rejects"" very much and hated ""House of 1000 Corpses"", so my feelings about Zombie are mixed. This ""Halloween"" is far worse than ""Corpses"" and not equal to one minute of ""Rejects"". It's simply a rotten misfire that isn't shocking, exciting, involving or ""cutting edge"". It makes the ""Texas Chainsaw"" remakes look like spun, celluloid gold. This film may have rung the death knell of the current horror boom. Thanks, Rob.",Halloween
85,TOMNEL,"Zombie's Halloween has no chills or thrills, not much content, just gore and profanity.",4,8 September 2007,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy gory films and strong language works well in a lot of films...but this wasn't one of them. John Carpenter's Halloween is a true horror classic, where this is....well I don't know quite what this was. It's called simply ""Halloween"" meaning that it's a remake. The remake of the original didn't even come into play until the last half of the film, and it really wasn't true to it at all. The flashback to Michael's past in the first half of the film wasn't any good or compelling material at all. Especially this half was simply lots of really horrible profanity and gory deaths, which may appeal to the horror fans now, but I prefer actual scares. The characters are also molded in Zombie's image to all be jerks, including the protagonist Laurie. The only really interesting aspect of Myer's childhood was his therapy with Loomis (Malcom McDowall) in the asylum. As for the scares, it's amazing that a film nearly 30 years old can generate more scares than a new film with cleaner photography. Rob Zombie obviously has his style in making films, and if people continue supporting him, than good for him, but I'd prefer that he didn't remake anymore horror classics, because he's just ruining them. Let's just pray we don't see Rob Zombie's Friday the 13th coming soon.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 105 mins. Rated R for language, strong violence, sexuality and nudity.",Halloween
86,Jonny_Numb,The Night Horror Came Home,7,31 August 2007,"It is not without good cause that horror fans have been recoiling at the several-year-strong spate of remakes that have infiltrated multiplexes. With a coat of studio polish, a ""current"" cast, and little innovation, very rarely does a redux challenge (let alone transcend) the parameters of its parent. In most cases (last year's ""Omen"" comes immediately to mind), there is little to justify a remake's existence outside of curiosity. That being said, the ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) and ""Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) remakes, based on respected '70s horror films, became unique entities in the hands of confident, creative writers and directors. Rob Zombie's revamping of John Carpenter's iconic slasher, Michael Myers, can now be added to the minimally-populated vanguard of worthy remakes.I won't mince words: I have never been a ""Halloween"" purist. I've watched it many times over the years, and while I think it is a generally well-made film, it is far from the masterpiece many hail it as. Did it have an influence on the path mainstream horror subsequently took? Sure, I'll give it that. But in all honesty, I think the ""Friday the 13th"" series (a rip-off in itself) did better, replacing exposition with gore. ""Halloween"" is good, but I have always ached for it to be more than Carpenter's cold work-for-hire.Zombie's ""Halloween"" is all but condemned to a low rating on the TomatoMeter from the legion of critics who hold Carpenter's 1978 art-slasher on a pedestal, and his no-holds-barred approach is bound to divide audiences, as well. Remakeseven those that succeedstraddle a quizzical postmodern line: whether they slavishly reproduce the original or expand on the already-established story, they are condemned. (And on this page, I can foresee an outbreak of one-star reviews, each one more anal about comparing the two films than the last.) The one major complaint I have about Zombie's ""Halloween"" is that, as busy as its story is, it left me wanting more. Even at 109 minutes, the film could have expanded some of its plot threads and strengthened some of its characterization into a more satisfying whole. On the other hand, this IS an intense experience that leaves one drained by the end, so I'm guessing the cuts were made out of consideration to the pummeled audience. And Zombie should be credited for having a surplus rather than shortage of ideas (though I wouldn't mind seeing an extended director's cut in the future).For my tastes, Zombie's decision to flesh out Michael Myers' backstory is a welcome change of pace from the standard-issue stalk and slash that sent the franchise into oblivion. Going the true-crime route, Myers (played as a child by the convincingly creepy Daeg Faerch) is presented as an animal-killing, blank-faced psychopath with a childhood dominated by a vulgar patriarch (William Forsythe""The Devil's Rejects""), bullying classmates (which leads to the film's first truly shocking scene), and a retreat to neuroses behind the guise of a clown mask (I quite liked the personality gradations between ""masked"" and ""unmasked"" Michael). After murdering 3 people on Halloween night (the film leaves the years ambiguous), young Michael is sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he is analyzed for 15 years by Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), who subsequently abandons the now-unresponsive adult (played by hulking Tyler Mane). When Myers escapes in transit, he heads to his old stomping grounds to raise hell on the idyllic suburban landscape (it is here where the film really kicks into a remake of Carpenter's film, wisely jettisoning the talkier segments and adding a more logical, satisfying motive for the killer).The lead actors are excellent. I was truly surprised at Sheri Moon's convincing turn as the tragic Deborah Myers, a total 180 from her Baby Firefly persona; McDowell's seasoned experience sparks the film every time he's on-screen; Faerch and Mane foment evil in different ways, but each has an indisputably strong screen presence (though I would argue that adult Michael is a bit overexposed here); the girls that unwittingly fall under the knife this time out are introduced hastily, but shaded in nicely with some character-defining bits of dialog (and for those interested, Danielle Harris and Kristina Klebeas Annie and Lynda, respectivelybear all for their art); even Tommy Doyle and Lindsey Wallace are turned into smarter, more assertive characters. But the final third of the film belongs to the immensely likable Taylor-Compton's Laurie, the virginal babysitter who never loses her survival instinct. (Smaller roles are filled by a fun catalog of character actors from the '70s & '80s, including Udo Kier, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, and Richard Lynch, among many others.)Zombie's film-making prowess has improved dramatically since the wretched ""House of 1,000 Corpses,"" and ""Halloween"" is his most controlled work to dategone are the obnoxious camera flourishes and cartoony characters, replaced instead by a tone that, while crude, carries an emotional charge. While some of the characterizations feel truncated by time constraints, the scenes with Moon, Faerch, and McDowell are as disturbing as the subsequent violence; and a basement scene between Laurie and Michael is both chest-tightening and strangely moving because of what is imparted.Zombie has cranked the relatively minimalist violence of Carpenter's film to an astonishing level""Planet Terror"" may have shed more blood overall, but ""Halloween"" is bereft of an ironic, winking subtext, and plays the violence straightthe result is bone-chilling and unsettling. Here, murder is presented not with sadistic titillation, but the unglamorous finality it carries in reality. Even the semi-obnoxious audience I watched this with fell dead silent during many of the more intense scenes.While purists will try their hardest to make sure Zombie's ""Halloween"" is forgotten as quickly as possible, those with more open mindswho are tired of torture porn but seek something as substantially violent, with a story to back it upshould give it a look. This is a brand new entity that makes the Eve of All Hallows scary and menacing all over again.",Halloween
87,aidanratesmovies,Just because Zombie 'made it his own' does not mean its any good,1,14 July 2021,"Oh dear lord, why does this film exist? Besides being again the epitome of white trash, Zombie again provides a horror flick with every single cliche in the book- and none of the charisma to make up for it. The handful of things I liked about the film are mainly just tied to the original in one form or another. I feel there are a lot of interesting concepts and ideas here, but none of them are properly executed or go anywhere worthwhile. The film itself looks okay, but its cinematography is quite annoying, shaking the camera to dizzying levels at times. The film is endlessly frustrating between Zombie's horrendous sex obsessed writing, his forced goriness, and the acting...oh my god the acting. I didn't know this until after watching the film, but somehow they passed up Emma Stone for Scout Taylor-Compton. Yes, you read that write, Oscar winning actress Emma Stone- what were they possibly thinking? Was she not dumb looking enough for Zombie's juvenile writing? Needless to say she is horrible in the role throughout, and honestly so is just about everyone else. It has its entertaining moments, but it's too tedious and mind bogglingly bad to find any true enjoyment out of it. In the end, Halloween is one of the worst remakes i've ever seen- horror and not. It takes the mystery and atmosphere out of Carpenter's creation and squanders every morsel of it until its destroyed completely. It's a horrendous waste of time, and I urge anyone with a brain to stay away from it at all costs.My Rating: 1/10.",Halloween
88,a_chinn,Rob Zombie's divisive reimagining deserves it's due,8,5 November 2018,"Rob Zombie's reboot of a horror classic was wildly divisive for horror fans, but I fall on the side of the film's defenders. Zombie's reboot is really two separate films. The first half is an unsettling masterpiece of horror, where Zombie imagines the formative years of a young Michael Myers, which were never shown and barely discussed in the original films. Daeg Faerch plays the 10-year old Michael Myers, and presents as completely soulless and lacking any empathy, killing small animals and the victim of bullies, abusive stepfathers, and lacking any parenting from his stripper mother, Sheri Moon Zombie, in a surprisingly moving and empathetic role (likely her best performance). Faerch's 10-year old Myers very much reminded me of Joshua John Miller's disturbing performance in ""The River's Edge"" as the needlessly cruel character lacking in any moral compass. Zombie's version of the young Michel Myers is not just a single scene of Myers' murder of his sister and boyfriend, as was the case in the original film, but is a depiction of the build-up to that disturbing murder scene. Zombie then invests a significant amount of screen time following young Myers' time institutionalized and his many counseling session with Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), which document Myers slow downwardly spiraling mental state and his withdrawing into himself to become the eventual ""Shape"" that horror fans are so familiar. The second half of the film picks up 15 years later with an adult Myers (Tyler Mane) escaping from the mental institution to return home to Haddonfield, IL, where he terrorized hapless babysitters Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends (Danielle Harris and Kristina Klebe). Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" reminds me of ""Full Metal Jacket"" in that the first half of the film is so strong, that the second half pales in comparison. It's not that the second half of the film is bad. In fact, the second half of both ""Halloween"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" are quite good, but the first half of both of these films are so good that the rest of the film feels like a disappointment. Zombie delivers the slasher film goods when it comes to suspense, scares, and gory violence once Myers goes on his bloody rampage that horror fans expect, succeeding in making Michael Myers scary again. This second half of the film also feels a bit awkward because there are moments that feel like pure Rob Zombie, but there are other moments where it feel like he's trying to slavishly stay true to the original. Those homage moments to the original film are fun and effective, but when Zombie allows himself to do something original, as he did with the first half of the film, that's when this reboot really shines. As with his prior films, Zombie populates his film with a cast of colorful character actors including Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Sybil Danning, Dee Wallace, Danny Trejo, Richard Lynch, Udo Kier, Clint Howard, Lew Temple, Tom Towles, Bill Mosley, Leslie Eatbook, Ken Foree, Micky Dolenz, Daniel Roebuck, Sig Haig, and probably others I missed, which is always a treat for fans of grindhouse cinema. I'd read somewhere that Zombie had originally wanted this film to primarily focus on young Myers and the second film would be the grown Myers. That film might have been a horror masterpiece, and although the second half is still solid horror entertainment, it's not a masterpiece. It's merely a grizzly well executed slasher film. Overall, Rob Zombie's reboot of ""Halloween"" is solid filmmaking and should be appreciated as a smart reimagining of a horror classic.",Halloween
89,Movie-ManDan,Actually Pretty Bad.,2,29 October 2014,"If I had to rank all Halloween movies, the 1978 version would be at the top. This one would not be near it. It gained a lot of flack for various reasons, one being that people don't like Rob Zombie's style. I'll admit that I liked Zombie's first two original movies, but not this at all.The way that it is explained in the original is different and should have been shown instead. In the original, Michael is just simply evil with no motive and no explanation. That makes everything scarier. In this, Zombie took a more believable approach by having Michael grow up in a trashy family and get picked on in school. I thought, as everybody did, that Michael growing up in a vulgar trailer-trash family in suburbia-Chicago was unnecessary. On the upside, it was well-done. Shock was added, sympathy was drawn and Michael developed better than in any of the other movies. This may have been the first Halloween where Michael was developed, so it is an obvious win. Either way, the kid that played Michael did a great job. Years later, he breaks out of the mental institution and goes after his sister, Laurie Strode. It is awesome the way he breaks out of the institution. The way Zombie made him is cool too: a seven-foot, long-haired, unseen faced monster. The unrated addition includes a graphic rape scene before he escapes that was very random. Why would Zombie want to include that? Anyway, Michael gets his signature outfit and goes in his killing spree. That is when it falls apart. His main target is his little sister, Laurie Strode (Compton). Compton sucks as Laurie, her friends suck and the kids suck too. Malcom McDowell who plays Dr. Loomis even sucked. There is no suspense or plot development at all after Michael's escape. On the upside, there is a high body count and well-done death scenes. So even though there is a lack of suspense, the extreme brutality makes up for the terror and extreme danger. People say that the first half with Michael's origin is better than the second half which I will agree on. But the second half is inferior.1/4",Halloween
90,ctomvelu1,Why?,5,1 November 2011,"Slick but unnecessary and ultimately unimpressive remake of the 1978 classic. The director spends way too much time focused on the young Michael, as if we are watching a documentary on the making of a serial killer (miserable childhood, poor impulse control, etc.). And his sense of staging is off. For instance, compare the scene involving the girls' first encounter with Michael to the original. The 1978 version keeps us on edge while in the remake, the scene falls flat.Zombie also botches the ending, which is extremely unfortunate. I will say Tyler Mane makes a decent looking adult Michael, but he is simply not scary. And the gal playing Laurie Strode is shrill and can't hold a candle to Jamie Curtis's Laurie. Malcolm MacDowell as Sam Loomis only makes me yearn for the late, great Donald Pleasance, who so memorably played Loomis in several previous HALLOWEEN flicks. Some familiar B-movie faces show up in various roles, including Brad ""Child's Play"" Dourif as the sheriff and Danielle Harris, who starred in two previous ""Halloween"" flicks, as Annie. None of this helps. You will do better to stick with the original.",Halloween
91,Matt_Layden,"""Not As Good As Original, But Still Better Then The Rest""",7,30 August 2007,"A remake of the Carpenter classic ""Halloween"". Michael is sent to an insane asylum after killing his family. He escapes and kills people. That's about it.In 1978 John Carpenter released a film that went on to become a cult classic. Not only is it regarded as one of the best slashers films of all time, but one of the best horror films of all time. Anyone who thought that Rob Zombie was going to up the original is off their nut, but Zombie does manage to make this remake one of the better installments in the Halloween series. Although that is not saying much about this film, but more about the others. Halloween doesn't come close to being as good as the original, but it is one of the better horror remakes that we've seen done to death.Zombie is a member of the ""splat pack"". A term used to describe a group of directors who use graphic violence and gore in their films. Halloween has all that is expected from Zombie. Foul language, disturbing violent and bloody scenes and a general horrific atmosphere. These ingredients usually make for a spectacular horror flick, but in this case it simply makes one that is slightly better then the competition. From the start you know it's Zombie's film, we know his style and we know his cast. Familiar faces pop up everywhere in small cameo roles. Zombie's usual crew: his wife Sheri Moon Zombie, William Forsythe, Udo Kier, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Sid Haig and Ken Foree are here and old horror favourite Brad Dourif and everyman Clint Howard round out the supporting characters. McDowell plays Dr. Loomis, made famous by Pleasence. He does a fine job, but does nothing to really add to the character. Here was his chance to do something and actually make a bit of that character his own, but instead plays right through it.Jamie Lee Curtis was also made famous by her character Lauri Strode,she became known as the Scream Queen. The actress does a good job, again, but doesn't fill the shoes of Curtis at all. She would have been fine if this were some other character in some other slasher film, but it's Laurie Strode. Finally Tyler Mane as Myers. One of the better representations of the character yet, probably because this film dives so deep down into him. Mane portrays an evil walking entity perfectly and does strike fear into the viewer. His size alone will make you clinch your seat. It's odd for someone to not say one word in the film and give the best performance.I don't know what it is with these remakes that seem to have to give some kind of reason or human background to these monsters, but it doesn't always work. Black Christmas, TCM: The Beginning and now Halloween try to humanize a character that doesn't need it. Out of all the sadistic slashers out there, Jason and Freddy included, Myers is the only one who is pure evil. Jason is out for revenge, Freddy is a child molester out for revenge, Chucky is a killer trapped in a doll out for revenge, Leatherface is mentally challenged...but Myers is simply and purely evil. Loomis tells us this, there is nothing behind his eyes, just emptiness, blackness. So why the need to show us a human side to him? Although I did like what they 'tried' to do with it. Showing Myers as a kid in the asylum was interesting, if a bit too long.There lies another problem, the film feels like two totally different films. First we are following Myers and his sick and twisted life he lives, then we switch gears to Laurie. Not enough time to get connected with anyone in this flick.It's easy to see how far Zombie has come with his directing skills. House of 1,000 corpses felt like a 2 hour music video for one of zombies horror songs. Rejects shows maturity and an appreciation for a genre. Halloween shows that he is able to step outside of his comfort zone and tackle something that is held with such high respect. If he were to mess it up, it would be it and he would fall into the realms of every other horror director out there, but he doesn't falter. He doesn't score one out of the park either, instead of remakes a horror classic and adds his own unique spin on it. The camera angles, the dialogue, the violence all scream Zombie.There are a few scares in the film, mostly jump scares, one of which did get me. I attribute the scares to the sound instead of the imagery. Speaking of imagery, yes the iconic scene is added as a homage to the original here. The infamous 'tit' shot as it is known in ""Scream"" although it is handled sloppy and rushed. In fact, the whole film feels rushed, like it can't wait to get to the next scene for it's scary moment. The deaths are fine, more gory and violent then original, which is expected, but the people who die...who are they? We are introduced to them minutes before their death. No time to connect with anyone...ANYONE.A shaky start, good middle and abrupt ending make for Zombie's Halloween a hair short of being a really good horror film. It is leaps and bounds over other remakes of recent years. Don't get me started on ""When A Stranger Calls"". Compared to the original, it sucks, compared to what we have today, it's great. Zombie was the best man for the job and any horror fan will be pleased they caught this one.",Halloween
92,slayrrr666,Disappointing but still watchable,5,27 May 2010,"""Halloween"" is a massively disappointing effort.**SPOILERS**Tired of his life, Michael Myers, (Daeg Faerch) grows frustrated with his increasingly dysfunctional home-life and decides to unleash the homicidal feelings. Committed to an asylum, he goes under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis, (Malcolm McDowell) who spends years trying to get through to him to no avail, and when he's due to be transferred, Michael, (Tyler Mane) escapes into the night. Fearing he'll return to his hometown, he finds that he has targeted his sister Laurie Strode, (Scout-Taylor Compton) and her friends Annie Brackett, (Danielle Harris) and Lynda, (Kristina Klebe) and is cutting a path of destruction to get to them, forcing the survivors to find a way of ending his brutal onslaught.The Good News: There wasn't a lot to like here, but it did have some good parts. The big action scene, his escape from the hospital and ensuing rampage of personnel, is extremely effective as the hulking monstrosity mowing down everyone looks good and the scene itself manages a bit of suspense amongst the whole act. The grimy look of it all and the kill methods aren't bad either, and overall, this is a pretty good scene. The best, though, are the final chases through the house and the encounters within, which are just absolutely a blast. From the darkness used to portray the events to the completely unnerving design and layout of the surroundings and the fear of being caught, these are a lot of fun. That there's several of them, each of which are filled with wanton destruction to the surroundings and result in harrier escapes each time, making them more fun and are a blast. Those are included with the different encounters each of the friends experience, as several of them are just plain creepy and suspenseful, which is a nice touch as well as the fact that many of them are call-backs to the original, and coupled with the fact that each of them feature a ton of nudity is a plus. Each of them look good, and mixed with the suspenseful encounters, it's certainly good fun. The last plus here is the film's extremely brutal and bloody kills, which is always nice. With graphic slit-throats, a series of brutal beat-downs, stabbings, a snapped neck and more, this one is filled with brutality, and it's all effective. These here are the film's pluses.The Bad News: This one had a lot of big problems going for it. One of the biggest is that the film really plays way too much like the original, really destroying the potential impact this one could've had. Utilizing the exact same scenarios and scenes from the original into this one is a really lazy move, showing no real attempt to mix it up despite the overwhelming effort to do so earlier in the film. While the fact remains most of them were effective at what they did and managed to elicit some real suspense from them, in an attempt to make a whole new story, this one just ends up doing the same thing over again and it really makes a big difference to the film. The beginning tried something new, and it feels fresh, while the rest tends to just feel like a repeat of the same thing, which wouldn't be bad if this hadn't managed to copy scenes, camera angles and results wholesale, the point of this gripe. Another really big damaging factor in here is the fact that there's just way too many times during the main action scenes it's impossible to see what's actually going on since the camera is shifting and swinging all over the place. These scenes have the feel of a music video and really feel disjointed and hard-to-follow since they're nearly impossible to actually see clearly. From the chase through the house at the end and the battle in the basement to him stalking around town, the shaking camera during these big action moments are just irritating and not creative, and it's such a disturbing habit that it really needs to stop soon. This is yet another example of a style not-that-good to begin with actively damaging a film because it renders its contents impossible to make out, which is the point, and instead just makes them aggravating. These, though, pale in comparison to the film's single biggest flaw, the beginning of the film. While it is fresh and new, the fact that there's just no end to the problems of these scenes is what makes these the biggest flaw in the film. The fact that this one just spends an eternity hammering home that one detail, minutes-upon-minutes-upon-minutes on-end does the film no favors, pointing out that which we already know because it's been laid out for us already. Having to constantly be inundated with the idea that he went crazy and homicidal from abuse-at-home during his childhood doesn't do any favors, as one it's a lame idea that just feels like an after-thought as the concept doesn't imbue the character with fear, then the over-the-top manner in which it's spelled out just grows old, and the scenes with the bullies or the hospital staff just fall flat. The last part to them is that they just utterly destroy whatever mystique he had to begin with, as a homicidal maniac targeting a victim for no reason is a great concept, but now to simply throw all this into it just doesn't work and the whole film never really recovers. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict: One more in a long line of massively-disappointing films in both Zombie's career as well as the remake trend, there isn't a lot to like here. Fans of his previous films will be interested as well as the sleaze and gore-hounds, while most others should heed extreme caution.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, Graphic Language, animal violence and several sex scenes of varying degrees",Halloween

The scenes follow quickly and logically, but crazed-slasher isn't enough to sustain interest. More emphasis on unmasking the killer would lead to all kinds of trickery. And the long final act was the usual grey & black & sound-effects, with lots of screaming. In the end I expected the sister and brother theme to deliver something clever or emotional, but it wasn't revealed.Also there are no true jump moments, which is a big minus for a horror.

94,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A fascinating re-imagining and contrast to the iconic original, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is a very different beast... though that isn't necessarily a bad thing.",7,22 October 2016,"I believe there exists a degree of criteria that a remake must attempt to fulfill in order for me to consider it successful. Only in fulfilling some of these will I consider it worthwhile. These mainly fall into broad ""goals"", such as: -A flawed original should have its faults be corrected by a remake; -In contrast, a good film should be explored in a new way that works for the material with a remake; -A remake needs to maintain a careful balancing act with just enough elements of the original mixed in with new ideas to keep it fresh but familiar; -Etc.But the most important thing that a remake should strive for is also the most simplistic and obvious. That of course being that a remake should be able to stand on its own, without being overshadowed by the original source material. A remake, reboot, re-imagining, etc. needs to be able to be judged on its own merits as a film experience. A film that can be watched on its own without the constant and pervasive thought of comparison to the original that many remakes suffer for.And I do firmly believe that Rob Zombie's 2007 reboot of John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween"" fulfills the necessary criteria to be a successful remake. It explores the idea from a new perspective. It gives a modern spin on the characters. It includes just enough tribute to the original to have an air of familiarity without pandering. And when you watch it, you will be absorbed into its unique take on the story and mythos, and for the most part, that original film will be the last thing on your mind, save for a few moments.The film is divided evenly into two halves. The opening of the film follows young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch), a troubled child who begins to develop signs of aggression and psychopathic tendencies in response to his life of bullying and abuse at the hands of his peers and step-father. On Halloween night, he finally snaps and murders his family, save for his kind-hearted mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) and baby sister. Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) oversees his stay at Smith's Grove sanitarium and chronicles his further descent into madness as he slowly becomes a silent predator.Fifteen years later, Michael (now played by Tyler Mane) escapes and returns to his hometown to finish a demented unknown goal. Young Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) begins to notice Michael stalking her throughout the day, and soon it becomes obvious that Michael is after her for his own dark reasons. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis also returns and works together with the local sheriff (Brad Dourif) to try and capture his former patient.There is a degree of controversy surrounding the film regarding the different tone and style that writer/director Zombie takes. Whereas the original was a very slow and deliberate thriller that made keen use of long, static shots and a subdued production, this remake is very much a ""Rob Zombie"" film. Everything is loud. Flashy. Gritty. And very grimy. But honestly... I kinda dug it. We already had been through eight prior films with the original series, and for the most part, even though some entries were strong, there was an ever-growing sense that the films were merely struggling to recapture even a modicum of the original's style and atmosphere. I do think that taking a step back and giving us a fresh new perspective on the story was a good move. It not only gave this film a startling and very noticeable identity of its own, but also gave us a newfound appreciation of that original film that had become lost in the endless sequels and follow-ups that came prior. And I found the new style so refreshing and such a great contrast to the previous films, it really helped to suck me into the story and become more accepting of the changes that were being made. It was a new take on the franchise.Performances are for the most part very strong. Taylor-Compton makes for a charming and easily likable new Laurie, and makes for a great protagonist in the film's second half. She really captures the manic energy of teenagers but doesn't go so far as the become unlikable. McDowell is a lot of fun as our new Loomis... he's far less mentally unhinged than the character had been previously portrayed, and comes off as a bit more grounded... but also deeply flawed in his own way. Sheri Moon Zombie and Daeg Faerch are absolutely phenomenal in the opening half of the film. And Brad Dourif steals the show in every scene he's in.However, the film does have some flaws. While it stands tall as a unique vision of the series, there's a degree of fan-service that occasionally detracts from the film. Its at its best when its doing its own thing and only serving as a ""loose remake""... however, a few references do feel clunky and contrived and can't help but call a little too much attention to the original, begging for comparison. (I think references and homage to an original are important... but not when they make you instantly want to compare them.) It's also a bit too heavy on sexual themes. Particularly upsetting is a very cruel scene of assault in the extended cut and a very clumsily executed sex-joke involving Laurie and a bagel. And at times, Zombie's trademark ""gritty"" camera-work can be jarring.That being said, I do view this as one of the stronger remakes of recent years. It does enough new with the content to stand on its own, the performances are great and it's both a good compliment to and contrast of prior entries. Fans ought give it another shot if they had previously dismissed it. It's a different beast entirely to the original... but that's not necessarily a bad thing.I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10.",Halloween

96,m-47826,Zombie's shallowness plummets an otherwise good script.,3,1 November 2020,"If it wasn't for all those things that makes it close to unwatchable. This remake would've been a good homage to the original movie. Rob Zombie tried too hard to make it in HIS way. With foul language/behavior, characters acting like bikers and their groupies, and blaring directing. Even the fashion is out on left field for the franchise. The first half was good. I thought the acting and characterizations, were on point. Sherry Moon Zombie gave a great performance, as Michael's mother. So did the rest of this cast. Only it had to be spoiled by Zombie, pushing his own vision onto how characters were to act and interact. And the way the movie must look like. Which went on overdrive, during the second and third half. With unnecessarily long and violent death scenes. That's probably the worst thing about this remake, the way everything about the original movie, is exaggerated. Under an already extravagant approach. It leaves you with that bad sensation of having eaten too much candy. Very dripping and sticky ones.",Halloween

Written and Directed by Rob Zombie Rated R for strong language, violence, gore, sexuality and nudity.I just finished watching the original Halloween less than a week ago. We were excited for the new version coming out and decided to watch the original because it's a classic. Our viewing added up to less that desirable results. Although still entertaining the original Halloween is far from flawless. Despite the fact that it created the clichés that so annoy us in movies now, it takes so long to get going, that when it finally does start it feels pretty lackluster. But don't get me wrong the film is still classic and had it never existed so many films that followed would have never been made today. Including this update which in one word is superior to it's original predecessor. Although this version isn't flawless either. This is without a doubt one of the best slasher movies ever made and one of the best horror remakes ever to grace the screen following a close second to the fantastically macabre Chainsaw rehash. That being said lets talk Michael. The first 40 minutes of the film is Michael's early years the ones that shape a kid into being what he will become. He grows up in a white trash family, constantly picked on by bullies because his Mom is a stripper. Ridiculed by his promiscuos sister and emotionally and mentally tortured by his handicapped stepfather. He resorts to cutting up animals until one fateful Halloween night when he decides to brutally murder the people who have made his life miserable. Flash forward eleven months after the trial and we are treated to his years in a mental institution where he meets Dr. Loomis and receives weekly visits from his Mother. One bad circumstance leads to another and we flash forward fifteen years to the night Michael escapes to return to Haddonfield to come after his baby sister. The film's first third concerning the early years works rather well and doesn't even feel like a Halloween film. Sheri Moon Zombie is especially impressive and sympathetic as his mother and the young Michael played by Daeg Farsch is quite creepy. The film's problems lie in it's second third when we are introduced to his now grown baby sister and her annoying friends. None of them are really given all that much character development and the only one we ultimately end up caring for is Lori. The film drags a slight bit in this act. But the final act is where horror history is made. It's so incredibly intense you'll want to run and get a massage from the edge of your seat thrills that are lashed towards you. Enough said about the surprising climax. This film doesn't feel like a remake of the original film but an entirely new Halloween film altogether Zombie has taken the source material and made it his own improving upon it in my opinion. Reasons are even given from a psychological stand point in why he murders the promiscuos teens and why he does what he does. Zombie's direction is confident and slick. The cinematography is aggressive and creative, check out the stand still pan shot of a key emotional scene in the film. By amping up the violence and intensity factor emotions are what this film is about and the film is flooding with them adrenaline, tears, laughter and even sympathizing with many characters situations even Michaels'. As far as the performances go Tyler Mane is effective as the title character bringing a sort of humanly menace to his monster. Mcdowell is decent if a little over the top as Dr. Loomis, Scout Taylor Compton is annoying at first as Lori Storde but earns her scream queen stripes as the film approaches its horrific finale. Daeg Farsch is creepy as young Michael. But the real breakout performance here is Mrs. Zombie. She plays a completely different character than in her previous films and nails it. She's multilayered and you sympathize with her and her situation. She feels real. And so does this movie despite the implausibility of a unstoppable killer Zombie makes it feels as real as he possibly can. You never doubt the situation or the happenings. If I had one complaint it would be that they used that classic Halloween music too early in the film and too much. the score is classic and I felt should have been built up to. What Zombie has done is nothing short of a horror movie miracle he's resurrected Michael Myers anew and made him scary again. He's no longer the unmotivated psycho stalker. He's been fleshed out and he like this film is a monster on a cinematic rampage. If your in the mood for a scary movie with substance this movie is it. It's Halloween for a new generation.****1/2/5",Halloween
98,rivertam26,An intensely flawed but decent effort,6,1 March 2020,I've been a fan of Rob Zombie since he released his innovative House of 1000 Corpses. It wasn't perfect but it was clear he had a knack for the dirtier and more wildly creative side of the genre. He followed that up with the unexpected and surprisingly layered Devil's Rejects and so on and on. His films have always interested me. Even when they were hot messes like Lords of Salem. They were at least unique and intriguing. And stylistically inspired. So I was excited when first seeing this film back in 2007. I mostly like what he did with it. I really liked the first half with the dissection of Michael and his enviorment. And was quite blown away by Sheri Moon Zombie as his mother. It's by far her best performance. But when we get to the actually remade part it suffers from some of the same problems that plagued the franchise but with a meaner and less entertaining streak. Also the casting of Scout Taylor Compton is all wrong. She's just unbearably annoying and her friends are as well. I lived the ferociousness of his character but his journey was a little nonsensical.,Halloween
99,Analog_Devotee,"As time passes, my dislike for this film grows more and more.",2,4 January 2021,"A couple of years ago, a buddy of mine admitted that while he wasn't fond of this flick when it originally released, it grew on him over time and he now regularly watches it throughout the year. Not long after, I heard someone on a podcast relay the exact same thing, and then stumbled upon a forum thread where a few other people shared the opinion. In fact, as time continues passing, I hear it more and more often.""Hated that one when it first came out, but it's grown on me over time.""It's funny, because I've had the complete opposite reaction to this film. Upon release, (DVD release, that is) I didn't have much of a reaction. I didn't hate the film, but I didn't particularly like it, either. I also didn't understand why so many fans were outraged. My thought process was, these people know it's a remake, right?Well, as time went on, I grew to love the originals more and more with each rewatch, and every time I rewatched this one I felt like I was getting something cheap. Just... not up to par with the others.Listing the specifics of what I dislike about this film would be a waste of time. Why? Well, because at this point, I don't like anything about it. I'm not sure why I even allow it to take up space on my shelf anymore. The only reason I give it a two star instead of a one star is because the sequel manages to be even worse.",Halloween
100,Pumpkin_Man,An Awesome Remake to a Great Classic!!!,10,22 September 2008,"I loved Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I saw this the first day it came out. I couldn't possibly wait another day. I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (NOT the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the HALLOWEEN music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is just as good as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN! I highly recommend this film to all HALLOWEEN fans! HALLOWEEN begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psychopath. On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time? You gotta watch the movie to find out! If you love horror, remakes, and Rob Zombie's work, you'll love HALLOWEEN!!!",Halloween
101,Sirus_the_Virus,Some films should be left alone.,4,4 August 2009,"The original Halloween film is my favorite horror film ever. It' disturbing, creepy, and makes you jump. It has the key elements that most horror films need. But for some stupid reason, Rob Zombie decided to remake it and mess it up. Halloween is an origins story about a deranged boy named Michael Myers. The only person in his family was his mother. One night while his mother is gone, he decides to murder his sister and his step father. Years later, Michael Breaks out of prison to hunt down his other sister on Halloween. He decides to kill all of her friends just to find her. This isn't the worst remake ever. It's one of the worst. The worst remake ever is definitely the Psych remake, which was absolutely dreadful. Halloween is just like every horror film nowadays, blood, guts, sex, and sluts. I wish they could be a scary film like Drag me to hell, which is the best scary film I've seen in years. Rob Zombie screws up this already good film and makes me sick to think about it. This film is actually pretty disgusting. I'm ashamed to say that Rob Zombie's Halloween is a huge letdown to the series.",Halloween
102,Angelus2,"This Halloween, evil is coming home..",3,11 May 2010,"I was familiar with the Michael Myers characters, but never got around to watching the movies. I expected something very scary, something unique that would break the barriers that recent Michael Myers films had found them in. But what I got was awful....Michael Myers grows up with a lap dancer for a mother, a abusive father, and a sister who likes to sleep around. He spends his nights secretly killing his animals until the desire to kill something bigger takes over and he massacres his family....15 years on, Myers returns from his prison to kill....the neighbours.I thought the film started off strong, it had some good performances from the actor who played the young Myers, but as the film went on it became slower and duller....It almost seems to me that the Director realised he was running out of time and just sent Myers on a quick killing spree....The three lead actresses/victims, were brainless...Strutting around naked....No sense whatsoever....",Halloween
103,baumer,An abomination,1,10 September 2007,"I think Rob Zombie is a talented film maker. I thought his first two efforts were perfect homages to the genre he professes to love. He subtly tipped his cap to the pinnacles of the genre and yet still managed to show us his own style. When I heard he was taking on Halloween, it made me nervous. Halloween is the best of the bunch. With all due respect to Psycho, which Halloween tried to emulate, Halloween is just so much better than any other horror film ever produced. I realize this is not an empirical statement, but the quality of Halloween and the influence it has over a plethora of horror films is. There is simply no getting around it, Halloween is the best of the best. I say this because for Zombie to want to remake the pinnacle of horror takes a lot of balls and it had better of been a faithful retelling of the story or it won't work. This film sadly doesn't work. In fact, it stinks.Rob Zombie either has no understanding at all of the Michael Myers character, or he just doesn't care. Perhaps he needed a hit after his first two films were well received by the critics, surprisingly, but did little business at the box office. Or perhaps he thought all of today's jilted youth would flock to it and somehow relate to the Myers character. Let's revisit the original 1978 Halloween. The film presents us with a child who, for no apparent reason at all, stabs his sister to death. As Dr. Loomis tells us, there is no rhyme, no reason and no understanding behind his eyes. He seems like he is a normal kid with a nuclear family who just takes a large knife and slaughters his sister on Halloween night. It is simply evil that motivates him. This idea that an incarnation of evil could just snap is what made the film so FRIGHTENING. He spends the next fifteen years in an institution just waiting. He doesn't speak or move or show an intelligent signs of life or even a modicum or human understanding. He just waits for Halloween night and then guided by evil, he escapes. IT, Michael Myers escapes Smith's Grove and heads to Haddonfield and goes after his only remaining family member. Why? Who knows. It is never really explained. But we are left with is pure and unadulterated evil, on a mission of death. Dr. Sam Loomis was the only person who knew this. No one else believed him or took heed to his warnings. They just left Loomis and his pet patient alone. Loomis' world has become one that is spent making sure that Myers never leaves Smith's Grove. It drives him almost to the brink of insanity. He wants to make sure that Myers is never let out of the institute.These themes are tantamount to what made Halloween such a brilliant piece of film making. I don't think another movie will ever capture the feeling of evil and doubt and fear quite like Halloween.When you look at Zombie's white trash version, the first five minutes of the film are like a slap in the face and it makes you cringe.Zombie literally slaps you in the face and decides to give us a reason as to why Myers is the way he is. And what do you think that is? He is from a white trash, trailer park family. The evil and disgusting step-father, the stripper mother and the whorish sister. The family speak like drunken sailors and go on about things that just don't resonate. And then of course you get Myers being bullied at school. So we have the personification of evil being evil because his step father is a jerk and kids beat him up. Are you kidding me? So basically Michael Myers goes from a character that represents complete evil and lack of humanity, to a tortured nutcase that snaps. When in the original, he was just E-VIL.What is also terrible in the film is the writing and the dialogue of every character. Where Carpenter and Debra Hill shared the writing duties in the original, Zombie does it all here and his juvenile rantings of the female characters in here is just wrong and even his kindergarten like interpretation of Loomis is terrible. Malcolm McDowell is fine as the good doctor, but Zombie betrays him with psyche 101 babblings of what he thinks Loomis would say. What makes it that much more frustrating is that Zombie says he loves films like Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And instead of emulating what made those so effective, he dumped all over the Halloween legacy. This might have been a decent horror film, but it is not a Halloween film. He doesn't understand Halloween, Myers, Loomis or any of Carpenter's brilliance. He hacks away at it for the Facebook generation and it is a nauseating experience. This movie resembles more of a rock video than it does an iconic horror film. And that is sad. Even worse is kids who haven't seen the original might actually like this repulsive version.This is the worst horror remake ever, and that includes Psycho.DO NOT SEE THE HALLOWEEN REMAKE.",Halloween
104,jaredmobarak,He has come back for his baby sisterHalloween,4,31 August 2007,"I love the backlash that has been thrown about since this ""re-envisioning"" of John Carpenter's horror classic Halloween was announced. At first I agreed with them, why remake a film that everyone loves? However, I am not the biggest fan of the original, I find it a tad boring, and I have been intrigued by Rob Zombie ever since he tossed aside his rock day job for director threads. I haven't seen his previous two efforts, but I've been wanting to and now am even more anxious to see them. I say that because Zombie's take on Halloween shows some real nice flair and inventive use of the camera, not to mention well-planned death scenes that show the gore, but don't quite keep it on screen to disgust. It may be graphic, but it never becomes gratuitous. He moves the action along at a nice quick pace, not lingering on the blood, just showing it as it happens. With all that said, though, I do not recommend this film. On the whole, its parts do not make a masterpiece, but instead a jumbled mess that tries to cram too much story into what should be a genre film. Michael Myers works as a character because we know he is pure evil; don't try and humanize him by showing that his upbringing created his malice, it takes away the fear and a bit of the cold- bloodedness that he embodies so well.The beauty of 70's era horror is that it was always substance over style. Nowadays, these Hollywood autuers want to show what can be done on a bigger budget. Unfortunately, it is not the blood and violence that makes those movies good, it is the subtle use of suspense creating a psychological reaction in the audience, not a visceral one. While Zombie's style is prevalent, and exciting to watch, he appears to go overboard at times and at the risk of the story being told. Scenes like the freeze-frame post massacre where everything is paused except little Michael in the police car are beautifully orchestrated. It is a shame that he then needs to put in hamfisted cues like Blue Oyster Cult and an old horror flick on TV to draw comparisons later on in the film to moments that occurred earlier. These instances don't show how smart and clever you are, they just prove you are talking down to your viewers. Just play Carpenter's amazing score and we'll know evil is coming, don't force-feed us clues that are so blatant they bore us.As far as the debate of this being a remake, I would say it isn't. Maybe the last quarter of the film contains the incidents that occur in the original, everything else is new. Well, maybe not new as much as Zombie's version of Myers' backstory and creation as a psycho killer madman. I'm sure a lot could be common knowledge having seen the millions of films in this series already, but here we have the childhood and subsequent incarceration of the William Shatner mask-wearer, (the origin of that mask is somewhat amusing here, as well as the burning question of when Michael buried it to get it back 15 years later). It is all an interesting psychological study, yet it seems to take a bit away from the action, slowing down the pace ever so slightly. I actual liked the change because something other than Michael being killed and getting right back up was a welcome reprieve. Too bad this incarnation is hopped up on steroids and can deal with any pain imaginable as well. It would have been nice to see Zombie stay away from that crutch, but I guess what Halloween film can be complete with out it?In the end, the aesthetic is cool and I wish Zombie would have kept with his creative juices and used it for something fresh. This story did not need to be retold and no matter how much new blood was infused here, it didn't make it fresh. I do applaud the death toll, however. There was a few times when I was taken by surprise at people that were dying. He pulls no punches; everyone is expendable, and I like that. As far as the acting goes, I thought it was a waste getting genre people in this with such small roles. Kier, Howard, Dourif, and Trejo are all pretty much insignificant except to give the filmmakers a face in throwaway roles. The lone exception here is William Forsythe as Michael's father, (a fantastic little gem that had me second guessing myself whether it was really him)oh, and Malcolm McDowell's hair trying to make him look youngeryeah, it didn't. Sheri Moon Zombie was at times great casting and at others nepotism at its best. Rob, just because she is your wife, doesn't mean she needs to be in all your movies, she is no Meryl Streep. All joking aside, though, our two ""leads,"" if you can call them that, are effective. Scout Taylor-Compton is cute and believable in her role, both as the bubbly teenager and as the horror stricken victim. Young Michael Myers truly steals this show, however. Daeg Faerch is amazing as the homicidal ten year-old. Either he really is a killer or his parents are very liberal at letting him go places no kid that age should have to go mentally. I for one would not want to see this kid walking down the street in my neighborhood.",Halloween

106,thekarmicnomad,Is probably going to please nobody,5,25 February 2019,"This is Rob Zombie's take on Halloween, taking it all the way back to Michael's childhood.The direction, production and acting in this, for the most part, is very good.
The young Michael is especially good: managing to portray an intangible creepiness but with a hint of childish innocence.The film is quite long (I think I saw the extended version) and once you get passed Michael's childhood not an awful lot happens.
Young people get naked before getting sharp implements jabbed into their bodies, rinse and repeat until the credits roll.The main question is why was this made?
Rob Zombie is a master at recreating films in the style of the 70's ""video nasty"" a genre dedicated to push against an unrelenting censorship system using an overabundance of sex and violence.
Halloween is\was a fairly straight forward horror.This film is obviously going to annoy die-hard fans and is not original enough to excite the Rob Zombie fans.The genre feels a bit creaky after the invention of the internet and a general desensitisation to nudity and violence.
I doubt many men will watch this thinking: ""Phew I'm glad that's not me being stabbed in the back whilst I'm penis deep in a cheerleader"" anymore that I imagine female horror fans are thinking: ""thank goodness that isn't me tearing around a creepy old house, bare-chested, screaming my head off like a lunatic, chased by an actual lunatic.""Fans of the original should stay away, so probably should Rob Zombie fans.
This isn't a bad film, a large portion of it is very good cinema, it is just a bit of a misplaced effort.",Halloween
107,Fernando-Rodrigues,The Beginning,7,6 February 2021,"I like the 2nd level of the film better than the 1st level because Daeg Faerch was not a good choice to portray young Michael. Another movie that proves how incredible is Rob Zombie's mind. It could've been way better, of course, but it gave everything the horror fans wanted.",Halloween
108,ODDBear,Somewhat successful origin of Michael Myers,6,4 August 2008,"Why remake a classic genre defining film when it would have been easier to make another sequel? Fans of the franchise probably would have relished that Zombie would make a ninth installment. He opted for a ""re-imagining"" of the original and that was always going to split fans right down to the middle. A lot of people here trash the film while others praise it. Since Carpenter's original was a nearly perfect horror film in most respects it was impossible a task to do a remake. That's not what this film is and here Zombie tries to explain why Michael Myers came to be.In short; Michael comes from a white trash family. The mother Deborah Myers, while seeming to be mostly decent, is a stripper who couldn't care less what kind of man she lets into her home and have a direct influence on her children. This is evident by the presence of Lonnie (William Forsythe), who here is a complete bum; complete with repellent use of language and a sick comment about Deborah's daughter Judith. He seems to be her boyfriend and one can only imagine that he's not the first loser to enter the Myers home.Young Michael gets a kick out of killing animals and early on a psychiatrist (Malcolm McDowell as Samuel Loomis) enters the picture and explains that this kind of behavior is usually an indicator for more serious problems. The same day Michael kills an obnoxious teenager (who I don't think would be sorely missed) and proceeds to kill more people as the evening wears on. He kills Lonnie, Judith and her boyfriend. As Deborah comes home from a night of stripping she finds Michael outside caressing his baby sister on the front porch.This doesn't take that long and then we're in for the therapy sessions. Those scenes are good (and if I'm not mistaken there are more of those scenes in the Director's Cut version than there were in the Theatrical Cut). Michael slips away, becomes obsessed with making masks and doesn't utter a word for many years. His mother commits suicide and Dr. Loomis abandons Michael after years of trying to reach out to him.While this is an interesting approach it isn't altogether successful. Michael's origins seem to come from a manual that describes the worst possible scenario for a child to grow up in. Zombie's insistence to only depict white-trash individuals with an exceptionally repulsive vocabulary is very stereotypical and doesn't make much of an impact. Deborah Myers, while being mostly a sympathetic person, is an unforgivingly stupid individual for bringing characters like Lonnie into their home. He talks about bumping off the Myers family himself, more or less, and this looks like a normal day at the breakfast table. While some people may relate to this kind of household it didn't ring true to me as the film tries to pass Deborah off as a caring mother who genuinely loves her children.The scenes at the asylum are, however, very good. The use of home videos (in black and white and grainy, a bit of a cliché but still effective) with McDowell's voice-over explaining Michaels descent into madness are excellent and young Daeg Faerch gives a good performance as the disturbed 10 year old Michael.And now Zombie's version is over and we're into remake territory. In the Theatrical Cut Michael escaped while being transferred to another institution. If memory serves the scene was quite grotesque as Michael killed the security guards in graphic detail. In the Director's Cut Michael escapes after some staff members enter his cell and proceed to rape a mentally unstable girl right in front of him. Both those scenes are somewhat unimaginative and very brutal and uncomfortable.Michael enters Haddonfield on Halloween and goes after his baby sister Laurie. While all this a nearly a straight remake of the original Zombie does well in depicting Michael's night of grueling terror. It's just that it's too fast paced. No tension is mounted as we're in for one brutal attack after another.Zombie is good filmmaker. He obviously loves the original and treats the subject matter with respect. He tries to fill in the blanks concerning Michael's origins and while he's not altogether successful it is a good attempt at expanding the Myers saga. Like in ""Devil's Rejects"", Zombie is first rate at creating brutal scenes of violence and, while not glorifying the act, making it extremely uncomfortable. He goes a bit too far in depicting repulsive individuals and in the ""Zombie-verse"" there are few people overall decent and moral.The cast Zombie assembles is top notch every time. There couldn't have been a better choice for Dr. Loomis than Malcolm McDowell. The 70's icon nails the part and, actually, here's hoping for another installment with McDowell as Loomis. Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon, is quite decent as Deborah and Faerch is very impressive as young Michael.Halloween 2007 is not a complete mess as it could easily have been. Overall I think the Director's Cut fleshes the story out in a better way and is preferable to the Theatrical Cut. While Zombie is no match for Carpenter at creating mood and tension he does mount amazingly brutal set pieces. His Halloween is nowhere near as good as the original but it is a solid film overall. Good intentions somewhat outweigh results but at least this installment is far better than Halloween's 5, 6 and 8. While the eighth installment was directed by Rick Rosenthal (who made a very decent Halloween II) the Halloween series has let some jokers take charge (Dominique Othenin-Girard with part 5 and Joe Chapelle, who reportedly hated the franchise, with part 6). Zomie loves horror films and especially the original Halloween and it shows here.",Halloween
109,MrGKB,Horrifically bad from start to finish...,2,24 March 2013,"...and I don't mean that in any sort of cutesy, punning, ironic way whatsoever. I've pretty much about had it with the naked emperor of sleaze, the pretentious hack that calls itself Rob ""The Devil's Rejects"" Zombie. Never mind the money-grubbing effrontery of remaking an iconic horror movie, Zombie has seen fit to utterly destroy it. ""He ain't no Carpenter, he ain't no Cronenberg, he's just a-hackin' along,"" sung to the tune of the Talking Heads' ""Life During Wartime."" Yeah, I know that doesn't scan perfectly, but you get the idea. Zombie is a hack, pure and simple, and a tedious, repetitive one at that.Take a perfectly good premise, then ruin it with a lot of low-class unnecessary back story, cast a slew of genre actors (including a talent-less wife) who wouldn't turn down a paycheck if their lives depended on it, sprinkle with a dose of unimaginative mayhem and gore, strip away all the innocence and charm of your supposed heroine and her friends, season with a rasher of ""oh, c'mons!"" and gaping lapses in logic, hire on tech support so enamored by your charisma that they won't call you on your mediocre script and pedestrian direction, and poof! You've got a bankable product that the ill-educated, tasteless masses will suck right up like a dog eats its own vomit.I look forward to the day that Rob Zombie gets called out in public for the perfect example of Sturgeon's Law that he is. I actually saw his repugnant ""Halloween 2"" before this one, and not only refrained from commenting on it here because I didn't want to dirty my keyboard, I also swore not to bother with this wretched mess. I'm damn sorry I went back on my own word. Won't happen again. Zombie is hereby on my no-watch list for good.",Halloween
110,cultfilmfan,Rob Zombie's Halloween,8,1 September 2007,"The 2007 version of Halloween from writer/director Rob Zombie isn't so much a remake as it is in parts a prequel to the 1978 film Halloween and the second part is almost a re-telling or a different version and in a different style and way of events that took place in the original movie. The 1978 John Carpenter film Halloween is one of my favourite horror films of all time and is often considered one of the scariest movies of all time as well. I usually am against horror remakes, or remakes of any kind because I feel it takes little, or no talent at all to remake a film because you are borrowing the story and events from a previous film and there is little to none of your own talent on display bringing to the screen something that has already been done before. For those reasons you will very rarely see me reviewing any remake at all because I really don't have a lot of respect for the filmmakers who remake others films. After being a fan of Rob Zombie's first two films House Of 1000 Corpses and especially The Devil's Rejects, I wasn't sure how to take the news that Rob Zombie would be making a Halloween film. What I liked so much about Zombie's previous films was the way he would sometimes borrow and mimic classic 70's horror films, but add his own touch to them as well making them unique and stylish in a gruesome kind of drive in way that many of the horror films from the 70's looked and felt like. Still after being impressed by Zombie before I thought I would give him a chance and see what he could do with Halloween and I was actually impressed. First of all I would like to address the fact that many reviews for this film on message boards and different entertainment sites were of a leaked copy of one of the first drafts of the film before it was properly edited and fixed before hitting theatres. Apparently a lot was changed, so please don't judge the film from what you saw on the internet, or of a bootleg copy you may have stumbled upon because many changes of the film were made since then. Also this film wasn't released for a lot of critics to review it, which is usually a sign that the film is bad and the studio doesn't want it to be reviewed figuring the bad press will kill the movie's box office. I really can't understand why this film wasn't released for critics. I'm sure it wouldn't have gotten great reviews because of the type of film it is and because critics haven't gone that crazy for Zombie's previous films, but I still think enough of them would have liked this. As for the film itself I liked what Zombie did with it. The first half where we are introduced to the film's homicidal maniac Michael Myers as a child growing up with a very dysfunctional family was interesting to me and a good start for the film to see where it would go from there. The soundtrack to the film as with Zombie's previous films was also good as well. What I really liked about the film however was how he made the film his own. Yes, he did borrow a lot from the original and some scenes in this film will remind you of parts of the original, but this is almost a completely new and rethought out version of the film and for once in a remake I liked the changes to the characters and a new story because it kept it in the tradition of old slasher films, but also added some 70's campy charm to the film and I think Zombie captured the tension and suspense of the original film very well here. The thrills are different because in the original it was scary because you hardly saw Michael Myers which added suspense and kept you wondering what his next move or kill would be. In this film you do see Michael a lot, but with really good editing and pace the suspense is still high. Not to mention there are a lot of gruesome and disturbing images in this film that add perfectly to Zombie's style. This film kept my attention and kept me entertained throughout and for once in a remake the new twist on the film actually worked and although this is nowhere close to being a masterpiece like the original, the film still holds up well on it's own because of a good campy story that is fun and a good ode to 70's films (especially the slashers), good editing, a good sense of suspense and music. This version is a lot of bloody demented fun and I enjoyed myself throughout and as for Zombie, I look forward to what he is doing next.",Halloween
111,fernandoschiavi,"Offering a new vision of history without losing the classic elements, Zombie produces a solid remake",6,5 September 2021,"Rob Zombie has always divided opinions on his projects. His first film, the well-traveled The House of 1000 Corpses (House of 1000 Corpses, 2002), brings elements from The Chainsaw Massacre with several other goods that are difficult to understand in a ""normal"" line of reasoning. His second is already a little more loved, the great (The Devil's Rejects, 2005), which serves as a sequel to the previous film and is far superior in almost every way. For the production of the remake of the classic Halloween, 1978 film directed by none other than John Carpenter, Rob Zombie had to make do, because: according to him, horror icons like Freddy Krueger, Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers himself they had become anything but frightening among audiences as the public was quite familiar with him. The director's proposal was to reinvent the Myers story in his new film.In the story, the boy Michael Myers, 10 years old, suffers from being problematic and, therefore, receives everyone's indifference. This ends up motivating him to commit increasingly horrible crimes that separate the boy from society, further contributing to the development of his sick mind. In addition, the film shows that, since childhood, the killer already had the habit of wearing masks. This, in fact, was the boy's way of hiding from the world. Thus, the film details the life of the killer, his massacres, especially on Halloween, and even his feelings. That's right, he has feelings.Using the same argument as the original, Zombie starts from the character's childhood to develop and justify his cruelty. It puts child Michael Myers in a hostile environment, with a stripper mother, an invalid stepfather who hates him, a teenage sister who, like any young girl, despises everything but her own belly button, plus a little sister, for whom Myers nurtures a positive feeling. This is the first act that underlies the character's motivations. The director tried to show a murderer who never escapes from his profile and who even the few feelings that are left appear confused and not very relevant. This was effective as it distances the film from the silly clichés that are increasingly present in projects of this type. In the early films, it was always stressed that Michael was pure evil incarnate. Here, the film ""uses the excuse"" that Michael is like that due to his complicated childhood. Not necessary? Maybe, but still this ""humanization"" of the character is realistic and has enough screen time (about 50 minutes) to develop, attaching a second story within the ""main"" plot.Because it contains striking scenes of violence, with emphasis on the killing promoted by young Michael in his house with a knife, ribbon and baseball bat and also during his stay in the psychiatric hospital. By introducing the psychological scope of Myers' childhood, Zombie produces a fearful real figure. Upon understanding his psychological motivations, the audience contemplates a dubious feeling: they recognize the character's monstrosity, but pity them for understanding him within an analytical-psychological system. An analysis that, however, does not remove the power of fear caused by the figure fond of hiding behind masks, fearful of his own appearance.The assassin's story is shown very faithfully to the character's instinct, that is, cruel and terrifying, a full plate for the genre. In a 30-year advance, the short second act presents Myers in prison, an event already predicted by his child psychologist, Dr. Loomis (Michael McDowell), who, since the boy's childhood, believed that his patient would sever the ties of the world outside the demonstrate a corrupted psyche incapable of absorbing the problematic of its own actions. The third act marks the character's escape from the asylum in which he is imprisoned and the search for his family's survivors.The second part of the tape, practically the final 50 minutes, is who carries all the big stones in the shoe. Even with the best use of the soundtrack and a clever work of photography in dark environments (yes, we're talking about Halloween night), everything seems to fall apart. The editing gets even worse - if that's even possible - and Rob Zombie's direction seems to be stricken with a neurosis of full-on action. Everything is too much: the run-and-run, the screams, the die-don't-die... it's as if the director wanted to show that that massacre that happened at the beginning of the film could ""be worse"" with adult Myers, but this approach only serves to make the aspect of psychopathy something cheap and cloying. If it seemed interesting at first, because the protagonist was a child, the event becomes exaggerated at the end, also because there is less suggestion and more demonstration of what the killer does.The main difference between the Carpenter movie and the Zombie movie (which for one time must have been the key element for the bad reception of some fans) is that the rocker leaves aside the suspense (you know those tense scenes that only is there in the Halloween movies, where Michael despite walking slowly is always close enough to the victim?) to give way to graphic violence. The cuts made in scenes that the killer will make a new victim take some of the obviousness of the act and give it a pleasant aspect, since it shows a commitment to the story and not to the viewer. What's the point of showing yet another violent death in which the killer doesn't forgive even the person who took care of him for years? An interesting scene is where a woman begs Myers not to kill her. The scene ends there and shows nothing but the gesture of the desperate woman. The dark mood and the nervous camera are present during the 109 minutes and give an interesting, disturbing atmosphere to the story, close to that existing in the sickly mind of the murderer. These features used mainly in Myers' attack scenes fit like a glove in the story and the result is positive. Just watch the scene where the killer kills a guy, hangs him and watches him like a real psychopath.The highlight of ""Halloween - The Beginning"" is the good performance of the boy who plays Myers as a child. Daeg Faerch, unknown until then, shows great confidence in taking the only part of the killer's life in which his facial expressions are observed, as he gradually incorporates the habit of wearing masks into his life. Just the look the boy makes is worth the title of best acting in the film. A look that mixes a troubled life with an unhealthy mind. A real psychopath, as the author of a book about the boy in the story says.In reality, what spoils Halloween - The Beginning is the ultimate exaggeration, especially the last 35 minutes of this ""unrated"" version (although the big problems start a little earlier). However, if the viewer understands that the purpose of the film was to introduce new features to the work and only then reprise events from the original, it is easy to see something good in the concept of Rob Zombie. It is as if we were looking at the general proposal of Psycho II (1983), Psycho III (1986) and Psycho IV - The Beginning (1990), all reviewing elements of Hitchcock's classic, but making it clear that the universe and the intention in question was other. Of course, there are similarities in content between Zombie's Halloween and Carpenter's (the remake part), but Zombie has steered its text more towards the origins than towards the ""final"" stage of Michael Myers. Interestingly, while working on this origin of the protagonist, the director was very successful - even with the carnage of the beginning -, making mistakes only when he decided to rewrite the first film with exaggerations laden with excuses to ""enhance"" Laurie's despair.Giving a new vision of history without losing the classic elements, Zombie produces a solid remake, unlike other adapted works, such as Friday the 13th, Horror in Amityville and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; such productions, when contextualized in the contemporary narrative style, did not necessarily know how to adapt to the new audience, which is no longer afraid of shallow monsters from the 80s. Updating the character, a lurking monster is created, owner of great aggression and a fear that seems more sensitive to the conception of reality. A version that, by delving into Myers' human makeup, makes him even more insane.",Halloween

113,mario_c,"I think this film fulfil its purposes, in this age of classics' remakes!",6,23 March 2008,"I didn't watch the original Halloween movie. In fact, from the series, I just saw some sequels in the middle which don't explain anything about the story, or how it did begin. So, for me, watching this movie, and even knowing it is a remake, it was as watching the original film! As I can't relate the original Carpenter's film to this one I won't make too many judgment value about Rob Zombie's version of the film, but I must say, of course, that, as any other director, he put his own film-making style on it! Is it good, is it bad, is it too damn gory and bloody?... Opinions change with each people's perspective and taste. I think he does his job as he knows and as he likes to do it, and in my perspective it's not that bad, and certainly it is not the ""worse remake in history"", as a previous user wrote! I think this film follows the typical cinematography of the 70's/80's slasher (kind of deaths used, the teen couples, deaths during or after they have sex, etc), so just because of that it can't be so bad, or so out of context from the original film. If it exaggerates a bit in the blood used during the death scenes, probably it does, but what the hell, it's a slasher movie!

114,EijnarAmadeus,Could have been worse; a bloody rush Halloween is.,4,10 November 2007,"Rob Zombie reruns the Halloween classic giving us more insight at Michael Myers' disturbed life; watch him cry, watch him kill and watch him kill again. Halloween (2007) is gory and brutal, it takes the tensity and thrills of the original and creates slashing and shocking scenes that becomes more disgusting than scary. The atmosphere of the movie is like a cultish, B-movish classic and although it's got a striking and convincingly dark atmosphere it almost gets too much at the end. The classic-finale with Myers returning over and over with stalking effect gets more annoying than intense, and the character-performances are all the way below average. Director Zombie fails to scare and shock, but he creates a bloody nightmare of Myers dark and haunted life as his disturbed childhood seems both believable and sad. Halloween (2007) is not a specially good movie, but it's dark and it's gory - both serving to the movie's greater good.",Halloween
115,Seth_Rogue_One,The first 50 minutes were stellar... Too bad about the rest of the film,5,30 October 2015,"In the first 50 minutes Rob Zombie does something pretty cool and interesting where he makes it more of a prequel to the classic Halloween movie that we know and love.We get to see Michael Myers as a young boy and his transgression into a full-fleshed serial killer that we saw in said film.But then after 50 minutes all original ideas goes straight out the window and the remainder of the movie is more or less a carbon copy of the original which gets old real quick.Although it's been some years since I saw it, I noticed there were multiple scenes and dialogue that was simply copied and pasted on to this new script.But what you lack in originality you can make up with... Boobs?Or at least that seem to be what Rob Zombie seem to have thought, with highly uncalled for nudity, I swear there is just one barely legal girl who doesn't get topless at least once.And unlike Jamie Lee Curtis character who was likable in the original and you really didn't want to get got by the evil Michael, here you could care less, actually initially I wondered if maybe they made the teenage girls so unlikeable just so you would be rooting for Mike, but I don't think that was the case.Not that any of the characters from the Michael Myers as a kid were particularly likable either but then we had at least a chance to see a glimpse of why he became what he became.So yeah I guess it's an alright watch if you turn it off 50 minutes in and just put on the classic John Carpenter version from there, because the ending is not good at all.The first 50 minutes gets a 7/10, the last 70 minutes a 4/10... at best.For the record I watched the 2 hour extended unrated version so perhaps some things I said (regarding every young woman except one getting topless for instance) does not ring true with the 109 minute theatrical release, still with that cut out I can't see it being that much better.",Halloween

I enjoyed this movie when it first came out but revisiting it showed its flaws.The first half was a bit too long and I didn't feel too much for Michael. I'm surprised by the artistic direction that Rob Zombie took by having Michael kill his bully before his sister. The bully's death was much more emotional and actually a bit hard to watch.The second half goes much faster and deaths are more satisfying. Rob Zombie really lets his artistic style shine. Homages to the original 1978 Halloween murders was well appreciated.One part that unsettled me was the direction taken with Dr. Lumis.

117,Superunknovvn,One giant failure,4,15 January 2008,"When I heard that Rob Zombie had been chosen to remake ""Halloween"" I thought it was an interesting pick. Interesting as in wrong and not suited for this kind of project, but, hey, maybe that was exactly what was needed: someone who had a completely different approach to the story of a man we've all come to know so well since 1978 (why they didn't just wait one more year for the remake to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the franchise, God only knows). So, was Zombie the right choice? Nah!Personally, I'm not a big fan of anything the man has made up until this point. Each of his previous movies has been an incoherent and chaotic mess. Zombie thinks foul language, twisted story lines and perverted freaks make for a scary horror movie. Well, not in my book, they don't. You can tell that for the remake of ""Halloween"" Zombie was trying to restrain himself, but his ""style"" still shines through. Worse still, his obvious weaknesses in writing dialog and making his actors play naturally become apparent in a story as dependent on suspense and likable characters as this one.The whole idea of making this movie part prequel, part remake of the original is stupid. It seems like the craziest overestimation of a movie's capabilities since Sam Raimi decided to have three villains in one ""Spider-Man"" movie. There's just no way this whole story can be told within one motion picture. Besides, who ever really wanted to see Michael's origins? What made Michael Myers so scary in the first place was that he was an evil, dehumanized monster. Getting to know him means taking away half of his appeal.Of course, it's hard to make a ""Halloween"" movie in 2007 and still surprise an audience that has seen this kind of movie countless times by now. Then again, no one forced Dimension to green-light this project in the first place. It has just been a bad idea all along and the outcome isn't even good enough to be a throwaway, by-the-numbers slasher-flick, let alone a remake of the mighty ""Halloween"".Rob Zombie is to blame most of all. He turned all the characters into Southern rednecks who curse, f..k and drink 24/7. Michael Myers himself is now a long haired metal-head (who listened to KISS in the 70's because... THEY WERE MASKED! Isn't that a great analogy?). In this version of ""Halloween"" Laurie is a faceless heroine who is every bit as foul-mouthed as her bitchy friends. And Dr. Loomis - well, Malcom McDowell does his best, but Donald Pleasence owned this role and there's not one scene in which it isn't apparent that Pleasence could have done the job ten times better.McDowell is still the shining light in this ensemble. Most of the cast doesn't do as well as him, most notably the ""teenage"" girls, but maybe they're not to blame for the horribly contrived dialog they have to recite. Then there are names like Brad Dourif, William Forsythe or Udo Kier - all very cool actors, but what purpose do they serve here in roles that mostly don't have any significance at all? It's typically Zombie to throw together people and ideas like that and hope that the sum of all he thinks is cool will be bigger than the individual parts.What about the death scenes? Well, they are as trite as they come. There's not one original kill in the movie and some deaths have simply been lifted from the original and repeated with more blood and less tension. Add to that more than a few obvious continuity errors and some scenes that are downright laughable (for instance, when young Michael tapes his sleeping stepfather to a chair and the guy doesn't even wake up) and you got yourself one of the messiest horror movies of the year.I like Rob Zombie for his passion about horror movies, but let's face it: the guy isn't a good director. He was given a great opportunity here and he messed it up. ""Halloween"" is one giant failure and an indicator for Zombie that maybe it would be better for him to give up making movies.",Halloween
118,Geeky Randy,"A ""Halloween"" with a touch of depth.",8,13 February 2010,"Zombie delivers a satisfying installment, which is actually a mixture of both remake and reboot. The film becomes an in-depth look at Michael Myers, from a child to a monster. The middle of the film is almost a shot-for-shot remake of the 1978 film, à la the remake of ""Psycho"", except it actually works in this film. The history of Michael Myers is tied up neatly in a nice little package, instead of plot-device after plot-device like the old series ended up doing. Where the film falls short is an unnecessary outdrawn ending, which makes the actual remake section of the film look like the middle child of three films crunched into one. As usual, Zombie doesn't disappoint in the gore or scare department, but things become a bit of overkill as the film nears the conclusion. Not ""overkill"" as in that it goes too far, but rather ""overkill"" in that the violence and scares become so repetitive that you become immune to it by the film's end.

119,DarthVoorhees,Is Carpenter going to be pleased? No but Zombie has his moments,8,3 September 2007,"Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake harmed the horror genre in a huge way. Now no film was untouchable for the remake. Two years ago if I was asked if Halloween would be remade I would say no. Carpenter's Halloween is only behind Psycho and The Exorcist in the eyes of horror film fans. The original Halloween is a classic, largely because of it's suspense.The original film was a lot of fun because of it's simplicity. In the first one we had no idea Michael had a sister and the only thing that made him tick was the thrill of the kill. Eight movies later Zombie has to work through countless back stories. Every Halloween movie has tried to create a new back story for Myers. Frankly I think Carpenter hates the character, and with good reason. Myers was simple in the original and that's what made him scary.Zombie is all most forced to create a back story for our favorite killer and he creates an interesting one. Myers is subject to a horrible family life but a believable one. Zombie creates a believable story. Myers isn't supernatural, he's a very real nightmare.Zombie plays with a back story between Dr.Sam Loomis and young Michael at Smith's Grove sanitarium. It works somewhat but Michael was intended to be silent after the murders. There are still traces of humanity in the young boy after he brutally murders his family. Scenes with Loomis hugging Michael take away from the story. There is an interesting subplot though with Michael spending all of his hours making masks.The gore is relatively tame which is surprising for Zombie.If you can handle Hostel or Saw you can go into Halloween and have no trouble keeping in your popcorn. I walked in expecting pornographic gore but Zombie relies on suspenseful moments like Carpenter. Michael hides in the shadows and pops out at you in fun ways.Halloween's strongest asset though is Malcolm McDowell as Sam Loomis. I couldn't think of better casting. He delivers the lines in ways that would make good ol Donald Pleasence crack a smile. They put in a new interesting spin on the character which makes him more of an iffy character who may see opportunity in the matter to advance his career. Brad Doruif delivers a great performance as well. He is still as talented as ever.Fans of the original may be disappointed,it's not a faithful adaption but if you are looking for a re spin on the classic story check it out.",Halloween
120,acidburn-10,Not as great as the original but worth watching,6,1 April 2008,"When I first heard that they were remaking the original Halloween movie I thought that it was gonna be a disaster waiting to happen, I mean why mess around with such an all time classic and why not just make another sequel to follow on from part 8. But as time went by I started warming to idea and was interested in what Rob Zombie's vision had to offer and at first I disliked it but after watching it a 2nd time I actually quite enjoyed it, although it's not as great as the original but it was still worth watching.At first I didn't appreciate at how different this movie was to the original, like showing Michael Myers as a child growing up and showing his white trash family as opposed to a normal family, but now I warmed to it, I mean okay in my opinion showing Michael Myers as a child growing up did take away the scariness of the character, but then I found it interesting although it did happen rather quickly and it was quite unbelievable and I would have preferred that Michael Myers's family was a normal all American family, but this family was actually quite funny and Michael did have a touching bond with his mother and his baby sister Laurie and the scene when he's holding his baby sister while waiting outside for his mother was quite moving despite the fact that he murdered most of his family. Another fact that I wasn't all that pleased with was swearing I mean it wasn't really that necessary and takes away the serious tone of the movie, even when it fast forwards to the present day when it shows Laurie all grown up and with her friends, I mean the way they talk to other and plus with her parents I mean it is highly unlikely. The things that I liked about this remake is that they upped the gore ante and the body count which is always a pleasing factor in my opinion and bringing back Danielle Harris who played Jamie in parts 4 and 5, even though she wasn't playing the main character which I bet is a bit of a come down for her.The acting Malcolm McDowell (Dr Sam Loomis) a great actor, but I found his portrayal of Sam Loomis quite robotic and surviving bad wigs while channelling Donald Pleasance now and again. But was it me or did he throw away his performance during the bulk of the last block. Tyler Mane (Michael Myers) nailed it! Imposing, somber while emulating the token Myers moves we all love perfectly. He was a wrecking machine! When the script wasn't playing against him. Daeg Faerch (Young Michael Myers) played his part well, his role as the young up and coming serial killer was moving and plus his scenes when he's sent away to the mental hospital was handled brilliantly. Sheri Moon (Michael's mother) was the best female part in this movie, she played the slut with a heart, I don't why her acting gets slagged off so much I thought her part as Michael's mother was brilliant and her scenes with Michael well she nailed it and it was tragic when it came her end. Scout Taylor Compton (Laurie) although just as great as Jamie Lee Curtis but she was cute and screamed well and I did find her a bit wimpy and Danielle Harris (Annie Brackett) like I said before a right comedown from playing a lead part to being just being teen fodder, and it would have been interesting to have seen her play the Laurie part.All in all it was interesting to see Halloween through somebody else's vision but it didn't compare to the original, not that it's a bad movie and is actually better than some of the Halloween sequels.",Halloween
121,DonFishies,"Entertaining enough, but Zombie could have done so much more with it",6,20 December 2007,"Michael Myers is part of the official horror cannon of intriguing slashers that became somewhat tired and ridiculous after more than a handful of sequels. While I have never really gotten into any of the Halloween films (including John Carpenter's pioneering original), I am not one to miss what everyone would assume is an atrocious remake. And while Rob Zombie has had moderate success with his House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects films (which I have also yet to see in their entirety), I was willing to give him a shot based on the very little Halloween knowledge I did have.As a youngster, Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) is not getting along too well with everyone else. He is ostracized and bullied by his classmates and members of his own family, and is almost forced to live life behind a mask. On Halloween sure enough, he kills the majority of his family, leaving only his baby sister and working mother alive. He is sent to live in an asylum, where Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) attempts to treat him to no avail. After Loomis finally leaves the case fifteen years later, he leaves Myers (now Tyler Mane) to his own devices. And breaking out and looking for his sister Laurie (now Scout Taylor-Compton) just may be the best of options for him.Having not seen the original, I cannot really compare the key plot points between both. But much like the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre films and Freddy vs. Jason, Myers is portrayed as just a misunderstood individual who takes his problems out on people by killing them. Yes, Zombie effectively makes him out to be a monster in more than a handful of scenes, but at other times, he just looks like a hairy giant, lacking any real desire to do anything with himself but repent and make paper-mâché masks for himself. There seems to be plenty of reasoning for Myers quietly going insane, but it seems baffled for logic as to why no one really tried to stop him. We see and hear about Myers brutally killing animals, and we see him quietly in solitude making masks, but never once does any character really set out to do anything about it. They just, let him do it. If you knew you had a potential psychopath on your hands, I doubt you would just let him sit and make masks all day to his heart's content.What Zombie also fails to do is give more credibility and character development to anyone other than Myers. We know all about him, and his slow fall into criminal insanity, but we never get a true grip on any other character in the film. Sure, we know that Laurie is his unknowing sister, and we know her friends are sex-craved stereotypical teenagers, but that is all we know about them. We know that Loomis wants to help Myers, and he makes a book about the ordeal, but nothing much else. It seems like Zombie wanted to flesh out Myers as far as he possibly could without descending into mediocrity, but he left everyone else to just deliver a few lines, and then get stabbed or run away screaming. I know that horror is the last genre anyone can hope for character developments in, but if Zombie is going to put that much effort into Myers, he may as well have explored a few of the other characters a bit more before facing them off against the killer.The actual horror elements of the film are a bit hit and miss. There are some fairly horrific scenes, but never anything that is truly frightening. Whether this is because the film seems tame in comparison to the near no-holds barred depravity of a Saw film (or even Zombie's first two plunges into horror), or just because the interlude between child Myers murdering his family and adult Myers breaking out and going on a killing rampage is unclear. It just seems like there are a few attempts, but none that are truly successful at being terrifying or frightening enough to make the audience scared. Although I am sure some of the sequences and near-excessive gore (with a little too much emphasis on black bile in a few cases) will disgust more than a few people. I liked what Zombie was doing with some the visuals, and how interesting he made many of the scenes (like the murders of Myers' family early in the film), but it never seems like he goes all the way with a lot of them. It looks like he may push the envelope, and then he does not do it (or leaves the film to meander along blindly for minutes on end, including the lengthy ending). I think he could have stretched himself a little more in those cases. I would have liked a little bit more creativity in some of the deaths as well (although I was fairly impressed by how much nudity he got away with before, during and after some of the kills), but I assume that Zombie was being a little closer to the original in most of those cases.While the storyline is a little mixed, the acting is not too horrendous. Mane is great as Myers, giving off just the right amount of brooding horror this character needs. His mute actions and reactions throughout the film are fairly astonishing, but could have been helped a lot more by some added sequencing. McDowell and Taylor-Compton do the best they can with their characters, and manage to exhibit some greatness that is missing from Zombie's script. The rest of the supporting cast is fairly one note, although it was amusing to see the usual Zombie crew show up in small roles.While it is not nearly perfect, Halloween is entertaining enough as a horror film. I just wish Zombie did a little more with it.6/10.",Halloween
122,innocuous,Always nice to see William Forsythe working....,4,10 March 2008,"Any movie that employs William Forsythe gets an extra point from me. And even though he's actually about 52 years old, he gets to shack up with a hot young stripper in this film. There IS justice in the world....Other than that, this movie is typical over-the-top Rob Zombie. Never pass up a chance to be obvious about something when subtlety might have served.Zombie adds a lot of extra scenes, characters, and back-story that contribute nothing to the film. It is a disgrace. Trust the other reviewers on IMDb and stick with the original.BTW, the final denouement between Loomis and Michael is a total waste and doesn't work nearly as well as in the original movie.",Halloween

Halloween (1978) is a masterpiece, Halloween (2007) is just an entertaining production with gore. The first half hour show us an interesting looking to Michael Myers' childhood, but later we watch a remake with some changes and nostalgia. Malcom McDowell is an amazing actor but Dr. Sam Loomis is for Donald Pleasence only, McDowell's Loomis is a weak copy of Pleasence's acting. Scout Taylor-Compton's role is good but Laurie Strode is for Jamie Lee Curtis. Danielle Harris return to the franchise is good, also there is a lot of horror stars around: Brad Dourif, Danny Trejo, Dee Wallace-Stone, Ken Foree, among others. The production design is good, that is the best of the film. Not amazing but funny. A gave a 10 for nostalgia to the original film.",Halloween
124,TalesfromTheCryptfan,Quite a nice revamp of the series!,8,13 August 2009,"Seventeen years ago, a young boy named Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) had a dysfunctional family. His stepfather Ronnie (William Forsyth) is a drunk redneck who is quite abusive, the mother Debroah (Sherri Zombie) is a sexy stripper, a stepsister named Judith (Hannah Hall) and a baby sister named Laurie. His behavior has gotten rotten and dismal such as killing animals and even murdered a few school bullies secretly, but on Halloween night he did brutally murdered his big stepsister and boyfriend including Ronnie creating one of the most brutal mass murders the town of Haddonfield has ever known. He is taken to a psychiatric ward and under daily care by Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcom Mcdowell), years later adult Michael (Tyler Mane) has an obsession with masks and remains silent for years but has became large and strong. He escapes from the ward to go back to his hometown including his long lost sister Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) as he kills anyone that gets in his way as Loomis is on the verge to destroy him.Exciting revamp of the series by Rob Zombie who is a long time fan of the first two original movies! When a remake of the 1978 landmark masterpiece was announced, people cried blasphemy but then Rob Zombie took the job as writer-director as i think he saved the series after the embarrassing ""Halloween Resurrection"". After his underrated misunderstood ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and brilliant ""Devil's Rejects"", Zombie decided to give a unique and fresh back story on Michael Myers as the film works as both a remake/prequel at the same time that honors the first two John Carpenter Halloween movies. Although Zombie had no intention to make this a shot-to-shot remake like 1998's horrible ""Psycho"" remake and thank god for that, the film does co-star Ken Foree (""Dawn of the Dead""), Brad Douriff, Clint Howard, Dee Wallace Stone, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Sybil Danning (From the original) and Udo Kier. I like how Zombie throws in a small history on Michael's psyche and his family, some fans are disgusted on the idea that Michael has a trashy ""Married With Children""-esquire family in this version.The film does offer some pretty gruesome scenes of gore and violence as it could be the goriest Halloween film since 1981's part 2 or 1988's part 4. Danielle Harris from Halloweens 4 and 5 even does a supporting role in this movie as one of Laurie's friends, although it does misses out on the psychological terror of the original but goes more to the bloody stabbing violence of the original movie's sequels and some action.It may not replace Carpenter's brilliant masterpiece but it's not the intention it's just a fun gory ride through madness, the sequel should be superior.",Halloween
125,jlthornb51,Sadist Zombie's Version Is Torture Porn,2,10 July 2015,"The original Halloween is a truly iconic horror film. It is one of the most remarkable motion picture terror treats ever made but it had heart, charm, and magic. Carpenter captured the spirit and atmosphere of the Halloween of childhoods past. There was a sense of real holiday fun. All that is missing from Mr. Zombie's sadistic, tasteless effort to re-imagine the classic. His camera lingers disturbingly long during scenes of female brutalization. Basically, he writes poorly and directs with a sledge hammer. There is little of the subtlety or sensitively observed elements that distinguished John Carpenter's Halloween. What was a beautifully realized story has become nothing more than a gross monster movie and the result is humdrum yet sick. The original swept one up in a mysterious world of utter mayhem and terror. This is just blood, guts, and gore and little else.",Halloween
126,WriterDave,Dreary Rehash from Zombie,5,11 February 2008,"*The following is a review of the unrated director's cut: Say what you will, but Rob Zombie is a director of considerable technical talent who knows how to frame tension-filled scenes, utilizes rock music as another character in his films, and shock audiences with his juxtaposition of pristinely photographed shots and extreme quick-cuts of brutality. Why he would decide to do a remake of the original ""Halloween"" is anyone's guess. Granted his original works have been far from masterpieces, but with such innate skill, one wonders what Zombie would be able accomplish as a for-hire genre director. Instead he continues to wallow in the muck of the horror film gutter and debase his audiences through the display of his own sick obsessions.The actual remake portion of the film (the last 45 minutes) is fairly well done and probably would've worked had Zombie not made the three teenage girls stalked by Michael Myers such annoying and unsympathetic characters. The ""chase"" scenes are well staged and Zombie throws in some decent scenarios not found in the original. The climax is an entertaining combination of classic 80's style horror where you are screaming at the female lead for being so stupid and modern horror grisliness where you feel sick to your stomach after enduring it.Zombie leads up to this with 45 minutes of wildly offensive exposition giving us details on Michael Myers' life we never cared to know. Part of the thrill of the original was the mystery behind Myers' insanity. Zombie plays up the ""tortured childhood"" aspect in his signature white-trash-nightmare style and makes the adult Myers too superhuman to be truly feared. It's a calculated gamble to add this new layer, and it doesn't pay off. In the end, ""Halloween"" is perfectly watchable for horror buffs, but why would anyone waste their time with Zombie's monster of a movie when they could just sit down with the original?",Halloween
127,LoneWolfAndCub,As a remake; bad. As a stand-alone film; not as bad.,6,16 April 2008,"I really don't know what to say after seeing this. It has been a long time but I have finally seen the remake of one my favourite horror films. When I first heard about this I was shocked, how dare they remake Halloween of all movies!! This is one of those times where the original was perfect in every way and a remake would just be a waste of space. However, upon hearing Rob Zombie would direct, my interest peaked. I have respect for the man, I enjoyed both of his previous works; 'House of 1000 Corpses' and 'The Devil's Rejects.' Unfortunately, I never got to see it in the cinema as it was slapped with an R18+ rating. But I took a trip down to the local video store and rented a copy this morning and popped it in. The first 40 minutes had their pros and cons, I thought it was done quite well actually. The last half of the movie, though, was a rushed mess and really brought it down.Personally, I did not mind the fact that Zombie added a lengthy back story about Michael's past, I thought it was at least a fresh take and that he tried something a bit different. On saying that, I thought the white-trash thing was stupid and it really did not make me feel sorry for most of his family he killed. Also, having us see his face from the start took away the mystery, therefore killing the suspense and horror for the rest of the movie. The proceeding parts at Smith's Grove were also pretty good (although the rape scene was totally unnecessary and it seemed was just there for shock value). And I thought Sheri Moon Zombie was surprisingly good as Myer's mother.Fifteen years later, when Myers escapes, the film starts to go downhill. Everything seemed rushed, there was nil development for Laurie, Annie or Lynda (not that there was heaps in the original) and zero scares. This part of the movie could have shined but it felt like Zombie just wanted to finish it.I found it interesting that in the first 40 minutes the body count was almost double the originals. I felt some of the deaths were unnecessary (especially the Strode's deaths) and were just there for a large body count. I have to admit, a few of the deaths were brutal and had me squirming a little. As expected, there was some nice female bodies present (Danielle Harris anyone!). It was a smart move to keep John Carpenter's original score and another smart idea to bring many famous horror faces into the picture. Danny Trejo, Ken Foree, Dee Wallace, Brad Dourif, Sid Haig and Leslie Easterbrook are a few famous faces that appear.Now, let me get this clear, I have the utmost respect for Carpenter's original and as a remake of it, this fails in a lot of areas. It isn't scary, there is zero suspense, Myers isn't interesting anymore and none of the characters are that like-able. As a stand-along slasher I thought it was quite good though, with a decent story, a high body count with plenty of blood, some boobies and some good acting from the supporting parts (Scout Taylor-Compton was pretty bad).So, as a remake I would give it 4/10 and as a stand-alone a 7/10. This averages out to a 5.5/10 and rounding up for IMDb a 6/10.",Halloween
128,LazySod,Not really related to the original,7,13 November 2007,"29 years after the first Halloween film was released the title returns to the cinema. Neither remake, nor prequel, nor sequel, but instead a film with many elements of the original one and just as many new elements that make it different. This makes for some interesting results in the opinion of people of this film. The people that are expecting a true remake will hate this one as it includes so many differences. The people that are expecting something entirely new will not like this one either as it still uses quite a lot of the things that made the first film so good. So, the best audience for this film are the people that have never seen the original series or that have seen it and are able to look past the comparison.Just like the original film this one is a slash and dice horror film where a maniac killer explores the world wielding a sharp knife and a bad temper. Unlike the first film the background of the killer is clearly explored and we get to know him to some extent making him more human than ever. His victims however are more expendable as we hardly get to know them at all. This makes them far less interesting and much harder to feel sorry for. The killing style is better though and not entirely unbelievable.All in all, Michael Meyers might not be back yet, but he sure did find a nice friend that happens to share his name and liking for butchery.7 out of 10 masked maniacs",Halloween
129,suspiria10,S10 Review's Halloween (2007),6,31 August 2007,"Michael Myers returns to the stalk-and-slash game with this highly controversial and anticipated re-imagining of the much beloved 1978 version of Halloween.I ventured into a midnight showing thinking I pretty much knew what to expect. Or did I? I was one of the chuckleheads who saw the work-print on Tuesday night. What I saw in the work-print had a lot of promise. It needed the usual pacing edits and a half dozen or so pick-ups to round out the action.Flash forward to Thursday night / Friday morning and a promising start with a wicked 'The Mist' trailer I hunkered down for the nest two hours. I knew there were changes. A new ending and the removal of the rape scene seemed to be the most mentioned. As things started to unfold my interest started to pick up when many of the thinks I had noted from the work-print were tweaked and snipped making it leaner and meaner. The fairly nasty rape scene that lead to Michael's escape was replaced by a more likely scenario (hell more screen time for Bill Mosely is always welcome). The pace gets tightened and it moves quicker. A few bobbles here and there. The nurse getting slaughtered scene while properly shortened took away some of the long version's creepiness. But nothing too severe and tension was even added to several scenes whereas the work-print had absolutely no scares at all. All the way to the final ten minutes I thought 'Rob you're doing a heck of a job here considering the baggage you have to overcome'. Then it happensthe new 'test audience' approved ending begins to unreel. Gone was Dr. Loomis coaxing Michael to spare his sister's life and when the smoke clears of a dozen police officers bullets hits a dead Michael Myers lay amongst with his doctor shedding a quiet tear over him. Now we are treated to an absolutely ludicrous extended hunt scene that has Michael literally bringing down the house in search of Laurie. Needless to say by the time the credits rolled in the space of ten or so minutes my jubilation had turn to disgust. I may put too much stock in endings but sometimes you have to draw a line. The whole 'test audience' thing needs to be abolished or at the very least renovated. They do not represent either the fans or the movie going public in general. I do hold the original very high it has been my favorite horror film for over twenty years and my love for 'The Devil's Rejects' and house of a 1,000 Corpses' was vast not to mention Zombie's music career. It's not Zombie's fault entirely. Most of the blame is at rest on the good old brothers Weinstein. They wanted to gear up a possible another run at a lucrative franchise. Lord knows they need it after botched nearly every release of the fledgling 'Weinstein Company'. It just amazes my some times how quickly things change. My favorite franchise has been left a smoldering husk and I think it is truly time for Michael to hang up his mask. A few producers need to call it quits too.",Halloween
130,Nightman85,"Made me cringe, mostly for the wrong reasons though.",5,31 August 2007,"Dangerous small town kid grows up to be a crazed murderer and strikes on Halloween night - but we already knew that.Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's 1978 horror classic differs greatly from the original film. Not so much in storyline, though we are given lots of back story and some new plot twists, but Zombie's film really lacks the subtle charms of the original. My main complaint here is that we aren't given a likable character in the whole movie. Let's face it, if you can't even like the 'good guys' who are we afraid for here? The characters in this remake are so thinly-written, unrealistic, and obnoxious (I'm not even referring to the villains here) that they severely weaken the films impact. However maybe you won't notice that with all the gore and sex that's thrown in.Though granted I've never been overly impressed by Zombie's films, and this one is no exception, I will still give him props because I personally like the guy (he has great taste in films and I love to see him host TCM Underground) and this was an amusing 're-imagining' even with its flaws. Cast-wise the performances are very uneven, Sheri Moon Zombie is probably the best as the mother of Michael Myers. It's nice to see such familiar faces as Malcolm McDowell, Brad Dourif, Dee Wallace, Ken Foree, and Udo Kier in the cast.So horror fans, if you dig the Z man - you'll probably get behind this remake. However, myself being a die-hard Carpenter fan, I can't really give this much more praise than I would an average slasher flick.** out of ****",Halloween
131,Aylmer,another uncalled-for remake,3,30 October 2009,"The only, and I mean ONLY reason to watch this dull and unengaging horror movie is to play ""spot the cameo"". This movie has literally more random B-horror movie actor cameos than any other I've seen, and that includes DEVIL'S REJECTS, a much more entertaining but similarly quite underwhelming film. Just look at the list; Ken Foree, Dee Wallace, Richard Lynch, Mickey Dolenz, Sybil Danning, Danny Trejo, Udo Kier (!?), Sid Haig, William Forsythe, Clint Howard (!!!), etc etc etc. All of them horror icons that I love, but now I have to call that affection into question based on their poor judgement skills if they actually read the script prior to signing on.This film is a remake of one which easily has it beat by at least 100x, begging the question why this needed to be made (or watched) in the first place. What this film does in spades is make the original look like Hitchcock in comparison, as Carpenter was able to do so much more and to much greater effect with so much less. In fact, it takes this movie about an HOUR to get where Carpenter's got in 5 minutes thanks to Zombie bloating the prologue with too much unnecessary exposition. Add to that, this movie just doesn't end either. By the time we're at the climax, we're just checking our watches.What hurts to see is that Zombie's heart is definitely in the right place. He seems to love classic horror films and idolizes the same 70's horror icons as I do. However, he has absolutely no talent as a director. Zero. At no point in this film does it ever seem like more than just a series of images and sounds that have little to do with each other. The dialog comes off as flat, the characters cardboard, and the murders by-the-book, uncreative, and so common that they actually get boring. You know it's bad when you find yourself yawning through a central character getting stabbed to death.",Halloween
132,lareval,Best Halloween movie since the original,6,6 October 2021,"It's bold, unique and extremely gore. While it's not really great, it manages to be actually good and worthy of being a good homage from the original. Really good remake!",Halloween
133,ClaytonDavis,Michael is human after all...,4,8 October 2007,"Writer/Director Rob Zombie brings to audiences a reinvented Michael Myers, quite different from what we have known. Halloween is the remake of the 1978 film of the same title starring Malcolm McDowell as ""Dr. Sam Loomis"" and new ""scream queen"" Scout Taylor-Compton as ""Laurie Strode."" The film brings a completely different perspective to the franchise which we have grown to love. Zombie gives us a thorough back story to ""Michael"" which John Carpenter never gave us. We see him walking, talking, and being a real child making him more human than a question mark. Zombie humanizes ""Myers"" completely and gives the viewer some strong sympathy for him. But I'm afraid the film on the cinematic level fails on many occasions.McDowell possesses much of the charm that Donald Pleasance brought to his role nearly 30 years ago but the role is underplayed and underwritten. ""Dr. Loomis"" doesn't have the same fear or awkwardness for Myers as we've seen in the previous films. Taylor-Compton takes the ""scream queen"" to an annoying level; running around, screaming, falling through ceilings and just irritating the audience every chance she gets. Taylor never gets Jamie Lee Curtis' role down rather than just play the A-typical bimbo role of the girl running in stupid directions.Tyler Mane who plays the adult Michael Myers doesn't have to do much rather than just be his large 6""8 stature and walk around. The youthful ""Michael"" played by Daeg Faerch is the most interesting aspect of the film giving us understanding of his psychotic tendencies. ""Michael"" kills twice as much people, gives us twice as much gore, and divides the scare factor in half.Halloween is an experience for a horror movie fan to involve themselves in but it's disappointing as a film in general. Zombie's previous films House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects finds more warmth and personality. At least the creativity was present in those genre films.Grade: **/****",Halloween
134,baileycrawly,A Worthy Retelling (Director's Cut),8,13 May 2020,"Rob Zombie brings us a modernization of John Carpenter's 1978 horror classic ""Halloween."" A troubled boy named Michael Myers is sent to a mental hospital after his psyche breaks and he commits a string of murders. Now, on Halloween night many years later, he's escaped... and he's heading home to continue his reign of terror.This will be a majorly unpopular opinion but, when viewing the series for the first time, separate from any and all nostalgic ties to its predecessors, this is a solid remake. The decision by Zombie to give a degree of humanity to the character was extremely well done and added not only a motive, but a reason to care about the character. John Carpenter may have given us a man in a Captain Spock mask, but Rob Zombie gave us a troubled child from an unfortunate home circumstance that ended up getting his revenge in a deadly way, something that may, perhaps, strike a little too close to home in a country known for its frequent acts of senseless violence.The first 45 minutes of this film are devoted to the back story, something the original film could've done much better by including.From that point on, however, we're treated to an essential shot-for-shot remake of the original, with a few changes but not enough to constitute total originality on Zombie's part. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing; the pieces all fit together better and the story is much more engaging and entertaining when you can see where Michael's character came from, what he endured and what made him out to be the way he is.(Major Unpopular Opinion Alert): Malcolm McDowell (of A Clockwork Orange fame) was the best choice for Dr. Loomis, giving a better performance than his predecessor. The scenes with Dr. Loomis felt more genuine in this version, and it was more of a character you believed truly cared about his work. Then, you have the always fabulous Dee Wallace stepping in as Laurie Strode's (new Scout Taylor-Comption, one of the only down sides to the remake) adoptive mother, and you even have an appearance from Brad Dourif (of Chucky fame), which alone constitutes 3 of my favorite people in 1 fantastic film.If anything, this film loses its 10/10 for 2 reasons: the second part of the film is definitely weaker, because it's the point at which Zombie goes from telling an original spin on the classic story to the point at which he must follow the dots to reach his destination. It gets formulaic and quickly merges with the original film. Were it not for those first 45 minutes of the film, this would've been an extremely bland, generic remake. The second star is lost because our Laurie Strode just isn't the same as Jamie Lee Curtis. Halloween has the distinct fortune of being a mute serial killer; you can put anybody behind the mask. The leading lady, however, isn't so easy to replace.Overall, this isn't a perfect movie. It has its ups and downs but, as was stated earlier, for someone watching this franchise for the first time with absolutely no prior attachment to or nostalgic value behind any of the films, this is easily a superior telling of the original story. It may be an unpopular opinion, but it's my honest opinion.",Halloween
135,mcfly-31,Zombie-fied garbage...,2,4 September 2007,"I pass on most remakes these days, as they're usually of forgettable junk that wasn't worth an original. But just the mention of ""Halloween"", evokes the beginning of a genre that's still running strong 30 years later. Unfortunately, overrated hairball Zombie has made this re-rendering look like one of the many slasher knock-offs from the 1980s.Populated by unsavory and obnoxious characters, I swear to you not one --- not one! -- character did I care ANYTHING about, if they lived, died, screwed, puked. Nothing. An insulting barrage of tasteless, endless dialogue throughout, involving verbal abuse, put-downs, and unrealistic references by 12-year-olds of semen being pumped from a female stomach. Eye-roller to the extreme from Zombie's screenplay.And I was constantly griping at the screen as to what time period this takes place in. 70s music and fashions abound, but then there are cell phones and racey, F-bomb laced dialogue uncharacteristic of any time period. I know we have trash-can mouths in the world, but this was stunningly excessive. Early 90s? Late 70s? Got me.His main approach, though, falls even flatter, as he tried to expand on the origin that is Michael Myers. This leads to an overextended 45-minute trailer trash sequence of events, that just come off more embarrassing than engrossing. Finally, Zombie arrives at the point where Myers is an adult, but then must shoehorn a majority of the original film into the final 45 minutes here. This leads to a rushed middle portion, completely lacking in suspense or tension. Only to be finished with an ending that had absolutely no direction and went on forever.As far as technical aspects, a real mess there as well. CONSTANT dramamine, shaky-cam moments, totally telegraphed kills (old and young Myers is ALWAYS shown in the background), and grating performances that annoy. McDowell as Loomis comes off the worst, with Donald Pleasance towering high over his understudy. Taylor-Compton a near-unbearable Laurie Strode, with her nerd-girl appearance and valley girl line readings. Plus other cookie cutter bimbo-sluts who we care nary an iota about. Sadly, one is a good inside-reference in Danielle Harris, the kid-actress of Halloween's 4 and 5, here playing a convincing teen at the age of 30. Well, appearance wise. Performance wise, kinda stiff, and that's not a pun intended considering her lengthy topless scene, mostly covered in blood.Biggest of all are the Myers actors, the first a pudgy, stringy-haired brat who brings an uncomfortability in watching him hack up a bunch of loutish wrong-doers in his life. Then, as an adult, Myers annoyingly resembling wrestling's The Undertaker, with spaghetti-strand blond locks hiding his mug. Plus the implausible fact that, though lying motionless for years in a nuthouse, he has the power to tear through walls and withstand gunshots.After reading the above you get the impression as to why this was not a fun-to-be-scared horror experience, but more of an exercise in viewer distractions to be counted. I coil in fear at the thought of Michael Bay's ""Friday the 13th"" remake due out next year. Lord, help us.",Halloween

137,PedroPires90,Different but good approach,7,13 October 2021,"Rewatching all the franchise, I can now compare this with all the other films and it is curious that this film works much better when it does something totally different, when it's not ""so Halloween"".The first half of the film is fantastic. It's more like a thriller, a violent thriller. The second half starts well but it goes too far in the very ending (in fact, I'm not the biggest fan of films with multiple endings).Either way, this is never a bad film. It's a totally different approach to the characters and story and I really like that (hate remakes shot by shot). It's much more violent, more brutal, more raw. It's less suspenseful, less atmospheric, less mysterious. Above all, it's different, but still good and much better than most of the sequels.As positive notes, the ""why Laurie?"" works much better than in the original version, overall the acting is also way better, Loomis is as good as the first one (if something, even more credible here) and all that part at the hospital is fantastic. Negative...well, Laurie, unfortunately, is much less charismatic than the original one (the film is also much more about MM), the film sometimes feels too heavy and too long and and the score - still a masterpiece - is worse used, not creating the same level of suspense.",Halloween
138,Rautus,Another remake that can't beat the original,5,30 April 2008,"Today practically every classic horror movie from the 70's or 80's is being remade into a modern movie, half of the time they fail mainly because they lack the style that made the original a classic. When I first saw the trailer for Rob Zombie's Halloween I was excited, I thought surly it couldn't be has bad as Halloween: Resurrection. When it came out on DVD I decided to buy it and although it's a little bit of an improvement over Halloween: Resurrection it's still a lack-luster remake of a classic. John Carpenter's Halloween is one of the greatest horror movies ever made, it was full of suspense, had a creepy music score, a terrifying killer and likable characters. Another interesting thing is that unlike other slasher movies John Carpenter's Halloween didn't have any gore, the film focused on tension rather than blood and guts. The remake however is the complete opposite of the original movie but like Rob Zombie said what's the point of making a shot to shot remake of a movie that already exists. Rob Zombie's Halloween starts out more like a prequel than a remake since it shows a young Michael Myers becoming a killer, it was interesting to see how it happened but it feels kind of unoriginal, he's bullied, got an abusive step-father and sister. It feels kind of cliché, Norman Bates became a killer because of his mother the same with Billy and Frank Zito, Jason Voorhees kills to avenge his mother and Leatherface kills because his family tells him to. It's always the parents, someone in the family or bullies that turns them into a killer. In the original it never really explained why Michael Myers killed people, Dr Sam Loomis would just say that Michael was pure evil.Another thing Micheal's family seem like white trash, I don't recall his family looking like trash when he's mother and father saw him with the clown costume and knife in the original. The dialogue in this movie seems a bit extreme too, practically all of the teenage characters talk about sex. Rob Zombie's Halloween also has a load of sex scenes and gratuitous nudity that doesn't do anything to advance the plot, the whole rape scene in the asylum was a bit over the top. Another thing that makes this film different is that the characters are unlikable, Laurie Strode was a shy teenager that liked to study and did babysitting. Here she's turned into a typical teenager that's talks about sex and acts irritating, when she babysits Tommy she acts completely irresponsible compared to the original. Her friends in the remake are also irritating and stereotypical, the scene where the one taunts Micheal on the street is just ridiculous. In the original she said ""Hey jerk, speed kills."" In this one the teenager just talks like a slut to him. Was Rob Zombie trying to say that every person is sex crazed, the teenagers, the two rapists at the asylum, the step-father. Another thing, in the original you got attached to the characters while in this one you don't. You want Michael Myers to kill them so we don't have to look and hear from them anymore, I don't recall ever wanting The Shape to kill Laurie Strode in John Carpenter's Halloween but in Rob Zombie's Halloween I did want him to kill her. Unlike the original this film doesn't have any suspense or tension, since we've seen Michael has a child and then an adult we don't get that tension. In the original you didn't really know much about or see him fully until later in the movie so that gave the character a bit of mystery, the same thing was with the remake of Black Christmas. Because you see Billy's back story the character loses that scariness and the same goes with this film. The only good points to this film was Michael Myers, the new look for the mask did look kind of cool, the gore and seeing him kill those teenagers. Rob Zombie's Halloween is nowhere near as classic as John Carpenter's Halloween, if you're curious to see the back story of Michael Myers and a different take to the original film than go ahead and see it but if not, go watch John Carpenter's Halloween which is far superior.",Halloween
139,kirk-246,Not for the faint of heart,8,2 May 2009,"I am a huge fan of the Halloween series and when I heard that Rob Zombie was doing a remake,Icouldn't believe it.I went to see it the first day it came out and it was a blast!!!!!!!!!some scenes were jaw dropping in a sadistic and violent kind of way.Of course I'm 13 years old and if you've seen it, then you should know how inappropriate it is for people my age.But that is one of the reasons why I loved this movie.Rob Zombie succeeds at paying homage to the original 1978 John Carpenter classic.But I suggest that you watch the uncut version.It's much better than the original version.Overall,I highly recommend this film for people who love horror.7.8/10",Halloween

I actually live just blocks from that tree-lined street. Seeing it on film, seeing them walk down that street gave the film sort of a cozy, welcoming atmosphere. You could feel the weather, smell the air. You saw the leaves blowing down the street and you almost......wanted to be there. It was that inviting. That is the allure of the original. In this remake? You want nothing to do with Michael Meyers and his white-trash family of low-lifes. He lives in a gritty, grimy, dirty hell. There is nothing inviting about this place and that is the difference here. You, hopefully, look at what is on screen and feel dirty. Also, not knowing anything about the original Michael Meyers makes him all the more mysterious. All the more curious. There is nothing curious about this film. Too bad.",Halloween
142,skybrick736,Rob Zombie's Halloween 4/10,4,21 February 2015,"Before I say anything I have to say that Rob Zombie had to be the last person I would want to remake Halloween. It's not that I don't like him as a director because I honestly do think he's a talented horror director but this movie isn't his style. He would be way better off with something along the lines of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Last House on the Left, which are already grimy and trashy. That said, I still anticipated the movie for two years before it hit the big screen, going in I was critical but surprised he managed to pull his Halloween off. The movie could have completely broken apart and become crap at many points but it was suffice throughout. The beginning was terribly rough at times and I was disappointed with Michael Myers back-story. What helped extremely was casting the likes of Malcolm McDowell, Brad Dourif, Danielle Harris and even Scout Taylor-Compton who performed well above I thought she would. There is quite a bit of Michael Myers action, the music was solid and I'm surprised I somewhat liked it.",Halloween
143,p-jonsson,Not bad at all,7,2 November 2013,"The critics are wrongagain. Well, at least as far as I am concerned. This remake is not bad at all. A lot of people are comparing it with the original which is understandable. A lot of people says that it is crap compared to the original which is not understandable. At least not by me. This is one of the movies where I have seen the original and it was even one of my favorites at the time. I think this remake holds up quite well.At first I was a bit worried that it was said to be a prequel. At least partly. However it is not really what I would call a prequel. It has a bit of extended background in the first quarter or so but that is not really what I would call a prequel.I think the movie was pretty much what I expected or perhaps I should say what I hoped for. It is a slasher-movie of course but it resists the temptation to go all overboard. Nowadays you do not really get scared or even shocked by these kinds of movies so I was not really expecting to be. I was just enjoying Michael's rampage through the town. It is of course a bit scary in itself that you are watching a madman going on a killing spree through a small town and enjoying it but hey, it is all fake! One problem with the extended background at the beginning of the movie is that now there is kind of a plot-hole that is a bit annoying. When and, more importantly, how did Michael turn from a deranged kid to a supernatural killer with the strength to carry away one ton worth of tombstone and survive being stabbed as well as shot at? Apart from that I think this movie was not bad at all. Sometimes I actually felt that Michael was behaving a bit too human like when he was stumbling when crashing through walls etc. but on the whole I quite liked this movie. The style is different from the original for sure but I do not feel it is worse or better for that matter.It is a bit surprising (well maybe not, the French are bizarre when it comes to scheduling movies and TV-shows) that Cine+ did not schedule this movie for actual Halloween instead of the crap they did show. This one would have been perfect then instead of a day after.",Halloween

Was there any reason anyone would ever need to see this when the original is so good? No! I think Rob Zombie could still have a career in movies someday. Not because his movies are good yet, but because he does have a certain amount of a good visual style. Please do not waste your money on another remake. It is because of people like those, (in the U.S. particularly, that we keep seeing these dang remakes being made over and over. I bet we see ""Halloween"" remade again in 2037. I think it is a shame that we now have to say, ""I loved THE ORIGINAL Halloween!"" NO MORE REMAKES!",Halloween
145,xamtaro,Works better as a psychological drama than a horror show,7,16 October 2009,"I have no idea why so many people complain about this remake. About humanizing Michael Myers, changing Dr Loomis's personality, etc. For heavens sake, IT IS A REMAKE! The original can not be topped that's for sure; Rob Zombie(the director) clearly admits that by taking this remake in a whole new direction instead of just rehashing what has already been done. In the original, Laurie Strode was the main character. In this remake, Michael Myers himself is the focus of the story as we trace his origins from his tortured childhood.The movie can be essentially be split into to distinct parts: Myer's childhood and incarceration at Smith's grove Sanitarium right up to his escape years later, and then the second part would be his return to Haddonfield to carry out his grizzly murders.The highlight of this whole movie for me was the first half; his tragic childhood story. Growing up in the town of Haddonfield, young Michael Myers is bullied at school, teased by his sister and continually insulted by his stripper mother's boyfriend, Ronnie. Pushed to the brink, his psychopathic tendencies finally manifest resulting first in the killing of the school bully and then his sister, her boyfriend and Ronnie on Halloween night. Michael is then placed under the care of Dr Samuel Loomis who tries unsuccessfully to ""cure"" the boy and then makes a career out of him by writing books based on Michael Myers. Following the suicide of his mother, Michael grows ever more distant and remains in Smith's Grove for the next 15 years until he escapes by murdering the employees as one of them were attempting to rape a girl. Why I liked this is how the director manages to craft a world as seen through the eyes of a killer( Reading through the other reviews, it seems that few people were able to understand this). Hate drove Michael to kill and similarly every single character, with the exception of Dr Loomis and Michael's mother, is portrayed in such a way that you just MUST hate them as much as Michael did. The girls are b1tchy, the guys are foul mouthed retards, every single character is just so easy to dislike. Aside from Michael, Dr Loomis is also given a much better character development here than in the original. He is a more sympathetic character who genuinely wants to help Michael Myers and for a while, the two actually form some sort of bond. Much better than the obsessively driven Loomis of the original.The second part involves Michael returning to Haddonfield and going on a killing rampage while searching for his long lost sister. This part is the ""horror story"" proper; very disappointing, but it depends on how you look at it. It is not scary at all; you'd know it every time Michael is about to kill someone so that takes away a lot of tension. But then again, this movie is from the killer's point of view. Michael Myers is not scared when he kills and thus neither should the audience be. On the technical side, Most of the cast do a decent job of acting their parts. Special mention goes to Malcolm McDowell as Dr Loomis who does an incredible job of fleshing out his character's inner torment; he feels responsible for Michael's actions but at the same time cannot bring himself to kill a man that he pities more than hates. None of the supporting cast are every fully explored though, with only Michael Myers and Dr Loomis getting the most character development.(again, since the movie is about Michael and from his POV, I would expect nothing more). Rob Zombie does fall back on quick cuts and other typical camera tricks of horror movies but it does not take away from the enjoyment of the film. There is also a good amount of gore and nudity here to satisfy the casual slasher movie fan too.Not everyone will be happy when a horror movie not just humanizes its main ""monster"" but fails to be scary. I on the other hand loved the fresh new direction that the remake decided to go which added a whole new dimension to the slasher film killer stereotype. Though not entirely perfect, Halloween 2007 is a lousy horror show BUT an excellent psychological drama that delves deep into the mind of a killer, effectively reminding us that behind every face of evil, there was once a human.",Halloween
146,theshadow908,Completely unnecessary remake.,6,2 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is a remake of the 1978 John Carpenter classic. The latest in a slew of horror remakes, and the first remake that has ever really angered me before I even saw it, simply because Halloween was not a movie that needed to be remade. This version delves deeper into the background of Michael Myers, taking away any mystery or intrigue behind the character. We are immediately thrust into his abusive home life with his stripper mother, her white trash boyfriend, and his rude sister. In fact, the only one Michael seems to love is his baby sister Laurie. After a scene filled with some pretty colourful curse words, we see Michael at school where he's bullied. On Halloween night, Michael brutally slaughters everyone in the house and is sent to a mental hospital. He's there 17 years when he breaks out and heads back home to hunt down his little sister, while his psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis, is hot on his trail. Unfortunately, too much time was spent on Michael as a child to get any real story in as an adult.I'll start with the bad. Rob Zombie made some bad mistakes in the concept of this film. He took everything that was creepy and mysterious about the first film and made it clichéd and boring in his version. What made Michael so frightening in the original was that he was more of an entity than a man. He was evil incarnate. He had no reason and no motive for doing what he did. In this film, Rob Zombie gives him the typical serial killer childhood. He lived in a white trash family and was abused a lot. But Zombie lays it on thick, and it goes way over the top and ends up becoming ridiculous. Another problem is that far too much time is spent on Michael as a child, so when Michael becomes an adult and begins going after Laurie Strode, there is barely any time left for character development, suspense, build-up, or anything important like that. Sheriff Brackett's role is shrunken down due to this and this leaves very little time for Loomis and Brackett to hunt for Michael. Basically as soon as Loomis contacts Brackett, they're on their way to take Michael down. Loomis doesn't seem as sure in this movie that Michael is pure evil. In this movie he seems to think that Michael is just a normal psychopath on the loose that needs to be taken back into custody, which is actually what Michael is. He's not a supernatural force in this film. He's just a man. The reason he can do all the things he did in the original is because in this film he's 6'8 with muscles on top of muscles. The death scenes are far more brutal in this film and for the most part unnecessary. People died in this movie that didn't need to die, and shouldn't have. Also, I didn't like how Michael was a vicious killing machine through the whole film that killed people that didn't need to die or deserve to, yet when he reaches Laurie, all he wants from her is some sisterly love. What is that? She should be his main target, but no, Rob Zombie thought it would be better if Michael only wanted to reunite with her. And let's talk about plot holes. How does a 10 year old kid being fed hospital food for 17 years and doing nothing but make papier mache masks in his room grow into a 6'8 mass of muscle? How did he hide the mask and knife as a 10 year old, considering he had to punch through floor boards to retrieve them as an adult? And the dialogue! The dialogue between the three girls is sad. It was obvious this script was written by someone who has no idea how the minds of 17 year old girls work.Now onto the good. Once Michael gets the mask on, it becomes more faithful to the original. If only Rob Zombie had kept the same formula as the original (having Michael as a kid for 5 minutes and then having suspense and build up for the rest of the movie), while still putting his own spin on it, it would have been a much better film. Quite a few scenes made me happy that Zombie included them, such as Laurie seeing Michael watching her from the school as well as on the street, Michael tilting his head after he's pinned Bob to the wall, Laurie asking if Michael was, in fact, the bogeyman. And there's a few more. Keeping John Carpenter's original score was a smart move, as it made certain scenes more reminiscent of the original.As for acting, Malcolm MacDowell does a fairly good job as the new Dr. Loomis though he couldn't hope to top Donald Pleasence. Scout Taylor-Compton actually did a really good job as Laurie Strode. She filled Jamie Lee Curtis' shoes nicely. Tyler Mane made a good Michael Myers, though I guess it's not the hardest role to play. To the other leads in the film, sorry. Better luck next time.Overall, the movie destroys the feel of the original, makes a mockery out of Michael Myers, and feels too rushed, however...It does become entertaining and a little more faithful once Laurie enters the story, and that saves the film.5.5/10",Halloween
147,bh_tafe3,Interesting if unnecessary reboot,6,27 June 2014,"Basic, disturbing and lustily violent, anyone would think you are watching a Rob Zombie movie. Wait.... you are! Zombie takes essentially the same elements as the original, makes Michael a little more human, turns Loomis into a complete dick, and churns out a movie that works reasonably well in its own right.As detestable as Loomis is, we do feel some empathy with Laurie, and most to the Director's credit, Michael. There is some over the top brutality in the death scenes, which isn't a bad thing. But, while the film works for what it is, there is a real feeling of ""why are you bothering?"" about the film. It certainly is a better film than parts II, V, VI or VIII, but feels like it's posing questions and giving answers to the back story that aren't really called for or needed.Halloween alumnus Danielle Harris and Child's Play's Brad Dourif are welcome additions to the cast. In the end, kind of like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 remake with Jessica Biel, this succeeds in being a decent film, but fails in making you think it had a reason to exist.Check it out, especially if for whatever strange reason, you've ever found yourself wondering what the original Halloween movie would have been like if Rob Zombie had directed.

148,Prof-Hieronymos-Grost,Tired remake,5,27 July 2008,"The much anticipated/dreaded remake of John Carpenter's classic slasher, this time has a comprehensive back story added that explains the reasons behind Michael Myers killing sprees, its down to a dysfunctional home, a sister who treats him bad, an abusive step dad, a mother who's a ""Stripper"", added to this he is in trouble in school due to him being bullied, all valid reasons to go wipe out your family don't you think?, what this succeeds in doing is it gives the viewer more knowledge of the character but it also succeeds in demystifying the Myers myth somewhat and so the film lacks any real tension, that the original had in abundance. The film comes in three parts, Myers as a child, Myers as an adult in an institution and finally Myers on the rampage again, this final third is basically a compressed version of the original story. The overall result of the film is that this time it is told from Myers point of view, the Laurie Strode character is given very little to work with and as such this viewer found little empathy with her character. Having said all that, Zombie has put his own mark on this interpretation, it feels like a Zombie movie, it has his look, F word dialogue, the kills are quite decent without ever being spectacular. The rather jaded metal soundtrack only adds to the ever decreasing atmosphere of the final film. I say all this because of the preconceptions I have in regard to the original, as a stand alone modern horror, Zombie's Halloween isn't that bad, its just not that good either.",Halloween

Many people are giving it bad reviews as they are saying it did a lot of changes in the story. People should have expected the changes as it was a remake. I think these changes were good. It made film more interesting to watch.One of the biggest change was Michael talking (which he never does in the original film) and also showed his childhood which I think was necessary.The movie loses some of its momentum when it jumps to the present day, when too often it reverts back to some of the trend-setting scenes from its predecessor.Zombie's ""Halloween"" succeeds on all fronts. It brings modern touches to a format that had long since fallen into cliché without changing it so much that it becomes unrecognizable. It manages to restore the menace and dread of the iconic Michael Myers. Most importantly, it delivers the goods horror fans demand but includes enough depth and subtext to make it more than just cinematic junk food.In short, I was pleasantly surprised with this new version of ""Halloween"". It could never replace its predecessor, but does make for a very admirable companion piece to a horror classic, blending the old and the new into an entertaining and thought-provoking fright film.",Halloween
151,coldwaterpdh,"Should have been called ""Michael Myers"" or something else...not ""HALLOWEEN.""",7,20 August 2009,"This movie suffers from one major problem above ANYTHING else: the title. For the life of me, I cannot understand why these film makers nowadays continue to rape these classic horror movies by giving new films, even ones that are totally different, the same title as the classics. This movie is not really a remake at all. It is more of a PREQUEL to the original ""Halloween,"" and it works pretty damn well if you just give it a chance.It starts out as a gritty, disturbing glimpse into the life of young Michael and his family. His mother is played pretty terribly by Zombie's wife, Sherri. I think a better casting choice could have been made there. Anyway, this kid's got one messed up life. He ends up offing some people and gets put away. The whole story then proceeds onward through Michael Myers' life, up until the time he escapes from the mental hospital. It is all pretty true to the original, I mean, Rob Zombie takes some liberties here, but if there is one guy who can take liberties when it comes to horror flicks, why not Rob? Have you ever seen that dude's movie collection? Suffice to say, he knows his stuff.I found this to be far better than any 'remake' horror movie I have seen in recent years. It is scary, funny, gory and entertaining. I just wish they would have titled it ""Michael Myers"" instead of stealing the title of the original. For that, it loses on star in my book.

153,Bloodwank,"A middling, fitfully cool re-imagining",5,12 April 2011,"In the past decade mainstream horror cinema has been overrun by cash whoring remakes. Remakes of old classics, remakes of recent foreign work, remakes of just about anything with some kind of a following and rights that can be sold and turned into gloss and gore, or gloss and jump scares if PG13 is the intended certificate. I took quite some while before getting round to seeing Rob Zombie's treatment of Halloween through a mixture of cynicism and just plain not caring, but actually it isn't all bad. In fact I'd go so far as to say that whilst I did not think all that much of the film, it was a hell of a lot more interesting than it could have otherwise been and really only falls down substantially in its second half. The key to the film is that it's a Rob Zombie film, not a Carpenter film, not someone else's vision of a slasher film but a Rob Zombie film. Though a remake, it feels personal and the efforts to give it personality are welcome. A rigid rehash of the original would likely have been rather poor and a toned down one even worse, Zombie adds savagery, a bit of gore and a whole lot of bad language and it ends up fitting his free wheeling and exploitative style in a manner that makes it quite entertaining. The first half is almost all Zombie's vision, imagining Michael as a poor kid, bullied by schoolmates, mocked by family, upbringing rather than innate evil, nurture rather than nature is the origin of his violence. And when he makes is asylum escape it is the evil of man again that incites him. The film extensively demystifies Michael and does the same for Dr. Loomis too. Loomis here is seen as a puffed up, somewhat selfish individual trying to make a name for himself with the Myers case, he commands authority but not sympathy and pursuit of his own goals only loom larger as the film goes on. Its interesting to seen a remake in such a way, openly grappling with its template, and until Michaels return to Haddonfield for Halloween massacring time the film is pretty sound. Sherri Moon Zombie has a modicum of fraught likability as Michaels torn mother, wanting the best but coming apart from strain, Dag Faerch conjures a reasonable aura of blank violence as Michael and best of all Malcolm McDowell is evidently having a blast as Dr Loomis, benignly chomping on scenery with just the right self satisfied, faux wise air. Up until Michaels escape the main problem can be seen in the kill scenes. Invariably their construction is shaky, too many edits and jittering camera-work actually detract from the sense of violence, the kills tend to be a blur of mock fury capped with a gore shot or two where a traditional approach would have been far more effective. Fortunately most of the kills at least take place in light or semi light during the first half, not so in the second. In the second half the kills are rarely at all satisfying because the hyperactive direction mixes with the dark of the night to blunt all attempts at brutality, each kill ends up being mightily frustrating. The second half also errs by adhering closely to the layout of the original, in this way it can't help but often remind of the superior skill of the original, its likable characters and traditional style. Its as if a cruel mirror is held to the fierce new style of the remake and suddenly it just doesn't look so interesting anymore. Add a bland turn from Scout Taylor Compton and a weak finale and overall the film has ended up a bit of a wash up, and such a shame. Still, its not too bad overall and I had an alright time, so a tentative 5/10 from me.",Halloween
154,PoisonKeyblade,A New Masterpiece,10,31 August 2007,"We all know what remakes are. They're a fan's worst nightmare. Unless they set out to improve upon the original in some way, remakes can end up in ghastly territory. Case in point: When a Stranger Calls. The perfect example of a remake gone wrong that only succeeds in bringing down the appeal the original film once held. Halloween is no such remake. Halloween takes the opposite route, surpassing all other remakes and really doing what all remakes should aspire to do; it was flawless on almost every level, and it actually improved on some of the weaker aspects of the original (of which there were very few). It is filled with beautiful directing, amazing performances, and has to be the scariest film to hit theaters this year. Halloween is written and directed by the horror genre's savior, Rob Zombie, and it features many various well-known actors and actresses from the horror community including Sheri Moon-Zombie, Dee Wallace Stone, Malcolm McDowell, and Tyler Mane.Michael Myers is a troubled young kid. His mother is a stripper to make end's meat for the family, his father is rude, obnoxious, and abusive, and his sister is slutty and just plain mean. The only one that seems to understand young Michael is his small little sister, 'Boo'. Michael finally snaps on Halloween night, and he kills several people. Fifteen years later, Michael escapes from the asylum he was put in and returns home, back to Haddonfield to find little 'Boo', and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants.So what exactly is it that makes Zombie's Halloween such a sensational film? Well, it is pretty much everything. Zombie really knows how to scare people; Zombie takes what was so frightening about the first film and amplifies it. The script is so rich and fantastic and it goes so deep into the human psyche, pecking at all that we know about serial killers and breathing new life into the slasher genre. All the characters feel so familiar, and it feels like you could know this person or that one. Each actor and actress brings incredible believability to these situations, and that's what feels different about this Halloween. We'll always known how amazing Jamie Lee Cutis's performance was in the original; she was simply outstanding playing Laurie Strode in the role that made her a legendary scream queen. Scout Taylor-Compton takes over the role with such bravado and skill that you would think she's been chased by some maniac in real life. In fact, all of the roles were perfectly fitting. Sheri Moon-Zombie gives a powerful performance as Deborah Myers, Michael's sympathetic and tragic mother. Malcolm McDowell re-imagines the role of Doctor Loomis like no one else could have. Donald Pleasence would have been proud of such a great re-imagining. My favorite character and performance in the movie, however, had to be that of Danielle Harris, who plays Annie Brackett. The little girl that everyone grew so attached to in Halloween 4 and Halloween 5 is all grown up, and her acting skill was so perfect that I wish she had been given more screen time, which is not to say that she didn't have enough as it was. Another performance I liked a lot was that of Daryl Sabara, who has grown a lot since the Spy Kids films. However briefly he may appear, I really liked his role, and he played it magnificently.Rob Zombie has perfected his craft with Halloween, which is his best film to date and one of my favorite horror movies of all time. He utilizes lots of atmosphere, and his characters are so rich. Tyler Mane was the perfect choice for Michael Myers, and he gave the icon something new that wasn't present in the original. Daeg Faerch plays Michael Myers at age 10 really well, and provides us with some much-needed insight into the mind of the psychopath. All of the clichés of the genre have been flipped on their head, and Zombie has made an actual frightening film. This new version is scary through and through, with a very deep story that feels like it could happen to anyone. Some of the dialogue was really well written, and I loved the occasional nods and references to the original film, although what made this movie so good was the fact that it went its own way. Zombie made a superior film to the original, through and through. It wasn't like a thousand times better or anything, but I must admit that this installment had more drive, more backstory, better characters, and more emotion flowing through the entire project. Rob Zombie didn't just want to make another When a Stranger Calls or The Fog. He did what most directors feel it is so impossible to do; he stayed very close to the original while taking things in a different direction and he still came out on top. He didn't take the route of the Black Christmas remake, where it was all played for fun and giggles. Zombie made this Halloween another classic, one that should go down through decades as being one of the best horror films of our time. Rob Zombie seemed to accomplish the impossible, and he did it so well that he managed to surprise me. I wasn't expecting this film to be as good as it was. Halloween (the original) was always one of my favorite horror films of all time, and I didn't want it to be disgraced with a hideous remake. Halloween, 2007 version, is another classic all its own.",Halloween
155,MovieGuy01,This remake was better the the original....,8,1 November 2009,"I usually do not say this, but i thought that the remake of Halloween was better than the original. The story was changed quite a lot. In Haddonfield, Illinois, the nine years old Michael Meyers is raised by a family: his mother Deborah is a stripper in a night-club; his foster father Ronnie is an alcoholic his sister Judith is a easy sort of girl On October, 31st, after an incident in school where he is bullied by a schoolmate, Michael overhears the conversation of the principal and the psychiatric Dr. Samuel Loomis with his mother. They had found pictures of Michael torturing animals in his backpack and Dr. Loomis would like to send Michael for psychiatric evaluation believing that the boy is deranged. This revelation triggers Michael that escapes from the school and kills the bully, Ronnie, Judith's boyfriend Steve Haley and his sister Judith. On Halloween 1963, Haddenfield, 10-year-old Michael Myers, mentally unstable, is imprisoned in Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis for the murders of his mother's boyfriend, his older sister, and her boyfriend. Eleven months later, during the visit of his mother, Michael kills his nurse and his stressed mother commits suicide. Now, 15 years later, years later, Michael escapes from the mental institution and is now in search of his baby sister Laurie and Dr. Loomis, he is on his way back to Haddenfield. I thought that this was a great remake of the 1978 Halloween film, it was very disturbing and it had a lot of strong bloody violence in the film 8/10",Halloween
156,CelluloidRehab,Can Zombie do more than redneck chic?,3,22 January 2008,"John Carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies I can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic Conan the Barbarian). To prepare for this re-interpretation I decided to watch the original, for a competent comparison. Too bad there is very little to compare. After seeing Rob Zombie's previous films (which were heavily stylized and derivative, but enjoyably distracting), I could see sparks of potential. This movie makes me question those sparks of creativity. An aftertaste of redneck dis-functionality and a mild burning & itching sensation is all that remains.The first half of this movie is an origin story. The origin of Michael Meyers prior to and after the killing of his sister. Zombie attempts to fill in the gaps of the original; Michael's turning into the killer and the years in the institute before he escapes and how he escapes. Where John Carpenter used Michael Meyers as a metaphor of the dysfunction that can occur in middle class America and the suburbs (places that are considered safe), Zombie almost justifies the creation of Michael Meyers as probable and even sympathetic. His first kill isn't a sudden urge to kill his sister on Halloween night, but rather a progressive transition from animals, to classmates, to his sister and then his father. It is this first 20 minutes that although not in the spirit of Carpenter's ""Shape"" is actually quite graphic and made me quite uneasy(not since I saw Jesus Camp). This 20 minutes is the only good segment of the movie.Zombie's Meyers isn't a faceless, person-less killing ""Shape"", but rather is an abused prototypical serial killer. His parents and sibling are ""suburb rednecks"" who do nothing but pick on him (obnoxious and despicable members of his family, unemployed, working as a stripper and whoring). Is this really what a typical American middle class, suburban family looks like to Zombie or is he deriving from his own experiences? He doesn't kill for no reason, he very clearly snaps. By showing us his face in the early minutes of the movie, Zombie shows us that there is a human being behind the mask. A goofy looking child. In and of itself this is not necessarily bad. When taken in the context of the second half of the movie is where the problem develops. If Zombie continued on his initial re-imaging, this would have been a graphic and watch-ably average movie. It wouldn't be great but infinitely better than this reject.Unfortunately, Zombie feels the need to re-shoot (almost scene for scene) the 2nd half of the movie exactly as Carpenter's ""Shape"". It just doesn't work. Meyers cannot be a ""Shape"" when you spent the first half of the moving turning him into a textbook serial killer. You spend the first half of the movie almost sympathizing with Meyers. The second half just ruins everything. It's almost as if Zombie didn't know what to do or how to finish what he had started, so he just defers to Carpenter. The second half just becomes a series of forgettable massacres. Where the original had little gore and worked the inclusion of a bloodbath desensitizes any thrill. Thankfully I cannot remember any of it. This movie is a series of contrasts. I did like all the masks Michael creates to hide behind, almost as a different mask for every emotion he is burying. At the same time his killer mask is a worn, gray and cracked mask. It just looks dirty. It doesn't emote as well as a bleached white and faceless Shatner mask (original). I also felt the inclusion of the other-sister angle (brought up in the lesser sequel Halloween 2, which never really worked for me nor was directed by Carpenter) seemed even more rushed and random in this movie. His mother (Zombie's wife Sheri Moon) further cements just how bad of a mother she is and how mediocre an actress Sheri is. The bard of Carpenter's original, Dr. Loomis, is played by a hippie Malcolm McDowell (very reminiscent of his over-the-top Caligula performance, very hammy). Adult Michael is also no longer average but a brutishly gargantuan (played by X-Men's Sabertooth, Tyler Mane). He's become a caricature and not the kid-next-door turned faceless monster for no reason. Also not helping the movie is when you are sympathetic to the psychopath because the protagonists are so annoying. The movie should just start with a montage of people's faces, of various shapes, colors and sex, whom all say ""I am Michael Meyers"". Zombie shows us how the right circumstances of genes and environment can turn one into a serial killer. Hard to be terrified by the explainable. The Unrated DVD does nothing more than add gore to an already dysfunctional and bad movie. If you must watch this, just watch the first half. A better solution is just to go back to the original.",Halloween
157,mikeiskorn,Good,7,6 March 2021,"Great movie and remake. I liked that Zombie tried to give Myers a human side however brief it was in the movie. The kid at the beginning playing Myers played the character really well, too. Not sure I'll watch again but doesn't deserve any hate. A solid remake all round.",Halloween
158,ThrownMuse,Bad trash.,3,16 September 2007,"""Halloween: White Trash"" is one of the biggest horror turds of the year so far. While I'll give Rob Zombie some credit for ""re-imagining"" the popular 1978 horror classic (he spends half the film on Michael Myers' childhood and lock-up time) instead of merely remaking it, the end result is unfortunately an incohesive mess. It is also spastic, obnoxious, and worst of all, not scary. The dialogue is really awful--it makes the dialogue in Eli Roth's films sound like Shakespeare. Most people I know drop f-bombs here and there, but nearly every character in this movie uses it in every other sentence! Michael is the only main character in the film, which is actually a neat reversal, but Zombie's poor writing skills just can't pull it off. Boo-hoo, his mom was a stripper and kids picked on him for it. This is why horror remakes should not try to give horror legends like Leatherface or Michael Myers or whoever a new back-story. It's usually a half-assed attempt to make the character sympathetic. Unless they can come up with something truly fascinating or bizarre (which they never do), then it's not going to be effective. Worse, it takes away any mystery or suspense the film could potentially have, as in the sad case of Halloween'07. Laurie Strode's role serves a completely different purpose in this film than in the original. While that is inherently interesting, it isn't enough to keep this one afloat. As with ""The Devil's Rejects,"" Zomb gets kudos for casting genre vets in most of the supporting roles, but it almost comes across like a joke at times. At one point, Udo Kier pops up, spouts an Udo-ism in his Udo accent, and then is never seen again.",Halloween
159,flicklover,A re-imagining of a classic that is wrongly demystifies an horror Icon.,6,29 May 2021,"The original Halloween is one my absolute favorite films. It is a horror classic that i have seen so many times that I've lost count. So when it was anounced tgat Rob Zombie's was going to direct a remake I was not really looking forward to it. I am not a big fan of remakes. Why remake something that already great? Good remakes a very few and far between.What i feel that Rob Zombie did with his version of Halloween is half origin story and half remake. He spends almost the first full half of the film with Michael as a 10 year old kid. We see his family. They are presented as a dysfunctional bunch of unlikable white trash characters. His mother is a stripper. His mother's live in boyfriend is horrible to him also. Michael gets bullied in school. So Zombie tries to explain why michael is thevway he is. Big mistake in my opinion. The readon i feel the 1978 film is so good us that Michael is just presented as the embodiment of evil. No reason, no explanation. Here, Michael is a nice bur put upon kid that snaps. That me be more ""realistic"" but it isn't what made the original the classic it is. After murdering a kid that bullies him, he goes after his sister and mother's boyfriend. He gets caught and gets put into a mental institution. And we see Michael going through therapy with Dr. Samuel Loomis played this time by Malcolm McDowell. In the original Donald Pleasence played Loomis as petrified of Michael. Convinced that Michael was the embodiment of evil and he never wanted Michael to get put of the mental institution. In this film we see Loomis befriending Michael, treating him. Which would be fine but then he leaves to write a book about him and becomes famous. I just didn't like Zombie and McDowell's take on the character. He comes off as annoying. Then 15 years pass and Michael is a 7 foot tall man with really long hair!!! That just the world that Zombie likes to show I guess!!! But again Michael was imposing in the original but he wasn't a freakishly huge man. So much time is spent on Michael here that there is no mystery to him. I didn't like that part of this version. The second half of the film is more the remake of the original. Michael goes to Haddonfield and is going to go on a killing spree. But the difference here us that he goes after Laurie Strode but here it is established that she us his sister. That was not in the original. It was introduced in Halloween 2 in 1981. Even then i didn't like that because it removed the random part of Michael going after her just because he saw her. He chose her. Not going after her because she's his sister. But i will say that the second half is better than the first. When Michael starts his killing spree its very brutal. The original's violence was virtually bloodless. Here it is more graphic but not over the top. This film is at it's best when its just a slasher film.I do admire that Rob Zombie tried to do something differently than just make a carbon copy of the 1978 Halloween but i didnt like that he made Michael almost into a sympathetic character.Maybe if it weren't a remake of a classic it wouldnt have bothered me so much.A well made but average remake.Grade: C+",Halloween
160,renegadeviking-271-528568,Halloween review,6,4 January 2021,"John Carpenter's Halloween has been cemented as an absolute horror classic, and remaking such an influential movie is a big task for any director. However Rob Zombie's Halloween movies have a notably divided reaction to them, and they're not really for everyone. His first movie is a bit of a mixed bag but at the same time, there's parts of it I like that's worth praising.For the record, I haven't watched the director's cut, but from what I can tell it's a little more violent and adding an unnecessary rape scene, so I don't think I'm really missing much by skipping out on that version. Halloween 2007 is essentially made up of two different halves. The first half is about Michael Myers when he was younger and basically serves as an origin story. One of the major criticisms of the movie from a lot of people is that Michael Myers shouldn't be explored as a character, and that he works much better as a mystery and almost supernatural presence. I'd counter that even if that's true, this would at least be something different from the original instead of just recreating the movie and going through the same beats. Honestly my issue with it was personally more of the handling. Long story short, Michael Myers grew up in a broken home, and I'll skip past the fact that this origin story is way overused for villains, since I've already got a lot of things to say. It is heavy handed how horrible his childhood is, and while blatancy isn't inherently bad, some of the writing is just so over the top, especially with the dialogue. With that said, there are some nuanced scenes and some parts that were handled quite well, and it was interesting to see Zombie's take.The second half is pretty much the events of the original film, which is both better and worse. On one hand it is more steady and less messy than the first half, and is just pretty much Rob Zombie doing his own take on the events of the original Halloween. The downside is that it is just that. While for sure there are some little plot changes made so that it's not exactly the same, it's just pretty much ""Rob Zombie does Halloween"". Zombie is definitely paying homage to the original, so he's not shamelessly copying the original, nor does he just recreate the whole movie, but even just paying homage has the potential to limit your movie, and that is the case here. It is quite jarring going from essentially Michael: Portrait of a Serial Killer, to what you'd expect from a Halloween remake. The early parts of that second half can be a little boring and uninteresting as you're just waiting for Michael Myers to start stabbing people, specifically the people who you know are going to be killed from watching the movie. Once it picks up later on though it does work well. If I was someone who was scared of the original movie (which I'm not), I'd be less scared watching the remake, because while it is more graphic, we spent almost half the movie with the killer and less time with the victims and survivors, so the kill scenes aren't nearly as impactful.The cast are also a bit of a mixed bag. Tyler Mane plays the grown up Michael Myers and while you don't see his face, he does so well in the role. His mere presence is intimidating and he's probably the most physically imposing version of the character that you could imagine. Donald Pleasance is hard to replace as Dr Loomis, but Malcolm McDowell was perfectly cast, and is quite good on his part. For the most part he pretty much just acts like Pleasance from the original but there are some moments where he stands out, especially in some of the earlier scenes before Michael Myers escapes. A lot of the rest of the cast is hit or miss, Brad Dourif does pretty well in his scenes as the sheriff character. As for Laurie, Scout Taylor-Compton I guess is alright but certainly suffers by not really feeling much of a main character like Jamie Lee Curtis's version did in the original.Even though I've only seen the Halloween movies from Rob Zombie, I can tell that this is definitely a Rob Zombie movie. He lent his style to this take on the Halloween movies, and while I think that it's more suited to something like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I'm not complaining that we got something distinct here. Perhaps the biggest contribution Rob Zombie has given to the Halloween movies is making Michael Myers an absolute force to be reckoned with, with his attacks being very aggressive and loud. It can be very over the top and even unintentionally funny at points, but I liked it all the same. As for horror, as I said before I wasn't scared by the original Halloween, and the remake certainly is much less scary than that. Tyler Bates's score is mostly its own thing, outside of when it uses certain themes from John Carpenter's score. It's not quite as effective as the original's music, but very few movies could achieve that, so I'm alright with that. My issues with the score is whenever it inappropriately uses the main theme in the movie, for example when kid Michael Myers is just running, it just plays randomly and it doesn't really fit. The Michael Myers mask and overall look is pretty much perfect, really grimy, creepy and scary.Halloween 2007 as I said before is a mixed bag. The new take is interesting, but Zombie doesn't quite pull off the execution, and while he does an alright job at redoing Halloween 1978 with Michael Myers on the loose, it is the same stuff and not anything beyond decent. All that being said, Zombie did make these movies his own, when he's not paying homage to Carpenter's classic at least. If you want to see Rob Zombie go full... well... Rob Zombie with the Halloween movies, then his Halloween 2 would be the one to check out after this one. If you liked the original, I'd say the 2007 remake is at least worth watching, even just out of curiosity.",Halloween
161,monstermayhem32,A much darker picture but still has it's flaws,6,2 September 2007,"The beginning of the remake of Halloween gave a better explanation on how Michael Myers became evil, by living in a abusive childhood. I was surprised how the child actor Daeg Farech manages to make Michael as a sympathetic character who still may have had some humanity in him since he really did love his baby sister Laurie. I also like how the film showed Michael in Smith's Grove and gains trust in a guard played by Danny Trejo who befriends him. I also like that Daryl Sabara who played Juni Cortez in the Spy Kids Trilogy was shown as bully and mean to Michael, who becomes the first victim of Michael. What I didn't like about the remake is that it feels like half Halloween and a half prequel to the original film and that there was no character development between Laurie, Annie, and Lynda which made the original so great. Scout Compton Taylor seemed to portray Laurie as a bit obnoxious and much more outspoken than the original Laurie who was more of a quiet bookworm that Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed. I do like that Michael was a lot more faster and vicious, and Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Sam Loomis who is more sympathetic towards Michael, but Donald Pleasance will always be the best Sam Loomis. The ending of the film is left with more questions than answers and the fate of Annie Brackett is uncertain.",Halloween

163,the amorphousmachine,An okay remake!,6,21 July 2009,"One cool thing about Rob Zombie's version of Halloween is the background information on Michael Myers, and yet it is also the downfall of the movie. In telling that aspect of the story, the mystery is lost, and Myers' obsession with masks (and he came up with some cool masks) would have realistically being ceased by the institution the kid was being held. I kept thinking during the film, why wouldn't the staff just make him show his face, and I think realistically, they wouldn't encourage his mental behaviour by allowing him to wear masks throughout his childhood.Malcolm McDowell was good filling Donald Pleasance's shoes, and there were some cool homage scenes to the original film. However. The recent spate of remakes- particularly horror remakes- really displays how worthwhile the original film influenced a particular. The original Carpenter 70s 'Halloween' is head and shoulders above this movie. And if this film makes more people see the original, then more power to it. It's slightly above average in the end of the day. Certainly much better than Zombie's 'House of a 1000 Corpses'! *** out of *****!",Halloween
164,ebossert,My Problem With Rob Zombie,5,28 December 2007,"I rented Rob Zombie's Halloween yesterday while making my rounds in American cinema. I found it to be mediocre as a whole while very annoying during certain moments. I'd probably give it a 5/10 rating.Zombie himself said that he wanted to make Michael Myers into a Frankenstein-like monster for which the audience could relate and emote with. Well, maybe you should've made a Frankenstein movie instead of taking an already established character and changing his entire psychology to pigeonhole it into a specific theme that's contradictory to the character's very essence. If you want to focus on nurture over nature, Michael Myers is probably the very last character you should have chosen.While watching Rob muck up the entire thing, I pondered at what could have been. Little Mikey Myers (played by a kid actor who doesn't look like a mutant) grows up in the perfect prototype household  a loving mother, father, and sister  yet still snaps one night and slaughters his sister without reasonable explanation. Now that's interesting, non-clichéd stuff. The film could subtly hint that something is wrong with him before that night. Perhaps some neat dream symbolism, or perhaps a ""trigger"" theme that focuses on his evil state. No dice, I'm afraid. Such concepts are much too intelligent for (underpaid?) Hollywood scriptwriters anyway, so I should probably blame myself for ever expecting it.As far as Zombie himself is concerned, I kind of like the guy even though his first three films were all mediocre to me. He seems to lack pretension, admits that he makes lots of mistakes while making movies, and actually has a genuine interest to improve his film-making skills. I admire that. In addition, he does have a talent for using the camera, and many of his shots are quite good.But Rob, for the love of God, please get someone else  anyone else  to write your scripts. The dialogue in particular is so inane and childish that I can't help but cringe in my seat when its expressed on screen. Zombie himself hinted at this when he said that his ""reality"" is with ""extreme people""  translation: a very small demographic known as white trash America. It would seem that Rob doesn't have sufficient knowledge of reality outside of this existence that he revels in, and it really hurts his scriptwriting skills.When a worker at a mental institution says something like, ""Lets go *beep* . . . I'll come in here and *beep* this place up one night . . . Yeah, you want some *beep* p*ssy?"" to a patient, I can't help but roll my eyes and get very, very annoyed. Sure, they might talk like that in white trash America, but that doesn't mean that you should transpose that lifestyle on every single character in every single movie you make. When you do, things begin to feel contrived and artificial.Imagine a circus performer-turned-moviemaker who is so ignorant of life outside the circus that he makes everyone in his films a clown: gas station attendants go to work in full makeup; corporate CEOs give speeches with big rubber noses; doctors perform brain surgery with poofy wigs; cops pile into little clown cars while on duty; etc. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? Well, that's exactly what Rob Zombie is doing with his constant, unrelenting transposition of white trash America in his films.Keep directing Rob. Stop writing.",Halloween
165,Jacques98,It got one thing right . . .,1,2 September 2008,"I'm going to be honest and say I've never seen the original, and I know nothing about slasher movies. Both were before my time. Ask me to write a 10-page essay on torture films, I could write 20 pages. But slashers, I know nothing about . . .The beginning of this film was very boring. For the first hour and a half, I literately had to fight myself not to fall asleep. Myers growing up just was too ""I've seen this a thousand times"" for me. If they cut that out and just cut to him killing his family, then cut right to Halloween night, it would have been a lot less boring. But the casting for young Myers was perfect and his killing scenes as a child were great.From that point, I think the only thing that carries the movie is the feeling of Halloween night. This movie gave me the same feeling as those old kid's Goosebumps books on crack and grown up.As for the gore, there wasn't really any to speak of. All the kills were cut-away scenes, and all the blood was sparse. Nothing you haven't seen in a PG-13 movie before. But the kills were pretty fun.In the end, I think I'm just glad this movie did what others of its kind never do: it actually takes something childish, such as the old Goosebumps books, and makes them more mature without making it more boring or sacrificing the same emotional experience. (If only del Toro understood what Zombie now knows when he made Pan's Labyrinth.) I also prefer parts of this over the original because it is more modern and generational. The characters felt real, not just cheap clichés or brainless good girls and boys as in the original.In other words, it's FAR from hardcore or intense, but it's fun. Don't look at it with a critical eye, just enjoy everything the horror genre is amazing at in pure, meaningless, fun form.1/10",Halloween
166,marcus_stokes2000,It felt like watching two movies... and they both sucked!,1,4 September 2007,"*SPOILERS* On HalloweeN night, 1978, 10-year-old Michael Myers (Daeg Ferch) kills his abusive stepfather (William Forsythe), a bully who taunted him, his sister Judith (Hanna Hall) and her boyfriend.Only survivors are his stripper mom Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) and infant sister, 'Boo', who weren't in the ONLY TRASH HOUSE IN A LILY WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.He ends up at Smith's Grove Asylum and begins to meet with Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), who seems to have been turned into some kind of Gale Weathers ripoff, who was also his school psychiatrist, various times, so much that Loomis feels they are best friends (EW).15 years later (or more? There are so many anachronisms), a magically ginormous Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) escapes from Smith's Grove, and kills, kills, kills... oh, did I forget that he also kills? Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) (three guesses on who she is and no, the first two do not count), Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris) and Lynda Van Der Klok (Kristina Klebe), are making plans for HalloweeN night, but they are all invited to a KILLER party...OK, first thing on, people who say that this is better than the original are complete and utter MORONS. Each and everyone of them. I'm THROUGH with being understanding and forgiving! Secondly, Rob Zombie is a cheater and a hack! The first part of his movie looks like parts of 'Devil's Reject' and 'House Of 1000 Corpses' I saw on Youtube, and it is utterly ridiculous.It seemed Rob Zombie had mistaken 'HalloweeN' with 'Carrie', what with his trying to make us feel compassionate for Michael... hey, Rob, the two movies have both PJ Soles in it, but the resemblance STOPS THERE. OK? The second part is even worse; Michael without any reason kills Laurie's parents, without any reason kills Paul, without any single reason doesn't kill Annie... you guessed it.If he wanted Laurie, why would he kill all the others (including Lynda and Bob)? Why did he kill Paul? If his objective was to be rid of anyone else in Laurie's life, he should've killed ANNIE. SHE IS LAURIE'S BEST FRIEND. PAUL ISN'T LAURIE'S BOYFRIEND, ROB ZOMBIE! YOU MORON! I have been really offended by Rob Zombie's idea to bring Paul in only to have him killed in place of Annie, and by his idea of bringing Laurie's parents in only to kill them is even more unforgivable.Laurie, Annie and Lynda were so annoying I didn't care about them, Paul was a little better than them, so I really got offended when he died stupidly like that, I hated Loomis' death, I detested the ending, I really abhor the new 'human' Michael Myers, and am aghast at how the IMBECILE American audience gobbled up this putrid (even the way it's filmed looks dirty) prequel/remake/reinvention/whatever! I hope that Dimension stays true to its word and NO SEQUELS TO THIS ABOMINATION.The fact of it existing is already a Hostel-like torture to anyone who has good taste.HalloweeN (2007): 1/10.

168,geminiredblue,Stop Hollywood From Remaking Everything! Part 1,1,26 April 2011,"I want to set the record straight, I have respect for Rob Zombie. He's built his reputation around a horror-themed persona. As a musician, he rocks. But as a director, I'm disappointed in him. I've sat through four of his films: HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, DEVIL'S REJECTS, HALLOWEEN (H1 as I'll refer to it) and HALLOWEEN 2 (H2 for short.) However, if you've seen even one of his films, you won't need to see any others. They're all the same: bad actors, outlandish and brutal violence, a totally butchered story, and tons of profanity with no purpose. I was willing to forgive him for the first two movies I mentioned, but I believe it's unforgivable to remake and besmirch such a horror classic and sequel. John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is a landmark horror film that helped pave the way for teen slasher flicks of the late 70s all the way through the mid-90s. When the attacks do occur, the deaths are swift and shocking. In '78, who would've believed that a 7-year-old child (from a middle class neighborhood) would kill his sister and one day grow up to kill again? In H1, we meet Michael Myers as a 13-year-old who's continually picked on at school and at home (which appears to be in an all white trash neighborhood.) No surprise that he would one day flip out and kill a bunch of people! I guess time and our mentality, as a nation, has changed sadly. Flash forward 15 years to the present (though it looks remarkably like just the next day) Michael Myers escapes and wreaks havoc on a group of teens. This is where the story deviates. HALLOWEEN worked by building upon a simple concept, using light and shadows to paint a canvas of fear, and allowing our imaginations to fill in the blanks. H1 decides instead to show us every painful second of some long, drawn-out death scenes. Blood gushes, throats are slashed asunder, etc. It's all so gruesome and ugly that what you feel isn't terror, but disgust. Second, in HALLOWEEN, Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie convinces us that she is an innocent, good-natured kid who gets caught up in a night of sheer terror. In H1, Rob Zombie unwisely uses Scout Taylor-Compton as the ""innocent"" Laurie. To telegraph her virginity and innocence, they simply have her wear glasses. Seriously, glasses?! Other than that, she acts just like the other characters, bitchy and unlikable. The only shining part is Malcolm Mcdowell as Dr. Sam Loomis. He's equally as good as Donald Pleasance. Unfortunately, in H1 we spend even less time with Dr. Loomis than in HALLOWEEN! What has compelled anybody, from Mr. Zombie to the Hollywood studios, to remake such a classic? Has Hollywood finally run out of original ideas? Go see the original HALLOWEEN, directed by John Carpenter, and avoid the remake like the plague that it is!",Halloween
169,tburke85,Halloween Another Flawed Horror Remake,5,17 June 2009,"Halloween is another flawed horror remake among many others being re-imagined these days like Friday The 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Last House On The Left to name a few. Writer/director Rob Zombie does an okay job of making the movie but the lack of originality, real scares, suspense, and character development are what weigh it down the most. The cast are for the most part solid in their roles including Malcolm McDowell who takes over for Donald Pleasance and Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode. Tyler Mane plays Michael this time and he does a decent enough job with the non-speaking villain role. Mane is intimidating as Michael and he proves to be effective as the iconic psycho killer. Zombie real life wife Sheri makes a brief appearance before being written out rather quickly. The rest of the cast are so-so in their roles but no one stands out before their parts get cut too short before you to even care about them. The film was really lacking in suspense build up, scares, and originality with the deaths. It didn't really offer anything new or exciting to the franchise. The violent deaths committed by Michael were well executed none the less. Overall Halloween is a flawed horror thriller with bloody deaths, some scares, suspense, and decent performances by the cast but the movie could've been a lot better because it ended up being a disappointment.",Halloween
170,darkreignn,Just as effective as the original,8,18 October 2021,"At risk of blasphemy, I dare say that, in many ways, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is superior to the John Carpenter classic. When the true remake portion starts and Zombie begins retelling the events that transpired in the 1978 classic, this film stuns with its genuinely believable acting and terrifying ferocity in its depiction of violence. Realistic is not a word I ever thought I'd use to describe a Rob Zombie picture, but the 2007 ""Halloween"" does feel scarily true to life from the way people react both as witnesses and victims of unthinkable acts of violence. Scout Taylor-Compton stuns in her portrayal of Laurie Strode, giving a very tender, sympathetic performance - and this can be said for almost every other performance in this movie. Malcolm McDowell as Loomis, Danny Trejo as an empathetic janitor, Danielle Harris as Laurie's friend Annie - the actors and actresses elevate this material past schlocky horror and turn this remake into a legitimately scary drama.However, plagued by generic Zombie-isms in the first act, ""Halloween"" does manage to not just shoot itself in the foot but practically blow its own leg off. Rob Zombie loves his portrayals of redneck, hillbilly, whitetrash - that's no secret. And there is a time and place for that - this movie was neither the time nor the place. In an attempt to give deranged serial killer Michael Myers a backstory, Zombie has Michael grow up in a home so broken that it would practically only exist in a Hollywood blockbuster. With drunk stepfathers who are sexually complimenting their own stepdaughters, wives who are somehow stuck in abusive relationships even though they're clearly shown sticking up for themselves and their family, and schools full of children who might as well be spawned from hell itself, the first thirty minutes of this movie are about as subtle and nondescript as the detonation of an atomic bomb. It may have been interesting to see Michael as a child, and in some ways even in this movie it is, but the choice to have Michael grow up in an environment so bad that it borders on parody only managers to cheapen the material.Though, once all the hillbilly nonsense is over, you'll finally be treated to the horror movie you wanted to see all along. Michael Myers is vicious here, shown with a rage and brutality that is still unmatched, even in the more recent David Gordon Green films. Michael utterly destroys his victims, throwing them around with a level of fierce intensity that is practically animalistic. And you know what? It's scary to watch. Zombie realizes that real-life violence is terrifying, and he directs his actors to react appropriately. As you view Michael smash, slice, dice, and decimate his way through person after person, it almost feels like you're watching people who are really being attacked because of how gut-wrenching their screams are. In this movie, the kills aren't meant to be fun or entertaining, but instead genuinely horrific.I watched the director's cut of this movie, which, to my knowledge, has a different ending than the theatrical version. I'm unsure what the ending is in the theatrical ""Halloween,"" but I can say with certainty that, whatever it is, it won't hold a candle to the ending Zombie gives us in his director's cut. Completing with a sense of finality, the director's cut ending is brilliant - as Laurie points a gun at the unconscious Michael's head, she cocks the revolver and pulls the trigger, with each round clicking empty. Finally, Michael wakes up and grabs her wrist - in her shock, she desperately pulls the trigger one more time, setting off the gun. Blood and brain from the impact of the bullet firing into Michael's skull spray on her and she finally reaches her breaking point - the movie ends as Laurie, beaten down from the emotional and physical toll the night has taken on her, screams. It's a brilliant, impactful ending that at once gives its audience a sense of catharsis as Michael meets his end but also leaves viewers with an understanding that Laurie is, though relatively unharmed, more mentally damaged than she will ever be able to repair.Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is a really effective horror film - one that is as dramatic as it is terrifying. Though the opening is ridiculous and almost pornographic in its depiction of hillbilly trailer trash, the rest of the movie is genuinely great and stands with the original as two of my favorite and most viewed slasher films.",Halloween
171,kikiboo_8,Not that bad this time,7,16 July 2019,"Now this has at least a little story and depth. Compared to the original at least. It shows Michael had plenty of background reasons to become the way he was. Let's see, an abusive and nasty stepfather. Immoral mother, with emotional depth of a kiddie pool or less, a whiny, annoying equally Immoral sister. Bullies in his school. The point being there was absolutely nobody, not one single soul who cared about him much or who gave him any serious attention or had any real interest in him. He had his basic physical needs met and that's where the care of him begins and ends. Ok, his mom did love him and cared about him of course, but she didn't know better than to give him the bare basics of care regardless of how she was feeling. There just wasn't anyone who knew how to reach him or approach him all along. Once you're used to being treated that way and your psychopathic personality is fully formed and it's a bit too late to change it. By that time nobody cares how did you reach that stage or what have you been through, all they care about is how awful you are and how to get rid of you. That's the sad truth.
After the part about his childhood it goes in the same style as all other Halloween movies. Kill, chase, rinse and repeat. In the end he only seemed to care to show his baby sister who he was and didn't seem to want to hurt her at all. It's not that bad, better than the original anyway.",Halloween
172,Jerique,Terrible!,1,15 January 2009,"Aside from the brutally violent kill scenes, this movie is a total wreck. I haven't seen any other films written/directed by Rob Zombie but if this is any indication, I won't want to. This remake does no justice to the original, blows the story totally out of proportion and all it becomes is a foundation to show some stunt double (or no-name actor) to play ""killer."" The original Halloween by John Carpenter was a masterpiece of horror, with good casting, good directing, a mind-blowing script and eerie music. The original gets in your head and you fear Michael Myers. You're sympathetic for the would-be victims.In this remake, the first victim of Myers is not his sister, but some bully at school. Sure, it's a cool scene to watch and very-cringe worthy, but it's only that. The rest of his victims in the film are nobodies, because the lack of character development. They brought back Danielle Harris as one of the babysitters, but who was in the original series as Jamie Lloyd.I'm very glad I did not have to pay to see this one. Oh, and the possibility of a sequel remake is thankfully snub because they killed off Michael Myers at the end. In the original, Michael is shot by Loomis and lands on the front lawn. A moment later, Loomis checks on Myers' body and it's gone. In this remake, Michael is shot to death by a dozen of policemen.After it's all set and done, it should be questioned why this film was completed because there's virtually nothing to be entertained about in this movie aside from the gore and violent killings. Don't watch this filth, watch the good one by John Carpenter in 1978.",Halloween
173,illbebackreviews,This movie receives too much criticism,5,1 January 2012,"I cannot understand why most of the 'best' reviews have such criticism such as this movie includes nothing new. Well, of course its not supposed to include anything new, because this is a remake. In fact, this remake is far better than some remakes such as Nightmare on Elm Street, and the second remake of Halloween.This movie is NOT complete garbage. It has a purpose. The acting seems decent, and the story drags along decently. The movie isn't that bad, as this film shows us what Halloween movies 1 and 2 were like. This would be a great film, but I don't know why there is such criticism. Sure, this movie ain't perfect, but its decent.Keep in mind, Halloween 2009 was complete garbage. This movie isn't that bad, and the script is far better than the 2009 version.",Halloween
174,amgee-89551,One of the best remakes ever,9,4 April 2018,One of my favourite horror remake is going to be 10 years old this year. That's crazy. I was in love with this film. I thought rob zombie done a great job reimagined a horror classic. The haters of the remake don't accept that zombie was doing putting a new spin on the 1978 John carpenter classic. Zombie said he didn't want to just do the same movie because it has already been done. The soundtrack was awesome for the remake. I liked we got more of Michael Myers backstory. I thought malcolm mcdowell done a good job as dr samuel loomis but he can't never replace Donald pleasence. He will always be loomis is my eyes and Halloween fans eyes also. I do admit zombie did fuck up the loomis character in the Sequel. It was the wrong approach of the character to just become a major dick. Remember a remake shouldn't outshine the original it's just another retelling of the story. All the casting was great. It was great to see one of my favourite scream queens Danielle Harris back in a Halloween movie. It was strange to see her playing the role of Annie because Harris was in her 30s and she was playing a 18 year old but she did pull it Of though because Harris is very young looking. I thought scout Taylor Compton done a great job as Laurie strode. She was very believable and u felt sorry for her. Sucks that Compton hasn't went on to bigger things because I think she's a good actress in my opinion. Plus she can do a great scream.,Halloween
175,Toronto85,Halloween (2007),6,3 July 2013,"Rob Zombie's attempt at remaking the 1978 classic 'Halloween' has both positives as well as flaws. It failed to match or even surpass the original, but has some charm to it. It begins with Michael Myers as a child, and shows the dysfunctional family he was living in around the time his killed his sister Judith. We see the emotional abuse he faced at the hands of his stepfather and sister Judith, as well as the bullying he faced at school from some of the older kids. Well, on Halloween day he snaps and kills all of them except his mother and little baby sister (Laurie). We get a large chunk of the film with Michael as a boy in the mental facility with Dr. Loomis attempting to treat him. Eventually (fifteen years later), Michael escapes and of course goes on his murderous mission to kill his little sister Laurie Strode. All of this leads to a gory conclusion.I loved the Haddonfield street scenes with Laurie walking with little Tommy Doyle, it was a good recreation of the exact same scene from the original. The original music score from John Carpenter is completely intact which was a wonderful touch by Zombie. The acting was a strong point I thought. Malcolm McDowell was the perfect choice for to play Dr. Sam Loomis, he put such life into the character. Scout Taylor-Compton played Laurie Strode with a little more edge than Curtis' version had, but still put some vulnerability to the character. And Danielle Harris (Jamie Lloyd from 'Halloween 4/5') puts in a good effort as Annie.My major problem with this remake, and I mean MAJOR problem, is the cheapening of the film. A lot of it feels like trailer park trash. The dialogue, some of the murder scenes, the filler stuff - all feels so cheap and trashy. It brought the film down a huge notch for me and is why I rated it as low as I did. It was sad to see a legendary horror film which held itself with class and tact, be remade as trashy as it was. The stripper scenes, naked Annie being cut up around the house, the dialogue they gave Annie and Lynda. It was sort of unnecessary. 'Rob Zombie's Halloween' has it's great moments. I liked the character development of Michael Myers as a child, and I liked the intensity of the film once it got to Halloween night in Haddonfield when Michael stalks the babysitters. But what separates this from the 1978 film is the trashy dialogue and the cheapening of some of the story. It brings it down a notch. Nevertheless, it's definitely worth a viewing!6/10",Halloween
176,shadowman123,Pointless rubbish !,6,10 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is just another reason for my to up-date my membership for the 'Boycott Hollywood for re-making classics' club and I would urge others to join that club - membership is free! Judging from the trailers yes I thought it looked good and I was willing to give it a try but however we had to bear in mind that it was Rob Zombie's spin on it and not John Carpenter. So I thought give it shot I was not expecting a new masterpiece but I have been proved wrong I mean take a look and the remakes of the Hills Have Eyes and The Hitcher both were very good and the certainly did overtake the originals. Now here we have Halloween, after seeing it I can now understand why others did not speak highly of it, this movie seems to want to try and re-boot the Halloween series which it really does not require it to do so as we are all aware of who the man in the white mask is and what he can do. Rob Zombie seem to be offering a justification for Micheal's actions - WE DON'T WANT THAT! Remember Ladies and Gents, in this world some people will turn to evil due to circumstance or pressure whilst others are not looking for anything logical - they just want to watch the world burn hence they are born evil! Mr.Micheal Audrey Myers is that ! The whole movie seems to spend time focusing on Micheal Myers into his adult life which was good but however it was just trying to offer an explanation for the way he is. It just seems to trundle along with a few stylish moments I must say and just as things start to warm up , they get cut off again. Also if you have paid good money to watch a theatrical realise then why does have a b-movie feel to it?!??! was I the only one? There are some nicely carved elements into it i.e. Micheals stalking the victims and his still superhuman strength, Rob Zombie also nicely blends in the like of horror icons like Ken Foree and Danny Trejo along with Danielle Harris from a previous Halloween film but the cheesy acting is just a let down and you just want to Micheal to come back on screen because every time he does - at least your guaranteed a kill. I could just go on a criticising this film all night but just to round it off it seemed like that Rob Zombie probably has sold his soul to El Diablo and in return he gave us the equivalent of a b-movie! I mean there is sex,blood and guts but the vulgarity of it does not exactly frighten or scare you because thats what you would expect from Rob Zombie, my advice is that just hold on to your cash as Zombie is not probably doing as well with his music so do not fund him in this very mess effort , just wait for it to hit the rental shop! and then watch the originals which will give you a new found respect for them. The only people who performed well during this were Malcolm McDowell who was trying his hardest as Sam Loomis but who really impressed was the youngster playing Myers.ROB ZOMBIE - GO KILL YOUR-SELF !ROB ZOMBIE'S HALLOWEEN : 6.7 OUT OF 10EVIL HAS A DESTINY!",Halloween

Anyway, after the settlement of the Halloween franchise, fans were then treated to a remake by Rob Zombie. I personally enjoyed Halloween, the remake, I had so much fun watching it as I only finished it and it's sequel last week but like Halloween 3, this film should not have been a remake for Halloween, this film was way too gory and dark for a remake of Halloween, at least Rob Zombie just say in the credits ""Inspired by 'Halloween'"", I don't think putting this down as the remake was very necessary, thats honestly the only thing that was bad about this film, it just should not have been a part of the Halloween franchise and just a stand alone film even if there were a few scenes Zombie did really good giving you deja vu back to the original film.

178,Gresh854,A Competently Made Remake That None Of The Less Should've Never Been Made,5,7 July 2018,"I respect Rob Zombie for approaching this Halloween remake with a more divergent and comprehensive design instead of using means of replication (for at least the first hour of this retelling). However, these new explorations pan out as eminently unnecessary and rather cataclysmic to the story of Michael Myers. Humanzing the character of Michael felt off-brand and almost betraying of the monstrous character that made him so devastatingly horrifying. It's strange though, because even though I didn't favor the changes Zombie was making to the story, I certainly wished he would continue to present more inventive themes that hadn't yet been explored in the Halloween lore as the film went along. It's unfortunate that the second half of the movie becomes a near copy of the original Halloween. If there's one fact for certain, it's that if you're going to remake a film, don't try to mimic it. Make it something different and fresh that could possibly further improve the lore. For the most part, I didn't enjoy any of the new portrayals of past characters (with the exception of Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis) which is mainly because of the script that the actors/actresses were given. Conversations between many of the characters seemed vastly exaggerated and quixotic creating a sense of unbelievability that was quite bothersome. I didn't favor any of Zombie's directing techniques; nothing surely could compare to Carpenter's directorial style. As I was basking in the movie I just kept asking myself, ""Why did this need to be made?"" Well, the answer is simple: ""It didn't."" (Verdict: C-)",Halloween
179,Tcarts76,Rob Zombie is a Horror Genius,9,25 September 2012,"I usually hate remakes, especially when the original is an awesome classic. In this case I loved it. Zombie proves he is a genius writer and director in the horror genre by taking on this horror/slasher movie classic, updating it, and making it even better than the original.The usual band of misfits from Rob Zombie's earlier movies accompanies him into this one, and usually this would annoy me to no end (kinda like Tim Burton always annoys me with) but in this one it completely works. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis is a stroke of genius as well. The Myer's family is cast as white trash middle Americans full of horrible dysfunction and really brings out the story of how Michael Myer's goes on to become the monster he is. This film sticks to the old story, updates it, and makes you even more afraid of the boogie man than we were when he was first introduced many years ago.Three cheers for a brave Rob Zombie for making a classic even better!Have an opinion on my reviews, love em, hate em, or have a request for a review?

180,Mr_Censored,Rob Zombie turns Michael Myers into a Hellbilly Deluxe.,5,27 March 2009,"Despite starting out with one of the classiest and most influential horror movies of all-time, by the turn of the century, the ""Halloween"" franchise was beaten to a bloody pulp. If six sequels with varying story-lines contradicting one another didn't seal the deal, then Busta Rhymes laying down some kung-fu on Michael Myers -- via the internet -- certainly put the final nail in the coffin. The ""Halloween"" franchise was an embarrassing, out-of-sorts mess with nowhere to go. Enter Rob Zombie. Having made a surprisingly fresh and original new horror classic out of ""The Devil's Rejects,"" it seemed that the man who built his career -- musical, theatrical and otherwise -- on horror was just the guy we needed to save our beloved Mikey. With the blessing of one John Carpenter, Zombie set out to do the unthinkable: remake a classic. Hearing the word ""remake"" is horror unto itself amongst horror fans, but okay. Michael Myers has survived worse, and at any rate, it couldn't be any worse than the derivative ""Scream""-inspired crap that Dimension was spewing in the latter years. So with carteblanche from the studio, Robert Cummings put his own stamp on the film, cramming it full of genre heroes, nods to its predecessor(s), classic rock music and a whole lot of foul language. Thus, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" was born.In Rob's version of ""Halloween,"" Michael Myers starts off as a misunderstood and horribly treated youth. His family swears over breakfast as he washes the blood of his freshly killer hamster from his hands. Fair enough. Afterall, when your mom is a b-grade stripper, your sister a hussy and your step-father an alcoholic low-life, it can be tough to keep a cool head. After being blown off for a night of trick-or-treating, Michael decides to play some tricks of his own and brutally slaughters his family, leaving only his baby sister and mortified mother in his wake. He spends the next fifteen years in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, under the care of Samuel Loomis, constructing his own home-made masks, never speaking a single word. One thing leads to another, and depending on which version of the movie you are watching, he escapes his prison to return home and raise Hell upon a batch of sexed-up teenagers and anyone who happens to get in the way.The only way a remake can truly be enjoyed is when you separate it from the original. Truer words were never spoken in the case of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween."" To say that Rob took many liberties with the story would be an understatement; if you consider yourself a big fan of the first, some of his choices may strike you as downright offensive. The problem with his ""Halloween,"" though, is that it doesn't succeed even as its own entity. Comparisons aside, his version is -- for lack of a better term -- weak sauce. We spend the first half getting to know and understand a very different Michael Myers, and all of that is engaging (if you can accept the fact that he's been given a white trash make-over) up until he escapes and Zombie fills out the rest of his movie with overly long stalk sequences, downright bad acting and what results in a rushed redux of the events of the original movie. It's like Rob can't decide on what film he is making. If you spend the first half creating something all new, by all means go for it! Don't attempt to cram the events of the original into your own movie just because it's expected. The film would have benefited a lot from doing something fresh with the story. We get a sizable chunk of story dealing with Michael's turn for the worse so he can do what exactly? Stalk a bunch of naked teenagers and drunken morons? Just doesn't add up.While the film has got some fine performances in it, most notably Malcolm McDowell, Danny Trejo and Brad Dourif, it's also host to some of the worst characters and worst acting in recent memory. Danielle Harris makes a triumphant return to the series as Annie, in a desperate attempt to shed the image of innocent little Jamie Lloyd, and she does fine, but like most of the other characters in the film, is hindered by cringe-worthy dialogue. Scout Taylor-Compton makes a great screamer but is an otherwise un-interesting Laurie Strode, and her character is virtually inconsequential. Genre fans will love seeing the likes of Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Udo Kier and Dee Wallace, but in unfortunate throwaway roles that serve as distractions more than anything else.Zombie can at least be commended for attempting to bring something new to the table in a brave way. It took a lot of guts to do to ""Halloween"" what he did, and had it been split into two separate films, the results might have been better. What we are left with is a messy, inconsistent and un-engaging story. While Zombie has a strong visual sense and pummels his characters with some of the grisliest deaths in the series yet, his narrative is strongly lacking, which tells me that either he rushed this job or didn't have the passion from the get-go. As far as the ""Halloween"" series goes, this one is no worse than, say, ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" or ""Resurrection,"" but its existence is hardly justified. When people say movies like ""Halloween"" don't need to be remade, this is a perfect of example of why. Even an audience unfamiliar with the source material will smell something fishy here, and coming from an uber-fan with talent like Rob Zombie, better should be expected. Will that come in the form of his sequel come summer? We'll see. If it's good, it will deserve all the praise in the world. If it's another mediocre entry, though, you can bet I'll be just one of many reviewers carving a jack-o-lantern out of it with a bloody kitchen-knife.",Halloween
181,Dragonsouls,Setting new standards in the Slasher genre. *minor spoilers*,8,31 August 2007,"I haven't reviewed a film in a long time, but I feel that I have to in this case. Rob Zombie just re-invented the slasher film. The tension during the murder scenes were so intense that I couldn't wait for them to end. The use of music and sometimes eliminating the music altogether in some scenes was very effective. Rob Zombie is a talented director, he knows how the mind works, and captured the psychology behind the murderer in every scene Micheal was in.The Acting: Great all around. Every character did exactly what they should do to play the role in a film like this. I felt like this film was smut sometimes, thats how real the chase/murder scenes felt.Micheal Myers was given some character development here, and you got a sense he was becoming the anti-hero/villain you root for until he escapes from the sanitarium. No, no, no...impossible to root for the sadism he displays in this film. The actor Tyler Mane was incredible. Forget Nick Castle, all 5'8"" of him. This Micheal Myers was different, he was more human, but yet inhuman as well. That is the only aspect I did not like. Zombie chose to keep Micheal that demonic force, who gets shot and never dies. I would have liked to see Micheal don a bullet proof vest at least.My favorite performance was that of Malcolm McDowell. He would have made Donald Pleasance proud. He helped make the ending as brilliant as it was. Go see it if your stomach is strong, and mind is too. Do not bring your children to see this film. One positive message in the film is that we can all easily head down the path Micheal did, and humanity deserves to go on for sure. Micheal was a very weak minded fearful boy, and no matter how much turmoil you deal with as a child, you have to be strong and never let hate, fear and anger get to you.",Halloween

I also really like the way Laurie finds out that Michael his her brother in the second one something that was missing from the original and it works but it doesn't save the movie at all.Not a fan of Sam Loomis in these movies he is boring and if that character isn't being played Donald Pleasance it just doesn't work in my opinion.Verdict 5/10 for both movies not a fan of them has some fun moments but just don't like Rob Zombie's style as a director",Halloween
183,BloodTheTelepathicDog,"Halloween, complete with modern ingredients",3,22 December 2008,"I should have known better. I consider myself a horror film fan, but not a modern horror film fan. The original Halloween, directed by the incomparable John Carpenter, had a mysterious aura to it while this film is basically just another mindless exercise in modern day horror sleaze. Rob Zombie shows his lack of writing skills, utilizing every cliché in the book: from making Michael Myers the son of a redneck stripper and constantly being bullied at school and at home by mommy's dead beat boyfriend. In the original Halloween, Michael was the son of middle class parents, not trailer park trash, creating mystery as to what set the boy off. Here, Rob Zombie offers the viewer no mystery but shows us everything - everything that we have all seen before mind you.I enjoyed Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses because of its originality and inventiveness, but Zombie just mirrors the latest horror sleaze trends in this film. The babysitters, the focal characters in the original, aren't even introduced until a third of the film is over, and when they are introduced, you won't like a single one of them - not even Laurie Strode. It is clearly Zombie's desire to have the film viewer sympathize with Michael, a murderous psychopath, since he doesn't offer us a single heroic character to pull for. Someone else should have written the script because Zombie doesn't have a clue as to how to build suspense or how to flesh out characters. Note to Rob Zombie: flesh out your characters! And that doesn't mean rip-the-flesh off your characters either.STORY: $$ (Like I mentioned, the story is very weak. There isn't any new ground charted. Rob Zombie had a great premise to work with and his heart was in the right place, but he just isn't talented enough as a writer to pull off his vision. He should have went with Carpenter's original idea, keeping Michael the son of well-off parents instead of making the boy a bullied stripper's son. A path to psychotic behavior is painted easier, and far more boring mind you, by thrusting a character into depravity than by having the character enter depravity on his own accord).VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Nonstop. Modern horror films are simply gorefest sleaze, abandoning story for the thrill of blood and guts. Man, I miss the good old days of DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT and DEAD AND BURIED!)ACTING: $$$ (The acting really wasn't a problem, although Rob Zombie has an obvious allegiance to low-grade ham actors like Sid Haig. Surprisingly, Mrs. Rob Zombie, Sheri Moon, gives one of the best performances here as Michael's well-meaning but misguided mother. She doesn't play the helium voiced psycho like she did in 1,000 CORPSES but actually portrays a convincing human being. Although, Rob makes it a point to give a close-up to her ass - he's just obsessed, what can you say. Scout Taylor-Compton is a young actress to keep an eye on. With the right talent agent, she should leave sleaze like this behind her and embark on a decent film career. Brad Dourif was the greatest miscast in this film - he is not sheriff material. That kid who played Michael Myers was also lacking in the talent department and Klebe was atrocious. The talented Dee Wallace was wasted and I didn't like Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis either).NUDITY: $$$$ (About as much as the gore. Both Danielle Harris (HALLOWEEN IV) and Hanna Hall (FORREST GUMP) prove that they're not child actors anymore, removing their tops. The non actor Klebe also has a full nude scene).",Halloween

The original gets remade and its the worse film to ever carry the ""Halloween"" name! This film is cold and robotic! Hard to believe that this film was made by an adult. THe problems with this remake are numerous. In JC original we had different ""types"" of teens. They all had their own voice. In Rob Zombie film they all sound like white trash and you don't care about any of them. John Carpenter built his scares on ""what you thought you are seeing"". Basically he made Michael Myers a land shark. In the original we don't know why Michael was so evil. He came out of a normal home and that was brilliant! Simple and brilliantRob Zombie made Michael a product of a white trash upbringing! You expect a homicidal maniac to come from his home. There is nothing new or creative here. This film was just a cash grab. This was not made by a gifted filmmaker! This was made by a man who is obsessed with female nudity. If you ever get the chance to watch the 4 hour documentary on the making of the film then watch it. It is far more entertaining than this mess!",Halloween
186,freaky_dave,A Disgrace to Carpenter's original,3,7 September 2007,"I read articles about the remake of Halloween. When I heard that Rob Zombie was going to direct, I decided to go see it even though many critics trashed it. That was a big mistake on my part because it's one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and a disgrace to the original.Everybody knows the story of Halloween. Zombie follows the original story pretty much, but adds in a lot of unnecessary gore and harsh language that just didn't work. Harsh language and gore do not bother me if they are used in an appropriate way to move the story along and keep my interest. This remake does neither.On top of all this, Zombie adds in an unnecessary back-story explaining why Michael Myers became what he did. This also was a big mistake because it humanizes Michael Myers and takes away much of what made Myers so menacing all those years ago. The feeling that Michael Myers was simply the embodiment of evil is not there anymore, and I found myself shaking my head in disgust instead of feeling uneasy. It doesn't help that the dialog during these scenes is some of the most atrocious I've ever heard. The actors are just as horrible, and there characters are never developed even slightly. Sure, Rob Zombie makes an effort to try and make them sympathetic, but falls flat. He really pushes to make us feel sympathy for Michael Myers, but I only found the kid who played him in his younger years to be aggravating. Even the presence of Malcolm McDowell as Sam Loomis is a total failure. I won't even talk about the girl who played Laurie Strode or her friends.This remake is probably one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes there were a couple shocks (maybe two or so) but there was never any suspense or twists that grabbed me. I knew everything that was going to happen before it did. The gore was excessive, but as I've said so many times before, gore alone in a horror movie does not work. You need suspense and good characterizations as well. Rob Zombie's Halloween has none of this, and so it fails miserably. Is it the worse film I've ever seen? Not quite, but it is not too far off.",Halloween
187,d_m_s,"Starts OK, ends poorly but better than the original.",3,29 October 2015,"I really don't like the original Halloween and the only reason I bothered to watch this is because it was made by Rob Zombie and I love his music.I've read another review that criticises Zombie's deviation from the original for the first two thirds of the film in an attempt to show Michael as a child and what went wrong. For me, this was the most interesting part of the film and had it stuck more closely to the original the whole way through, I would have found it a completely pointless film. And this, for me, is why the film ends poorly. The last 30 minutes are just your average slasher film, very similar to the original and nothing at all interesting happens.It wasn't an amazing film from the beginning or anything but it was entertaining enough and I was not bored. But the last half hour was so boring and unoriginal that it ruined it all and just made it feel like I had wasted my time. I was really itching for it to finish but it dragged out.A disappointing film overall. I was hoping Zombie was going to do something unique, interesting and fun but he did not. Still, it's better than the original.",Halloween
188,springsunnywinter,No brains required just sit back & enjoy,9,6 October 2007,"I was not really looking forward to this film because remakes are always poor. I saw it on the cinema because there was no other film that looks good to watch. I would say that they had a good update from the original is that they showed why Michael Myers is mentally ill e.g. his sister & especially his father were psychologically disturbing him and they are the worst family I have ever seen. After that it is exactly as same as the original even the music. The remake is much better because the original was really slow & boring. It's good that they didn't continue after Halloween: Resurrection because I had enough of them. There were about seven sequels and each of them had no story & wasn't going anywhere. They were all the same e.g. the teens who drink & had sex got killed & the virgins survived. Also watching this takes you back to the 70s.I've not seen any of Rob Zombie's films so I have no idea what kind of director he is and why his second name is Zombie. But after watching Halloween I figured out that zombies are brain-dead and you didn't need any brains to watch because it's all blood, gore & violence so that's why Rob's second name is Zombie and it doe's suit his personality.Overall it was a good & entertaining movie that didn't had a single boring or useless scene but had a very unexpected ending that makes you ask yourself ""Is that it?"" If I haven't seen the original then I would have given it a 10 out of 10 but since it's really similar so I'm giving it a 9 out of 10. The best horror movie of 2007 is Dead Silence, it has been about 3 months since I seen it but I still remember how good it was.",Halloween
189,helmutty,Halloween!,5,21 October 2007,"It is based on the original Halloween movie, I don't know whether it is a sequel or a remake. I have not watch the original Halloween so I don't know whether this is better than the original one. It shows the beginning of Michael Myers becoming a deadly killer. Since this is directed by Rob Zombie, if you watched his movies, you know that this will be full of blood and nudity. It is basically brutal. There is not really any gore but it is very bloody. Since it is a horror slasher movie, it got to have bloody violence. Rob never fail to do that.It is okay for a slasher movie, it does have the usual bloody violence and nudity. The violence and the nudity won't be a problem. The story plot is okay, enough to hold me to the seat. It is pretty engrossing as I am interested in knowing how the young Michael becomes a violent, deadly killer. I am surprised that even the young Michael can kill almost all his family members. After all catching of him and whatever I am not interested, it goes to the future when Michael is big and is a great man. He goes and search for his youngest sister and from there, he slashes at anyone who is in his way.Overall, Rob did a good job in making the story engrossing. It does have the main thing people want, the violence. Rob also like sex scenes which are in this movie. Everything equal to a slasher movie, not bad and not good. That is the appeal to people. The story does not really have dragging parts and it could have been more interesting.",Halloween
190,randyfromscream,Just a lazy entree of Halloween reboots,5,16 September 2017,"This film is bad mix with good. I just hate it how they use sex joke like any teenager would laugh at. Micheal does look good I have to admit. Their's good death scene in this movie too. As a fan of John Carpenter's Halloween films this is weak compared to the first one. The story line feels rush like this film needs to come out so bad. They're parts that are enjoyable and fails sometimes. I'd watch the Unrated Director's cut and it's good, a minor improvement.Score for Unrated Director's cut: 7.5/10",Halloween
191,johnny-08,Zombie's vision of Michael Myers,5,3 January 2008,"Carpenter's ""Halloween"", after all these years, still holds a very high place on the list of best horror movies ever. Zombie's ""Halloween"" shouldn't be compared to original cause that is impossible. Zombie's work stands alone and try to judge Zombie's try, that is not that bad after all. Cause Zombie went from the beginning, from Michael Myers childhood. Michael was a different from others and that is way he was humiliated in school but he was even humiliated at his home. From his drunk stepfather to his older sister. The only persons he loved were his mother and his little sister and that's because they showed him some love. I am not trying to say that Michael would turn out to be normal man without humiliation that he had to put up on all sides, cause clearly it was something wrong with him. Those teasing from his surrounding only helped to make him the real Michael Myers. And even there Zombie makes a turn; the best scene in this movie is the one when Michael first gets to his sister (when they are grown up and alone in that room). One commentary excellently says that Zombie tried to give a monster a soul. And that is true. So try to watch Zombie's movie from this point of view. Even tough there are big minuses in this movie: from bad acting to a slaughter without any sense. If you cannot ignore this ""minor"" things, this movie is not for you. Of course legendary Danny Trejo has a role in this one (why am I not surprised). Oh, and also the casting of Daeg Faerch for the role of young Myers is brilliant. He is so creepy and great at the same time (the only good thing except Zombie's soul monster in this movie).",Halloween
192,DustinRahksi,Way to much Mr.Rob Zombie.,5,9 December 2012,"It seems every time I watch a Rob Zombie movie I get nauseous, but not because of the violence. The film starts off with a young homicidal Micheal rampaging around. On the outside you wouldn't suspect a killer, but on the inside he is messed up. The violence towards animals was unnecessary, kind of hard to root for Micheal after that, but he makes a comeback. The violence in this movie is hardcore and in your face, and I mean he doesn't just kill people, he brutalizes them. Most of them deserve it though, low-life scum. The fact that those guards raped that girl in the asylum was very unsettling.The characters were God awe-full, the atrocious dialogue didn't help one bit. On the plus side we get Malcolm Mcdowell and Brad Douriff, they were enjoyable to watch, and were the only ones I cared for. The main actress was really annoying, and I felt Danielle Harris was better than her. But they do a much better job in the sequel though, so it worked out somewhat.This film is better than most of the other films in the franchise, but that isn't saying much. I did enjoy the sequel to this film much more than I enjoyed this film. If you like your doses of violence, sex, and nudity cranked up, than this is a film for you, if not stay away.",Halloween
193,Rathko,A Disappointing Miss,6,4 September 2007,"I was a big fan of 'Devil's Rejects'. Rob Zombie displayed a genuine understanding of the psychological (and sociological) foundations of the grindhouse exploitation movies of the 70s and created a far more authentic homage to the genre than either Tarantino or Rodriguez' contribution to 'Grindhouse'. The original 'Halloween', by comparison, was a slow and deliberate exercise in suspense. It was never intended to shock or appall in the calculated way of grindhouse, but to build up an unbearable sense of atmospheric dread.It's interesting, therefore, that Zombie should remake 'Halloween' rather than, say, 'Last House on the Left'. Perhaps that was the point - to inject some of that dark and ugly nihilism in to what is, let's be honest, a spooky boogeyman movie. There was hope for celebration, but unfortunately, the results are decidedly hit and miss.When Zombie has the chance to create something original, the movie really shines. In the first half, acting as a kind of prologue, Sheri Moon gives her best performance yet, managing to be sympathetic even while resigning herself to her abusive boyfriend, and while this back story never offers a real reason for Michael's psychosis, young Faerch's performance is so intense as to be consistently interesting to watch. The sequences within the sanatorium are suitably cold and sterile, and it's refreshing to see a vision of a modern criminal psychiatric unit that rejects the genre clichés of dripping ceilings, flickering lights and decaying walls. McDowell is suitably over-the-top as Dr. Loomis, but never descends to the gleeful scenery-chewing theatrics of Donald Pleasance. But it is here that the screenplay starts to falter. At no point, despite copious interviews, does Loomis ever come close to making any diagnosis, however tentative, or seem able to offer the viewer any understanding of Michael's particular psychosis. This lack of explanation makes the entire prologue, and Zombie's claims of making Michael more real, redundant. After a full hour of exposition, we are still no closer to understanding Michael than we were in the opening scenes of the original movie.Once 'Halloween' switches to 're-imaging' mode, Zombie seems to be bored by his obligation to shoot a scene-for-scene remake. The originals slow-build suspense is replaced with one hysterical chase sequence after another, but none have that dirty, ugly, sadistic quality that Zombie brought to 'The Devil's Rejects'. There's little real violence or gore, or even the cringing suggestion of it, and the movie quickly becomes dull. Despite a last act that, departing from the original, allows Zombie some level of creativity and kicks things up into top gear again, it's too little too late.The narrative is tight, and several of the performances are better than is to be expected from the genre. Tyler Mane is great as the adult Michael Myers, and brings the most physical and intimidating version of 'The Shape' to date. But Zombie, for all his developing talent, seems hampered by his own creative conceit, and despite several genuinely affecting scenes, the movie is nowhere near as good as it could, and should, have been.",Halloween
194,FKDZ,Trailer Trash,2,17 November 2020,"What a waste time. I watched the unrated version and this being my first rob zombie movie I had my expectations but I guess I underestimated how ''f$#%ing'' bad this movie is.Everyone in this movie is written like the most despicable character in any other movie. Mean, selfish and downright unrealistic. Especially when it's all supposed to take place in some nice suburbs?! The acting is okay, but the writing is some of the worst I've ever seen. How are we supposed to root for anyone here, where is the motivation, backstory...etc? A big negative as well is that this movie decided to make a sort of prequel and show how Michael was created. But oh my god, could they be any less subtle and at the same time vague? I was actually kinda looking forward to what his story might be. But he ends up just randomly killing his family so we still have nothing explained about that except they took a lot longer to do it. Also then he gets sent to prison in solitary but also not? Like they show how the boy is becoming worse and worse but where are the other people in the sanitorium? Throughout the whole first hour this entire segment plays out it seems like he is alone in that prison. And ofcourse, surrounded by the most degenerate guards and nurses that can only be mean. There's one nice guy but he gets so little screen time versus the bad guys.The music is all over the place, from the very moment they used the iconic theme I felt it was very misplaced. Like once again I did not go into this movie thinking it was going to be bad or anything. But so much of it was just wrong. The music throughout the movie is okay but nothing really works.Secondly the directing, if this is zombie's style then I guess I am not a fan, messy, blurry, clunky. I found myself having to refocus so many times, and in general just hated how any action scene had some incredibly shaky cam just to make the poor lackluster choreography look decent. In general it was professional in a sense, but it's too much, there's so little thought put to any of the shots, framing or anything. Most of it is just tons of background blur and some crazy zoom on the character. Also the contrast is turned up to 11 so everything looks grungy and dirty.Now about the fact this is a remake, for me I liked some of the new things it tried but also hated when it just redid things we've already seen in the original Halloween, like I couldn't be less interested in the 3 girls walking home from school and getting stalked by michael. This is also where the movie just gets even worse and turns into a character after character kill count. And ofcourse, these kills aren't without nudity, I thought the friday the 13th movies were egregious but this blows it out of the water. I mean if you're a woman in this movie you're almost guaranteed to die topless. It's just makes the movie feel so much cheaper.I don't think this movie brought any more value than the original already had. The attempted backstory for michael is not properly fleshed out, dragged out and has many plot holes. The family dynamic that supposedly drove him to become a psychopath is terrible, especially the stepfather being incredibly unrealistic. I'd rather have it vague like the original, than attempt some backstory that makes no sense in the end.Also about the first killings with young michael, he puts on the big micheal mask but it looks hilarious? was this intended because what was supposed to be a defining scene looked so foolish. The gore is okay-ish in this movie, I'd argue some halloween sequels before this had much better kills. Also of course this movie does the same kills we saw in the original but in a much less interesting manner. Like the kill where the guy is held up by the knife on the wall which is so well shot in the original, here it's filmed from the bottom of the staircase looking up and you barely see michael turning his head because the scene is so dark.2/10 skipped a couple of times towards the end because this is nowhere near worth 2 hours of your time.",Halloween
195,bayardhiler,"Interesting Take, But Nothing Beats The Original",6,5 October 2012,"After watching Rob Zombie's take on the Halloween Saga, I am left with mixed feelings about the movie. On the one hand, there are some things that were good for the movie. First, the back story concerning Michael's dysfunctional family gave him a motive for his insanity, which allowed the viewer to connect with him as a human being. Malcolm Mcdowell gave a fine performance as Dr. Sam Loomis, especially with Michael as a young boy, and it should also be noted that Daeg Faerch did a magnificent job playing a disturbed ten-year old Michael. Some other good qualities include the original music score and an almost perfect match to the original mask. However, Rob Zombie fails to capture what made the original version so good. The violence in this version is plentiful and leaves nothing to the imagination as opposed to the original, where Carpenter chose to focus on creating a spooky and foreboding mode. If you look at Carpenter's version by itself, you did not know why Michael was doing what he was doing or whether he was even human. After all, if you look at the credits, Michael is referred to as simply the shape since he can come and go as he pleases, like a ghost. Here, we don't get that same feeling. With that said, how would I rate this movie? Well, if you are someone who is really looking for a motive to Michael's madness, this would not be a bad film to check out. However, if you are a die hard fan of the original version, you might want to stay away. My vote is 6 out of 10.",Halloween
196,LanceBrave,"The Zombie-fication of ""Halloween""",7,3 November 2013,"When it was announced that Rob Zombie was going to remake ""Halloween,"" the fandom reaction was mixed. How would someone remake ""Halloween?"" More importantly, how would Rob Zombie remake ""Halloween?"" By turning it into a Rob Zombie movie. The movie focuses on Michael Myers. The previously squeaky clean Myers household is given the Rob Zombie make-over. Little Michael is an ugly kid. His mother is a stripper. His sister wears shorts-shorts and has anonymous sex. Most obnoxiously, Michael gains a vulgar step father. Everyone swears and makes crude sexual references. Little Mikey lives in a house but his family would probably fit in better in a trailer.Michael's transformation from normal kid to soulless killer is no longer unexplained. His home life sucks. He's bullied at school. He shows early signs of psychotic behavior, torturing animals. His initial murders are no longer unexplained. Michael is striking back at his tormentors. Even after being imprisoned, his violence is provoked by people being jerks to him. Michael's time in Smith's Grove, completely untouched upon in the original, form a major portion of Zombie's ""Halloween."" Dr. Sam Loomis, child psychologist, spends hours talking with him, analyzing his motives and psychological trauma. The transformation from human to monster is gradual, a boy retreating into his own mind, eventually forgetting how to interact with anyone with something other then brutal violence. The barely human ghost of Carpenter's classic is not present. Rob Zombie completely reinterprets Michael Myers as his own character.Zombie reinterprets most everything about the original. Dr. Loomis isn't a dark knower of evil. Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis is a real psychologist. He isn't terrified of Myers. Instead, he feels sympathy for him. His guilt over failing to heal Michael drives him. Loomis has made millions from a best-selling book he's written, something other characters are willing to chastise him for. In the theatrical version, Loomis speaks the ""Blackest Eyes"" speech. However, it's completely wrong coming out of this Loomis' mouth. Carpenter worked in archetypes. Zombie delves into his character's psyches.The Zombie-fication of ""Halloween"" extends to the content. Zombie's trademark over-the-top profanity, extreme gore, and sleazy exploitation fills the movie. ""F**k"" is every other word. Even wholesome characters drop f-bombs. A random trucker describes his bowel movement. The movie is intensely bloody. Throats are slashed and blood pours in torrents. Bones are cracked. Nobody dies easily in Zombie's universe. Characters suffers and weep in agony before dying. Corpses stew in pools of rust red blood. Zombie loads the movie with sex and nudity. Judith and her boyfriend rut in bed. Lynda walks around fully nude. Nancy talks dirty with her boyfriend. In the director's cut, most disturbingly, a pair of Smith's Grove orderlies rape a female inmate. This was so unnecessary that it was cut from the theatrical version with no effect on the plot. I feel like this remake probably would have been better received if Zombie had dialed back his white trash aesthetic.Zombie ultimately made Myers too human. It's hard to imagine a teenage boy decimating his family the way lil' Michael does in this. A major story turn involves Michael killing the one person who was kind to him in the hospital. This is supposes to show that the kid is too far gone. It doesn't work and instead seems out-of-character. Daeg Faerch growing into 6' 9"" Tyler Mane seems unbelievable. Despite being very human, Michael maintains his super-strength from the later sequels. He smashes bathroom stalls, explodes through doors and walls, and crushes a man's skull with his bare hands. Myers adsorbs bullets with ease like no human could.In general, the director tries to have it both ways. This is when Zombie's ""Halloween"" truly falters. After following its killer's evolution for the first hour and change, this becomes a standard remake. Laurie, Nancy, and Lynda go about their school days, interacting with their parents and boyfriends. Because this is a Rob Zombie movie, Laurie cracks crude jokes about bagels, Lynda cusses out her teachers, and Nancy calls her friends ""b**ches."" Zombie recreates sequences from Carpenter's original, Michael stalking his prey throughout the day. Loomis is suddenly hunting Michael like he's an evil superbeing. Laurie babysits Tommy and Lindsey, even watching ""The Thing from Another World"" and ""Forbidden Planet"" on TV with them. The sudden story change disrupts the pace, flow, and intent of the story. Suddenly, 2007's ""Halloween"" isn't a character study but another slasher film.Zombie loads his cast with cult actors new and old. Malcolm McDowell actually gives a thoughtful performance as Dr. Loomis, making the character his own. Danny Trejo shows his softer side in his small supporting role, a highlight of the film. Dee Wallace excels at mother roles, given her natural warmness. However, more often then not, the stunt casting is distracting. William Forsythe, Lew Temple, Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, and Leslie Easterbrook go way over the top in their small roles. Brad Doriff, Richard Lynch, Udo Kier, Clint Howard, and Sybal Danning, all actors I love, are mostly in the movie so you can point at them and say, ""Hey, I recognize them!"" The young talent isn't much better. Danielle Harris and Kristina Klebe can't make Zombie's unseemly dialogue workable. Only Scout Taylor-Compton wins the audience over. Her Laurie has a lovable repor with her family and the young kids. Taylor-Compton actually works far better as a normal teenager, as her scream queen routine is mostly unconvincing. She's cute as a button too, which helps.Zombie's ""Halloween"" is too long by ten minutes, an additional act being added to the climax. Ultimately, I admire Zombie's film more then I like it. All the sequels were beholden to Carpenter's original. Zombie, mostly, does his own thing. The real question is ""Is this a Halloween film?"" I'm not sure I have an answer.",Halloween
197,lagriff05,"A 21st century re-enaction of a classic horror movie, and not bad at all",8,15 September 2007,"All of you whining and moaning about how this is unfaithful to the original Halloween - well, you all might as well just shut up and go back to your PG-13 ghost stories. Rob Zombie had the balls to touch up this indisputable classic to modern standards, and I'd say he did a damn good job of it, whether you like his directing style or not. He's unleashed a monster, as this is a visceral, gritty beast that doesn't care who it kills.Everything that made the original Halloween good is pretty much gone here, so it's safe to say you can just treat this as a separate movie. That's the thing people don't get, though - they just want to compare it to the old one. While the original Halloween was a quiet, elusive, rather sleek and stealthy stalker, this film is an overweight, crushing, mountainous behemoth that lets loose a raging storm of blood, guts, and brutality. It was honestly the only path Halloween could've taken in the modern day - horror films aren't made these days like they were in the 70s. Back then, the waters were simply being tested, and there was rarely any real blood or gore thrown at you; opting more for subtle, silent shocks that crept up on you from behind. Fast forward twenty years, and horror films are mostly about brutality, gore, and more gore, scaring one through a slightly different version of the ""what if?"" sort of scares utilized when one puts himself into the position of the average victim in a movie like Halloween '78. Haute Tension, The Devil's Rejects and now (to a lesser extent) Halloween '07 are frightening in the same way that the classic horror films were frightening - they have terrifying, realistic, and brutal plot devices that could actually happen to you. In The Devil's Rejects, a group of friends - normal, innocent people who have done nothing - are tortured, raped, and murdered by this group of depraved, back-country maniacs, just for the hell of it. Some might call that crass, and it is, but it's what modern horror movies should be. All things evolve, all things take new forms with time, and horror films are no different. Like it or not, Halloween '07 is a further realization of this fact, with more gore in the first 15 minutes than the old Halloween had in it's entire duration. Would you really want any other modern horror director to remake this classic film? I daresay that in the hands of anyone else, this would've just been a bland, boring, ""playing-it-safe"" tribute to Carpenter and his greatness, but Zombie is too good for that. He takes a good film and puts a new spin on it, which is something I rarely ever see in horror remakes, ever. Halloween '07 isn't retro, and it doesn't hold back it's rock-hard blows, but the series had nowhere to go but here in the 21st century. If you don't like it, feel free to leave the hall.I was skeptical about this movie initially, not sure how Zombie would handle it...but my fears were not realized, as Zombie has actually done quite a fine job here. His directing style is harsh and relentless as usual, and his characters are dirty and mean, crass and rude. The hospital scenes were very good, a nice addition. The Haddonfield scenes are good, but not as great as the first half, and the movie drags on for too long. The new Laurie is quite spunky, actually a GREAT choice for the role. I wouldn't have picked anyone else, and I really have no gripes at all with our leading lady's performance. The other actors here are not quite up to the challenge, but I'll let it slide; it's a B horror film for Christ's sake. As I mentioned, the last half hour or so really does drag on unnecessarily, but fortunately the ending is spectacular, showcasing a much darker, bleaker, more hopeless Halloween than any of us thought possible. Watching Laurie's bloody, gore-streaked face as she pulled the trigger of the gun, and then hearing her agonized cry as she let go of it as the credits began to roll...well, that's something you'll have to see for yourself. Only Zombie could pull this off, and he did an absolutely marvelous job.My biggest gripe with this is that it's not subtle at all. We don't get a Michael Myers that lurks in the shadows, and we don't get any suspense when he kills the sex-crazed teens, he just gets right to the point. It's just too straightforward and pugilistic, too ""in your face"" to really work on all levels. That's the only reason I took some points off, and that's definitely most of what I meant when I said that ""everything that made the original Halloween good is pretty much gone."" But this isn't the original Halloween, and nobody should have expected it to be. This is a new horror film for a generation desperately in need of innovation, and I can safely recommend it to the more open minded fans of the genre.",Halloween

199,CrassActionHero,Better Than The Original and Here's Why,6,10 September 2007,"Halloween(2007) Review: Now Rob Zombie takes the task of remaking Halloween. I understand why he wanted to. Halloween needs the treatment.Halloween from Zombie's perspective takes a whole new turn. Here we have the entire back story on why Micheal Myers became such a killer, a psychopath. The story does fit well and helps huge. Myers' father is dead,his stepfather is a total lazy jerk, his mother is a sleazy stripper, his big sister is a whore, and despite warning signs of his rage manifesting, his mother pays no attention to it. Wrong move.Little Myers goes homicidal on his family except his baby sister and is institutionalized in a mental ward. This is great development. The first half hour alone is far more chilling than the entire original movie. After fifteen years, Myers escapes from the mental ward and goes homicidal again, this time to find his baby sister. What really works here is Myers does not say a word, and the 6'8 Tyler Mane makes Myers look quite menacing. Zombie does Myers justice.However this isn't without it's drawbacks. The killing does get a little tedious as Myers is mostly killing your horny teens. It's the old cliché. You have sex, you die. This happened a little too often.We do have a good cast. Malcolm McDowell is good as Dr.Sam Loomis. Our star is Scout Taylor Compton, and she's perfect as Laurie Strode...and very cute. The final thirty minutes of Halloween are indeed the best parts of the entire movie. Suspense and thrills galore. Even I jumped a bit out of my seat.The Last Word: Zombie does it again. After seeing the original and this, Zombie destroys Carpenter and then some. He makes Myers chilling, menacing, and fiendish. This could have been better, but still decent.",Halloween
200,kevin_crighton,"not the worst, but yet another pointless remake (plot details and possible spoilers)",3,28 September 2007,"During the trailer for this movie, the voice-over announces that this is Rob Zombies' extreme version of a classic. That says everything you need to know about this really. What it doesn't say however, is that it's not scary, not as intelligent, and not as well written as the original.The remake does start differently to the original. The original starts with Micheal Myers murdering his sister. The remake goes further into Micheal's past. It attempts to show how Micheal turns into a killer, going from killing small animals, to killing people. However, these scenes are flawed either by poor editing or simply bad writing. In short, Micheal kills his sister, her boyfriend and his step-father, because his sister doesn't take him trick or treating at Halloween. At least, that's what comes across. Before this, he kills a bully because...well he's a bully. And all this happens AFTER a dead animal is found in his school bag.Anyway, at this point, enter Dr. Loomis. He spends the next 16 years trying to talk to Micheal to find out why he killed his family. He even finds the time to write a book about the case too.So, Micheal escapes. He returns to Haddonfield and there the story pretty much follows the original with a couple of little differences....The cast led by Malcolm McDowell do their best, but sadly pale to those in the original. Rod Zombie as a director gets better from each movie, from House Of 1000 Corpses, to The Devil's Rejects, to this. But sadly as a writer, he's written a badly paced and plotted movie.The problems? Well to being with, the motivation for Micheal killing the family is ridiculous. And when the cat is found in his bag and his mother is called in to talk with the principal and Loomis, no-one seems to notice Micheal calmly leaves the school and goes to kill the bully without anyone seeing him!! As for the scenes of him in the Asylum, he attacks a nurse for no obvious reason, except possibly to show he's gone REALLY BAD.When he does escape, and finally gets to Haddonfield for the carnage to begin, another movie springs to mind : Friday THE 13TH - JASON TAKES MANHATTAN. In that movie, Jason spends most of the movie getting to New York, and little time there. Here most of the movie seems spent getting Micheal to Haddonfield for Halloween, and then condenses all the events as copied from the original into maybe half the movie. Better pacing of the movie would have helped.The death scenes are as bloody as you'd expect in a Rob Zombie movie. Well at least in the first half of the movie. Strangely, when it comes to the second half, the deaths scenes are less bloody and more like the original, which was not a bloody movie.Despite this there are key plot points never dealt with in the movie:1. How did Micheal get to Haddonfield? Drive? It's never explained. To be fair, it's never explained in the original how he drives either!2.He lets his baby sister survive the family massacre. Okay, fine. But how did he know who she is, and where she lives. Remember Laurie was adopted. Loomis didn't know about it, so how did Micheal.3.Since when was Micheal suddenly unkillable? The original plays on the fact he might actually be the bogeyman. Here? Well it plays like just another Halloween sequel in truth.Crucially however, Zombie ruins the ending. The original did leave it open as to the fate of Myers (which turned out to be a series of tiresome sequels!). But it did have a killer of a last line. Here, the confrontation between Laurie and Micheal goes on far too long. And as for the killer line ''Was he the bogeyman? 'As a matter of fact he was' ' all the got from the audience was laughter. I think that reflects more on those watching it now as opposed to when the original came out.But the main problem with this movie, and this is something I've been having a go about for the past couple of years, is that this is a movie that didn't need to be made. The original is a classic movie. This movie does nothing or adds anything that the original didn't need or do better.I feel Zombie would have been better served with either making a completely new horror movie, or if he had the need to enter the Halloween series, then possibly doing a story about how Micheal became the killer. The scenes here about that are the better part of the movie, and if written better could have made an interesting and compelling tale. The remake of BLACK Christmas managed to fit in a killer's background, via flashback and still keep the flow of the story and movie going. Here, it's almost half-prequel/half-remake. Personally, a full prequel would have been better. As it stands however, this movie is a poor version of the original HALLOWEEN.",Halloween
201,Ozzy2000,Your usual slasher remake,6,17 June 2008,A remake of the 1978 John Carpenter slasher/horror film. The original Carpenter relied more on suspense and intrigue which made the less revealed evil protagonist even more horrific. It was also made at a time when zombie films were less frequent and thus more impacting. This remake about the young Mike Meyers who grows up to be an almost invincible masked zombie slasher with no mercy is in your face with blood and gore at every turn. The characters are reduced to trashy white American one dimensional and slutty figures in the case of the females in this film and is probably aimed at similar audiences. None the less the film is entertaining and lives up to the genre of a slasher zombie blood and gore. These films have a sufficient American audience base in the USA to make it to the screen internationally and obviously have their fan base here. I tend to watch most horror movies with friends at home when they come on DVD as I did with this one as the effects are predictable and still entertaining on the wide LCD/ Plasma screen. Also it gives everyone a chance to have a good belly laugh as they find themselves alluding to the obvious faults of the film. I am giving it three stars for its entertainment value perhaps on a multiple DVD viewing night as a primer to a a higher quality film your going top view. No doubt slasher fans will elevate it to collectible class.,Halloween
202,Ibuk,I watched in horror... as Zombie destroyed my favourite horror movie,1,6 January 2008,"I am not familiar with Rob Zombie's previous work but with a name like Zombie I thought he was destined to make horror movies. I recently watched the original Halloween for the first time a few weeks ago so the original was fresh in my mind. The original was terrifying and was a landmark film. The remake is a pale imitation and is a insult to the original. Zombie seems to have replaced the horror element with vile sex references. Zombie seems to think that all teenagers are whores, which in fact there are not. There is also no real tension as Micheal slays his victims.It did however start quite promisingly. After Micheal butchers his sister and his dad things start to go downhill. After that it becomes a psychological drama as Micheal is put into a institution. Halloween however fails on that count too because there is no real explanation behind Micheal's behaviour. That is what disappointed me the most because the whole reason why I watched the remake was so that I could find out why Myers was why he was. I do have quite a lot of patience but I just couldn't bear to watch more than half of it, believe me I tried to. In my opinion John Carpenter should sue Zombie for making such an atrocious mess of his superb masterpiece.",Halloween
203,tequila101,Not one of the best re-imaginings but still hits at becoming something,7,8 December 2011,"I took a look at the 2007 prequel/re-imagining of John Carpentar's Halloween again and I decided to start on a fresh review. This is another film which didn't need the remake trend, but it got it anyway. I continually watched this film and was blown away in some parts wondering on how the director, Rob Zombie was going to explore the inside mind of Michael Myers. I am going to talk about the remake's pros, cons and I will also relate to the original if I must (In most cases I will).The story on the whole is exactly the same as John Carpentar's 1978 suspense classic which it is about a boy who commits a brutal murder and is sent to Smith's Grove sanitarium. After fifteen years, he escapes and goes on the look out, stalking and killing baby sitters in the quiet home town, Haddonfield Illinois.Carpentar's creepy film is yet one of my favorite horror films of all time and going into the remake I had semi-sorta high/low expectations for it. I got the good mixing with the bad anyways. I for one will say it is one of the better remakes to come in a while since we've had re-hashes which become random. Here, I believe this remake belongs on a new level.Let's talk about Michael Myers. In this remake he's brutal, a giant and when a low angle shot is looking up at him, he's larger than life. It may have made him a monster but it never made him scary. The way he walks around the street is lame. He's just walking, where's the supernatural qualities? He was'nt scary because in the original, Myersused the environment to his advantage. He mysteriously moved among the houses, bushes and trees so that he wasn't seen. Zombie strips Michael of the supernatural qualities and decides to have him lumber about. Wasn't that effective but what I did find effective was the way he got the mask, it being stitched up. It sets a new tone for the film when he got the iconic mask. I also liked the way he got possession of the jumpsuit. The way he killed people in this film was very bloody and really brutal on all levels. I was expecting this since it was a Rob Zombie film and Zombie films aren't for everyone. Another thing I liked to point out was Tyler Mane as the adult Michael Myers. Truly a menacing figure of death. There haven't been many good actors as Myers over the past decades and Mane sure knew how to play this role.I also liked the eerie, dark music that Rob set in this film. Not as effective as John Carpentar's soundtrack suite but it was still a joy to listen to. The only problem with the music was once again it just wasn't that scary. In the original, the music makes the film really creepy and sets the climax of being a scary horror film.The acting at many points was very dry and it didn't seem to work. Most of the time there's tones of swearing and lots of screaming. Brad Dourif is perfect in his role, Malclom Mcdowell wasn't too bad. The rest of the cast was a stinker. I didn't like Scott Taylor Comptom a bit. She was very whiny, really repetitive and should have been like Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie. Much more neater there.The one major flaw I did have in this new version was the back story. A disappointment. It wasn't realistic at all.. Killing animals? Abusive family issues? White Trash environment? Getting bullied. I have no idea why Rob' approach to this film was like his previous films. I would have been better if he didn't explain Michael away because it ruins him later on. Unlike the ""Nightmare"" remake, Zombie humanizes him to a point where we are supposed to have sympathy for him. Weren't supposed to feel sorry for Michael, we're supposed like him but not feel sad for him. We root for him. Chaning him into being another slasher and not ""The Shape"" really ruins Michael. As mentioned I love the Michael in this film but humanizing him and not making him a monster really annoys me. I think for any director it would have been hard to go through Michael and give him a decent back story.A lot of people also had problems with the swearing and sex scenes. I never had a problem with those things. But what buggers me is the use of rock style music and the like, like ""Love Hurts""??? Who wants to hear that in a ""Halloween"" film??? I know I don't.Despite being a little bit negative, I do like the film, I really do. It's another one of those remakes where you think ""It won't be as good as the original, but it'll still be good"". When I watched it again, my hopes were enlighten. The beginning feels like a waste because there's all of this false explaining which feels unnecessary. But trust me, it picks up after the first forty minutes and you won't regret watching this film. It ends up becoming a fun film where you will just watch it and think of how brutal it is compared to the original. It's definitely not on the level that the original is but it's still a decent remake which works in most areas.Another thing I will point out is that it is one of the best films in the franchise since Halloween II (1981). I also like 20 years later. The remake is on the level those films are. It is the fourth favorite ""Halloween"" film I have seen. A decent take on. 7/10",Halloween
204,daworldismine,best halloween since the original,10,24 November 2007,"the most surprising thing for me when i watched this movie was, they have actually managed to make michael myers scary again. after halloween resurrection i thought things could only get worse for the phychopath killer, well as soon as i knew rob zombie was doing the remake i was happy because both house of 1000 corpses and the devil's rejects were quality horror movies, made by someone who clearly knew how to make them. what i like about rob's halloween is that he's not simply just remaking a classic, he's expanding on it. bringing he's own vision to the story, and as much as the Texas chainsaw massacre remake thought it had. deep down it's just a cash in, anyway youv'e never seen michael like this, he is evil. the new dr.loomis is great as well. to sum it up A MUST SEE MOVIE.",Halloween
205,marc5477,Not for the artsy fartsies,6,12 March 2017,"The artsy crowd (you know who they are), will not like this one and will prefer the original brain dead version which has no story, soul, horror, or suspense. It couldn't even scare me when I was 5 and I must have watched a dozen times (not much else on back then).This one is not bad. At least the directors and writers had enough guts to try and tell a story unlike the original snorefest. Mind you I don't think this one is great, and certainly I wouldn't say that it was scary (then again I am much older now), but at least the character of Michael is menacing and I can somewhat think of him as a threat. The original Michael was a just a pansy who resorted to sneaking around like a peeping tom and sucker punching people from behind. The new one is in your face and tough as nails.Overall I think its a good horror movie. Not great, certainly not scary, but like I said prior, at they had the guts to try and tell a story which is more than I can say about most cheesy cliché horror movies made today where they try to maintain ""mystery"" by avoiding story and resorting to action, gore, cheap scares, and lets not forget nudity (though this one does it too).",Halloween

Laurie and Michael both fall off of a balcony and Loomis's gun goes off just as Michael grabs her wrist.This remake and re-imagining by Rob Zombie is the Halloween remake that I really enjoyed and was fantastic, but the style of the movie is very bloody, brutal and gory and this is the only scary movie where it bothers me. I don't mind blood and violence and gore in a movie at all, it's just that it can go too far in a few areas.I like what Rob Zombie wanted to do and he successfully succeeded in this film, doing both a prequel and remake and that is one heck of an achievement.Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psychic, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people , whereas Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.The acting is amazing in this film and I'm gonna break it down for you. Daeg Ferch plays young Michael Myers and Tyler Mane plays the adult Michael Myers and they both do wonderful jobs as the killing machine and I don't think anyone else could have played it any better.Malcolm McDowell plays Dr. Loomis, the character that the late Donald Pleasence played in the original series of films, with the exception of ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" and ""Halloween: Resurrection"" and he might not have what Pleasence has, but his performance really does shine out.Danielle Harris plays Annie Brackett and I was surprised to find out that she was Jamie Lloyd in the previous Halloween films, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" and ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" and she is amazing as Brackett. Brad Dourif, who is known as Chucky / Charles Lee Ray in the Child's Play movies is playing her dad, Sheriff Brackett and he does an amazing job and he was the perfect casting choice.Kristina Klebe plays Lynda van Der Klok and she is amazing in the screen time that she has, but there is one problem that I have with her and that is way too much personality, but I had to admit the way she was killed was a little bit too intense and it had me jump once Michael Myers choked her by her throat and she can't breathe. That was cool, but I have to admit she captured P.J. Soles's famous scene brilliantly, but did they have to show her really without any clothes on? No! That is bullcrap. The original had Lynda put on her shirt. That was it! Which brings me to the teen kissing, like Freddy vs. Jason and some scary movies, they take some of the kissing a little bit too far, but Zombie is the director of this, not me, because if it was me directing this, I would have tone some of the kissing scenes down.Back to the acting, Scout Taylor-Compton is really fantastic and amazing as Laurie Strode and she captured Jamie Lee Curtis's performance in the films wonderfully as well. Sheri Moon Zombie, Rob Zombie's real life, plays Michael Myers' mom, Deborah Myers and she does really good in the screen time that she has.Tyler Bates' musical score for this film is wonderfully well done and it is really great and his musical scores for ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" were really great and it is just spectacular and fantastic. The way his version of John Carpenter's Halloween theme was really great and amazing. I still love the John Carpenter version of the HALLOWEEN THEME and the other versions of the theme song is really amazing, but the only film that it does not appear in ""HALLOWEEN III: Season of the Witch"".Overall, I love the new version of HALLOWEEN and while it still has some major elements that I have a problem with, but I still like the remake.9/10",Halloween
207,droog-56936,A Rob Zombie Winner,9,19 October 2019,I don't know what these other reviewers are going on about cause this modernization of the original classic is great.

This is as close to being murdered by a superhuman slasher as you're likely to get.,Halloween
208,Craig_McPherson,Rob Zombie's journey into Michael Myers' heart of darkness,7,1 September 2007,"In the almost 30 years since John Carpenter unleashed the killing machine that is Michael Myers, the Shatner-masked psycho has carved a niche for himself alongside such other legendary unstoppable maniacs as Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. However, none of the seven Halloween movies he's appeared in have given the audience much, if any, insight into what created this monster. That is, until now.Almost half of Zombie's screenplay is devoted to showing the perfect alignment of internal and external factors that came together to form the ""perfect storm"", as Myer's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (McDowell) explains it, and brought forth the knife-wielding monster sometimes known as The Shape.By the age of 10, the youthful Michael (Faerch) appears as an introverted, bullied kid with a hidden fixation for killing small animals. Born into a dysfunctional family with a loving stripper Mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), wheelchair-bound abusive stepfather (Forsythe), and self-centered and uncaring older sister (Hall), young Michael begins exhibiting early signs of split personality with his dark evil half fond of taking refuge behind various masks.In keeping with John Carpenter's original story, the young Michael finally snaps on Halloween night and slaughters his entire family. Only his mother and infant sister, whom he cradles lovingly as the police arrive, are spared.Zombie, who is maturing as a director and screenwriter at an incredibly quick rate, provides nuanced insight into the youthful Myers' neurosis during several scenes in the psychiatric prison where he is locked away. Interviews with Loomis, visits from his Mom, and a bond formed with the prison janitor (Trejo) all reveal the dominant emergence of the black, evil half, and the suppressed, in-denial human portion that would eventually be shunted to the back of the killing machine mind. The end result of this is a monster that is much more real, corporeal and terrifying than the quasi-supernatural uni-dimensional creature that Carpenter created.Once Zombie gets through painting his back story tableau, the movie moves into more conventional territory as it tells the story of the adult Michael's (Mane) escape from his psychiatric prison and subsequent stalking of his now adopted baby sister Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) who has no knowledge of her deranged older brother and blood-bathed family history. Yet even in this second half, among the narrative that more closely sticks to Carpenter's version, Zombie manages to insert interesting hints that Michael is not entirely lost to his dark half.Of course, there's no shortage of critics lining up to pan this film, which, I suppose, is to be expected given that the horror genre seems forever relegated to hillbilly trailer-trash status among the pantheon of cinematic blue-bloods, however with Halloween, Zombie shows he is a growing, maturing, and future force to be reckoned with in a genre that has long been given a cinematic short shrift.",Halloween
209,bhester0806,It's a good movie despite what some reviews reflect,7,11 July 2021,Look I'm a die hard Halloween fan and there's nothing that will ever top Halloween '78 and the scares and suspense it provided but this film doesn't try to top that in this remake.RZ essentially reimagines the character of Micheal through a more modern lens while still using the same story from '78 and it works for me. Yes it's weird seeing Michael as anything other than a mindless killing machine but that's what we get here.The only real complain is the perhaps the the first act of the movie is drug out a little much with classic Zombie banter among the parents but once we get past that it's a solid film worth the time.,Halloween

211,TheMovieDoctorful,"Overhyped On BOTH Sides...Not A Masterpiece, Not A Disaster",5,16 October 2018,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is a film that I initially loved on first watch, but really soured on me the last time I saw it. The stuff that I liked on initial viewing is still strong, but every problem I had back then has just grown more and more significant over time. On top of that, on watching the many Halloween sequels, I find that many of the things that I admired this film for doing are done much more maturely and intelligently in many of those films. This doesn't negate any of my positives, but it definitely gives me perspective that this film isn't as brilliant and daring as I had initially perceived it to beAs far as the positives go, the acting all around is great, especially Daeg Faerch as young Michael Myers. This franchise seems to have a talent for finding great child actors and Faerch is no exception, he does a great job capturing Myers' brooding presence and emotional coldness while also being surprisingly endearing and tragic when the film needs him to be. (That being said, he's a bit too old...How does Daeg Faerch in any way sound like the 6 YEAR OLD Loomis described in the original?)Scout Taylor Compton gets a lot of flack for her performance as Laurie Strode, but I honestly loved her here. She does an excellent job capturing the adorable innocence of the original Laurie Strode, while also giving her own realistic and charmingly mischievous side to the character. Her only real crime is that the character is more modernized and less puritanical than the original Laurie, which is, admittedly, a change for the better.I'm not sure who Malcolm McDowell is supposed to be playing, but I know for a fact that this greedy, manipulative and secular two face sure as Hell isn't Dr. Samuel Loomis. What he is, however, is an interesting and three-dimensional in his own right that's acted solidly. I found his relationship with Michael Myers to be rather fascinating and complex and he has strong chemistry with Faerch. His Loomis is equal ways despicable and sympathetic, oddly enough much like Michael Myers himself.Unlike seemingly everyone else, I do actually like the idea of humanizing Michael Myers by showing his backstory in an abusive household. I have many problems with the execution (Which I'll get into later), but with the franchise 7 sequels in and spinning around various origin stories, fans deserved a clear prequel to get inside Little Mikey's head. We know he's going to become The Shape, this film was about the journey. I found it fascinating.Unfortunately, that journey is only half realized, as Rob Zombie seems to completely lack the gift of subtlety. Showing the domestic abuse Michael suffered as a child, the bullying he faced from his peers and his masculine insecurity are all well and good, but when that's all we're offered in terms of characterization, that can grow stale. Every single line or moment in Michael's childhood seems to only exist as explanation for his evil destiny. None of the trauma he endures really hits because it's all so repetitive. Even the friendship of Loomis and Michael, while well handled, lacks the subtlety of their relationship in the sequels. Just the scene where Loomis confronts Michael in the Myers House about how they can stop his eternal rage together has more nuance, subtlety, pathos and depth than anything featured in this film.To add to that, I'm not sure why Rob Zombie was so concerned with justifying nearly 80% of Michael's kills. Most of Michael's victims are outright horrible people, which almost frames Michael in the role of an antihero. When he breaks that role and goes after somebody innocent or someone who had been good to him (Danny Trejo's asylum janitor, for example) it almost feels out of character and obligatory. Michael hardly feels like the embodiment of evil when evil is everywhere you turn.With Rob Zombie adapting a Halloween film, you really have to take the good with the bad. On the good side, we do get to explore the mind of one of the most infamous killers in cinematic history; an intriguing prospect. On the bad, we also get an obnoxious abundance of juvenile cursing, (intentionally) grimy cinematography and constant, gratutious sexual violence against women. Granted Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers featured an instance of sexual violence as well, but it was only a single instance that I would argue made sense for the characters, themes and tone of the film. Rob Zombie's Halloween features constant scenes of rape or allusions to rape that merely feel thrown in just for the sake of shock value. With just how grindhouse and exploitative this film is, one almost gets the feeling that Rob Zombie would have been better off remaking The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, not Halloween.Overall, Rob Zombie's Halloween is very much a mixed bag. There's just as much content that I love in it as content that I hate in it. In the end, I don't think it's the masterpiece its defenders will praise it as, nor do I think it's the absolute failure its critics have called it. It's okay. And you know what? Okay is fine!",Halloween
212,RCWjr,"Not horrible, but please, it is time Myers rested in peace.......",7,30 December 2007,"There are some fantastic elements. The mask is finally captured perfectly. The music is almost a note for note copy of the original's and that is a good thing in my opinion. There are a couple of nods to the first two films via the soundtrack. Tyler Mane finally brings some character to Myers. Say what you will about Zombie casting his wife, but Sheri Moon Zombie was one of my favorite characters thanks to Zombie's performance.There are some elements that are a mixed bag. Loomis; I did not like the Act 3 Loomis. I think this is mainly due to the character this time around is stripped of being the narrator of Michael's past. There was a real sense of dread projected by Loomis in the original. Here he is basically reacting like everyone else. The back story. While it does offer up some interesting study, in the end, we know too much about Michael. Scene transitions/editing is choppy, especially during chase sequences. The suspense is element is lost during the push to end the film. The fun of the first film was Michael stalking the kids. This time we get a bit of it, but since his back story is given so much attention, the final act has to be moved a long too fast. There are story elements, such as why is he after Laurie, that are never fully realized. Again, I think the back story's length is to blame for this. Things that were a total turn off. The gore factor. I knew this would be a concern going in and Zombie played his hand as expected. Just way too much gore. There is an art to what is not seen and today's horror film makers haven't a clue how to use it. Hillbilly overdose. There is just so much white trash that can be used before it starts stinking up the joint.Overall I thought Zombie did more right than wrong, but there was enough wrong for me to say let's allow Myers to finally rest. A modern retelling has been done, there is nothing more that can be done with this character. The film is the highest grossing of the franchise so I doubt my wish will be granted. But I would really like to see them NOT attempt any more Halloween movies with Myers. An anthology approach yes, but enough with Myers.",Halloween
213,reeves2002,This spoof of the original Halloween is unintelligent & horrible! It is a giant insult to John & Debra,1,2 September 2007,"I really wanted to like this film.I was scared it would suck but hoped I was wrong.I even went in with no expectations because a lot of people that saw it hated it.Well all I can say is,listen to what the people said that hated this movie because it is all true! It was nothing like the original and stayed as far as possible away from it. While I was watching the first 30 minutes of the movie I actually thought it was a big joke and was waiting for the real Halloween to start.I was thinking there was no way this was the movie but was hopefully just another trailer.My fears were realized when I noticed I was watching the right movie and I have never been more disappointed.The trailer for the Halloween remake looked interesting and scary but the movie was embarrassing and painful to watch.Yes it was a gore fest but that didn't bother me.In fact you wanted Michael to slaughter all the annoying characters in this Goddamned movie! In the original Michael's sister's boyfriend left the house after they screwed and wasn't killed,and Annie Brackett was killed and the scene was done in a unique way with the tomb stone, but in this P.O.S. she lives and the lousy attempt at it was ruined but of course we had to keep seeing her naked body over and over again covered in blood crawling on the ground suffering as Michael stood there pondering what to do.It would have been better if he would have just killed the bitch instantly to end her suffering.And then it's not clear whether she lives or dies which was nothing like the original where she is killed instantly. Another unnecessary and annoying thing I noticed about this trashy film was that there were mostly male victims and they were being killed in way more brutal ways then the female victims. I have no respect for Rob (white trash) Zombie anymore.Rob, you should just stick to your music! Even Danielle Harris annoyed the crap out of me with her horrendous portrayal.I thought she had more respect for the Halloween franchise then to star in something that has destroyed it.If Rob had left out some of the stupid humor and pathetic homophobic dialog,toned down the profanity & moronic hip hop talk(since when are guys called bitches!),and stayed true to the original and to the 70's then it would have been good. This(screwed up)version of Halloween should have been set in 1992 for Michael's early years,and then 15 years later to the present(2007) because at least then it would have coincided with todays dialog instead of making a mockery of the 70's.But it was just an unintelligent and immature attempt to remake a classic! I can't imagine what Debra Hill would think if she was still alive and I can see why John Carpenter wanted no part of it.It is definitely a whole new film and is nothing like the Michael Myers we knew.This one tries to humanize him and convey a little sympathy and to me that takes the mystery,horror and fright right out of the whole movie.Why couldn't Michael be a normal kid from a middle class family with 2 parents including a real dad(not a sleazy step dad)and then turn out the way he does.That would be more frightening because there would be no reason or motive. And as for all the people who are delighted that we now see the events of young Michael Myers childhood growing up prior to the murder of his sister,it is likely nothing even close to what John and Debra would have imagined had they written a prequel.This is just str8 from the imagination of Rob Zombie and how he imagined it.Shame on you Rob for saying you are a fan of the original! I guess Rob just wanted to show us the kind of trashy people and families he is familiar with.This may well be his own childhood experiences. In all fairness, Brad Dourif,Malcolm McDowell,Daeg Faerch,Tyler Mane,and Dee Wallace were all really good,it was just a really bad script which is a shame because there was so much potential for this movie.If Rob made it less like his other movies,it could have been a 9th sequel and maybe the best one yet.I do kinda hope there is a sequel directed by someone else though because I don't want this to be the last we see of Mike Myers.",Halloween

I gotta be honest, it's by far the best instalment, even though it's not directly linked to the previous parts.Admittedly, it's still not 'amazing' on the grand scale of things, but as I said before, it's hard not to be better than any of the previous instalments.Nice touch using some of the actors from the original Halloween 'universe'.It's a little bit longer than it needed to be...and has a bit too much unnecessary nudity...if I wanna see t*ts and a**, I'll watch a porno - not a horror!Overall - a great little film.",Halloween

216,McQualude,Zombie has talent but should have skipped the remake.,6,1 January 2008,"I've been putting this off because I wasn't very hopeful for the project when I first heard about the remake, even less hopeful when they gave it to Zombie and my last hopes sank when I read the reviews. Halloween (78) was the first real horror movie I watched in the theater and one of the very few horror movies to give me ass clenching terror so it holds a special place in my heart above it's status as a classic. But, eventually I had to see the new for myself. Overall the movie has some very positive things going for it. The casting was very good, many fan favored faces and some good solid acting and direction. The new Michael was very creepy, that white mask gave him something of an unreal look like a human body with the head of a Greek sculpture stuck on top. Tyler Mane would be imposing even with a happy rabbit's mask, here he is downright terrifying. Begrudgingly I have to admit that Tyler's Michael was a scary sonofabitch. Zombie's Michael on the other hand wasn't very scary. The whole back story portraying Michael as a victim just didn't work for me and it almost seemed like Zombie couldn't really stick with it himself as he struggled to show this ugly, girly, little boy as victim become evil, psychopathic bogeyman. I liked that Michael was absolutely remorseless, even killing his caretaker of almost twenty years. I didn't like Michael's ambiguous motivations for kidnapping his sister as I wasn't sure if Michael's behavior near the end was the result of his desire to see his little sister again or if Zombie had just run out of ideas for getting the knife to Laurie. The unrated version is overlong or maybe both versions are overlong. Zombie spent way too much time on young Michael and by the time we return to Haddonfield, I was bored. I stayed bored until Loomis and Laurie finally meet up but the end was near by then anyway. Really I think Zombie had some terrific ideas and he really shows promise as a horror director but it's unfortunate that he took on this remake as his ideas would have made a better movie without begging comparisons to the classic.",Halloween
217,chucknorrisfacts,A complete disappointment!,1,31 August 2007,"I, like many others feared this movie wouldn't live up to the original; sadly this was most definitely the case. It lacks everything that made the original so great. Carpenter's Myers stalked and studied his would-be victims, waiting for just the right moment to strike. Michael Myers is not supposed to be a seven-foot tall behemoth; he is supposed to be the height of an average man. One can notice Tyler Mane's need to duck down to avoid hitting his head on doorways while moving from room to room.A man of average height can be stealthy, not a man the size of a professional wrestler. Zombie has taken all of Myers' unique characteristics and replaced them, making him a carbon copy of Jason Voorhees, with a Myers' mask. Carpenter's Myers was very methodical and deliberate in his actions, however Zombie's Myers clumsily chased down and brutishly killed his victims.Everyone who is a fan of the original series knows Michael doesn't run. This has almost become the standard in horror movies today, the killer walks knowing you can run or hide, but won't escape him. In this film, Zombie has Myers charging Laurie and tackling her over a balcony and to the ground. What was he thinking? Suspense makes a movie, not blood and guts. The original keeps you on the edge of your seat always wondering where he'll strike next, but Zombie has this lug as the focus of the movie and you almost always know where he is. Less is more when it comes to making a successful suspense film. I guess that wasn't what Rob Zombie was going for here.Michael Myers is supposed to be evil incarnate, but when Zombie's back-story shows how he was a victim of a terrible childhood; it is hard to be afraid of the one you're forced to sympathize with, as he is the focal point and not Laurie.In closing, if you want to waste your money, go and see this piece of trash. If you'd like to see what this movie should have been go and rent the original.",Halloween
218,MovieProductions,A disgrace to the beloved classic in every way,4,12 November 2010,"*1/2 out of (****)Rob Zombie's rendition of ""Halloween"" is truly a slap-in-the-face to Carpenter's infamous classic. Everything Carpenter had going for him is everything Zombie doesn't. The acting is truly putrid in every sense of the word, the dialogue may be the worst I've heard, and the nudity, gore, and profanity are so overbearingly excessive, that I wouldn't be surprised if the director intended this to be an exploitation flick. The only reason why Zombie gets a ""4"" is because as a stand-alone film, this is passable, but as a remake, especially compared to the original, it's just terrible. Although, seeing as how Zombie can't even tell what he wants to do (the 1st half serves as a prequel and the 2nd half serves as a copycat), I'm just going to play it safe and award this film a ""4"". Perhaps I'm being too harsh but it's just that the acting and dialogue annoy me oh so much.First off, one might ask, is the acting really that bad? Let's just say that I wanted everyone to die the second they were introduced. I'm serious. Also, is the dialogue as bad as they say? Oh yes. And worse. No character can go without uttering a swear word in the most unnecessary way possible and no teenager in this film can go without using explicit sexual innuendo. Are teenagers really this perverted? Are people really this potty-mouthed? If so, I really hope this is just a temporary phase in society. Not only that, but the kills are so graphic that I just started to roll my eyes. Is it really necessary to run a guy in a wall ten times and stab him five times? It's kind of funny actually. In one scene, a bathroom can be nice and spotless and the next, a bathroom can be filled with gallons of blood.Also, is it just me, or is this the trashiest movie I've seen? Teenagers engage in premarital affairs, adult men are seen with Playboy magazines (even though only the title is visible), teenagers talk about sex constantly, teenagers talk like sailors, a mother is a stripper, a girl in this movie couldn't be any more of a slut then she already is, and every five minutes something or someone gets killed. I'm all up for mindless entertainment but this is just pathetic. If your movie is this trashy and you take it this seriously, there's a problem.While this movie is pretty bad, I have to admit, the first half is actually not too bad. Yes, the first five minutes are extremely irritable, but it's pretty interesting seeing Michael's childhood. Furthermore, while I thought the gore was too plentiful, usually that's what today's audience flocks to, so what the heck! Carpenter's film had terrific performances, nice cinematography, a Halloween feel to it, well- done suspense, and a balanced pace. Zombie's film has abysmal performances, weak dialogue, a hillbilly direction, poor suspense, excessive gore, and an incoherent flow. Take your pick.",Halloween
219,mrush,"Give it a rest ,already!",5,13 July 2008,"OK OK,so I've never been a huge fan of slasher films,I'll admit.But I enjoyed Rob Zombie's ""Devil's Rejects"" so I thought I'd give this movie a shot.I should have left well enough alone.This movie isn't any thing new,just another worn out masked slasher film based on an already done to death story.A demented little boy is sent away after he turns Halloween night into a bloody massacre in his small home town, as anyone who has seen any of the ""Halloween"" movies knows.Years later the boy,now a giant hulking mask wearing silent freak,escapes and returns to his home town to find his only living relative,his younger sister.Actually the first half of this movie wasn't bad.It sort of shows how little Mike began his life of blood lust and how he was shaped.It really doesn't explain why Mike likes to torture and kill animals.I guess we just have to assume some folks are born that way.It was interesting and pretty gruesome as he disposed of his family and eventually the staff at the crazy house where he was sent off to stay.Some pretty cool stuff....The second half of this movie is what kills it.Zombie seems better suited to do the crazy weirdo stuff,when he tries to do straight laced film-making,as the second half of this film is,( as straight laced as a slasher film can be),he is out of his element and doesn't show that much skill as a director.In the second half of this film the action drags,the script is lame,and the special effects weak and the then this thing turns into just another masked slasher film that isn't done as well as other slasher films.But really the whole ""Halloween"" thing has been done to death anyway,I'm not sure there would be a whole lot even the greatest director could get out of this worn out series.What I'd like someone to explain to me is how can a guy,albeit a big demented guy,be shot and stabbed so many times and still get up ?That is the thing about slasher films that bores me,if you can't kill the thing what is the point?How does the slasher acquire the supernatural ability not to be killed? Also how do they somehow get superhuman strength? In this film the killer supposedly lifted and carried away a tombstone that weighed over half a ton.So the guy can carry over 1000 pounds? Yeah right.Unless you show Satan or some other other force giving these slashers eternal life and super human strength the whole Jason and Micheal Myers thing just doesn't make any sense to me.But anyway in this film what we end up with is just another slasher film with silly teens getting killed while in various stages of sexual intercourse....yeah we've seen it a million times.The unrated version does have quite a bit of nudity ,including some total frontal female nudity,and of course once again we are treated to the naked butt of Rob Zombie's wife like we are in many of his films.OK Rob ,we get it by now ...you're slamming that....we get it......you don't have to point that out in every film.One surprise in this film was the familiar faces who popped up once in a while in mainly cameo appearances.Trying to figure out who some of these faces were and where you had seen them before was more entertaining than the storyline.What this film does,at least I hope,is put the final nail in the coffin of the ""Halloween"" movies.Hopefully this film will signal to producers and directors that there isn't anymore that needs to be said about Michael Myers.While I'm at it there isn't anymore that needs to be said about Jason or Freddy either.",Halloween
220,glenmatisse,"Loud, Angry, and Empty",4,2 September 2020,"The backstory of young Michael Myers is entirely unnecessary, but it's also the most interesting part of this film which completely falls apart after that section is over and becomes a reheated version of John Carpenter's original. Unfortunately, by painting its three female leads in the most irritating way imaginable, there's little suspense and you'll find yourself checking your watch to see if it's almost over.",Halloween
221,kclipper,Unbelievably disturbing remake.,10,18 October 2014,"Rob Zombie, like myself is a die-hard old school horror/exploitation fan of all the original horror films that paved the way to today's disturbing and desensitized Internet and television generation. This remake of John Carpenter's landmark achievement in horror film history is Rob Zombie's best work after ""The Devil's Rejects"". Zombie goes for stark reality and exposes a statement on the worst of our twisted society, merging that concept with Carpenter's original tale of ""pure"" evil incarnate about a little boy transformed into a mindless but calculated killing machine without motive or purpose. A frightening concept indeed, and its handled by a cast of genre veterans as well as talented newcomers in a modern day exercise of murder and mayhem.This film is divided into two parts in which the audience is free to judge which part is best. Zombie decides to juxtapose a story about a young Michael Myers, who undergoes child abuse and neglect by bullies, a vicious step-dad (portrayed to the extreme by talented genre actor, William Forsythe) and a self-absorbed older sister in which he relentlessly slaughters on Halloween night circa 1970's and fast-forwards it to later day as psychologist, (perfectly played by Malcolm McDowell) retires and alters a now older and powerful Michael into a soulless killer. Michael disposes anyone who gets in his way in order to seek out his baby sister and return to Haddonfield for an onslaught of murder and revenge. French child actor, Daeg Faerch is excellent as the 10 yr. old victimized Michael as well as poor, distraught Mom (finely played by Zombie's wife, Sherri Moon Zombie) and this first part of the movie is triumphant in displaying a complicated and surreal backdrop to second half of the story that John Carpenter defined as ""The Shape"" and not a human being anymore, but a ruthless entity that kills without passion. Its ultimately up to the audience to decide whether Zombie's new-school revamping can live up to original classic, but overall, I believe it to be a compelling masterpiece that takes an already classic concept and transposes it to a tragic and hopeless post-millennial era in which people fail to embrace what's truly substantial and altruistic. I truly think that's what Zombie is hinting at with this remarkable film. Other old-school genre stars include, Ken Foree, Brad Dourif, Clint Howard, Danny Trejo, Tom Towles, Bill Moseley, Danielle Harris, Dee Wallace, Sybil Danning, and Sid Haig, and more! Its truly sick and demented stuff from a director/writer that understands the darkest depths of our world's most nihilistic intentions dealing with revenge and retribution. Plenty of homages, plenty of sick dialog, I loved this movie! Followed by ""Haloween II"" and ""The Lords of Salem"".",Halloween
222,jamhorner,Halloween's New Mask,7,6 October 2007,"All horror directors have at least one hit and several flops. Rob Zombie had his flop with House of a 1000 Corpses and his hit with Devil's Rejects but his latest reworking film of Halloween, it could be considered a hit or miss. He chose to approach it with a back-story to the young Michael Myers. This was a clever approach to the movie since most of us wanted to know who Mike Myers is and why did he suddenly kill his sister, but in this movie he doesn't just ice his sister, but also his step-dad, the sisters boy friend and almost his baby sister. There are three great parts to this story, the pre-Mike-Myers, the insane-asylum-Mike-Myers and the post-insane-asylum-Mike-Myers. The acting was dynamite especially for Daeg Faerch who played the young Myers and Scout Taylor-Compton who played the helpless babysitter. There were lots of scares and classic killer-walking and young-girl-running scenes. The revised version of the Halloween theme was excellent.William Forsythe's character was the best and Forsythe really brought out the cruel and sadistic manner of that individual. I was not surprised that Sheri Moon was in this movie, considering she's in every Rob Zombie movie but I was surprised to see that she acted pretty damn good. She was believable as a dysfunctional housewife who goes into depression after he son had been committed, rather than acting like a drunken party girl.But this movie does have flaws. It puzzled me why would an asylum, a place that is supposed to treat the unhealthy, let Myers keep a room full of homemade masks and let him continue to make more masks when that obsession is what drives him to kill? Danny Trejo's Character seemed out of place. Malcolm McDowell's Character seemed over the top and a little campy, at least in the last segment. It seems like McDowell just winged this role just so that he could be recognized again. The infamous ""closet scene"" was ruined since it took place inside the Myer's residence.However, despite these flaws, it was a pretty good remake of a classic horror movie. It had all the parts that the original had and more. I am glad that Rob Zombie decided to make this movie since he gave the classic a new mask to wear.",Halloween

224,CowherPowerForever,It Must Be Great Living in Denial. I Must Try it Sometime,7,31 October 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.The year was 2007 and it had been five years since the last Halloween film. With the whole reboot/re-imaging craze in full effect, the studio felt it was time to restart the franchise. The director chosen was Rob Zombie. Of course this was met with some backlash, and rightfully so, but in the end, it is my opinion this is one of the better remakes in the horror genre. Zombie got the acceptance from legend John Carpenter, and Carpenter even told him to make it his own film. While I don't think the film was one of the better in the series, it certainly was not the worst. The following is my review of Rob Zombie's Halloween.The film was written as well directed by Rob Zombie. Zombie already had two big films under his belt at this time with House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. Both are very well received even to this day. Zombie molded the story his way, and is based on elements from the first two Halloween films. There are glaring differences in this Halloween film over the original, which is a good thing. The last thing anyone wanted was a shot for shot remake. The film starts out for the first hour or so filling in the background before the night he came home. What Myers was like as a child then in the mental hospital. Of course making Myers coming from a redneck household was never a side of the story I enjoyed, but it does fit his version of the film. On the infamous night in this re-imaging from Zombie, we see Michael not only kill his sister, but also kill his mother's boyfriend and his sister's boyfriend. We also see Myers get the infamous mask on that same night as his sister's boyfriend brought it over. These are some big changes, but nothing that hurts the film. There are some other bigger changes later in the film, but much like the other changes, I don't think they hurt his version of Halloween. Overall, Zombie writes a pretty interesting take of the entire live of Michael Myers. While purists of the franchise will be upset, most should enjoy this story.As I mentioned above, Rob Zombie also directed this movie. Here in lies some of the bigger problems I have with the movie. The original film was not a bloodbath of killings. It was made to be subtle and to make you think about what Michael was doing. That was effective. In this movie it is kill basically anything that moves, and make it as gory as possible. I don't like my Halloween films like that. The Unrated Director's Cut makes the film even less well made. In this version we are seeing too much of Myers in scenes where he is hiding out behind a bush for example. I don't really remember the theatrical cut so well because I've only seen it twice and it has been over seven years since I watched that version, but I do remember it being much more subtle in it's approach. Not with the gore aspect, much the haunting aspect. This version is sadly hard to come by, but there are copies out there.The acting is above average, and is save by the fantastic work that Malcolm McDowell did as Dr. Sam Loomis. While his take is also different than the Donald Pleasence take on the character, not much is really different until the sequel to this film. McDowell does a fantastic job of filling some very big shoes. The rest of the cast? I would say is was average. No one really stands out to be expect for Sheriff Brackett played by Brad Dourif. Scout Taylor-Compton steps in to take the semi lead role playing Laurie Strode. She is nowhere near the talent level of Jamie Lee Curtis, but then again, who is? Rob Zombie also has this idea that his wife is a good actress and she is once again in another one of his films. Her effort playing Michael's mother is very poor. We shouldn't be surprised though. Danielle Harris is back in another Halloween film, having been gone since Halloween 5. She doesn't have a wide range of acting ability, but I think she fits the role of Annie just fine. Other smaller roles from actors like Danny Trejo, Clint Howard, and Richard Lynch are fun to see. They are such fabulous actors.Tyler Bates had the challenge to score this film. The score is very important in a Halloween film, because John Carpenter created such an iconic score for his original film. While not much is changed by Bates, the score is fabulous. Some minor changes were made, but nothing that ever hurts Carpenter's original score. While I cannot honestly say it was the best score after the original, it certainly ranks pretty high for me. Great effort from Bates, and most hardcore fans of the series should enjoy this aspect of the film.In closing, this is a remake/re-imaging, and purists will always have a hard time dealing with them. I don't enjoy them myself either, but remakes always happen. It is just best to watch and then judge the film. I judge this film and found it to be rather good for the most part. The theatrical cut of the film is the better version of the film to watch. If you are a firs time viewer, seek that cut of the film out first. The Director's Cut is above average, but has more problems in my opinion. I would say the theatrical version get a seven out of ten for me, while the unrated version gets a six out of ten. The film, while nowhere near the original film, is still a nice yet different take on Michael Myers.7/10",Halloween
225,gattonero975,"""Helloween"" (Part One)",7,6 November 2012,"When I 1st heard about a remake/re-imaging on one of the greatest classics of all time, I was like ""no way"". But when I also discovered that the director would be Rob Zombie, now I was somewhat interested. I had known of Zombie from his music and recently from his Devil's Rejects films. So I was really interested on what would be his take on Halloween. And who who he would cast as the main characters. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Samuel Loomis: When I 1st saw him with long hair, kinda hippie-looking, I was like no way. But fast forward years later, when he has so-called ""retired"" and is promoting his book based on Michael Myers, and now he seemed the part and was much more believable.Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode:I admit. I had never heard or seen her before. She was no Jamie Lee Curtis but I think that wasn't what Rob Zombie wanted for his movie version. Scout did her own take on Laurie and it was different. Not memorable but interesting. The fact that she was 17yrs old while filming made it more believable because she acted like a true 17yr old would! Tyler Mane as Michael Myers:A good choice. Mane being 6'9"" makes this Myers the tallest of all. Mane makes Myers the formidable menacing figure that he should be. With no dialog, Mane just had to rely on body language and he did a pretty good job. Daeg Faerch as Michael Myers, age 10:Now this kid did a great job. I had never seen him in anything except 'Hancock'. Daeg did a memorable job as young Myers. I could actually envision Myers as this messed up kid. Sheri Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers:I some how knew Rob would find some role for his wife in this film. I even heard at one point she was up for the ""Lynda"" role! That would have been a mistake. Don't get me wrong, Sheri is very beautiful and has a wonderful body still, that's why she could get away with the role she was ultimately given as Myer's stripper mom. But playing a teenager is another matter. No doubt it would have been interesting but I'm glad she didn't.William Forsythe as Ronnie White: William did a great bit as Deborah's slimy boyfriend. Forsythe is very good when plays these types of characters. He actually had hurt himself I guess prior to filming so they just incorporated it into the script and filmed him that way. Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett:Interesting casting here. Harris had played Jamie Lloyd, Laurie Strobe's daughter in Halloween 4 & 5! So here she is practically playing her 'mom's' best friend 20yrs later! I believe she did a great job considering she was 30yrs old playing a teenager in high school! Kristina Klebe as Lynda Van Der Klok: Never heard or seen this beautiful actress but I will be from now on. In fact, gonna see her in a new zombie movie called ""Zone of the Dead"" with one of her co-stars from this film:Ken Foree! Klebe did an OK turn as 'Lynda' but no one can replace P.J. Soles original take on it. Totally! Danny Trejo as Ismael Cruz: Trejo is cast as Myer's caretaker per say. Nice bit cameo. Playing against type.Hanna Hall as Judith Myers: Beautiful little actress that I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything. She did a great job here just oozing sexiness as Michael's sexually active sister Judith. it prompt William Forsythe to say what a sexy ""dumper"" she has! Leslie Easterbrook as Patty Frost: I did not recognized her at 1st in her bit role as the guard transferring Michael. But it was refreshing to know that Police Academy's Lt/Capt.Debbie Callahan is still around working! Brad Dourif as Sheriff Lee Brackett: The iconic actor behind the voice of none other than the Chucky Doll! Brad actually did a good job playing an intense Brackett. In an alternate ending of this film, Dourif and his crew get the best of Michael and kill him. Richard Lynch as Principal Chambers: Another iconic bad guy from the movies being cast as a good guy. It would have been interesting to have seen Lynch in the Dr. Loomis role. But here his bit role as the principle, he did not have much to do. Lew Temple as Noel Kluggs: Anyways, here he had a deliciously evil guy role as Danny Trejo's co-worker.Dee Wallace as Cynthia Strode: E.T.'s mom! It was nice to see her here but her role was very short tragic because Myers was just plain cruel with her death. Ken Foree as Big Joe Grizzly: Now this was a great cameo bit! One of my favorites! He actually tried to take on Myers and in the toilet! Foree is tall (6'5"")but next to Mane(whose 6'9""), he looked short! Had the best line in the movie, ""Let me pass this beast in peace!"" :D Sybil Danning as Nurse Wynn: I did not recognize this iconic actress for nothing in her very brief bit role as the nurse attending Michael. It wasn't till I seen the credits that it was her! Micky Dolenz as Derek Allen: This was a surprising and welcomed cameo! The Monkey's drummer/singer Micky! And in a bit that pays homage to Dick Miller's pawn-shop clerk role in The original and classic Terminator! Classic! And last but least the great Sid Haig as Chester Chesterfield: Sid had a nice cameo as the caretaker at the cemetery. Tom Towles,Bill Moseley,Udo Kier, Clint Howard, Daniel Roebuck all had their scenes deleted. They were reduced to cameos. :(",Halloween
226,seckinlergafri,Not bad but not great this is Mediocre Horror Movie !,6,7 August 2017,"Halloween (2007) This is a horrendous thriller horror film from the united states and is a 1978 horror remake movie titled the same, the film was directed by Rob Zombie and first aired on August 31, 2007.About 10 year old Michael Myers who killed his sister And her stepfather right on Halloween night. After that incident Michael was put into a mental hospital. 15 years later, Michael ran away from the hospital and returned to his hometown to find his little sister who lives in a small town called Haddonfield, a series of murderous events terrorizing Halloween Night in that small town .. Halloween horror movie is quite good but There are various shortcomings ie less its tension, I have not watched the original version of this film that is Halloween (1978). If you like watching a horror movie then watch this movie. If not just search for another movie.Warning: A lot of sadistic scenes, blood, nudity, dirty words .. The movie is for 18+!",Halloween
227,iainsmith-18061,Awesome,10,16 December 2020,Absolute brilliant movie which gives you more of an insight to Michael Myers as a kid & I absolutely loved it . This is by far the best Halloween movie ever. Don't miss this .,Halloween
228,MairegChernet,inept for its genre.,1,6 January 2008,"I saw this movie on DVD last week, and you wanna know how I felt about it? I was disappointed. It was just plain bad. I haven't seen the original but I'm sure it is not gonna be worse than this remake. The makers were, for some reason, incapable of having a decent and organized plot. They filled the film with senseless junk irrelevant to the main plot. They didn't give the audience detailed backgrounds of the main characters. They didn't even tell us in depth why the main character Michael Myers started killing people, instead the things that occupied the runtime were dialogues full of unnecessary profanity(supposedly angry dialogues), naked girls running around for their lives, high school girls that apparently are obsessed with sex('cause all the girls talked about was sex). Overall this is not a good horror film. It was superficial and the bottom line is that it was a boring piece of crap. Don't waste your money on this, no jokes, this was one of the worst movies of 2007.",Halloween

230,hfreinoso,"I understand the hate, but I like it",6,2 November 2018,"I understand that people don't like this movie, and I understand it wasn't for everyone. I enjoyed the first half of this movie; it was okay to meh at best during the second half. I liked watching it. I found it interesting that Michael was given a backstory that shows why he started killing. I also liked the amount of blood and gore; this movie produced, but that doesn't mean it's better than the original. Like at all. This movie gives the character a motive, and the original didn't. That's what makes Michael Myers so scary. We're not supposed to know his motive; all we know is that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Also, the first half of the movie is excellent, with lots of brutal murders and blood. The other half could've been better. Why would they go from doing something very different with the story to going back to the old, boring killings of the original Halloween? This movie could have been a success only if it kept up the brilliance of the first half. And not focus too much on the second half; I feel like the studio took creative control over Rob Zombie. We should have followed that first half and seen more from all the characters. Also, it was weird seeing Danielle Harris return as Annie, plus all the adult stuff we see is what I call weird. I understand people don't like these changes, but these changes are brilliant, and what makes me like these movies, they make it different from the original, and that is what I like to see, unlike the second half did with doing a copypaste to the original. Overall I thought this film was nothing as bad as people say, But I prefer to watch this movie over his second. Now that wasn't good. 6/10.",Halloween

232,stevetseitz,The scariest a William Shatner mask has looked since...,2,2 September 2007,"...the last Priceline commercial.First of all, here is a suggestion for writers, producers and directors out there: Don't remake a perfect film. If you want to be successful with a remake, take a great concept and make a slightly different movie. For example: Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"" -> George Lucas' ""Star Wars"", Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" -> ""The Magnificent Seven"" Halloween was the original slasher film. It's not supposed to be realistic or have a back story or explain anything. That's why it's scary. It's a monster movie set outside the Gothic confines of a monster movie. John Carpenter used every iota of creative cinematic energy to extract a perfect atmospheric low-budget film out of what could have been a laughable b-movie. Still to this day it is one of the few films to make a bright day-lit suburban street uber-eerie.Leave it alone. The reason sequels are made and re-makes are attempted is because the original had IMPACT. It is not necessary to try and simply increase the level of violence, gore etc. You aren't achieving anything. You're just trying to create an endurance test for the audience. It becomes a game of one-upsmanship.Mr, Zombie, if your ideas are good enough, then make an entirely new feature...the great thing about film is that you can even pay homage to your inspiration without trying to stand on the shoulders of genius and ride the coat tails of a financially viable name.",Halloween
233,scott-sw,Never let a Zombie direct a slasher film,1,30 December 2007,"I remember seeing the original Halloween when I was eleven-years-old. It literally scared the crap out of me. It wore me out, left me exasperated, and tired. Yes, it had scary moments, but it was also suspenseful and frightening. Enter Rob Zombie's new modern adaptation. What? Since when was Halloween a snuff film. Both movies have to be juxtaposed for this review.
In the first place, Rob Zombie's goes much deeper. The first 30 to 40 minutes explores the pathology of Michael Meyers and how he got started. Showing signs of social detachment disorder, he tortures animals and has a mask fixation amidst a dysfunctional family. His mother is a stripper, and is dating the prick of the 21st Century. He has two sisters. The older one, Judith, is a sex pot following in her mother's footsteps, and a baby sister, Laurie. Eventually, Michael (Daeg Faerch) snaps. On Halloween, he butchers his sorry father figure, his older sister and her boyfriend, and a bully from his school. He is committed to a sanatorium where he meets Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcom McDowell). As he settles deep into his abyss, he withdraws further, refusing to communicate. At this point, his mother commits suicide, leaving him all alone in his cell of self-made masks. Fifteen years later, on the night he is to be transferred (I assume to a state prison), he escapes, brutally attacking the guards, even turning on the one friend who continually tries to reach him. The adult Michael (Tyler Dane) returns to Haddonfield to reek havoc again. I am sure we all know the story as Sam Loomis pleas with Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) to stop Michael. Of course, he is met with skepticism as many of his lines are repeated word-for-word from the classic 1978 masterpiece. Laurie (Scout Compton), of course, is babysitting Tommy, and her friends become targets of Michael's fury (Annie, in fact, is played by Danielle Harris of the Halloween IV and V sagas). The first mistake was exploring Michael's pathology. The original had none. In fact, that is what made it so frightening. Second, Zombie only uses one type of character: poor white trash with little or no scruples, and a profane mouth. There is no other variation in this, even going from movie to movie. There are very few scares, and zero suspense, which is what made the first one great. Another issue is Tyler Dane as the Shape. His stature is the frightening aspect, as opposed to Nick Castle's clever, pathological patience. It also gives way to Dane's Shape is much more brutal in killings as opposed to Castle's efficiency. Finally, the exploring of the Shape's pathology, it rushes the end of the movie. This movie is bad from start to finish.",Halloween
234,legendaryunderdog,Zombie is still good at what he does....,6,20 December 2007,"I tried very hard to ignore the Carpenter classic and move on with the new Zombified version of Halloween, and on the whole I was impressed except for a few things. The sex scenes (which are prevalent) made me very uneasy at times and for some reason I have a hard time trying to get through numerous sex scenes in recent films. This tactic made my patience wear very thin but still I pressed on, the childhood years were very disturbing (quite a good addition to the film by Zombie I must say). Michael's height grows dramatically, Dr. Loomis's character is done very well by MacDowell, the whole Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett and their stupid friend Linda (with her even dumber boyfriend Bob) were done O.K. but not as good as the original girls (Nancy Loomis, P.J. Soles, and Jamie Lee Curtis). I just have something for the seventies/dated material coupled with the fact that I really dislike the trends today but the original by John Carpenter will always be the one to me. R.I.P. Donald Pleasance.",Halloween
235,Kashmirgrey,HOLLOW-EEN... another Devil's Reject,3,8 September 2007,"Some film makers live in a world where all men are sadistic rapists, all women are sado-masochistic tramps, violent murder is abundant and perceived as funny, and everyone uses F$#& every other word. Hey, to each their own reality, whatever...First, let's take a short jog back in time... John Carpenter's Halloween is a film considered by many to be one of, if not the best horror films of all time. For me, what made Carpenter's 1978 classic so frightening was the not-knowing why a 10-year old kid, who came from a middle-class, two-parent family living in a nice home in a nice suburban neighborhood, would don a clown mask, and proceed to savagely butcher his older teenage sister. Why would he then remove his mask and stand outside the front of his home with an expressionless look on his face, waiting for Mom and Dad to return? What made this even more disturbing was how the perspective of the viewer was shot through the eyes of the mask so that the audience sees what Michael sees. That, and of course the fact that it all happens on a Halloween night and in cadence to a magnificently, creepy musical score. Insane asylums always conjure up unease intensifying the scene where Michael escapes from the mental institution and seizes the two doctors' station wagon amidst ghostly, mentally-disturbed patients wandering around outside. Why does Michael want to kill his sweet, younger, teenage sister Laurie Strode? Why does he wear a mask? Why can't he be killed? What, if any, is the method to his murderous madness? Why does he arrange the corpses that certain way? These questions we want to know, but at the same time, the not knowing is what makes us pause the film and check that all the windows and doors are locked.Now let's jump to Zombie's version. Not comparing it to the original and letting it stand on its own two feet, it's just a lousy film. What kept it from ""straight to DVD""? Two titles: Rob Zombie and Halloween. Zombie seems to have felt it necessary to humanize ""his"" Michael Meyers and attempt to provide a sympathetic explanation for Meyers' future murderous behavior, so Zombie has painted a new picture of Meyers' home. The father (William Forsythe) is an unemployed, abusive husband who has incestuous thoughts about his teenage daughter. The mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) is an attractive, but weathered, stripper. The teenage daughter (Hannah Hall) is promiscuous and cruel. There's little baby Laurie. Finally, there is 10-year old Mikey (Daeg Faerch) who is a long-haired, animal-torturing, juvenile delinquent (who looks 14). On Halloween, Meyers' snaps when two older schoolmates harass him and make sexually explicit, derogatory comments about his older sister and mother. Later, Michael, wearing a mask, beats one of the boys to death with a tree branch. Michael goes home where his father degrades him sexually. His mother leaves to strip, and worst of all, his older sister chooses a roll in the hay in lieu of taking him trick-or-treating (that warrants murder and mayhem!) So, he duck-tapes his father to his chair (managing to miraculously accomplish this while his father sleeps) and slices his throat. He then takes a baseball bat to his sister's boyfriend, and finally, after she awakes and catches him feeling her up, he slices up his older sister. Meyers' is institutionalized. After he murders a nurse with a fork his distraught mother blows her brains out. Fifteen years pass and Meyers' gets a break, escapes and proceeds to follow the plot points of the '78 original. Meyers' sister Laurie has been raised by adoptive parents in Haddonfield and Meyers' comes to hunt her down.What did work for me, not so surprisingly, was where Zombie follows and mimics scenes from the original film. I mean, why re-invent the wheel, right? (ahem!) Meyers (Tyler Mane) portrayed as a tall, dark, and hulking Leatherface-like menace, who seems more deliberate in his behaviors in this film, was a nice tweak. No one could ever replace Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis, but Malcolm McDowell was a comfortable second. The connection between Meyers and his younger sister Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) was defined intriguingly, too, I thought. Unfortunately, the more critical connection, that being the character of Laurie with the audience, is non-existent. (Just an ironic coincidence to make my point, I had to click on ""MORE"" on this film's IMDb.com main page to even find Strode in the Cast listing!)***10/29/2008 (Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie has since been added) But aside from these, the film is just another House of 10,000 Devil's Rejects. Knowing why Meyers becomes a monster isn't scary with Zombie's textbook serial killer explanation. I don't want to understand Meyers' inner-child. Also, this Meyers, unlike John Carpenter's original, murders with senseless abandon with no attention to suspense. A ""re-imagining""? Where's the imagination? I am not anti-remakes. But when you're going to tackle an original masterpiece like Halloween, you need an adept film maker. Zombie, who seems obsessed with incest, rape, flaunting his wife on screen, gratuitous sadistic torture, and words that begin with the letter F and end with the letter K, is not such a film maker. He seems (pardon the pun) ""hell-bent"" on offending his audiences for the mere purpose of being offensive. What is sad is, these days offensive means controversial and controversial has become synonymous with art.Some might say I've missed the point. My point in seeing the film was to be entertained and scared. What was your point?",Halloween
236,lovintennis,Decent but not solid,5,9 September 2017,"The only problem I have with this one is why Michael killed Danny Trejo's character.

237,moimoichan6,Previously in Halloween : What happened and what Rob Zombie took from the previous movies.,6,15 December 2007,"10/31/1978 (Halloween) : John Carpenter invents, after Hitchcock's Psycho, the modern slasher movie. An evil bogeyman terrorizes a little suburban town, and kills a few of its teenagers, especially baby sitters. Michael Myers has no face, no past, no personality : he's just a representation of the evil that haunts this anonymous town of Haddonfield, and can appear as the ghost of an untold sin whenever he wants to. The opening sequence is an admirable subjective one shot, that marked history of horror cinema and the ending with the immortal villain is also an anthologic part. The rest of the movie shows a magisterial use of cinemascope, that manage to give a frightening and creepy look to a very common town. Rob Zombie really signs here a remake and an interpretation of this first night of Halloween, developing the beginning, adding blood and gore, but staying faithful to the movie in its second half. He just cuts some tension and adds some action, but the situations, the characters (even in the way they talk), and the murders are pretty much the same.10/31/1981 (Halloween II) : The second Halloween is the direct continuation of the first and happens in the very same night. It's a rather clever sequel, not as mastered as the original, but very fun to watch. The two movies could almost be seen as one. Rob Zombie took from this movie the relationship we discover between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. It's now a well known fact and a part of the myth, and it was almost unimaginable for Zombie not to mention it in his remake.10/31/1982 (Halloween III: Season of the Witch ) : The Halloween without Michael Myers (except for an apparition on a TV screen, when a character watches the Carpenter's movie !)is an involuntary funny B-movie, and didn't influence much Rob Zombie. There's maybe the fascination of his Myer's character for the masks, that you can find in both movies, but it's really certainly more a Zombie's personal touch than a reference to this film.10/31/1988 (Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers) : Certainly the best of Myers' movies after the two first ones. If this movie also marks the return of Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't come back and Mychael Myers is now after her daughter Jamie. Rob Zombie kept the redneck attitude of the inhabitant of Haddonfield, that stupidly shot everything when they learn that Myer's back in town ! The relationship between Myers and Loomis is also well developed here, and it certainly inspired Zombie.10/31/1989 (Halloween 5) : Producer Moustapha Akkad tried to make the same thing than in Halloween 2, by making here a direct continuation of the fourth, but he was obviously lacking time, and ruined all the good ideas of the previous movie (the ending !!!). There's nothing to keep in mind there and Zombie completely ignore this movie in his remake.10/31/1995 (Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers) : This movie is also called ""The Origin of Michael Myers"", but it has absolutely nothing to do with the one Rob Zombie decided to develop. The worst episode of the franchise is only worth seeing because its one of the last movie with Donald Pleasence - but that's all.10/31/1998 (Halloween H20: 20 Years Later) The last three episodes are forgot, and Halloween 7 is the sequel of Halloween 2. This funny and clean variation, that introduced Josh Hartnett on screen, apparently didn't satisfied Rob Zombie, that comes back with a more hardcore and rotten aesthetic.10/31/2002 (Halloween: Resurrection) : Except for an opening scene with Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode for the last time, there's really nothing to save here. It's time for the franchise to invents something new. Rob Zombie tries to personalize the series, by making a remake that cross the Halloween's universe with his own grotesque preoccupations. But to me, if his efforts are praisable, the result isn't as satisfying as expected. By being too faithful to Carpenter, Zombie looses a little bit of his personality, and signs a bastard movie, half-Carpenter, half Zombie, not so well from both point of view. So, all we got in the end is a pretty good episode of the series, but yet, also another useless remake.",Halloween
238,LinkGoku,wow.. surprising,8,17 February 2010,"well going into this movie i wasn't expecting anything more then an average slasher flick, i even waited till it was on DVD and i saw the unrated directors cut.. but honestly.. i loved it.. the music was still good.. and the acting.. Malcolm Mcdowell was good as Dr. Loomis, and Scout Taylor Compton did well as Laurie Strode even though she wasn't near as innocent as Jamie Lee Curtis in the original.. i think Tyler Mane was born to play Michael Myers, and same with Daeg Faerch as 10 yr. old Michael.. i even thought Sheri Moon Zombies character was a good addition, i liked the return of Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett, and i thought Brad Douriff did well as Sheriff Brackett, you know one of the common things i hear from people who don't like this movie is that its too different from the original.. ITS A DIFFERENT MOVIE PEOPLE!! i liked the changes made and honestly i thought the storyline was much more complex and well written, i highly recommend this movie, thus concludes my review of Rob Zombie's Halloween (unrated directors cut)",Halloween
239,Phantasm01,I enjoyed it,8,16 December 2007,"I liked it. I really did. I enjoyed it as a film. As an individual film, separate from the rest. Sure, it wasn't perfect. It felt a little uneven in the middle. In other words, it seemed like each half of the film were really just shortened individual films that were put together to make a whole new one. Because of that, the remake phase was a tiny bit fast-paced for me. However, overall, I enjoyed it a great deal. There is a reason why, however, that is deeper than the film itself.What Rob presented was a great film, that had a story that wasn't perfect. Therein lies the genius of it. It felt real. It didn't feel like a movie. While many will find that to make it a cluttered mess, it didn't for me. An example would be the way he presented Michael's victims. We didn't get to know them that well before he killed them. But when some serial killer kills a group of people, and it is announced on the news, what do you think the chances are that you know those people? You don't. And yet, it is still horrifying. In other words, you don't have to know the victims to understand how terrifying the crime is.In a movie, you follow these people around, the camera being your eye as you stalk them invisibly. You really get to know the people. Here, by not following them, it presents that realism quite well. You don't know who these people are, but whether you know them or not, Michael Myers is still presented as a terrifying being. Speaking of ol' Mikey...I thought Tyler and Daeg's performances were amazing. I loved how even though you could sympathize with him in his early life, it didn't change how bizarre, and truly evil he was. Right in the opening scenes, we see him petting a rat, and then we see moments later cleaning a bloody scalpel or something. Then, he tells his mother that his rat died. You know what he did. It's not that hard to figure out. What's great about this is that it shows that even though he had this terrible life, he didn't just snap over night. He's been going crazy for some time. The scene with the bully in the woods was powerful, at least for me. His eventual escape was equally amazing. How he took out those guards truly showed his power, and menace. I especially liked when he killed Ismael Cruz, because that was the indicator that the young boy that went into Smiths Grove was not the monster that walked out. To quote the original Doctor Loomis, ""That part of him died years ago."" Michael Myers in this film, as a character, was just as scary as he was in the original. The best Myers since Castle IMO.Which brings me to another point that I really liked. I think that of all the actors who could have played Loomis, Rob really picked the right one, which was surely a difficult task. Sure, many suggested Anthony Hopkins, but (and I hate to say this) having played similar characters several times, he may have had a spirited performance, but he would have taken you out of the real world, and remind you that it was only a movie. Rob could have cast an actor that wasn't that well known, but then the performance would have been lacking, and have the same effect. With someone like McDowell, he has that face that is just obscure enough that you can buy him as a real person, yet he is also a great enough actor that he can still pull an amazing performance.The rest of the cast was great as well. I really liked Harris as Annie, and Laurie was cast pretty well in my opinion. She acted like a real teenage girl. I would know, there's one next door, and then there's my younger sister. As for greeting each other with ""Hey, Bitches"" I think that was actually rather spot on. Real girls aren't like cartoon girls, or 7th Heaven characters, who go wide-eyed the moment someone uses a curse word.Like I said, the film isn't perfect, but it was definitely better than most, if not all of the sequels. As for how it measures up against the original, well, in terms of sheer quality, no, it wasn't better. But better isn't what they set out to do in the first place. I think this is the problem with most remakes. Many people who bash them believe that the initial concept is to make a better version. What Rob set out to do was make a Halloween that was just as good as the original, to make Michael Myers scary again, and at that he passed in flying colors. Sure, the original had good things that this film didn't have, but this film had good things that the original didn't have. They're different films, so you can't really judge them together. It's not a shot-for-shot remake, and it isn't a rehash either, so there's not much room to really compare everything. The only area where you can compare them is in the level of quality, and at that, they're at about the same level for me.",Halloween
240,hotrobinproductions,Very bad 6/10 is me being generous,6,9 October 2019,"Not as good as 2018s and not even close to the original. Rob Zombie is everything that's wrong with Halloween. Most of his movies are so unsettling and unbearable, and yes I get it, that's his style, but there's plenty of directors with a distinct style that actually knows how to go along with a great production, solid script and so on. Zombies gritty feel actually helps the film and the first act is pretty interesting. I'm a huge Halloween fan and that's why I give this a 6/10 but if I'm really judging this film in a critical standpoint it's a 4 close to a 5/10. What could have made this film better was if rob zombie had no part of it, if he had to be apart of it, then a much better script because the writing was god awful, better character development and not making the movie such a rush just for the sake of the movie, also learning how to end a movie. The way this movie ends is fast and slow at the same time it's just a movie that tries so hard, and manages to have its highs while doing it, but once you think it's going for something it just spits back in your face.",Halloween
241,walken_on_sunshine,Halloween comes early with a treat from Rob Zombie,8,31 August 2007,"Halloween has itself a legacy and it seems today that everyone goes overboard when somebody wants to remake or add to this legacy fearing that the original will be ruined. It blindsides me how people can be so judgmental about this film before it's release even though there have been seven horrible sequels that for me ruined the legacy of Halloween. Rob Zombie's remake does not pose as the original like the remakes for The Omen or The Grudge it has it's own unique take on a classic character.People seem to have a pretty prejudice feeling for remakes because almost every message board I go to when one is announced is always flocking with negative posts on how it will ruin the original. Remakes have existed since the time of ancient Rome however as most plays salvaged from that period are simply Greek plays with different characters or slight tweaks in the story thus a remake. I feel this is one of the better remakes up there alongside Dawn Of The Dead, The Amityville Horror, and The Hills Have Eyes.The acting I felt was I most cases very good and very convincing although certain characters are very cliché. Sheri Moon does an amazing job playing Michael's gutterslut mom who isn't at fault for where her life has brought her. She is the character you sympathize the most for as she does all she can to keep her family together, works all the time as a stripper because her dead beat husband won't do anything, and when Michael finally kills it breaks her down even more as all she's left with is her murdering son and her 8 month old or so daughter. Daeg ferch who plays young Michael has some line delivery problems but when acting with just facial expression or body expression he is the perfect Michael Myers as he is simply eerie to look at. The teenage characters with the exception of Laurie Strode are very cliché ""bad"" girls who are of course drinking and having sex throughout most of the film and no most of them cannot act very well however they are minimal characters so it doesn't take much from the overall picture. Malcolm MacDowell plays an interesting yet very underdeveloped child psychologist who after 17 years working with Michael decides to quit on him and move on however when Michael escapes he returns to prevent the death of Laurie Strode which at first is not Michael's plan.The story is very interesting yet straightforward there are no twists and turns just a simple plot and one storyline. Rob uses all the scores from the original throughout the film to build suspense and surprisingly it works very well. The blood and gore which some would expect to dominate the movie works very well as it's not just a hack/slash film like any of the Friday The 13th, or Nightmare On Elm Street sequels. Rob uses suspense to build up the act of the murder and much like the film seven shows mostly the aftermath and not the kill. It's not the blood or gore that is meant to scare you though, what is meant to scare you is the violence which is terrifying because of it's realism and how relentless Michael is with that knife. The kills make you feel uneasy not sick to your stomach but very uneasy as you can put yourself in the victim's position much like Saw. The remake seems to have a lot more depth than the original not that it's better but I honestly feel it's a pretty worthy addition to the franchise far more worthy than any of the 7 pathetic hack/slash sequels. Halloween is what Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning should have been a deep, frightening back story that dives in to the killers before and after persona's and gives us reason and the ability to see why he does what he does. If you have a weak stomach I guarantee you won't like this film not due to the gore but again to the realism of deplorable acts in this film there is a very realistic rape scene that will make you feel angry and uneasy at the same time and I know many who were outraged by the one in The Hills Have Eyes so any of you out there offended by that please do not see this film. If however you are looking for what today is a rare breed a good horror movie with an actual plot than see Halloween immediately because trust me it is the best slasher I've seen in years and a shockingly scary good time.",Halloween
242,lopcar1993,Terrible remake of a great classic,2,12 October 2009,"I'm a major fan of the original and I saw this one with medium hopes that Rob Zombie would give me something worth seeing, but my first instinct about this movie sucking eggs was right. It was a bloody mess.Halloween(or as I like to call it Suckloween.) was a disgrace to the franchise that practical invented the slasher genre. It was too dumb and far too bloody and messy to even try and comprehend the story of the psychotic Michael Myers( no not the Austin Powers guy.) But what it did have, and this is the only good thing, is a pretty good spin on Michael's beginning's not much of it was revealed in the original so that was the only positive thing I found about the whole film. But this movie was a let down none the less.Tyler Mane an ex- wrestler turned horror star plays the maniac Myer's well(seeing as he doesn't have to say anything.) but his mannerisms are just like the original Michael and he is the only saving grace in this film. Scout Taylor-Compton (who is allot prettier than Jamie Lee Curtis.) Has no real acting talents at all and is just there to scream her head off when needed. Malcolm McDowell(who was the only true good act in this.) does very well as Dr. Sam Loomis but is not as hell bent on killing Michael as he was in the originals, instead here they turned Loomis into a kind hearted soul(which was a mistake.) Being someone who's watched all the Halloween movies Loomis is nothing like his 2007 counter part and that is where again Rob Zombie fails. But Malcolm McDowell does very well in this movie and he holds up nicely against terrible acts. But all in in all the rest of the cast was terrible.Halloween(2007) Is nothing short of a brutal, mindless, laughably bad mock up of a horror film that tries, and fails to capture the essence or even style of the original. But I will give it this. It does try very hard to be scary but to no avail.All in all Halloween is a A-Bomb.",Halloween
243,badgrrlkane,Get over it people.By the time Hollywood's done every horror classic will have been remade,7,1 September 2007,"I always groan when I see their remaking another favorite classic horror film of mine & a lot have sucked.The only one I went completely crazy about was Dawn Of The Dead. I mean where are the original ideas? But,Rob Zombie came out with a whole new way of telling his version of Halloween & how it went down & I liked his version better than what the original Halloween franchise did.First off I really felt pity for poor Michael as his home life really sucks.The only kind one to him is his Mom, Sherry Moon Zombie (who was awesome in this role as she got too show some acting chops finally playing a decent character whose not psychotic for a change) & he just begins to loose it by hiding away his ugliness behind his masks,he just slowly introverts into his brain,losing all compassion,& sense of what's right & wrong especially after his Mom kills herself & the one burning thought that he left his baby sister""Boo"" live still.15 yrs later he escapes, kills a whole mess of people (way more than the original)& in a whole lot more brutally of a fashion too & eventually meets up w/h Baby Boo, now Laurie Strode.Once again it's a fine story but this IS NOT JOHN CARPENTER'S version.It's Rob Zombie's & he warned fans of the original that this would be different. RZ once again uses actors from various favorite horror films of mine in small roles as the whole cast of The Devil's Rejects are in this as security guards,janitors, & graveyard caretakers. Also the wonderful Dee Wallace gets to play Laurie's mom & let's out a bloodcurdling scream as good as any young scream queen out their when Michael goes to knife her. Also he used one of my all time favorites Sybil Danning as the Nurse who young Michael forks in the jugular. And Danielle Harris who played the child Michael was after in the previous Halloween franchise of films 4 & 5 I believe is back but in this one is playing a teen & at 30 she looks way older as Annie than the other 2 actresses do. They kill Michael with Laurie sitting astride him & blowing his brains out as she screams in to the night so I don't see no sequel but that's okay as to me that is what killed the original films creepiness. I liked this.I thought House of a 1,000 Corpses was OK,Devil's Rejects kicked ass, & Halloween is definitely a future horror classic 2-0 Mr Zombie keep on rolling out the ""Hard R""horror, just if you could do it from your own imagination with a completely original horror concept as the remake thing is very risky. And people just don't like things to be remade.Or remake the all time gore-fest Zombie for American audiences & go all out & get a NC-17 rating!! **** out of ***** Miss Kory Kane",Halloween
244,misbegotten,Good grief - a decent horror film remake!!,8,8 December 2007,"I'm not fond of the current trend of endlessly remaking horror movies from the Seventies and Eighties, especially when some of my all-time favourite films  such as The Fog and Black Christmas  have been submitted to the Xerox treatment and the results have been totally dire. However, Rob Zombie's version of Halloween is the first horror remake that's actually worth a damn. This is because Zombie remains respectful of the original Halloween while introducing various changes, the majority of which are intriguing, work logically within the script, and are in tune with the sensibilities of a modern-day audience without deviating too far from the source material.It's clear that Zombie is a big fan of the Halloween series, as he includes references not only to John Carpenter's film, but some of the sequels, to the extent of using songs that appeared in Halloween and Halloween II, and even having characters watching the exact same movies on TV that they did in the first film. However, the biggest change that Zombie makes to the series' mythos is the least successful: in Carpenter's Halloween, Michael Myers is a nice, well behaved, unremarkable young boy growing up in white middle class suburbia, who one Halloween night puts on a clown mask and inexplicably stabs his older sister to death. Sent to a psychiatric hospital, he doesn't say a word or interact with anyone for over fifteen years. As a result, when he escapes Michael has become a quasi-supernatural figure  'The Shape'  a bogeyman in (barely) human form who walks among us, but clearly exists on another plane of reality. In contrast, Zombie spends the first half of his version of the tale giving Michael a dysfunctional white trash background: a mother who works as stripper, a violent redneck stepfather, and a slutty jailbait sister. He also reveals that Michael has been torturing and killing animals (including his own pets) from an early age. And instead of merely killing his sister, young Mikey goes on a minor killing spree before being locked up. Even then, he remains talkative, occasionally crying and whining, and busying himself by making cardboard masks. As a result, Zombie's Michael lacks the eerie otherworldly quality that Carpenter's Shape possessed, and there seems to be no connection between the extremely troubled but clearly human Michael seen in the first half of the remake, and the looming silent figure that he eventually becomes. I got the impression that Zombie had an idea rattling around in his skull about making a film exploring the internal and external factors that create a psychopath, and when he got the chance to do the Halloween remake, he decided to incorporate it. If so, then Zombie's decision is to the detriment of the three characters who were of vital importance to Carpenter's original: Michael's potential victims Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda. In the original Halloween we spend nearly half the film getting to know these three teenage girls, excitable, complex, rejoicing in some things while decrying others, with their whole lives and endless possibilities ahead of them. However, Zombie spends so much time detailing Michael's background that Laurie, Anne and Lynda are introduced barely ten minutes before Michael start cutting them up. As a result, we care little about them. Also, Carpenter's film contained only a quick glimpse of spilt blood and a brief flash of breast, all in the opening scene when Michael killed his older sister after she'd enjoyed a quickie with her boyfriend. However, times change, and Zombie's Halloween not only contains buckets of plasma, but practically every young actress in the film sheds their clothes for some lengthy nude scenes. How far we've come. I'm no prude, but it seemed unnecessary, especially as Carpenter proved it was unessential.One major plus in Zombie's favour is that he's assembled a truly great cast  even the tiniest role or one-line part is played by a legendary B movie actor (Look, there's Richard Lynch! And that's Udo Kier! Sybil Danning! etc). But perhaps the biggest coup is the casting of Danielle Harris as Annie. Nearly twenty years ago when she was a child actress, Harris played Michael's niece Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4 and Halloween 5, and together with Jamie Lee Curtis and the late Donald Pleasence, she remains forever associated with the series by its fans. Zombie had announced during pre-production that he was sick of seeing obvious twenty-something actors playing teenagers in movies, and therefore he was only going to cast actual teens in the teenage roles in this film. then he cast Harris to play high school student Annie, despite the fact she's in her early thirties. However, Harris is one of those fortunate individuals for whom the ageing process has just stopped and there's no denying that in the scenes that Harris shares with the actresses playing Laurie and Lynda, you'd never guess that she was already a horror movie veteran while they were still in nappies. Zombie clearly gets a kick out of having a genuine Halloween icon in his movie, and this results in a surprising twist regarding the character of Annie: with the exception of Laurie (the film's heroine and Final Girl), Annie is the only character who survives being attacked by Michael, despite the fact that he has plenty of opportunity to kill her. She's practically the only person who actually fights back against him, and it's subtly hinted that this earns her Michael's respect, and therefore he lets her live (Annie died in Carpenter's original). However, I suspect the real reason Annie survives is that Zombie just couldn't bear the thought of killing Danielle Harris. Rob, you're just an old softie at heart.",Halloween

I really wanted to see what Rob Zombie did with and thought he did really well.I really liked the better explanation and story about Michel Myers,even some of the story freaked me out. But the typical American teens were annoying.A very good connection with the main characters and good scare scenes, well done Rob Zombie. Good cinematography and filming.

247,Dandy_Desmond,A re imagining,6,19 August 2010,"When directors remake films they always seem to bang on about how their version will bring something new to the story and will be more of a re imagining of the original rather than a direct remake. Usually this is complete tosh. Rob Zombies Halloween does try to go its own way for a while. Rob Zombie may have his critics and to some extend I also think his movies are trashy, but he does try and make this film his own. By going back and telling the story of what made Michael a monster takes away some of the mystery but it goes its own way which I found refreshing. Michael Myers is brought up in a bad family environment and is dangerously disturbed. He is killing animals and taking their photos which is brought up to his mother by the principle when the photos are found. His mother is played by Zombie wife and movie regular Sheri Moon, who I think is a good actress. Michael then snaps, first by killing a school bully, then everyone in his family except his mother and his baby sister. The film then follows Sam Loomis and his attempt to understand and re rehabilitate Michael, who slips slowly into himself. All of this part of the story is very well done. Rob Zombie is comfortable here. However when we get to meet Laurie, Annie and Linda for what is basically the direct remake part Zombie resorts to copying Carpenter which doesn't fit his style or the films style so falls short. Overall this is one of the stronger remakes that have been out lately and but I would have liked to see Zombie do it all his way rather than feel like he had to shove the whole first film into the last 45mins. So this and the fact every character he writes swears every other word lets the movie down ultimately but not a bad attempt.",Halloween
248,A_Llama_Drama,Makes you realise just how amazing the original is,4,29 September 2007,"So, Zombie decided to remake and reinvent and breathe life into the 2nd scariest bogeyman ever after endless sequels which turned him into a parody. well, at least he did one useful thing... he helped me appreciate the original for what it is: a masterpiece in horror. Sadistic exploitative violence for the sake of sadistic exploitative violence should be discouraged. Zombie has excelled in lifting sadism to a new level with the terrificly brutal deaths of Judith Meyers, Linda, the parents, and the 16 other (oh yes, Zombie keeps Meyers busy, if Meyers shows up, it's usually either to kill someone or to kill someone in a more horrific fashion). And yes, the deaths are sick inducing and painful to watch... but anyone can do that. Just reach far enough into the human mind and it's easy to pick out 20 different ways to kill people most horridly. And this is the problem. What's the point in all the violence if there is no story behind it? Cause Zombie decided Meyers is the 400 lb gorilla that can do whatever the heck it wants? Well, that's not what he is about. Michael Meyers was a fascinating monster, his motives were unknown and he lived for nothing, he was more of a cancer, impossible to understand and always lurking unseen. Now he's a big boil on a person's face that's fill to bursting with pus. He's always there and he's always blunt and disgusting. In John Carpenter's Halloween, a story unfolded, luring us in and then holding us as Michael finally acted in murdering the girls. The opening murder of his sister was shocking, and that was it's reason, to shock us into realising that we are in for a scary ride from then on. Here, Zombie decides to drag out the opener with murder after murder and subplot after subplot before Meyers kills his doomed sister so that by the time he has committed the act it feels more like an excuse to get him the ward to cause more havoc. And that's another thing, after the stunts he pulls in the ward, any sane doctor would have the little sod shot but nope, the entire body of staff in the sanitarium have more sympathy for Meyers than his victims. Again, in Carpenter's story, the tension was built up and that's why horror movies like Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street and god help me for saying this, Hostel (yes it's super violent and it exists for nothing else but the idea is that we shared Josh's pain when he is tortured as we've been told the tale and we've become absorbed in the tension) worked, because when the tension was released through murder, it shocked us; the more tension built, the more terrifying and satisfying the deaths were. Here, we have death after death after death, no tension built, no reason or rhyme or need, so by the time Meyers decides to off Annie, the audience is sitting thinking, oh look a screaming woman crawling through a living room, hasn't that already happened like 10 times? we're also thinking, ""who gives a rat's fart?"" but i'll commend certain areas, there are some seriously scary shocks to be had during the chase between Laurie and Michael. Zombie has also done something rather clever by replacing the more iconic areas so that those of us who've seen the original will be saying, we know exactly what is gonna happen, before ripping the arse out of it and turning it on it's head. But overall, it's just a boring, over-exploitative and clichéd slasher flick with a very high body count. go buy Carpenter's version if you want a ghost story. Go watch this version if you wanna feel repulsed and dirty and bored for two hours",Halloween
249,ChiefGoreMongral,Goremongral's Movie Review: Halloween (2007),6,5 September 2007,"From the time Rob Zombie was announced as the director of the Halloween remake the bar was already set extremely high for him as he already has a fan base from his previous films that expect utter greatness or a modern classic. On the other hand Rob has the pessimistic horror fans of the original who were ready to throw Rob to the wolves with the slightest tainting of the original. After seeing the reviews and seeing the movie what I have found that though definitely not a classic or even great film Zombie does just enough to make this movie enjoyable but not without its flaws.As most may know Rob approached this movie in a viewpoint of watching the growth of Michael Myers from troubled young boy to a sadistic killing machine. For the most part the first half of this movie works. We see Michael as a child already on the road to psychopath killer, torturing animals and taking pictures of them. We also see a total screw up of a home he is from. His mom (Shari Moon) is a stripper and his stepfather (played extremely over the top by the always cool William Forscythe) who always belittles his mother, stares at his older sister in a not so fatherly way and of course make fun of little Michael and his fascination with wearing masks.We see the final straw that breaks the camels back as Michael attacks a boy that makes fun of his mom and her ""profession"". That night on Halloween the ""Massacre in Haddonfield"" happens. As oppose to us hearing about it like the original and seeing a brief murder scene with his sister, Rob's version brings that and more as we see a total brutal display as Michael takes out more than just his sister. Of course after this we have Michael heading off to the mental institute where we are made more acquainted with Dr.Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell) and get to see how his attempts to save little Michael are all in vain as well as the deteriorating mental condition of his mother.The film then spirals into act 2 which brings use to modern time Haddonfield where Michael is on the hunt for baby sister Laurie. It is here that fans of the original will see some of the things that took place in Carpenter's version re-envisioned by Zombie leading to a brother/sister confrontation that is similar but not all together the same as the original. Dr Loomis is there along with Sheriff Brackett (played by the always welcome Brad Dourif) and Laurie's friends Lynda and Annie (Danielle Harris from Halloween 4 and 5).Here in lies the problem with the film, though the first act is for the most part handled well despite the rather generic serial killer stereotypes for his reasons of murdering, it's the second act that hurts this film. For one you can tell that there seemed to be some cuts taken from the film be it for movie running time or what was felt to not be needed. Now by this I do not mean for gore but rather for what seemed to be character development or to set up the next scene. Instead of a setup we are randomly sent to the next sequence that does not give us any indication of how we got from point A to C without B. Some may be able to overlook this but it is a rather odd flaw that made me definitely realize that there is some cutting room floor stuff still out there.This second act also seemed too much like a John Carpenter Halloween-lite or Cliff Notes for the original Halloween and not a totally new vision of the film for Zombie. It is like he added some slight differences but for the most part went back to Carpenter's basic story and played ad lib with it. Again some things here worked but not all.It is these reasons alone that make this movie a tale of 2 films. If the second act could have been cleaned up a little better and provided for more twists and turns (of the knife) this would have been a solid outing for Zombie. I will say that it is better than average and horror fans can do A LOT worse despite what some reviewers are saying is the worst remake they have ever scene (please go watch some movies). The scenes of violence alone are catered to the horror fans and though not extremely gory they are violent and fun to watch (for all my little sickos like me out there). In the end Rob does enough to make this a slasher film from the killers viewpoint a solid rental title and a good matinée viewing but full price...uhhhh.The Goremongral lays down a slightly better than average score of: 6/10: Above Average, view this as a modest slasher film with good scenes of violence with a legendary horror character as its main star and you will likely enjoy this more than most. Viewing this in any other light (remake/over zealous fanboy/etc.) You will find far more flaws than I have mentioned...just wait for cable!!!",Halloween
250,shannen-l-c,A mixed bag,6,15 June 2018,"The original Halloween has been my favourite horror movie since I was first introduced to horror as a young teen. With that in mind, I didn't exactly go into this movie with high expectations. The horror genre seems to be more inclined to hash out dire prequels and remakes more so than any other movie genre, but I'm such a horror fan that I'll always indulge, no matter how terrible I expect them to be. What sets this remake apart from the original the most (aside from the entirely new cast and direction) is the attention given to Michael's childhood. The original is centred on Laurie's character, but this remake felt like it was very much Michael's story. I understand that for many people exploring Michael's past and delving more into his character was unnecessary since the fear of his character lies in the unknown. The fear of Michael lies in the unanswered questions - what made him that way? Who is to blame? Was he born that way? Did something terrible happen to make him that way? This movie tries to answer those questions but unfortunately falls short. The explanation we get is very mixed and in parts it feels that Michael's chaotic and unhappy home life is the reason why he starts to kill but later on the message seems to be that he was born a psychopath. I have to admit, the flimsy explanations did little to add to the story and whilst I think twisting the movie to look more at Michael's POV could have been great, it wasn't done very well. By the time the movie switches to the present time and we're introduced to Laurie and her friends, it feels that it's been split into two different movies. The beginning half that looks at Michael's childhood plays very little part in the second half, which reverts back to the original almost entirely. Many of the famous shots, quotes and kills are included with only very slight differences, and although for any remake it's important to keep some element of the original, it did begin to feel like a copycat in places. The changes of cast were somewhat disappointing. Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie was by far the worst of the casting decisions. Admittedly, any actress that played Laurie would have had a hard time going up against Jamie Lee, but in this remake Laurie felt all wrong. Her character was bland, unlikeable and it was very hard to sympathise with her or care if she lived or died. In the original, the audience fall in love with Laurie and are so invested because they want her to live. Part of the issue lay in the fact that this Laurie incessantly screamed and even when Michael was less than a foot away was still whimpering. Laurie in the original was a pragmatic and intelligent young girl that survived because she out-manoeuvred Michael. In this remake, she seemed utterly devoid of any common sense at all. The rest of the cast were okay - neither good nor bad - but the same problem befell all of the characters in that they seemed to be stripped of the personality they had in the original. Don't get me wrong, this remake is not actually THAT terrible. In fact, for the most part it's enjoyable and certainly a lot better than other slasher movies I've seen in the past. I love that Zombie kept the original music, because let's face it Carpenter's piece is what makes Halloween what it is and if that had been changed in some way, it wouldn't have felt right. In addition, I do think that despite the attempts to humanise Michael, he still remains scary. In fact, I'd argue that he's even more scary because we see that actually he was once a normal, cute little boy who was adored by his mother despite the less than ideal living situation he was brought up in. It makes you question even more so why Michael is this way. Clearly he has some capacity to feel which is evident when it comes to Laurie and Sam Loomis. He spares Laurie's life on more than one occasion, and even when he is trying to kill her, it almost feels like he's not actually trying. His relationship with Sam is also incredibly complex and although there's clearly not love there, there is some inexplicable bond that allows Sam to reason with Michael on some occasions (even if only for a moment). I do think the biggest success of this movie was the development of Michael's character. Some might not agree with how it was handled or how Michael's character was changed, but personally, I found it fascinating. The one thing that always bugged me about the original is that we were never given enough insight into Michael. What was his motivators? There are very few killers who kill just BECAUSE, there's always a reason, even for the most psychotic psychopaths.As far as remakes go, overall, this is a good one. However, it would have been so much better with a few changes. Better casting decisions (particularly for Laurie's character) and more care put into developing Michael's story and character could have made this almost as good as the original. What let this movie down is that in the second half it fell into the trap of imitating the original and lost sight of Michael's story. What this movie should have done is followed Michael from being a child, provided a much better explanation than what we got for why he was the way he was and showed the break-down of his mental state over a period of months/years. However, jumping very quickly through those stages of Michael's childhood and then completely neglecting it in the present, derailed the attempt to explain or make sense of Michael's character. Despite this, I would recommend this remake to fellow horror fans and fans of Halloween. It will never be good as the original, but what will? It's still worth a watch since it does have some very strong parts and adds a new perspective to Michael's character (even if it's not taken as far as I would have liked).",Halloween
251,catdogmanfish,If you like Rob Zombie,1,17 September 2020,"Halloween gets the Rob Zombie treatment, more of a love letter to 1970's slasher and skin flicks than to the original Halloween. Like all his other films, Zombie goes more for shock value than actual suspense like in the original. Carpenter didn't need to resort to cheap thrills to drive the story, he didn't need to establish ridiculously drawn out story to describe the main villain, the point of the original is there is no real reason why Michael kills, and that makes him even scarier. Basically Carpenter operates with a scalpel, Zombie operates with a chainsaw.",Halloween
252,culmo80,No where near as good as the original,5,10 October 2009,"I really wanted to like this film but it just does not measure up to the original. I think Rob Zombie can do a good job of writing a movie but he failed here.--Spoilers-- I think he spent way too much time on the young Michael Meyers and too much time of him in the hospital. While it was interesting to see more of Michael Meyers in this film, it was almost like Rob Zombie wanted to take all the little bits and pieces we got of Michael's background in the original series and put them all in one film. What results is the majority of the film being spent on building up this psychopath killer and then spending only a little time on Laurie and the actual Halloween killings that was the main focus of the original.Zombie also wanted to make this a much bloodier movie than the original Halloween and I think that is another failing. The original was notable for its lack of gore and blood. People die but you don't really see gallons of blood going everywhere like you did in other slasher films. Some of the deaths were just unnecessary to the plot such as the truck stop killing. It was a long scene just to show us how he got the jumpsuit.As for the background into Michael Meyers...what made the original Michael Meyers so great was that he had no personality. You didn't see his home life before he killed his sister, you don't learn (in the first movie) what set him off. That is what made him so great as a villain.Less is more in horror films. Knowing less about the villain works out the best. Having less scenes of gore and blood is better than overdoing it.Overall, it was just disappointing. Halloween is such a classic and Rob Zombie probably would have done well to just come up with something original.",Halloween
253,voicemaster71,Interesting Back Story But Way Too Gory,6,3 September 2007,"I saw this movie last night with my friend and his wife. My buddy is really big into horror movies, so we thought we'd check it out. What I like about the new Halloween movie is the re imagining of Michael Myers and the fact that he was given a back story. We see his face only in childhood and that was when he spoke. The kid that played the young Michael Meyers was perfectly cast and he had that demon possessed look in his face. You see the dysfunction in his family to the maximum extreme. You see when he stops speaking and when he comes across the jumpsuit, the knife, and the mask. I won't reveal any more than that, so I definitely recommend this movie in terms of a prequel story. But in terms of the violent content, the original Michael Myers of the classic Halloween movies was violent in his killings, but it was at least watchable. This new Michael Myers kills with the same grotesque level of violence that Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th series. Hey!! Now there's an idea for a horror movie. Michael VS Jason.I'd like to see that. Anyway, the rest of the movie is a condensed remake version of the original movie from 1978. And not surprisingly, there is nudity and teenage sex followed by murders. If you are a true horror movie buff with lots of blood n guts, I highly recommend this movie, especially to see the psychological back story on Micael Myers. But if not, I'd advise you to steer clear in terms of the violence because now in terms of killing, Jason Voorhees has finally met his match in Michael Myers.",Halloween
254,seveleniumus,Honest review from the fan of the series.,6,18 August 2009,"From what I've seen I would like to say, that this movie could have been very good if it hadn't been for the fact it's Halloweens remake. While it's going through itselfs original story – about Michael being little, going crazy, killing everyone, being sent to the security facility, where here progressively turns into that dark psycho Michael we all know and love, it's all perfect, I loved that, I love Halloween series and really could appreciate the effort to tell the back story, which was more or less almost non-existent before that. But since the first second movie starts to copy-cat original Halloweens scenes one by one everything starts to go down the hill – stalking fails, lurking fails, character development is non-existent, special effects fails, mostly because it's too freak-in dark and you can't see a thing, and acting fails big time too, while not to say, that original Halloween had perfect acting performances, this one really misses the point in this department. Storyline is a little more logical than originals and several plot-gaps are fixed, but it doesn't really give this movie too much bonus points. Then that's being said – it's actually one of the better ones if not the best of Halloween sequels/remakes call them however you like more. It's worse than original by far, but I'd still recommend it both for fans of the series and for those who are new to them.",Halloween
255,jaguiar313,Remake of classic is a mixed bag,6,4 October 2012,"There are things I like about Rob Zombie's remake and things I don't. Zombie's biggest mistake is de-mystifying Michael Myers. Carpenter's original had an average little boy from an average family, savagely murdering his older sister for no apparent reason on Halloween night. Zombie makes him the product of a broken white trash home with a stripper mother who has a taste for loser boyfriends. Giving Myers a reason for his violent behavior takes away the mystique the character had. Zombie's Myers is a damaged young boy who grows into a homicidal man. Carpenter's Myers was pure evil, the young boy stopped existing and grew into a vessel for an unexplained evil force. The original Myers became a supernatural being, where Zombie's Myers is all too human. Another mistake is spending over an hour examining Myers incarceration at a mental hospital before he is set loose to return home to find his little sister, now a teenager. Carpenter got things rolling within a few minutes and, in the original, Laurie Strode is a random victim, we didn't find out she was related to him till the original Halloween 2. Finally, the casting of genre legend Malcolm McDowell, as Dr. Loomis, doesn't work. I love McDowell but, his portrayal is off. He also botches a couple of the classic lines. Patrick Stewart would have made a far better Loomis, not that he would have done such a film. On the plus, Zombie does have a nice visual style and things do get intense once he let's Myers loose on the peaceful Haddonfield. Zombie's Myers has a savageness that the original Myers lost after being dragged through numerous sequels, and the havoc he raises is some of the best action the character has seen since the original. As for the climax, Zombie chooses to end his remake with a blunt and apparently final ending where John Carpenter crafted an opening ending that left us with a feeling of dread even after the film was over. I stand by my opinion that Zombie has a great horror film in him but, he needs to concentrate on using his distinct visuals more often and moving past his fascination with the 70's grind house style filmmaking which he has explored enough in his 3 films and music videos. He also needs better scripts. The lowdown: better then pretty much all of the sequels but, a far cry from John Carpenter's original masterpiece.",Halloween
256,cheighlee,The one where Rob Zombie misses the point,4,18 June 2018,"While the movie is certainly competent, reimagining one of the great horror icons left bad taste in viewers mouths... and eyes. Like someone pissed onto fans and casuals alike.As much as the the original movie (and it's sequel) tried to dehumanize Michael Myers, this reboot tried to humanize. He is a sweet kid, he has family, he speaks, he thinks, you can see his face, etc.All of it has no point and it just makes Michael Myers a shittier villain and in process, completely missing the point why Michael Myers is such a great villain.Best thing is that Myers is played by Tyler Mane and the dude is huge. And at least that adds some imposing physical menace to this version of Michael Myers.Everything else is either dialed to eleven (social interactions and characters) or is a direct copy from the original.I love Malcolm McDowell, but he was miscast here. Also, I didn't care for the rest of the cast... maybe Brad Dourif. However, I must nod to the number of cameos that Rob Zombie brought on. Most obvious is that character Anne is played by Danielle Harris that also played Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4 and 5.It's not a bad movie by itself, but it's a bad Halloween movie. An edgy disappointment for Slipknot fans in mid 2000's. Disclosure - i was a fan of Slipknot then and still hated this movie.",Halloween

258,MWNiese,Enough With the White Trash Concept Rob,3,1 September 2007,"The white trash concept worked in Rob's ""House"" and ""Rejects"", but enough is enough. How about you come up with some new screen play material Rob? I mean, you have talent, it's just that you really don't have the ability to really create a depth and range of new and refreshing horror ideas. This movie was like one big freak show cameo appearance. Yes, I loved the actors in ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses"", but did they all need to be in his ""Halloween"" remake? I found the cameo appearances distracting at best. Oh, and Rob, your wife couldn't act her way out of a tissue box. The first 45 minutes is a drag, as it tells the complete story of Michael's origins, and ruins any hope of suspense and fear that we may have about Michael. The second half of the film was a mess as well; it was rushed, the acting was poor, the dialog was brainless, the characters were underdeveloped, and frankly I didn't care about any of the people being killed. Which reminds me, the body count was way too high. The bottom line is that Carpenter is the master of horror and Zombie could have done much better.",Halloween
259,Rattrap007,A pale remake of a classic,2,23 March 2010,"Rob Zombie obviously doesn't get horror. He get's violence and gore OK, but not not the spook factor.. Heck none of the recent remakes really get their source material all that well.In the original you see a POV shot of someone looking through a mask.. A hand picks up a big knife and walks upstairs. The POV walks up to a young woman and kills her. It is then revealed in front of the house to be a small child. He has a blank stare and the house and parents look fairly well off. Then it cuts to modern times and you have the adult Michael simply walking and stalking the victims. He is slow and methodical. When he kills someone he has a bit of a quizzical reaction to their death. The deaths are never super gory. The mystery is what makes it scary. You know so little so your mind wonders what caused this all.Now we get a pointless remake. Zombie obviously hates mystery because he feels the need to to give us about half the movie devoted to how Meyers became what he is. He is the demented son of a stripper, with a sleazy nasty sister, an abusive step father, he is bullied at school, and loves to torture small animals. He is just a white trash kid with severe problems? wow.. Way to suck all the spookiness out of a film.He is no longer some supernatural force of nature. No.. he is just some psychopath who is freakishly big and strong. Nothing more. You can kinda see motives behind the killings now.Some movie killers need a back story. If they have one it is usually summed up in a few quick moments or a scary story. Think of how they gave back story to Freddy and Jason.in nightmare on Elm Street. The mother basically tells everything you need to know inside of a 2-3 minutes speech. Jason, well his mother tells it shortly too. Then in another sequel it is again told, this time as a scary story. Very brief and tells what you need to know.With this movie you get a long drawn out psychological profile of the little snot. Wow.. the home life comes as no shock. Gory and unsettling is not horror. Mystery, suspense of building up to a kill is what makes horror.This movie has holes you could drive a truck through. Like young Micheal hid the mask and knife and finds it 15+ years later? So he planned ahead 15 years? How did he know it would still be there? Was he planning to kill mommy as soon as he got out? Kill the old principal? What? Makes no sense. The original is just him holding knife with a blank stare on his face. That is creepy and scary.This movie is nothing more than an attempt to get money out of teens who think gore = horror.",Halloween
260,briandwillis-83825,Nature or Nurture?,5,5 January 2021,"Rob Zombie's Halloween has guts for the first half of the film. Love it or hate it, the cult filmmaker is at least bringing his own spin on a classic story to the table. This Michael Myers never had a chance.Born into poverty with a cruel sister, a hard working stripper mother, and trashy abusive stepfather, it's no wonder he snapped and went on a killing spree. It seems that this is what Zombie is trying to attempt for a good chunk of his retelling. He's doing the complete opposite of Carpenter and taking a more humanistic approach of the infamous boogeyman.It works in its own way for awhile until he enters the ""remake"" portion and introduces Laurie and her friends. At that point, everything's thrown out the window and Michael behaves like the Michael we've all grown to love for 8 previous films. These two halves never really jive with one another and it creates a very confusing viewing experience with each half feeling like two completely different movies.",Halloween
261,MovieDude1893,Zombie Turns a Pointless Affair into a Pretty Good Film,6,8 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is the newest film released to churn stomachs and wet pants in multiplexes across the U.S., and while it delivers it share of thrills, the film seems half baked.Zombie never really takes any huge liberties with the basic story line, except for a few key facts involving Michael's family life and his family in general. Feared killer Michael Myers, has escaped from the mental institution and is back in his home town... ready to kill again.What Zombie presents us with to begin his film is a flash back. A flashback to little Mikey Myers, who has his life in shambles even at age 10. His father is dead, his mother is a stripper, and his sister has loose morals to say the least. Apparently, Ms. Myers has horrible taste in men considering she has a crippled, foul mouthed, horse's ass permanently slopped on her couch (the vitriolic William Forsythe.) But, Mikey has all the qualities of a healthy kid... you know, like collecting dead animals in his backpack. One day he snaps and you know the rest...As his Dr. Sam Loomis, Zombie has cast Malcom McDowell. McDowell is very good as Loomis, in my opinion the highlight of the film.With his last two films, Rob Zombie has fashioned himself as a bit of a grunge film making auteur, he continues this in Halloween. It is almost exhilarating how refreshing it is to see someone use every horror trick in the book and make it seem so natural. Zombie revels in the boos around each corner. This is a double edged sword. For every re-appearance of Myers, we have dead space. In the original, Carpenter filled every moment with spine tingling suspense. That is the factor Zombie lacks here. That being said he is still an interesting director who truly knows how to frame a death scene.With so much crap being put out and paraded around as horror, this one actually has a bit more boo in its blood (and there is much blood spilt.)Eli Roth, take note. Zombie knows how to treat an audience to a good time.",Halloween

I didn't watch this 'till now because I thought this was again some moron remake of original, thank god I watched.I've seen Halloween's you people wouldn't believe... ;) Laurie Strode was little hard to get in this movie, somehow similar voice to Curtis.This wasn't only horror almost at all, this was very interesting, didn't fell asleep in middle etc.The reason why I'm not giving more points is that if u haven't seen those before you probably don't have any idea whats happening.BUT best ""remake"" I've seen so far. Truly great cutting and storyline, like a prequel attached to remake. Little bit long but I don't think it was bad idea. Long story, long movie.

263,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,"""The Best of the Slasher Remakes"" - Theatrical Cut",8,10 October 2020,"""Halloween"" or as most people call it; ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"" is a remake of the iconic slasher film from 1978. It tells the story of a 10-year-old boy named Michael Myers who lives a horrible life with negativity surrounding him. But on Halloween eve, that all changes..When people release their rankings of the Halloween franchise the Rob Zombie films always ends up towards the bottom of the list, and I do understand why. First of all you have the ""unforgivable sin"" that this remake humanizes Michael Myers, then there's the huge amounts of severe language followed up by a lot of intense and unsettling kill scenes. Buckle up, because I'm here to defend!I really like that Rob Zombie took a different direction in giving Myers an actual backstory, because I really didn't want to see a complete shot for shot remake of the original film. I think the first 30 minutes of this movie is the best thing about it. It's dark, brutal, scary, intense and sets the tone for the rest of the film. Then we move on to the second act which I will admit could have been done better, but it's still pretty good. Then we meet all of the main characters like Linda, Annie (played by the great Danielle Harris) and the infamous final girl Laurie. Oh, and we also have the legend Brad Dourif playing the Sheriff in this one. Now moving on to my problems.Even though it's nice to see Myers in action, I do think the third act lacks a lot of the atmosphere and suspense that the first and second act had. Most of that is just because it's pretty much a repeat of the original movie. And since we have all seen that original film a million times, it makes the third act feel out of place and loose some of its atmosphere. Then I have to bring up the unnecessary explicit nudity, because there's far too much of it. But really, that's about it with the negatives.It's not perfect, I know. But It's definitely the best of the slasher remakes in my opinion. Even though most of its dark and creepy atmosphere is gone in the third act, the positives outweigh the negatives for me.Horror: A- (Creepy, Unsettling, Brutal)Entertainment: C+ (Not Really an Entertaining Film Since it's Quite Realistic)Acting: B+ (Good Performances Throughout)Suspense: B (Some Very Suspenseful Moments, First act Especially)Characters: C (Myers and Laurie are the Best Ones)Script/Story: B- (A Nice Fresh Take of the Original Story)Overall Rating: 7.4/10.",Halloween
264,zactac,"I went, I saw, and didn't feel to pleased.",6,3 May 2010,"This is a movie where you have to walk in saying to yourself who is making this film. I did that and even then it didn't prepare me enough for what I was about to see. I'm afraid the only thing you could compare it to being better than is the third and sixth Halloween films.I am a huge Halloween fan and I love how Michael is just the smart, scary, and sadistic killer he is. In this film it is hard for me to see that, while he still kills in a gruesome way he doesn't have the feel I got from the Michael from the other films. In this we see that he has his own intentions and some doesn't involve killing. But I think I'll let some of you who haven't seen the movie find out what they are on your own.While I am pleased that it wasn't made to much like the original to where it had some sense of originality it wasn't enough to please me. I do like how there is a feeling of actuality coming from the film and that is something the film-makers succeeded in however they didn't do to good at how it comes out. The story is to Michael centered, it is made in a way that you don't get any kind of feelings for the characters so all you see them as are a bunch of teens who have sex and act like they deserve whats coming. There is so much gore it takes away the suspense of the kill and it doesn't feel like the story has been well developed. While I had my moments of enjoyment through the film I'm afraid it barely phased me as much as a Sci-fi channel slasher movie does (and that's not much). While the remake comes as a stand alone story, fills the scenes with gruesome kills, and goes a little deeper into Michael Myers' past, it does little to honor one of the greatest slasher films in history.",Halloween
265,eytand94,"The best ""Halloween"" movie since ""H20!"" An underrated masterpiece!",10,29 August 2009,"Some fans loved Rob Zombie's vision of the classic 1978 scare show while some absolutely hated it. Lucky for me, I'm one of the people who loved it, and I still do 2 years later. 2007's ""Halloween"" is very scary, filled with tension, has plenty of violence and gore and it has the most nudity I've seen for a horror film in years.What Zombie does with his ""Halloween"" is he makes it his own. The 45-minute prologue introducing Michael as a child was unexpected and fun to watch. The rest of the movie was what Zombie would've done if he copied the original. However, he adds new elements to the last act that are original and frightening.Tyler Mane dons the white mask this time around, and he depicts the scariest Michael in years. He's stronger and more angry than in any of the sequels he's been in. And he's tall, too. Michael slowly closes in on the camera, which creates tremendous claustrophobia. Points for that, Rob.And this ""Halloween"" has a great, well-rounded cast of young and old stars. Malcolm MacDowell is always a pleasure to watch, and he's wonderful here as Dr. Loomis. I enjoy the new portrayal of Laurie Strode, which is played by the great Scout Taylor-Compton. She creates a different character from Jamie Lee Curtis's iconic heroine, and adds some spunk to her. And man, can Scout scream! And whenever you have Danielle Harris in a ""Halloween"" movie, it's a dream come true for the fans. Harris is awesome as Annie. The rest of the cast is perfect with Kristina Klebe as the bad girl Lynda, Sheri Moon Zombie(who, for once, is playing someone normal) as Michael's mom, Deborah, William Forsyth as Ronnie White, and Daeg Faerch is very believable as young Mikey. Along with those guys, Zombie adds some very famous horror stars that you never imagined would be in this. All in all, a perfect cast.Zombie's vision of ""Halloween"" is never going to be the original, but then again, it wasn't intended to be. The 1978 film remains a classic. And for a movie of its time, 2007's ""Halloween"" couldn't be any more fun or scary. This one is no trick. It's a bona-fide treat! ***1/2",Halloween
266,tamstrat,In a word-DISGUSTING,1,6 January 2008,"I will be the first to admit I am a mid 40 mom of 2 who knows very little about Rob Zombie who directed and wrote the screenplay for this piece of trash. But I remember being a senior in high school and going to the original ""Halloween"" by John Carpenter and Debra Hill and being terrified for days after. This movie wasn't scary-it was just plain gross and badly written and filmed. As many others here have stated, Zombie took an American Classic movie and put his own sick, misogynistic spin on it. Why? In the original, what was so scary to me personally was the fact that we did not know why Michael Myers was so evil-was he demonic, pure evil or just a little boy who was severely pathological? Carpenter did not tell and that added to the suspense and horror. Here, in the first minutes of the movie we find out that poor Michael is the product of a severely dysfunctional, white trash family. This causes someone to go nuts and gruesomely murder family members and strangers alike? I think not. The characters are not likable, the only one I did like, the Hispanic janitor in the asylum was killed off by his friend ""Mikey"". There was no character development of anyone. The language was horrible. Does every single person have to use the vilest language imaginable in order to get their point across? It was absurd. The females in the movie were all horrible and annoying. Even Laurie, the lovable, level headed babysitter in the original movie was annoying. I felt no connection with her whatsoever. Annie and Lynda were so obnoxious in this movie. Horrible! The thing that really bothered me was the amount of violence Zombie used in this film towards the females. The rape scene in the asylum was totally disgusting and pointless. It had no plot value, it was just Zombie wanting to throw it in for shock value or his own sick fantasies, whichever it is, it was pointless and disgusting. Also, the killing of Lynda and Annie's attack again tells me that deep down Zombie is a misogynist, I really believe it. Poor Malcolm McDowell, the brilliant actor from ""A Clockwork Orange"" has been reduced to this. How sad.While I am not familiar with Zombie's previous movies, if they are anywhere near as bad as this one I will stay away. If you revere the original ""Halloween"" don't waste your valuable time watching this garbage.",Halloween
267,citizenchris,it did something I have seen few other slasher films do....it made the boogy man a person,7,15 July 2008,"Halloween 7-15-08 Admitadly slasher films aren't my favorite horror sub genre. They have a few fundamental flaws chief amongst them being that the horror is generally derived from the anticipation of the inevitable death of two dimensional uninteresting characters at the hands of a seemingly unstoppable (and even flatter character wise) masked ""boogy man"". So why did I like a re-make of the prototypical slasher film of the same name? Because it did something I have seen few other slasher films do....it made the boogy man a person. Yes ladies and gentle man your killer for the evening is in fact a human being that was believe it or not a child at one point. Halloween feels a lot like watching a balancing act. On the one hand it wants to do something different yet at the same time its decidedly old school. Here we have a film that at the end of the day knows what it is....a slasher film. Once we are past the initial ""prequel"" segment of the film it descends into the afore mentioned genre traditions. Cute teen girls hunted by a really big guy intent upon killing them cus...well thats what he does. What I was left asking myself was did the prequel portion in any way alter my perception of the rest of the film or rather did it make it any better? Ultimately not really but I didn't care as I was left with a really good slasher film.",Halloween
268,Milo-Jeeder,This is how you make a formerly frightening villain look un-frightening,4,4 September 2007,"I don't have a problem with remakes per se. Even though I am not a big fan of the original ""Halloween"" film directed by John Carpenter, I do acknowledge it as a film that started a horror slasher trend and served as an inspiration for many of the films that came after it. Since I am not crazy about the 1978 film, I thought I would be able to enjoy this remake without being too influenced by my love for the original film. After seeing this remake, I started to appreciate the original version a little bit more, since Rob Zombie turned the story and its characters into a vulgar mess.The original film mostly focuses on the life of Laurie Strode going on about her business and interacting with her friends for the most part, while we see the mysterious Michael Myers stalking her, appearing from out of nowhere, and we never really get to know why (without taking the sequels into account). In this remake, Rob Zombie attempts to explore little Michael Myers' psychology, giving our villain a soul and establishing the roots of his evilness, taking away all the mystery and darkness surrounding the character. The results are not good by any means and the only thing it proves, is that sometimes, mystery is scarier and more disturbing than having everything explained, especially if the explanation is as predictable as ""he was raised in a bad environment"". The audience doesn't want to be spoon fed and I think it's clear that one of the main reasons why the original villain was scary, it's because Michael Myers remained as an enigmatic character from the beginning until the end. In the original film, Myers appears to come from a seemingly normal family, but for some reason, he turns out a merciless killer anyway. While the original ""Halloween"" film is not my favorite, as I established before, I do give the film credit for giving us a villain that no one could ever sympathize with. This film basically tries to portrait Michael as a poor little thing who was poorly raised and eliminates any possibility of seeing him as a genuinely dark and fear-provoking character. This overexposure of Michael's early years lasts about 40 minutes, which gets tedious, it makes the villain more pitiful than frightening and in the end, they don't really manage to establish a point about his insanity all that well either.Rob Zombie seems to borrow things from previous film, ""House of 1000 Corpses"", since the characters in this remake are swearing most of the times and while I have nothing against swearing, I think it gets artificial and silly when we hear the characters yelling and saying the f-word every five seconds. My noble advice for all fans of the original 'Halloween' movie is: Don't watch this remake if you're sensitive, because this hurts a lot. I know I felt cheated, even if I'm not a fan of Carpenter's version either.",Halloween
269,impendingdd,One of many faulty remakes,1,24 March 2020,"In theory, a remake of an iconic horror directed by the frontman of a popular metal band (and respectfully some original horrors of his own) sounds like a cool idea. I wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the childhood portion because I liked the kid who played Michael Myers. He looked evil and it kind of worked. Even though exposing and explaining the evil behind something weakens the mystery of it (many will argue the scariest part of something evil is it's lack of motive), it is the basic story of young Michael portrayed correctly, though modernized, a bit exaggerated, and raunchy in a Rob Zombie way. I hated it upon my first viewing, but after trying again I was able to watch it with the acceptance I had of having to know more than we need to about Michael. But Zombie's only good for only one thing in this movie: The redneck nastiness. When Michael begins to unleash his evil again as an adult it's transparent that Zombie has no clue how to direct a horror film. For starters, whose brilliant idea was it to make Michael Myers look like a WWE wrestler? It's very hard to take seriously. Michael is pure evil and can't be killed (Zombie actually did kill Michael off in an alternate ending, with no plans for a sequel). To make him enormous with metal hair is complete overkill. It looks silly. Leave the bulkiness to Jason. More importantly though, Zombie is incapable of creating proper suspense. The 2009 Friday the 13th remake suffered the same problem. It's very boring. There's no build up to a kill, it's just killing - as if that's enough. Gore isn't essential in horror, it doesn't scare so much as it disturbs or grosses out. The original Halloween and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre are surprisingly light on gore, yet they embody the very definition of horror. The film itself isn't good by any means on a critical level, but then again a lot of Halloween films and horror in general aren't striving to be, or at least not successful at, being critically acclaimed, they have to be at least fun and true to the franchise. This film lacks in both departments. It's not a good movie for critics and it's not a good movie for true fans of Michael. Leaving the grey area to be enjoyed by people who either love Rob Zombie or kids that are more entertained by quick kills and vulgar dialogue for the sake of edginess. I might add, no one can match Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis. He's one of those characters whose actor's performance of makes them hard to replace. But I will say as a replacement, Malcolm McDowell did just fine. He deserved a better script, but the casting could have been worse. Overall, it's a forgettable movie that has no importance in cinema history or in the horror genre. Zombie seems to love Halloween and horror, but not everyone can be good at creating (or recreating) what they love.",Halloween

Rob Zombie's interpretation is nigh on the same as every other rehash i.e. nothing new... they've tried to give the story behind Michael Myers and failed big time... the start is so over the top it's untrue... McDowell is completely wasted... and there's no characters at all throughout the film apart from him. The girls in it, couldn't even tell you one of their names I was so disinterested in whether they lived or died... it makes the originals characterisation looks like Pulp Fiction...This is a shame but I expected nothing more to be honest... this just turned into a re-hash of a 20 year old film? Why? Very similar in fact to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"" in the fact that they could've done something mroe special and really give you in-depth why he does what he does...In fact, I'm starting to change my opinion on Hannibal Rising because of these films, in fact, as these make that look like a true life story!

The original Halloween which has been dumbed the first slasher was a pointless movie about stereotyped teenagers dying at the hands of a crazy man, didn't know any of the characters didn't care and over the top special effects with literally buckets of blood. This remake gives the killer a back story and introduces him as a person who kills and introduces the teenagers at least a bit before some are killed. Ultimately it has the same basic shallow plot line the original did, so it is almost as pointless as the original. The original I'd give 2 maybe 3 stars this for 5 because it added to the plot line and spent time to develop the characters more along with better special effects it felt more believable even if it was still a pointless movie. I have no desire to watch either version again but this remake felt less of an amateur film where as the original looked like something made in a college film class.",Halloween

273,eched,Rob Zombie Strikes Again!,3,24 December 2007,"A few things should be noted before you read this review. I'm not a fan of Zombie as a director. All of his films have been sub par for me, and the only reason I saw this was because I'm having a bit of a gore fest and I heard that this version of Halloween did in fact have some blood in it.I'm also not a big fan of the original. I thought the pace was a bit slow, BUT none the less the original Halloween was a film with a smart concept. IE. to show what evil would be like if it was simply a force of nature.It was a unique interpretation of what evil could be like. This was not some killer with a motive to his crimes. This was not something that could be explained or reasoned with, it was just evil, and that was it.It was such a simple, yet interesting idea. So many films try to explain away inhuman acts, and Halloween just said screw it and didn't explain a thing. For that alone I understand why it is held so highly, even if I couldn't get into it.Anyways, If you have seen Halloween the original, then you've seen this. This isn't a recreation of Halloween. All this is, is a two bit back story stapled onto the Halloween we already have. Myers is given a back story, which obviously isn't needed because why doe Myers even need a motive? Once the back story is done(I admit it is a long back story, but only cause it's dragged out) the original Halloween starts. Entire scenes are shamefully recreated. Lines from the original are used instead of new dialog. Really, the only 'new' things this film brings to the table is blood(which isn't needed, despite my gore fest), nudity, the two note back story, and a rape scene, which fits in with Halloween about as well as a flying pig in Friday the 13th.Other then that, every scene from the original is simply reused, and poorly.The scenes that Rob does add come off as jokes. There is an actual scene, not kidding, that plays Love Hurts to make us feel sorry for Myers. There Myers is, crying his eyes out, and about to kill his whole family, and the song Love Hurts is blaring over the film. I have never seen such a cheap scam to get a tear from the viewer.The list goes on and on for flaws in this film, but I'll just stop it there. Happy Halloween, oh, I mean Christmas. Man, even the release date was screwed up.",Halloween
274,travisvincent,Halloween Redux,1,2 September 2007,"I was a bit skeptical before seeing this movie. Like most of the reviewers on this title, I'm a die hard Halloween fan who's seen the best and the worst of its sequels. While nothing can out perform the original, in this current incarnation we have a film that redefines the movie while still keeping true to crucial elements of the original. Having said that, Rob Zombies Halloween is in itself a completely new movie-it has many flaws but isn't entirely horrible. It begins with the origins of Michael Myers childhood life, his mother is a good mom but she's a stripper, his father or stepfather is an a-hole and his sister appears to be a bit on the skanky side. This makes Michael go ape-sh*t and he kills them, he spares his mother, who was out working,and his just-a-baby sister Laurie...oh, yeah, he also wacked the school bully in the woods with a huge tree branch and killed him--and that was on his way home from school. Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium and Dr. Loomis begins his role in Michael's life. Sixteen years later (11 months before he was committed and 15 years before he escapes.) Now that Michael is on the lam, he does a number on a trucker, steals his jumpsuit, hence the jumpsuit, and heads on in to Haddonfield USA. The rest of the movie plays out in an orderly fashion as those familiar with the original Halloween, with some good interpretations Rob manages to keep the second half of the story pretty true to the original movie. The directing is excellent, the soundtrack and the distortion of the audio in key scenes escalate the suspense. The movie also contains a hell of a lot of cussing and i mean A LOT of cussing, which seems to bring the movie down a bit, plus another major letdown is the acting...its horrible. It was sooooooooooo bad. Halloween reminded me a lot of how Batman was redone, gritty and dark. Batman didn't try to make up forget the original, but it did add a new spin, Halloween is the same. Rob Zombie, in my opinion, didn't do that great of a job directing Halloween but still didn't totally suck. Its worth a look, but nothing will ever replace the original.",Halloween
275,achmoye,Decent remake,6,1 November 2018,"Rob zombie did a pretty good job reviving this 1978 classic, the technical work is amazing and all, but some key scenes were removed from the original movie and therefore some things don't make sense.For example, the kid is bullied in the 1978 version : a bunch of kids harass him, telling him that the boogie man is gonna get him, so he actually has a reason to be curious about it and ask his babysitter.In the 2007 version, the bullying scene is removed so he is just obsessed about the boogie man myth for absolutely no reason.Besides, (and this is true for both versions) when the characters see this creepy guy with a mask staring at them in school, they almost have no reaction when they should just freakout because they have seen this creep for a while now. The girl is kind of worried when she should have called the cops days ago.Also Myers is super-strong (again, both versions) and nothing explains it. In 2007 version it's even worse, he's a superhuman, nothing can stop him when he's just supposed to be a guy behind a mask, not exactly into workout.This story is lacking depth and background. He lives in a messed up family and that could make him angry and all, but it doesn't explain why he becomes a silent killing machine. It kind of escaladates quickly here.Also, it's a slasher movie, but it doesn't mean it's OK to make a movie only based on the mere accumulation of murder. After 2, 3, 4 murders, what have we learned ? Where is the character development ?
In the end it may be a classic but I don't see nothing more than a technically perfect teenage popocorn spooky flick.",Halloween

Plus, how the hell does Dee Wallace have a teenage daughter, she must be 70, great to see her though ;-) Also as some others have said, the language is way too much, in the original family, people very rarely spoke like that then, especially children. Stuff like this does make you wonder how it got 'Green Lit' it's sad really!!",Halloween
277,brianlion,This contains no Spoiler. Unless you include the movie itself,1,1 February 2008,"It is obvious after watching the newest version of Halloween, that many directors and producers don't have a clue how to make a true movie. They start with mindless, un- clever scripts, use nudity and profanity when they get stuck, and throw in some gore for shock value. The producers of this film need to sit down and quietly watch the original Halloween. No blood, no graphic rape scene, no yapping and swearing to fill the scene. This Rob Zombie attempt falls way short, and is a disgrace. Hey Rob, did your friends and family swell up with pride watching each scene unfold, complete with profanity, graphic nudity and a feeling of nastiness through out the movie. What a waste of my money and my time.",Halloween
278,rupert-ian,Better than the Original IMO,8,1 September 2015,"Possible Spoilers, but I really tried not to....I really like this movie. I have seen every single Halloween movie, I really enjoy them, but I honestly feel this is better than the original. First off, this movie goes into way more depth as to WHO Michael Meyers is, and WHY he's so evil/screwed up. The original has a, what, two minute long extremely crappy beginning where Michael is a kid, and for no reason goes homicidal? There's just no buildup of his character. There's no reason for his madness... I absolutely hate the beginning of the original. No.. That doesn't work for me. When he shows up later in the movie, he's just not as scary because all you know is that he killed someone when he was a kid (trying to leave out exact details as to not be a spoiler)The remake goes into excellent detail, I love how they spend more time with his childhood and progression into madness. It makes the character much more menacing when you understand more about what flipped his crazy switch. I like everything about the Michael character in the remake better than the original. He's bigger, the mask is better, he seems more scary, he doesn't make the stupid noises, etc. I have always been a horror fan, but this will sound really weird to people: I never was big into Freddy, Jason, or the Michael Meyers movies. I saw and loved soooo many other horror movies (I am 35 so most people my age grew up with those three franchises), but I just wasn't into those them. So, it was actually AFTER the remake that I watched all the originals. I understand for people who grew up loving the old ones how they might hate on this movie for the differences, but they completely worked for me. I find myself caring more about the characters in the remake. When I watch the original, I just don't fear for or care about anyone but Dr. Loomis. IMO, everyone else is pretty terrible... Annie was a better character, I cared more about her than the lead girl. I understand that my opinion is just that, and it probably isn't a popular one. I can't expect people who love the original to watch the remake and feel this way, but try to have an open mind and give it a chance. It's paying homage to the original, not trying to poo on it. Also, get over the Rob Zombie hate, if you can't handle the fact that he's a pretty decent director (better at directing than a musician IMO) Repeating myself again, the detail and depth of Michael's childhood, and his work with Dr Loomis made the remake SO much better for me. If the remake is an 8 in my opinion, I would call the original a 6. I even find the original Halloween 2 to be superior to original Halloween 1. In my opinion, the suspense is better, the story is better, the direction and acting are better, the characters are better, and once you finally learn more about the back story, it makes Michael a tad more menacing and scary. In the original, he's just some dude in a mask who is super strong and makes noises like a mentally challenged person when he attacks someone. Knowing why he's nuts makes it much better. 8/10",Halloween
279,j-penkair,Unnecessary Additions,5,1 November 2014,"John Carpenter succeeded with ""Halloween"" because he was an honest story teller. We followed him every step of the way, feeling his honesty and sincerity, and got disturbed magnificently. This is why ""Halloween"" remains a classic. Enduring films and books always base on simple and well-intended directions. Rob Zombie's remake falls into a curse of having to do more, just to justify a replay. Complexity added to this new version, being Dr. Loomis's anguishes or abuses Michael had received as a child, might be useful for the Halloween-film textbook / companion, but it is utterly unnecessary as a story telling, let alone the one so already well-told. I grew up with John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and its images are still haunting me to this day. Zombie's version left me nothing to feel, except the weight of self-justification on the director's part. If this film was presented as a different film, perhaps admitting to be inspired by the original film, it would not be a bad work. Rob Zombie is skilled, intense, and thorough. He should stop trying to do the redundancy and go for his own pioneering. Hollywood studios do remakes because of the financial and age-bridging reasons. Artists do not have to go along and get hurt in the process. I recommend Rob Zombie to movie lovers, but not his horrendous ""Halloween"".",Halloween
280,coldstick,Surprisingly good remake!,7,23 November 2007,"The original ""Halloween"" is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I saw it home alone when I was little, and scared the bejeezus out of me. I have seen it numerous times, and every time it retains its creepiness.So when I heard Rob Zombie was going to remake a classic like Halloween, I wasn't sure what to think. On the one hand, I largely enjoyed Zombie's previous movies (particularly The Devil's Rejects). On the other hand, I wasn't sure if I wanted *anybody* remaking Halloween.Now, a lot of rock stars think they can make horror movies, but end up sucking big time at it (coughdeesnidercough). The rock star who can actually do film is pretty rare. As a lifelong horror fan, I can say that Zombie IS very good at it--so good, in fact, that I think he pulled off what not many directors would be able to: a decent remake of Halloween. The remake keeps most of the best parts of the original, but expands on it much more, especially Michael's backstory. Zombie's Michael Myers is more brutal, vicious, and corrupt than John Carpenter's.A lot of people complained about the babysitter, but I thought she was cast perfectly well: she seemed like a perfectly ordinary teenage girl. Was she not in it enough? Well, she wasn't in it much, but the original was already centered around her. Zombie's remake is far more about Michael than the babysitter. His additions to the story are effective and interesting. He doesn't just ""go through the motions"" of the original and then cash his paycheck, like most worthless directors do with remakes.All I can say is: thank god Zombie remade this before some other stupid hack director remade it into a crappy PG-13 snorefest. I don't want to say too much more about the movie, but if you're a horror fan who is curious,check it out! You might end up enjoying yourself.",Halloween
281,EmmeCHammer,Thanks a lot!,1,12 June 2019,"Rob Zombie managed to ruin the Best Horror/Slasher movie of all time.

But don't be discouraged just watch Halloween 2018 to somewhat salvage what John Carpenter invented. By the way he hates the fact that he lent his genius to Rob, he said it not me. Boy his wife sure can act......NOT!!!!!!!",Halloween
282,Hellrazr360,"Not Horrible So To Speak, But a Pretty Big Letdown",4,4 September 2007,"There's no question that Rob Zombie's a talent artist, whether it was back in the eighties and nineties with White Zombie or nowadays with his solo work. However, with his first two movies, reception wasn't as welcoming from everyone. But House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects could almost be dismissed as pointless horror violence, and now Rob's given us his re-imagining of John Carpenter's 1978 classic. While it's admirable that Zombie tried to create a unique vision of Halloween, it just doesn't wind up being that great of a film.The plot line for this Halloween movies is basically the same as the original, with a back-story for Michael Myers added in. While most Halloween fans will look at Myers' back-story as one of the film's major weak-points, I actually found it the best part of the movie. True, not knowing what Michael Myers incentives towards killing did make his character menacing, but Zombie's back-story (in my view at least) feels fitting for Myers character.The young actor who plays as the young Michael Myers (Daeg Fraerch), sad to say, was probably the best performer in the whole movie. Not to insult him or anything, he actually did a superb job as this delusional and demented child. Unfortunately, it's still a pretty bad thing to admit when you realize that one of the youngest actors in the movie turns out to be the star of the movie.Myers back-story takes up about forty-five minutes of the movie, and from there on, it's basically Halloween I with a more modern look and more sex...a lot more sex. This is where the movie begins to go downhill. The acting during the second half the film is mediocre at best, it feels like the only half-decent actor is Malcolm McDowell, but even he didn't do that good of a job. The young actresses were obviously picked for some eye candy, and they do just that.But seriously, just how much sex does Rob Zombie think we need? There must've been four or five sex/nudity scenes in the film, and I don't think any more than one would've been necessary. Seriously, not every teenager that goes into the theaters will see it for the babes. If anything, we want to see how well the movie works out as a modern age Halloween, not to see some lame sex scenes that anyone could find on the internet (if not then a few better ones).This gets me to my next gripe with the film: the pacing. Half of the movie is dedicated to Myers' back-story, and a few good minutes are wasted on sex and nudity shots. What's left is one hour to retell the whole original Halloween movie. Fitting the original Halloween into an hour-long modern vision isn't exactly easy, I don't think anyone could manage to pull it off without some major issue.Unfortunately, what this results in is the movie feeling really rushed for the second half. This not only shows in how quickly the movie passes by, but also in how bad the camera angles get in some areas. Think modern-age Sonic the Hedgehog games and you get a small taste of that with the camera shots in Halloween.Rob Zombie's take on Halloween is an admirable effort, but it just doesn't manage to satisfy. My best piece of advise would be to watch the beginning of the movie and then, once Myers breaks out of the institute, go home and watch the original. Not only will the pacing be a lot better, but you'll be getting a much better movie out of it than the cheap hour offered up by this ""re-imagining"".",Halloween
283,RHPSvegas,Try to open your mind and shut your mouth!,9,4 September 2007,"When Rob was originally contacted, he was asked to make another sequel. He said he wasn't interested in making yet another sequel, especially after the last several have been so bad. He came up with a re-imagining (which is exactly what it is) of the original story, but before he did anything he contacted John Carpenter and asked for permission. Carpenter himself gave him the go-ahead!! Therefor, if anyone's p***ed at Rob's version, just remember: he got permission from the original creator to do it.I, as an avid fan of the original Halloween, was totally against a remake. However, after I heard Rob was at the helm and that he'd gotten permission from John Carpenter, I decided to give this film a shot. I actually wound up liking it, as I didn't go in with any preconceived notions that it would suck. There are so many close-minded people who went in not wanting to give this movie a chance and therefor immediately saw flaws everywhere. I went in with an open mind not expecting a direct remake (which I usually hate) and went in with the mindset of, ""this is going to be something different; someone else's take on the subject matter"" and I was therefor pleasantly surprised.This was not only a re-imagining, but also an update for today's audience's (which are, frankly, attention deficit). So far I've seen this film twice (once in LA, once in Vegas), and both times there were children in the audience, most of whom had sneaked in, some of whom had come with parents. The ones that came with parents were almost twice as ill-behaved because the parents kept talking throughout the movie with the kids chiming in! It's totally disrespectful to talk through a movie (unless of course you're at The Rocky Horror Picture Show). I feel that that also ruins the movie-going experience, leading many to conclude that it was a ""bad film"" because they missed so much of it due to the distractions of others. This is also an unfair was to analyze or criticize a film.To sum up, what I'm saying here is: 1) respect the work on the screen for what it is (NOT a direct remake), 2) realize that the director/writer got the go-ahead from the original director/writer, 3) form your own opinions and do not let others' opinions or voices during the film influence you. Have an open mind about it and you may just find yourself enjoying it.",Halloween
284,ajaws4ever,Rob Zombie reinvents a legend. Better than the original.,10,25 August 2007,"I saw 'Halloween' at a special sneak preview last night and I really enjoyed it...a lot: One of the best, scariest, and brutal horror movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It is longer than the original, so it holds more terror and blood than ever before. And it's a lot more bloody than the original...in fact bloodier than all of them, if you can imagine that.But it's directed by Rob Zombie, so what do you expect? In the original, they left a lot of the blood flow to your imagination, but in this terrifying remake, there is more blood than you would expect...even if it is directed by Zombie. It is very brutal and bloody and terrorizing.But it's 2007, so what do you expect? A lot of people think that this movie would totally suck...but they're totally wrong. This Halloween is better than the original. Rob Zombie really brought it into modern times and extended it, bringing more and more modern things as the movie goes along. The girls are hotter than the original (well, duh), and there are more details about even the little things in the remake than in the original.There is a lot more behind Michael Myers in this movie than in the original. There are a lot more details about how he became a sicko-killer, and about why he is doing all of this. Rob Zombie seemed to know what he was doing.This film will make a lot of money, I can guarantee it. This is a big deal and a big remake. Rob Zombie really invented a legend.

285,The_Defiant1,A Prolonged Disappointment,3,20 September 2007,"This movie is truly disappointing. If you've seen the original Halloween movie that this is based upon, then the remake is more of a prequel that goes a step further and bores you with a very unsuspenseful retelling the original.In the original movie, a psychopath from a mental institution escapes and shatters the calm of Haddonfield, a peaceful and content community. In this remake, Haddonfield is hardly established as a peaceful and content community. We see Michael Myers grow up in a dysfunctional family where his mom Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper. His older sister is a tramp, and the step father is a loathsome and obnoxious crippled man.If the movie were to have stopped at being simply a prequel, it would have been an imaginative and insightful look at Michael Myers' past. Unfortunately the movie drags on and does an exceptionally rushed and poor retelling of the original. It takes all the mood and suspense of the original and just rehashes the same material. The difference is that you really don't have a connection to the characters in the remake. It is just a series of murders one after the other.This movie fails in every area where the original succeeded. In the original, the background music and video clips on television are used to foreshadow the impending horror. They set a mood of calm while conveying an anticipation of horror. In the remake, background music and television clips are thrown in as an homage to the original. It is as if the film makers did not understand the plot mechanisms which made the original movie good. In one scene a Rush song is blasting, and it has no apparent relevance to the story at all. In other instances they play Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear The Reaper"", not only once, but twice. The mood is wrong and it is an awkward break to an already unsuspenseful movie. This movie lacks the original score or a comparable substitute, so the viewer has nothing to set the mood. It's all hack, slash, kill.The casting and look of the characters is another disappointment. Most of the characters look unkept as if Rob Zombie himself had done their hair. Most characters looked, lived, and talked trashy. The foul language was tossed around without discretion as if to educate preteens rather than represent a realistic conversation. Malcolm McDowell completely fails in the role of Dr. Samuel Loomis. Rather than appearing as a wise and educated doctor, he comes across more as a concerned hippie who is friends to the family.If you are impressed by curse words, rent the movie. If you want to see a great classic ruined, see the movie. If you like seeing unkept hair that's been run through a blender, rent the movie. This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters. It is not worth owning the DVD unless you just truly idolize Rob Zombie and want everything he's worked on.",Halloween
286,Pythe,My thoughts after just seeing this...,6,23 September 2007,"I'm not really a huge fan of Rob Zombie as a filmmaker--House of 1000 Corpses felt like a needless exercise in sadism and torture. I also think the original film is an icon of the genre, one of the most well-executed suspense films of all time. Needless to say, I was apprehensive at what Zombie would do with the franchise.I guess the most positive thing I can say is that this is Zombie's take on Halloween, rather than Zombie's take on Carpenter's take on Halloween; it's obvious that, whenever he encountered a dead end in his creative process, Zombie probably didn't look down at his WWJCD bracelet for inspiration. There are a few scenes that very closely echo the original, but they feel like homages to a distant relative. Unlike most remakes, it feels like Zombie was counting on our knowledge of the original so that he could more easily set up, then shatter, our expectations. This isn't your father's Halloween.Tonally, the most important change is probably the discarding of suspense in favor of gore--no big surprise to anybody who's seen House of 1000 Corpses. In the original, the death sequences were fairly short and simple. More important was the anxiety: Carpenter builds, and builds, and builds, and as soon as you begin to suspect nothing is actually going to happen, The Shape lunges out of nowhere and discards the victims efficiently. Here, though, we almost never lose sight of Michael. The murder scenes are exhausting, as if Zombie was trying to top the opening of Suspiria with every kill. Characters are stabbed, beaten, dragged, strangled, drowned, and tossed down staircases. The camera lingers disturbingly on their terrified eyes as the life passes out of them, or follows them as they crawl, whimpering and broken, toward an exit we know they will never reach. It feels much too real to be fun anymore.Storywise, it's no secret that major changes have been made to the character of Michael Myers. Little Mikey's childhood has been expanded to what feels like half the film, and Zombie leaves no dysfunctional family cliché unexplored. His mother is a stripper, which gives ammunition to the bullies at school; his sister is a scantily clad harlot who makes no attempt to hide her loathing for Michael; his mother's boyfriend is an abusive alcoholic leech. Michael tortures small animals and hides behind masks which, he claims, ""help my ugliness."" In spite of the fact that anyone who took a psychology class in high school could figure out that Mike is a textbook case of a brewing antisocial personality, the world is still shocked when he up and butchers his family one Halloween night. All this back story might be well and good for another film, but for Halloween, it destroys the myth. Michael Myers is scary precisely because we don't know what motivates him; all we, and the characters, know is that somewhere, somehow, something went terribly wrong. By reducing this force of nature (or perhaps supernature) to a Jeffrey Dahmer prototype, the character becomes too sympathetic, too human. Ironically, my only real praise of the handling of the mythos is that adult Myers' face is never completely revealed; I cringe at the moment Laurie pulls his mask off in the first movie because it affirms that he does, after all, look like one of us.The cast reads like a who's who of horror and cult films. Danielle Harris, Sig Haig, Malcolm McDowell, Sheri Moon, Brad Dourif, Udo Kier, Danny Trejo, Clint Howard, and probably a few I missed. It's definitely bizarre to see high schoolers played by (gasp) teenagers rather than 30-year-olds pretending to be teenagers. An interesting point is that the dialogue between the younger characters is incredibly realistic; it almost sounds like somebody went out and recorded conversations at the local high school. If you've ever overheard a group of teenagers conversing, though, you'll know this isn't really a good thing. The reason nobody in films talk realistically is because real dialogue, to an outsider, is boring at best, supremely annoying at worst, and where teenagers are involved this is especially true. The effect of all the shallow cuss words, non-sequiturs, immature insults, dumb jokes, and bad sexual innuendo is, shall we say, less than endearing; almost every time one of Laurie's friends opened his or her mouth, I immediately felt the urge to pop them in the face. At the extreme opposite of the spectrum is Dr. Loomis, whose every word is drenched in melodrama. This wasn't nearly as irritating, since I took it as camp value. Also, with that voice of his, Malcolm McDowell can make pretty much anything sound good.So why six out of ten stars? Well, once you lighten up and learn not to associate this with the original masterpiece (you should be used to it by now, as you've had to do the same thing for six or seven sequels), and try not to hold it accountable for its lack of originality, it's a pretty enjoyable movie. Zombie's ultra-tight compositions keep us wondering what's lurking just outside the frame, so we're never quite sure when to expect a ""boo"" scare. The deaths are just unpredictable enough to keep us wondering who will survive (and what will be left of them) until the very end. Scout Taylor-Compton is adequate as the virginal Final Girl, even if she does obediently adhere to every rule in the book in the final showdown (never make full use of available weapons, always assume the villain is dead, run up the stairs instead of out the door...you've heard them all in the Scream trilogy). Michael's tremendous strength and general invincibility is more believable than it really should be. There's enough deviation from the original to keep us guessing what will happen next. And, of course, we get to see almost every hot chick strip down, which, let's face it, is really a key element of slasher films.",Halloween

288,cpbadgeman,Top-class remake of a classic,8,3 September 2007,"Rob Zombie movies are a crap-shoot. His first effort, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was dreadful. ""The Devil's Rejects"" was an affectionate homage to exploitation cinema that easily trumped his debut but didn't live up to it's potential. Now we have his much-hyped remake of one of the horror genre's true touchstones.What Zombie delivers is a compelling, exhilarating scare-machine that faithfully adheres to the plot premise of the original while simultaneously turning it inside out. Once again, murderous psychopath Michael Myers is institutionalized as a child only to escape many years later and stalk three teenage girls babysitting on Halloween night. However, this film is really more of a re-imagining than a remake. Much more of it takes place during Myers' childhood and, though there are some extremely tense moments, there is a much greater emphasis on action rather than suspense. This is the ninth installment in the ""Halloween"" franchise and it is a sizable tribute to Zombie's skill that he manages to imbue a genuine freshness to the material.In conclusion, this is a very different spin on John Carpenter's original that manages to be both audacious and familiar at the same time. Not only is this film worth the price of admission, it would be one hell of a deal at twice the price.",Halloween
289,furiousneon,"Zombie's Halloween is gruesomely in your face, whether you want it to be or not.",10,1 September 2007,"I have been a die hard Halloween fan since I first saw the original when I was 7 years old. I'm 19 now, I own all 8 films on DVD, numerous masks and collectors items. When I first heard that Rob Zombie would be doing a ""re-imagining"" of Carpenters original, I was, well, scared a little. I could deal with a sequel being bad, but going back and tampering with what made Michael Myers such a horror icon is pretty risky. After viewing the 11:00 show last night with a sold out crowd, I can tell you that Zombie sure did tamper with the movie. Hell, he gave it over a half-hour of insight into why Michael's childhood caused him to become a masked killer. In my opinion, it paid off. What made the original so great was the mystery of Michael Myers, you really had no idea why he did what he did and that made it creepier. What sets the tone of Zombie's version is how in your face the details of this kid are, its to the point where you are forced to feel creeped out, as if someone tied you down to the chair. After the insight and the institution days (which in my opinion, brilliantly tie some knots that Halloween fans should be pleased with) the movie cuts right to the chase, having an aura of the original and a fresh new feel at the same time. I do not want to give away any deaths (although I will say they are GRUESOME and mostly terrifying), big details or the ending, which some idiotic IMDb users do, but I can tell you that the twists in this film, especially towards the end will totally catch you off guard. As for the style of the film, I personally like Zombie's directing style, I think its unique and very much his and I was happy that he wasn't trying to copy Carpenter like so many other past directors have tried to with the Halloween Sequels. The casting was for the most part top notch. Expect to see some heavy hitters in the genre in little bit parts through out the film. To wrap this up, I was very pleased. The film screams at you, its right in your face whether you want it to be or not. If you can let your guard down and stop being so defensive of the original, you should enjoy yourself as much as I did. If you cant, a couple of months from now when your at blockbuster and these two films are side to side, you pick the one you prefer. Ill be picking both.",Halloween
290,stewiefan201,Rob Zombie's Halloween is a misfire on an epic scale.,1,23 January 2008,"Rob Zombie's remake of the cult classic Halloween revives the legendary slasher Michael Myers. Except this time there is a backstory to his motives. Michael Myers is brought up in a white trash family raised by his pole dancing mother (Sheri Moon Zombie), abusive and mean-spirited stepfather Ronnie(William Forsythe), and his also mean-spirited sister Judith (Hanna Hall). The only member of his family that he loves is his little baby sister that he calls Boo, who grows up to be Laurie Strode. Soon it is found out that he has been killing and photographing dead animals. But on Halloween night 1978 he kills his stepfather, Judith's boyfriend, and Judith. He is placed in a mental institution under the close observation of Dr. Loomis (Malcolm Mcdowell). After a while in the institution he cracks and never speaks another word. 15 years later Michael is over 6 feet tall and hulkingly muscular. While being transported during Halloween he viciously murders a few guards, and escapes from the mental institution. Dr. Loomis follows his path knowing that Michael is headed for his hometown Haddonfield where his baby sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor Compton) lives. Dr. Loomis must now stop Michael before he kills again, which may be too late.John Carpenter's Halloween is a classic horror film that is to this day truly very frightening. Rob Zombie's Halloween remake is the complete opposite of the original. There is not one moment in this atrocious film that is scary, interesting, or well written. The Halloween remake is filled to the brim with clichés, one dimensional characters, needless blood and gore, and also what may very well be the final nail in Michael Myer's long deserved coffin.How did Rob Zombie believe he could service the original film? The Halloween series does not need a remake because it is an insult to the original film. Kids today will only remember this mindless trashbag of a movie. One thing I don't understand with modern horror films is why the filmmakers think that seeing lots of blood and guts equals scares. Horror films need tension and suspense, and also characters that you don't want to see die, those are a few good ways to divy up scares. What this idiotic film has are a few white trash characters that only get developed as mean and cruel, and then they die a horrible death. The actual normal characters who were the biggest part of the original film, are not written well or developed enough to the point that we actually care for them or even remember their name. The reason for this problem is actually quite simply resolved. It is because Rob Zombie can only write creatively about white trash or cruel psychopaths, and even here he cannot do that well. It's a shame that Michael Myers doesn't talk, maybe Zombie could have written some philosophical dialogue for his character.Most of the acting in this film is shoddy or just downright terrible, and the actors who are decent can't save the movie. Malcolm Mcdowell gives it his all but at times sounds like he's in pain from delivering his crumby lines. Scout Taylor Compton was not right for the role of Laurie Strode, although she does seem to show a promising acting future. The other two girls who play her friends, Danielle Harris and Kristina Klebe, are utterly annoying and make you want to hit the fast forward button. The best acting in this movie comes from William Forsythe and Brad Dourif. Forsythe plays the abusive Ronnie and looks like he's having fun playing his nasty white trash character. Brad Dourif plays Sheriff Brackett with enthusiasm but does not have enough screen time unfortunately. Rob Zombie seems to believe that he could save his awful product by providing a cast of horror movie legends. This includes Brad Dourif (Child's Play), Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man), Dee Wallace Stone (Cujo, The Howling), Adrienne Barbeau (Creepshow), Malcolm Mcdowell (A Clockwork Orange), and of Course Danielle Harris (Halloween 4 and 5).Michael Myers' backstory is clichéd and will be very unfulfilling to horror fans. As far as I'm concerned Michael went crazy because his stepfather was mean to him, he liked killing animals, kids teased and rejected him, and worst of all his sister Judith wouldn't take him trick-or-treating. The fact that he kills 4 people on Halloween instead of just Judith, was used only to raise the body count and the food sitting in your stomach. However the biggest issue involving Michael's story is that Zombie realized that he wasted so much time on the backstory, that he almost forgot the actual story they're supposed to be telling. So they cram in the second half randomly as an afterthought, resulting in paper thin character development and weak rushed scares and suspense.So much bad to say, so little time. Rob Zombie's Halloween is a joke of a film, and a true disservice to the original. There is nothing creative, intriguing, or remotely original about the remake. Out of all the Halloween sequels this is by far the worst of them that I've seen. At least the sequels had fun with the plot and never really made a joke out of the title character Michael Myers. The remake takes itself so seriously that it ruins everything. I give Rob Zombie's Halloween remake a zero out of 4. Instead of it being a real movie, I wish it had been one of those fake trailers in GrindHouse.",Halloween
291,medic249a2,Really its own movie more than a remake,7,25 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's remake of Carpenter's 1978 classic 'Halloween' has screen writing that you might expect from Rob Zombie, but the way the story of Michael Myers is told in this one is considerably different from John Carpenter's.It begins with a 10-year-old Michael Myers, growing up in a home with a stepfather who is at best neglectful & possibly abusive, a mother who works as a stripper, and a sister who despises him. Young Michael develops psychopathic tendencies early on, torturing smaller animals & photographing them. He gets into a fight at school with 2 young toughs, and the hideous photos as well as a cat corpse are discovered in Michael's schoolbag. Dr. Samuel Loomis is called in to assess Michael, who leaves the school before he can be seen.Here the differences in Zombie's & Carpenter's versions become clearer. Michael's first homicide is not his sister in this version but rather the lead bully, whom Michael beats to death with a tree limb. On Halloween night, it is not just Judith Myers who meets a terrible end, but also Michael's neglectful stepfather and Judith's boyfriend.Michael is incarcerated at Smith's Grove sanitarium, and while his mother is visiting he brutally murders a nurse. Realizing her whole family is virtually gone & Michael is beyond help, his mother kills herself with a revolver, leaving her infant daughter - Laurie Strode - behind.Fast-forward to 15 years later, when Michael savagely murders several people in his escape from Smith's Grove. The homicides are incredibly violent & brutal, more or less what you expect from Rob Zombie. Now, 3 teen aged schoolgirls - including Danielle Harris of Halloween 4 & 5 - become potential targets of Michael's homicidal rampage. Some of the scenes are almost identical to Carpenter's (Bob's impaling on a door) while others never appeared in Carpenter's version (the murders of the Strodes & Dr. Loomis).Basically it's what one might expect from Rob Zombie although it tries to be a little more cerebral in telling the story of how Michael Myers became a walking machine of destruction & misery. Like the character of Leatherface in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films, this one shows that you can make a child into a monster. Knowing that Halloween fans would react badly to a word-for-word-type remake of Carpenter's classic, Zombie has essentially tried to make this one its own movie, in a way comparable to Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead.",Halloween
292,ashwetherall1,A worthy remake of the Carpenter Classic.,8,31 August 2007,"I just saw Halloween 2007 and to be honest I think that Rob Zombie on the whole has done a terrific job. As we all know you would have to be really stupid to try and make a by the numbers remake of the John Carpenter 1978 classic. Rob Zombies film works mainly because for the first 50 minutes it comes at the subject matter from a different angle. Rob zombies Michael is much more complex than John carpenters original creation. Halloween 2007 shows how Michael Myers was made.Michael Myers doesn't start the movie as a mindless killing machine. He starts out the way most serial killers do, as an abused child from a poor background. He is bullied at school, verbally abused by his by his step father and to some degree his sister. Only his mother shows him any kind of affection. Of coarse we all know where all this is heading and when Michael dose snap it is all the more chilling. The second half of the movie doesn't quite live up to the first 45 minutes. Don't get me wrong its good, but its a retread of most of the original movie last 45 odd minutes.Which is a bit of a shame as it started so strongly.Unlike the original, Halloween 2007 is very blood thirsty. The violence is realistic but never over the top or sensational. All the cast give good performances especially Malcolm Mcdowell as Dr Loomis who never try's to copy Donald Pleasence's original and Daeg Faerch as the young and very complex Michael is a natural actor who I'm sure we will here a lot more of in the future. Halloween 2007 is a worthy remake. Its not as good as the original but at least for the first 50 minutes it is original.",Halloween
293,scrapmetal7,Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is outstanding!,9,2 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's new Halloween film is excellent. It is the best of the recent spate of horror remakes. It is a worthy entry in the HALLOWEEN series, and can and should be the series' capstone. It is good enough to stand by itself without the rest of the franchise, and lives up to Carpenter's original and then some.Rob Zombie is one of the most exciting new directors to hit the scene since Wes Anderson. His movies are a moviegoer's dream, provided said goer has a high capacity for unpleasantness. No one can do unpleasantness quite as well as Zombie. The abusive household he brings to life in HALLOWEEN is in its own way as painful to watch as the controversial motel hostage scenes from DEVIL'S REJECTS. His films are also an actor's dream, giving many highly talented character actors a chance to shine and be recognized. His films make great use of musical scoring and cinematography to produce unique effects that I estimate will be imitated for some years to come.His new vision of HALLOWEEN and Michael Myers is stunning and terribly disturbing. In a way this is a remake, but the term ""remake"" hardly does it justice. Zombie successfully delves into places the original did not, mining the concept for more story, more psychological horror, and more emotional impact than we've seen. By expanding greatly upon Myers' childhood, Zombie adds so much to the character while being more true and faithful to the original concept than any of the sequels. This film was advance-marketed as a ""re-imagining"", a doubtful term on the surface, but one that proves quite accurate.This film is also genuinely scary, due in large part to the realistic depiction of childhood psychosis, performed so well by relatively new face Daeg Faerch as Michael Myers. We meet this child trapped in an abusive household, alone against bullies at home and at school; still wanting to experience the joys of childhood despite his surroundings, yet driven to act out his violent, homicidal urges. Indeed, he is at the end of his slide into homicidal behavior, and ready to explode. Malcolm MacDowall, as Doctor Loomis, is well intentioned but too self-involved and too late to help. Michael escalates into psychosis before his and our very eyes, and we are all powerless to help.This first half of the film that focuses on Michael as a child is disturbing and compelling. It is here that the movie works best, all of this being fascinating new ground, vividly brought to horrid life. At the end of it, I had dropped every preconceived idea I'd had about Michael from the previous films. The second half progresses more as expected, more along the lines of a remake or an updating. Michael escapes his institution and returns to Haddonfield (which looks just like we remember it!) on Halloween, and begins to stalk Laurie Strode. Here the audience can settle in and either relive the original, or witness the events for the first time. This half is of course highly suspenseful, with many violent shocks and deaths. Tyler Mane, who had a brief appearance in DEVIL'S REJECTS, is superb in the difficult role of Michael as an adult, having to rely on body language to convey Michael's menacing rage and despair. His visual as Michael is perfect, and the mask looks great!The cast of this film is outstanding. Almost the entire cast of DEVIL'S REJECTS appears in too-brief cameos throughout, and of course they are all welcome sights. MacDowall is great as Doctor Loomis. William Forsythe is revolting as Michael's stepfather. Sheri Moon is heartbreaking as Michael's overwhelmed mother. In one scene, set to Nazareth's ""Love Hurts"", Michael's mother performs at her job as an erotic dancer while Michael sits alone on his front stoop, thinking about her, and despondent that he didn't get to go trick-or-treating. Zombie does not shy away from the humanity of his characters. He might then slaughter them, or twist them horribly, but he sees their humanity and brings it to life on the screen. This is the essence of what makes him a great director, and why his horror films are great films.My opinion is that the film's one weak spot is Scout Taylor-Compton's wack-a-doo performance as Laurie Strode. Taylor-Compton's Laurie is all jacked up on Mountain Dew, the morning person from hell. She is shrill and whiny and obnoxious. In all of her introductory scenes, that all take place before she is aware of the danger and is just going about her normal day, she is almost frantically perky, excruciatingly so. She cannot go ten seconds without either mocking someone else's voice, or teasing her parents, or giggling, or snuggling up against her friends while walking down the street, or crying ""AWWW, C'MON!!! AW, GUYS!!!"" in a wounded voice. I am not sure if this is the effect they wanted, or if she is just overacting. It is not that she is unrealistic; everyone knows some loudmouth that they can't stand to have around because they are always ON. The problem is that her screen time is so annoying, and her Laurie is not really likable. She starts off intensely happy, already at the level of intensity she will have to be at when she is intensely terrified. This is notable, given the role. Jamie Lee Curtis became an icon the very first time she played Laurie, capturing the attentions and imaginations of audiences everywhere with her unusual look and the shy, gentle nature of the character. Taylor-Compton plays Laurie as a great big spazz. Even so, this is a fine, disturbing horror film, one that should leave you talking about it for days. Congratulations to Rob, Daeg, and all involved!",Halloween
294,Staymetal8390,Not as bad as people are saying.,9,2 September 2007,"I honestly don't know why people are bashing this, because it's not the original, well IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL! It'e meant to be different than the original, otherwise, there's no horror and it's no fun.This movie focuses more on how Michael became so psychotic and demented, and it's a lot more brutal than the others....not to mention teen sex and nudity. The only flaw in the movie, was that you don't totally know why he comes back for Laurie.Rob Zombie is good with this genre, he knows what will get scares, but in a lot of ways he's only favored by certain people. He likes using his wife, and showing her off, as he did in ""House of 1000 Corpses."" Some scenes were quite emotional, but brutal at the same time.I'm not gonna recommend this to people who aren't crazy about Rob Zombie, or those who think this is going to be exactly the original. It was quite a cool experience.",Halloween
295,blackberrybabe,"Not the classic, but still good",7,1 September 2007,"Michael Myers. The legend. How do you remake it? Rob Zombie has taken the legend & given him a history, & it isn't all bad. Zombie shows Michael's horrible childhood & therefore explains why he became a killer. Personally, I liked Carpenter's version better: where Michael lives a decent life but just snaps one night & kills his sister. Zombie basically makes Michael sympathetic; even though what he's doing is wrong, you still sympathize w/him. I also thought there should have been more of the cat-&-mouse like in Carpenter's version. Zombie has Michael follow Laurie twice, & that's it, while Carpenter has him hiding behind bushes & following her in the car. That's scarier. I do like how Michael didn't want to kill Laurie...until she made him mad in Zombie's version. And the new take on the mask was great as well. I miss Loomis' classic line 'What was behind those eyes was simply & purely evil.' This version refers to a psychopath (no argument there), but that line delivers chills down my spine every time I hear it.Malcolm McDowell has some huge shoes to fill & doesn't. I don't think anyone can top Donald Pleasance as Loomis; he is a legend as well. But McDowell does hold his own (doing a great job nonetheless) & I hated when he sacrifices himself. It was great to see all of the horror movie actors that Zombie recruited for this film, especially Danielle Harris. It's ironic to see her go from Michael's niece to Annie, whom I think lives. She has come a long way.And I waited during the entire movie for the dedication to Moustapha Akkad. It's there, as it should be, a few minutes into the credits. Stick around to see it.Bottom line, this is a good movie to have in your collection. I would recommend watching the original first & then this version. But Zombie has taken the legend to a whole new level.",Halloween
296,Here_2_Review,I regret spending money to rent this,4,18 February 2019,"This movie is a bit aggravating.... What was Rob Zombie's goal for this remake? It went nowhere... This movie even has Michael RUNNING in a couple of scenes... MICHAEL SHOULD NEVER RUN!!! That is partially the point of Michael being a nearly unkillable entity.... He ALWAYS (Laurie Strode is an exception) catches his running prey even while walking.... This movie has that same stupid teenager cliche, where the teenagers are always over the top, embarrassing, and super cheesy, always wanting to have sex and yadda yadda yadda. Since this is supposed to be remake, why not try a different route with teenagers, like make them normal....? Loomis was pretty decent in this and his actor was pretty good (I forget his name). Michael's backstory was pretty decent, and Michael himself was good (except the running), and Loomis was okay, but everything else just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.. I didn't even like Laurie Strode in this. Her actress and the character were really....annoying and over the top. Jamie Lee Curtis' take hits the spot. She's really quiet and down to earth and is just awesome! This version is just bad.... Nope. I give this movie a 4.5/10..... I wish I did not spend 3 bucks on Amazon, but I was really curious....",Halloween
297,MikeC19,Halloween: A Review,7,14 October 2007,"It's a hard thing to make a ""version"" of a movie that a lot of people love. I did enjoy this movie, however, I can't say I'd go out and watch it over and over again. I think I know how people felt when they watched the original, back in '79.What I liked: I liked the fact that I knew of several actors in this movie, and yet, I wasn't able to place them until the credits. I also enjoyed the performance of Scout Taylor-Compton. I knew who she was dating back to ""Sleepover"", but she's a terrific actress, who shall be recognized that way in the future, if not already. I also enjoyed the direction of Rob Zombie. Some may like him, some don't, but I honestly see why he's allowed to direct films. He just has a certain style to his movie-making. It's enthralling to me.What I didn't like: I wasn't a fan of the insinuated animal cruelty, but was relieved that none of the violence occurred on screen. And, after all, it is only a movie anyway, so, no worries. I didn't tremendously enjoy the first half of the feature as much as the second half. It's more than obvious that Michael Myers came from a broken home, and it's shown quite candidly.So, basically: Direction was good, characters were engaging, writing was nothing to complain about, and overall experience was good. Could I recommend this film? Sure. Is it something I'll end up buying? Probably not. A good overall, scary experience, though.",Halloween
298,jpasols,One of my favorite horror remakes!,10,23 October 2018,"Everyone has their own opinion on this film. You either love it, like it, or hate it. For me I loved it! I really honestly appreciate what Rob Zombie brought to the legend of Michael Myers. Giving us the first half of the film the whole story of his twisted and highly disturbing childhood. Now for a lot of people, they won't like that because what made the original 1978 film work was it was so mysterious and you had no idea why Michael Myers was doing what he was doing, you didn't know why he was killing innocent teenagers and you don't know what drove him to kill Judith Myers. Okay that worked very well for the original movie but guess what people...THATS ALREADY BEEN DONE!. It's time for Michael Myers to get a movie like this one in his franchise simply because there are people out there who would like an origin story, to attempt to answer all the questions about Michael that we may have. Just because his whole childhood is revealed in this remake does it make him a bit less scary? Yes it does I will agree with that. But just because you know more about him does that mean if he were really coming after YOU you wouldn't be scared or intimidated by him? No, you can't say you wouldn't be afraid because you would. In my opinion no matter what the reason is for someone to go out and slaughter people, I still think its terrifying and it's very real in this world. People everywhere kill with or without a motive. And that's the horror of this film.Aside from all of that I do love the plot, i love the cast and their acting, the Gore scenes were fantastic and Michael Myers himself (in the second half of the movie) looks badass! Definitely an intimidating character no matter what the reason he kills people is.Highly recommend this remake to horror fans in general. I'm a hard core Michael Myers fan but I'm also very open minded to new ideas for the character. So yeah I would say if you love Michael Myers definitely watch it at least once.My rating for Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007) a hard 10 out of 10.",Halloween

300,galahad58,Rob Zombie is America's Worse Movie Maker,1,22 December 2007,"Leave it to Rob Zombie to completely destroy an American classic. Zombie's take on Halloween is a complete waste of time and energy. Every character is poorly portrayed, the script is horribly written and the directing is more frightening than the movie itself. The constant cussing and tossing of the F-bomb gets old--and this is a staple of Rob Zombie movies. The man knows nothing about making a well intelligent script that defines characters and their behaviors. The acting is rock bottom, with his pin-up wife once more playing another trashy woman. There is absolutely nothing worth while in this version of Halloween. I just want to know what Hollywood idiots keep tossing money at Rob Zombie to make another piece of garbage. This DVD should be used as a beverage coaster and not put into your DVD player.",Halloween
301,luke-346,Pointless! Do not try and humanise a great villain!,2,6 December 2007,"Rob Zombies attempt at Halloween is utterly disappointing and quite possibly the worst remake/revisit ever. In a pure unashamed manner Zombie endeavours to conform with recent Hollywood trends, that is of trying to give the chief protagonist a sense of character and understanding through back story (Casino Royale, Batman Begins, Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc), thus in doing so Zombie destroys any notion of ambiguity and mystique that originally surrounded the Michael Myers character. He tries and fails to humanise probably the best horror villain of all time.The film relies far too heavily on horror clichés, which, as any horror fan will note, should be absent from ""slasher flicks"" given Wes Cravens 1996 slasher parody/pastiche, Scream. In being reliant on such clichés the film fails in its ultimate purpose, that being (as with all remakes) the modernisation of a premise, and through such failures audiences will feel frustrated and infuriated by certain characters motivations and choices. Those familiar with Rob Zombies previous works, The Devils Rejects & House of a 1000 Corpses, might draw some sort of gratification from the blood and lust elements of the film but directorially there are very few moments that leap out, at a push the swimming pool scene at the end is well lit and filmed but given its accumulation it is not really that noticeable.The film was poorly written relying, again, too heavily on profanities and cursing to add to its ""shock value"", this is also evident in the unnecessary usage of young naked females, in which no attempt is made to disguise the fact they are purely present for male audience titillation. The only real redeeming quality of the film is Malcolm McDowell's performance as Dr Loomis, although in reality its incomparable to Donald Pleasance's original offering it does however manage to enlighten Myers back story ever so little. Overall the film was pointless as was my experience of it!",Halloween

However how Michael myers escapes from the mental home really isn't strong enough and made me quite annoyed. If you watch it you'll see, it just didn't fit in with the rest of the story so far and the film lost its credibility a little.Then when the teen characters of Laurie was introduced, it didn't quite fit in how Myers found her, there were some definite mistakes there. Also the teenagers in general were irritating beyond belief so take it with a pinch of salt.GOOD POINTS - by the end of the film at the big crescendo it is extremely tense and you really will be on the edge of your seat!! Overall, this is a really good films with fairly any faults however when the filmmakers did muck up they did it big style so try to ignore the bit where Myers escapes and when the teenagers are constantly having sex.",Halloween

306,DonSwanson,Not Even Remotely Scary,4,5 September 2007,"I'm an indie filmmaker, and Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is one of my pillars of the film-making faith. I was not at all happy when I heard there was going to be a remake.Zombie's ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" was kind of decent, and I loved ""The Devil's Rejects,"" so I was looking for a remake that butchered the original but was at least interesting to watch, which is more or less what I got.In RZ fashion, it was intense at times, and beneath the un-needed profanity, blood, and nudity there was a captivating story, but there was ZERO SUSPENSE, and ABSOLUTELY NO REAL SCARES. As soon as the movie ended I told my friends, ""This should've been called 'Michael Myers,' not 'Halloween.' Up until Halloween night of 1995 (or whenever the present was) it was an interesting and intense story, then it fell apart. Halloween night came way too fast, and there was not nearly enough time to get to know the girls (especially Laurie), and no real reason to care about them. I actually thought as I was watching it, ""Wow, it's night already, how'd that happen?"" Michael stalking Laurie while waiting for night to fall was sorely missed, and the lack of it took away the suspense that made the night terrifying... which is why this movie was not at all scary.So, my $0.02, it should've been called ""Michael Myers,"" not ""Halloween."" It was interesting until Lynda and Bob all of a sudden are at the Myer's house. Had there been more building to the end (Halloween night) it may have been more effective, but as it was it seemed unconnected and rushed, like RZ said, ""I got this great back story on Michael Myers... oh, crap, I gotta remake the original film... here..."" And, of course, it wasn't the least bit scary. It was intense, Judith's death was a little hard to watch, but there's a HUGE GAPING DIFFERENCE between something being scary due to suspense and something making you feel uncomfortable because it is intense, RZ didn't even come close to accomplishing the former.Definitely not Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" not a bad movie, not a scary movie, but overall an interesting movie... hopefully RZ drops some cut scenes to better tie the end into the rest of the film when it comes out on DVD.I can't give it more than 5-stars because of how I feel about remakes, so on a remake scale of 1-5 I give it a 4, had the ending better fit into what came before it I would give it a 5... had it been remotely scary I'd break my own rule and add on another star.Every story is worth telling, it's just how you tell it - Me.

The family does not have the necessary harmony.
Logic and rationality require us not to imagine these two couples in each other.
Even with three children, they do not have harmony together.
The film has a slight mention in the early sequences of the psychological state of the family, and it shows that as a result of the psychological conditions of each individual in the family, it results that a particular fantastic psychological pattern arises.
In the first and second section, everything is close to reality, and it promises a real story, but in the third curtain, and when Michael escapes from prison, everything goes exaggerated and out of nature.
That the audience remains drowned in questionless questions before drowning in the inflammatory atmosphere of successive murders.
How easy Michael ran away, how easy to kill, how fast he would go, how he would look for his sister, how much srrong and not die, and ...
The whole can not be a very good score because it was the source of the question rather than the source of the effect.

Why Zombie?,6,3 September 2007,"This film would be average if it was a stand alone, but by hacking into a classic it shows a blatant disregard for what John Carpenter envisioned. I do not understand the psychology of Zombie who felt it necessary to neatly and tidily explain away Michael's evil. The beauty of the original was that those of us who had nice homes could harbor an innocent enough quiet child who one day snaps for no apparent reason. Instead we get an eminem 8 mile Dysfunctional family and a Kiss Rock and Roll fan Momma's Boy turned serial killer. Zombie then wants it both ways, super explaining and justifying earlier actions and later moving to a cold blooded killer who goes after those who seek to help him and then gong back again to caring about family, thus as confusing and inconsistent as I've just described. This movie ignores the fact that in the original, we saw older, seemingly stable parent get out of the car in the opening scene. This is ignored and an unstable family i inserted.",Halloween

I mean, it was nothing brilliant by any stretch of the imagination, but if the movie had continued along this path, it might have been at least tolerable. But the movie starts slipping drastically into extremely-sucky territory once the kid stops talking and grows up.We also enter cliché land just as quickly. I think the most clichéd moment was when Meyers went back to his old house to retrieve the mask the audience recognizes as synonymous with the character.Then we had the annoyance of watching a bunch of teens die while having sex. And I'm talking every teenager who has sex in this movie dies within the next five minutes. Tops.The ending got me the most. I don't want to give away what happens, so I'll just say that Meyers should have died, but turns out he didn't and started a chase scene that continued for the next twenty minutes. I wish I was making that up. A twenty minute chase scene.Of course, he doesn't kill the final girl. Yes, they even include the final girl into the list of clichés. I'd worry about giving that away, but I don't think anyone would be surprised.This movie was terrible. Absolutely terrible. As soon as I see the original, I will review that.

This isn't the original. It's a remake. And it's pretty stellar. Zombie creates an unsettling and gritty remake of Halloween with this REMAKE. It respects the original and it's cry baby fan-base and gives us an origin story to boot. It's solid as can be for what it is. This isn't reinventing the wheel folks. There was nothing particularly ""genius"" about the characters or their mythology in the first place. Carpenter, all respect due, created one of the greatest slasher films ever..but he also created one of horror movies creepiest soundtracks and slasher masks as well. Zombie was payed a butt load of money to reboot it. That he did, it works, fans cried like little babies, ticked him off so he dumped a hot steaming pile of metaphysical garbage on us with the sequel. Serves you right. Watch this one, skip the sequel and remember...you've seen it before so it won't blow your mind. This movie will be respected in years to come and folks will have it on their dumb under-appreciated lists once it's ""cool"" to like it again. Right now it's uncool to like it. Be a rebel and give them the bird.",Halloween
311,eternalsea,Just caught an advance screening and it's not bad,5,26 August 2007,"Just saw an advance screening of Rob Zombie's Halloween and I must say, it's actually pretty good. Now most people will recognize that this picture will never level with Carpenter's classic, but Zombie slots in lots of extra blood and some pretty scary sequences none the less. This picture looks a lot more at Myers back story which doesn't detract much from the film, but adds little extra. I found it to be an admirable idea, but sadly one that only slows the film down and actually makes the killer a lot less scary. The visual aspect of the film is strong, creepy visuals are present in strong numbers, but personally I wasn't as hooked by this aspect of the film as I was by last years The Omen remake. The performances are pretty good, most of the teens aren't top annoying and several people are developed in such a way that the audience cares about them over time. A decent horror movie but in summary if you've seen the original you've seen the better version.",Halloween
312,dmc102,"Void of skill, entertainment, scares and class.",1,31 August 2007,"Metal mogul-turned-director Rob Zombie hits out at the slasher genre with this ludicrous and ill-advised remake of John Carpenter's genre defining work. Along the way, Zombie takes the audience on a journey of how to make an inept horror film. Its a useful exercise.The concept of remaking Halloween would seem simple to most fans. Update the simple storyline with modern actors, somehow incorporate modern technology and stick to the original script as much as possible. Zombie takes a refreshing new path; throw out the original script, tack on a lengthy and dull prison-based first half, remove any genuine scares and replace them with over-the-top gore and explain Michael Myers' psyche with a pointless opening sequence full of comedy stereotypical characters.As a director, Zombie shows little understanding of the genre. His style is akin to a thirteen year old who has just been permitted to watch his first R rated film. Overuse of gore does not compensate for genuine horror - as the original Halloween so perfectly demonstrated. In fact, if one thing was strikingly obvious about remaking Halloween, it would be this; what is not seen is more frightening than what is.The acting from all concerned is of a poor standard. Other than the embarrassed-looking Malcolm McDowell, the performances in this film are extremely poor. Even McDowell is no substitute of Donald Pleasance, but he is at least watchable. Child player Daeg Faerch is weak as a young Myers, and Scout Taylor-Compton captures nothing of Jamie Lee-Curtis' vulnerable Laurie Strode.Rob Zombie's Halloween is filled with poorly-conceived plot developments. For example, why would Judith Myers keep a William Shatner Halloween mask underneath her bed? Pointing out these hopelessly coincidental moments is perhaps the only enjoyable thing about watching this film.Overall, Rob Zombie's Halloween is exactly what most fans of the original film expected it would be. The story has entirely lost its novelty, the film lacks any genuine scares as Zombie goes for gross-out gore and ghost train style jumps. Combined with uninspired acting, dull cinematography, a painfully lacking screenplay, a boring re-hash of John Carpenter's musical score and a tedious opening half make this film literally unredeemable. Frankly, it is just rubbish.",Halloween
313,ashecatlin,Added a lot of flavor the original didn't have,9,7 November 2020,"I love this movie, it's one of those remakes that actually bring something to the table. The reinvention of Laurie Strode is phenomenal, in the original she has as much as personality as a wet blanket. From the get go she's fingering bagels in this, which for me was the perfect introduction. She's still that innocent girl but she more bouncy and jokey in this one, she feels like an actual person instead of a cardboard cut out.I think Rob Zombie, developed a lot of things that the original didn't bother with. Like the escape from the asylum, there isn't a bunch of loons loose in this walking around with Michael just jumping on a car and then driving off it in. It's much more grounded where the wardens are being filthy scumbags and due to their incompetence, he escapes.The only thing I don't think this movie does as well as the original is Loomis, Michael Mcdowell does a fantastic job and is captivating to watch. But Loomis looses a bit of tenacity that Donald Pleasence, there is no replacing him though I do love Mcdowells rendition, he comes off as lot more caring when it comes it Michael.What else can I say about this movie? Well it's not perfect, I think a little bit from the beginning and end could have been trimmed. We didn't need so much of Michael's school life, I did like the introduction of Loomis and his family but I don't know it just felt longer than it needed to be. Same with the ending, it kind of has a subtle ending but the there is a chase after, which Michael literally tearing the house apart, where that is interesting. On rewatch it didn't feel as intense and dragged a little bit, I think the worse part is where young Michael is running down the halls and the classic theme plays, it's just so out of place. Aside from the minor gripes I love this movie, it brings a much needed flavor that original didn't have.",Halloween
314,eflemieux,Good creative job,8,1 September 2007,"I'm not gonna make friends here :-) I can't stand Rob Zombie (so i'm not a fan boy expressing my mad love for the man) and I'm not a complete fan of the original series, which i found slowly lapsed into exploitation and ridicule...This movie goes back to the roots of the original version but it updates it to modern realities. The 2008 audience has seen it all - crazy mass murderers, serial killers, people blown to bits by blind bombing - and they saw it on the news! We need something more than gore and craziness to be scared.Zombie reinterpreted the myth and added to it. Myers in the first series was a soulless monster - a robotic killing machine. The new Myers is closer to Ed Gein, as a human being that was driven on the wrong road. He is believable because he is a creation of the real world. I couldn't help but sympathize with him until he (SPOILER!!!) takes out the nurse,,, I could have done without the regular nudity, especially considering that the characters (not the actresses, please) are close to being underage. It made me feel uncomfortable, like watching illegal porn.Sherri Moon can act - wow - and the kid is creepily good. Let's say i'd never babysit him after seeing this movie... McDowell is amazing, he definitely outgrew Caligula ;-) Aesthetically, this movie is artsy, in a trailer park kinda way. It looks like Tarantino on a regular day. For people who find the characters cliché, pleaaaaaase... 90% of action/horror/thriller movie characters are cliché. If i wanted to see character development, i'd rent Six Feet Under...There are major plot holes though... SPOILER: (I repeat, SPOILER!!!!) How does he know who Laurie is? I pray it's not some kind of supernatural crap ""à la Halloween 5-6..."". Also, the number of security staff in the asylum is pretty low, considering the type of place... Finally, how many members in this police department?? Three? And finally, finally, the ambulance people would have called for help after arriving - there couldn't have been the 15 minutes lapse we see in the movie.In conclusion, good job for a third movie.",Halloween
315,jeffronthi,An Honest 7,7,28 December 2007,"This film was much better than I anticipated. Not perfect, but beats the samhain out of every other sequel, as far as quality is concerned.Pros: Just when I thought that it was going to be a bad idea to do away with the ""Samhain"" reasoning for Michael's behavior (for reasons of continuity), Rob did things right with showing and explaining Mike's rapid mental deterioration. The mask's were a nice psychological touch. So, the more realistic explanation, I hope, will remain. Psychopath's are the real monsters; thus, they are scarier. The cinematography was fantastic, as were the action sequences. All evoking real terror. Cons: I do not care if he starred in Caligula. Malcolm should have done more with Sam's eclectic personality. Also, and this is just a directorial quibble: The kid sucked, too. He may be a nice kid, but he was having too much fun with his role and did not come off believable. Too many minutes were wasted with the lens in his face. Gimme more POV, suggestion, whatever, just minimal facial shots. The kid should've had better acting chops. All in all, I feel he did a good job in keeping with the signature suspense of the series. It was far more enjoyable than I thought it'd be. Kudos. Next time, less soundtrack, more score.",Halloween
316,knuckles_and_sonic,Was That The Boogeyman? Yes I Believe It Was,6,19 February 2008,"I don't know who the boogeyman is in this movie. Rob the director, Michael or the audience for having to put up with an inconsistent plot. Lets get one thing straight, I loved Corpses and Rejects but this re invisioning of a classic was lacking in a lot of areas. I really hated the first five minutes or so because of the inappropriate and childish sexual dialouge. After Michael kills his first victim I was hooked and horrified that Michael then proceeded to slaughter his family. That 20 minutes or so was the only scary part of the film due to the brutality of the killings.Then we see Michael grown up and he loses all credibility as a scary character, sure the kills were violent and quite well done for a slasher movie but when we cant even hear Michael breathing properly and no one can see a 7 foot giant walking around with a knife, you have to ask why Zombie even bothered making this.The ending or the last 30 minutes was tense and great fun but overall I just felt cheated and annoyed that the original vision of Michael Myers to be a scary character was butchered (no pun intended). The movie didn't feel cohesive, some dialouge and scenes didn't work at all which was a shame and Im sick of Zombie casting the same people in his movies!!! His wife was good in this but got taken out too early. Lets just hope Zombie decides to do something original in the horror genre next time.Overall a 6.2/10 for the unrated cut. Watch the original as Id give that a 9 and at least that one is scary and tense.",Halloween
317,kyleallen_9,Halloween : A Kick Ass Remake,10,18 February 2009,"If you want to have the living daylights scared out of you, then i recommend that you check this hard core horror flick out! I'd like to say first, that I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie and Sheri Moon Zombie, he brought us House of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects and she played in them. Those two movies rock, so check them out if you haven't already. The Halloween movies are the only scary flicks that scare the hell out of me. This movie showed a fierce and more darker side to Michael Meyers, played by Tyler Mane, who brought the hulking menace to life. I loved the new Laurie Strode, played by Scout Taylor Compton(April Fools Day), she added wit and depth to her character and displayed the true meaning of terror. Awesome Job! I was also excited by Danielle Harris's character, Annie, and Danielle Harris played Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4 and 5, when she was a kid, so I was excited to see that she came back to be a part of the new Halloween. Other great cast members are Malcolm McDowell, as Dr. Sam Loomis, Kristina Klebe as Lynda, Hanna Hall as Judith Myers, William Forsythe as Ronnie, Daeg Faerch as the young Michael Myers, Leslie Easterbrook and horror movie favorite, Bill Moseley, Dee Wallace Stone as Cynthia Strode and Sheri Moon Zombie(The Devil's Rejects and The Toolbox Murderes) as Deborah Myers. Rob zombie and John Carpenter both have their own unique spin on Michael myers, however, Rob Zombie focused on how he grew up and what kind of life he had, as the basis for how he turns out. as for the rest of it, he breaks out and returns to his home town to find his baby sister, now a young teenager, who has no idea about her first families dark past, until Halloween night. Michel Myers in John Carpenters classic, was an evil night stalker and the new Micheal Myers is killing machine. This movie is brutal, sexy and scary as hell, one of the best remakes that i've seen in years, so definitely check this fright-fest out!!",Halloween
318,dgl1199,Oh my sweet lord....,1,7 April 2008,"This is beyond bad, it's offensively bad. Taking a classic horror movie like Halloween, stripping everything that was good and worked well from it, and replacing it with cheap sexiness, horrible dialog, irrational motivations, and stupid plots should be a criminal charge. I never liked Rob Zombie's work. Frankly I NEVER understood this guy's appeal. His scripts sound like they were written by an angry biker with a 9th grade education. Everything is about raunchy language and lots of T and A shots. The constant, endless, use of the F bomb cheapens it. Using foul language is fine, but not like this. The swearing was just annoying because there was no reason anyone should talk like that except if you're going merely for shock value. Malcolm McDowell, a tremendous actor, was way too old for this part. The acting was phoned in, the camera shook too much, no one had motivations for anything they did except to look sexy and sleazy, and the gore was over the top and really just laughable. Screw you Rob Zombie for desecrating a fantastic film franchise with this worthless crap.",Halloween
319,Icedooitle,Zombie influence,5,31 August 2007,"After having seen the original films I can call myself bias. I have high expectations to any sequel, but this film had an opportunity to be great because it is a remake. When a film is remade it isn't limited to the clichés and the less than great plot guidelines that the original film has set. Rob Zombie could have made this film his own and given it some of the true scares I have come to respect in his other films, but this was a wasted attempt at making Micheal Meyers make sense. This film tries to explain his origin, if not justify the killer he becomes, but it fails. The mystery behind his immortality and sinister nature are the backbone of the Halloween franchise. Zombie takes a character as simple as Micheal Meyers, and complicates him far too much. This film focuses too much on the story (Which it doesn't complete in any dimension) and leaves the scares until the last half hour of the film.Rob Zombie needs to learn a few guidelines in horror films. Not every piece of killing needs to be shown. Sometimes letting the audience use their imagination can be an effective scare tactic.",Halloween
320,Nyx_Selene,Taking a step up from the teen slasher genre,7,9 November 2008,"As I'm writing this, I've just sat through every ""Halloween"" movie made, and found that the 1978 original, ""H20"" and Zombie's version are the only ones worth watching. When it comes to comparing the 1978 with the 2007, I won't; I think it's unfair, since the two movies - although based on the same story - categorizes under two different genres.Sure, the 1978 was a tiny bit scary, mostly because of the music, but it was little more than a slasher - something that the sequels proved beyond a doubt. In the original movies Michael Myers is right up there with Jason Vorhees - the silent killer that can't be killed, and this fact, to me, takes all the horror out of it. We already know what he's going to do: He's going to find the biggest knife available and stab people, some girl is going to try out for ""scream queen"" and in the end, he's going to be killed in roughly every manner possible and then get up again. Knife - stab - fake death - repeat.What Rob Zombie has done, is to make Michael Myers human, thus making him more unpredictable, more mysterious and far more scary. The killer is no longer just a puppet with a knife - he's the weird kid next door, that one day took the final step over the edge. I love the fact that in this movie, his purpose for finding his sister isn't to kill her; I like it, that I can wonder how things would have been, if she too hadn't betrayed him when he finally found her.To round things off: Many thanks to Malcolm McDowell for the great portrayal of Sam Loomis, and to Rob Zombie and Tyler Mane, for finally giving Michael Myers more than a butcher knife.",Halloween

There are a lot of great performances by character actors I grew up watching in the movies and on TV. For the DVD, Rob, you MUST have a longer version . . . a true director's cut. I think The Fans and The Producers made you cut the film and second guess yourself in a few areas: Udo Keir says all of two words, Sheriff Leigh Brakett's scenes seem shortened and/or cut altogether. I think after Grindhouse Harvey Weinstein and his brother wanted you to get ""off stage"" as soon as possible. Also try to have a segment ""Directing Halloween"" because you are a brilliant, astute director who knows the genre and have made excellent films in The devil's rejects and Halloween (and have included Kiss God of Thunder; Kiss t-shirts; a Slayer T-shirt; Don't Fear the reaper; and Rush's Tom Sawyer in your scene a masse) Bless you dearly, Rob Zombie . . . you're the best director working today . . .

The only reasons why I couldn't rate it as 'Excellent' is because it wasn't. It was like a completely different story. In the first Halloween, (With Jamie Lee Curtis) that made sense and it was obvious Halloween was going to be live Saw, especially since 2004 and Halloween Directors Cut was up for discussion by the leading producers. Many fans then were happy, as they expected BUT..... (I'm such a fan of the films) this film was different!!!! It had some gory death scenes and big twists. The best death was when he stabbed the woman with a fork, that reminds me.... If the child was a murderer then why leave him with a fairly sharp metal knife and fork??? HUH....??",Halloween

It's a movie that's more origin heavy than the original though I liked that aspect. Zombie does a great job of capturing dismay, abuse, and terror. It's well shot and feels like a doc at times. It doesn't change much of the mythology just gives it more look of why this may have happened. Zombie has a gift for 70's feel and style which fit this adaptation.

326,myrkeyjones,"Sheer Unbridled terror, An amazing expansion of a Classic",9,23 November 2007,"Eye rolls where in abundance at the very though of Rob Zombie in the directing chair, But upon the release of the metal legends directing debut 'House of 1000 Corpses' in 2003 many where thoroughly entertained by the glorious ode to 70's grind house horror. It was incredibly fresh, with a touch of irresistible dark humor. But most impressive where his abilities to balance sheer horror with humor, it was impossible to look away from the screen. Now after a well received 'House' sequel, 'Devils Rejects', Zombie plows into highly sensitive fan turf and re-vamps one of the great horror masterpieces of John Carpenters Reign. The Result...WOW.Halloween 2007 is one sick puppy, bloody, full of obscenities, very foul language. The first half hour is a different approach from the original, it explores Michael, his mind, and his decent into madness in such realistic ways, it really does add to the climax. The human element brought to Myers never wavers in his ability to terrify. The Performances are generally good, the child actor playing Myers is brilliant, and Scout Taylor-Compton performance as Laurie strode was that of genuine blood chilling terror, it was highly convincing. Need i not mention the amazing Malcolm McDowell of Clockwork fame who is having great fun here.I really enjoyed, Halloween 2007. It really expanded upon the mythology and was a genuinely frightening film, with fantastic use of John Carpenters story, and original music score. My advice is to realize Rob Zombies unbridled respect for the genre and material and appreciate his passion unfolding on screen. It really shows, but be warned, the film takes risks which some of weak stomached disposition may waver from.Recommendation: A passionate remake, prepare yourselves for the wrath of Michael.",Halloween
327,nickzbekool,the perfect remake of a perfect film!,8,22 July 2008,"When I first heard of a ""Halloween"" remake I really questioned it. But I was so wrong, it is intense, crazy, horrifying, jaw dropping, and great acting. It really goes into the childhood of Michael Myers showing his harrowing descent into madness. None of the other ""Halloween"" films really goes into the origins of Micahel Myers. This one you see him talk, his extremely dysfunctional family life, and how he tortures and kills animals as a child. Which then leads him to let all his rage out on everyone who he hates, so he viciously kills them all. The murder scenes are very intense and graphic compared to the original's suggestiveness. But it does not harm the film, it is a great shock factor. A true Rob Zombie fan is used to graphic and bloody violence. His vision is so shocking and takes absolutely no prisoners! It actually shows Micheal's experiences in the mental institution with DR.Loomis(brilliantly played by Macolm Macdowell). It makes Micheal Myers character in a in- depth way that has never been seen before. Not just as a soulless killing machine but as a person who becomes an unstoppable killer content on killing everyone in his life. the shocking and suspenseful chase to get Laurie Strode( Micheal's little sister who was adopted by a well-to-do suburb family.) Micheal slowly works through Laurie's friends killing each hideously and destructively and he also viciously kills Laurie's foster parents. Then it comes down to just Michael and Laurie which to a shocking and stunning ending that will leave you breathless! a great slasher thrillride! Also a well acted character study. Also look for Rob Zombie's wife's great performance as Micheal's mom.",Halloween
328,Macabro,Rob Zombie is the Master of the Macabre,10,17 December 2007,"It is true what many reviewers on IMDb have posted about the new Halloween film: plot holes, exaggerated language, a confusing 70s, 80s or 90s time line, and so many other negative comments. Despite all these negative vibe, the new Halloween by Rob Zombie still delivers and it sets a standard in modern horror today.The first half of the film focuses on the early years of Michael Myers and in my opinion, this is the best part of the film. As Italian screenwriter Bernardino Zapponi (a friend of Dario Argento) once said: ""Children are always scary in horror films."" This works because focusing on Myers' early years and watching his first murder and his metamorphosis into pure evil and full insanity was done masterfully. It adds very much to the story and it causes quite an impact on the audience. The mother and son relationship makes it even more dramatic.Rob Zombie knows how to create very thick atmospheres combining silence, slow motion, a mixture of different noises and colors, flashbacks, close-ups, camera movement... He did it in House of 1000 and he's done it in Halloween.After watching this film, all I could think is that Rob Zombie is way up there with the maestros of terror. He's different than the Italian masters Argento or Fulci... or than American horror icons such as Craven or Romero. But let's admit that Zombie has developed his own style, his own trademark in all of his films. It might be too explicit, crude or exaggerated for many, but still... it is his style and after all, it is horror, the beautiful genre where anything is possible. Rob Zombie is one of the few visionaries that still have respect for the genre... for that, I applaud his ideas and creativity and put him up there with the best directors in horror today.",Halloween

330,jwtrox08706,Michael's Back!!!,8,3 September 2007,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Michael Myers has returned to the forefront of serial killers. Rob Zombie's re-envisioning of the 1978 film, Halloween, is definitely a grand slam. The acting is superb, whether it's Malcolm McDowell playing a more developed Dr. Loomis or whether it's Scout Taylor-Compton bringing Laurie Strode into the 21st century, the performers did a wonderful job in this film. The cinematography is very well done. The camera work (especially on the first human kill Michael performs) is superb. There isn't much on screen violence, but plenty of blood and gore to show the audience exactly how gruesome and brutal Michael's acts of violence really are. Michael is made more villainous and evil in this film, yet in the beginning, we feel sorry for the little boy of 10 who is living in a broken home, with a mother who is an exotic dancer and has a low-life and abusive boyfriend and an older sister who is promiscuous and rather mean to her younger brother. His final Halloween spent outside of a sanitarium is one of disappointment. He is left on the outside looking in on all of the other kids his age having fun trick-or-treating. Finally, he snaps and even after the brutal murders he commits on Halloween night, we still feel a little sorry for him, until he viciously stabs a nurse in Smith's Grove with a fork. From then on, it's a vicious predator waiting to get out. And even towards the end, he's not going after his little sister to kill her, rather to reunite with her. Michael has more substance to him in this film than all of the rest of the Halloweens featuring him combined. He is very much human in this film, but he's very disturbed. The music is very well done, with a lot of references to the original score for the 1978 film but with some modern day twists as well. What more can I say? This is the horror film of 2007, hands down. Michael Myers is back!!!",Halloween

They explain the childhood of Myers and give him a soul and a face. There was no need for that. That gives the monster a soul. So if you know that is only a man, then how come 4 shot of a .357 Magnun doesn't stop him. He is just a guy he is not Jason or Freddy he is just a man and yet after 15 years in a mental asylum he turn out to become one strong guy, unstoppable, bullet proof super human. Also the whole movie especially at the end is freaking dark. You can't hardly see what's going on. There is not suspense in the scenes where Mickael is. You can see him walking day light down the street. In the original movie he only appears and disappear making the whole character way more scary, anyway not a bad flick but definitely not good, if you like the gore and violent, yes, is OK!",Halloween
333,adam_uk09,"Not on par with the original, but a good try nonetheless.",7,9 June 2008,"Michael Myers returns once again in this, the 9th instalment of the Halloween franchise. Rob Zombie is at the helm of this half prequel, half retread of John Carpenters 1978 masterpiece. Daeg Faerch and Tyler Mane star as Myers young and old respectively. It is certainly Zombies best film to date, but that isn't saying much.Where John Carpenter brought us subtle, almost invisible horror elements, Zombie smacks us right in the face with brutal violence. The jump tactic has never been used to such an extent in any horror movie I have seen in recent times. It is most deserving of its 18 certificate.If you have seen the 78 original then you will notice how this is not just a simple remake. Zombie recreates and pours his own vision into what had become a very bland and tired franchise; he has injected a new lease of life into Myers.The first half of the film is a prequel; nothing more, nothing less, showing why Myers became such a sadistic killer and without giving too much away, it is shockingly brutal in such a way that some scenes can become impossible to watch. Despite this, it works; we finally get to see the boy behind the iconic mask and begin to show sympathy for a character we never thought that would be possible for.Daeg Faerch is an excellent choice as young Myers; his sly, almost slimy character makes sure we never forget whom he truly is. His acting is also excellent, in comparison to some other young actors of the year; he is a league ahead.Malcolm McDowell is the perfect choice for Dr. Sam Loomis; he plays his character with a finesse that would make the late Donald Pleasance exceptionally proud. He however, does not play Loomis as a gentle and subtle character, as with the rest of the film, he is an in your face, loud and potentially obnoxious character who's real comfort is not the plight of his patients, but the money.It's all going pretty well for Zombie right up until Myers becomes the character we all know and 'love'. The second half of the film lacks the imagination and ultimately the scares of the original, there are one or two jumps here and there and the violence doesn't cease to come fast and thick, but gore does not create a scary film.His mask on the other hand, works wonderfully with the sheer size of Tyler Mane as Myers and puts the William Shatner original to shame. This is the mask that will stick in your mind out of the 9 movies that have been made.Unfortunately the good news stops there regarding the second half, the characters we see in this half of the film are direly under-developed and we care more about Michael treading on the neighbours begonias more than the death of one of the lead characters. Example, Scout Taylor-Compton plays the famous Jamie Lee-Curtis role of Laurie Strode but her character doesn't really get to do much apart from scream and talk about sex. Her acting isn't up to par with Curtis.Zombies other movies, forgettable as they may be, were praised for their vast use of 70's music. Halloween is no exception; if you're a huge fan of the decade then this is definitely a treat for your ears, whether or not you like the horror genre. If you're not a fan, then your ears will certainly take a battering.The films plus point is that it never retreats its pace, it is mercilessly fast and efficient, while making sure that all the major details are carried over onto the screen. Whilst being shockingly brutal, noisy and fairly void of soul, this is a definite yes on any Halloween fans shortlist.Zombie deserves credit for the way he has recreated a horror legend in such a way that over 30 years after the originals release, he has managed to resurrect this monster from the Hollywood grave where it has spent the last 20 or so years.One can only hope that if a sequel is necessary, it be better than the ultimately lacklustre effort made by Rick Rosenthal in Halloween 2.",Halloween
334,jdavisjdavis,Nice,9,18 September 2007,"I'm a huge horror fan... huge. But I'm picky. To be honest, the original Halloween was OK for me... but just not a truly scary horror film. Perhaps it was too realistic in a way... or just not enough flash (I hate to admit that). But...This remake is much more to my liking- scarier, more action (at least in my perception), and more character development of the important characters. The beginning was probably the best for me... but the whole thing was really good. The ""Rob Zombie"" elements were fun, if you happened to have seen his other movies. He definitely has a little sick style that fits right into this one. Oh, and it could have only helped that the young Michael looked near enough to be a twin brother of a kid I knew in school! Too freaky.",Halloween

It was just messy and jumbled. The writing wasn't to good either, all the stereotypes were added here: bullies, abusive fathers, slutty girls, gullible cops, etc. This part of the movie was so unoriginal and blatant it was almost laughable. Also the editing was really choppy and sometimes I would be thinking ""what exactly is going on right now"" as the actress howls with the annoying screams that went on for 10 minutes straight. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't the worst movie ever, or the worst remake ever, it just wasn't very good either. It started out pretty good, with the back-story and everything but then it just went straight down from there. I would only go and see it if you are a TRUE Halloween fan and a TRUE ""remake the horror movie"" fan, otherwise, just wait for the DVD",Halloween

337,DexX,"The more I see of Rob Zombie's directing work, the more I appreciate him as a musician",4,2 February 2008,"The Halloween remake is, sadly, rubbish. A substandard film blasted into the depths of awfulness because of comparison to the classic original.Rob Zombie once again demonstrates how, as much as he loves horror, he doesn't understand it and cannot create it. He has no ability at all to build suspense, shock the viewer, or generate fear. On top of that, he also shows that he doesn't understand what made Michael Myers so great. Michael was frightening because what he wasn't. He was from a happy family, he had no history of violence, there was simply no decipherable pathology. Something inside him just broke one day, and he became the true essence of cold inhuman evil. He wasn't insane, he had no ultimate goal, he had no logical reasoning at all that we could detect. He existed to kill, and to kill without either remorse or relish. Michael, the real Michael, never exhibited fury or enjoyment when he killed. He also wasn't a massive giant of a man - in all respects he seemed to be a normal-looking guy.In the remake, Rob Zombie has gone off on completely the wrong track. He gives Michael a totally clichéd backstory, and makes him a perfectly human psychopath. Then, he has made Michael into a giant pro-wrestler looking guy, rather than the mundane evil of the original.Basically, Rob Zombie has taken the dead skin of Carpenter's seminal masterpiece and stuffed it with a stack of uninspired clichés, and in the process has forced out everything that made the original so good. If you love the original, stay well away. If you've never seen the original, see it first. If you prefer the remake, get professional help.",Halloween

The fact that Danny Trejo was in it gives this movie an automatic 2 stars and all the boob scenes give it 2 more. Beyond that it was painful to watch. Forty-two minutes of ground work to explain the evolution of Mikey and then the rest of the movie was just meh. But I said I would watch all the Halloween movies and that's what I'm doing, so the two remakes by Zombie and part of that.

The beginning pulls no punches with the gore and the trash talk but it's really leading up to something unforgivable and that is the humanization of Michael Myers. In the original we had a simple tale of unstoppable evil pursuing American innocence. In this version Michael is the every man serial killer with dubious motives once grown.I respect Zombie for trying to do something different at times but Halloween was famous for it's characters and suspense and jump quotient. This has none of that. Not a single shiver. I can tell that everyone tried but no cigar. Not even close",Halloween
340,thebengalimafia-1,Had potential but it was still disappointing,5,9 September 2007,"What was it exactly that made Michael Myers from John Carpenter's Halloween so creepy? And more importantly, what was it that made Michael the way he was? Rob Zombie's Halloween takes a stab at telling the story about the birth of a cinematic legend but in the end, the film takes away the terror evoked from Michael's image, and the Halloween franchise.The Halloween remake starts off by giving us a glimpse at the life of Michael Myers before he murders his sister. Myers' mother is a stripper who is trying to make ends meet and his step father is a crippled misogynist who ends up being the creepiest person in the film (due to the fact that he is sexually attracted to his step daughter and openly talks about it with her mother). So the film presents a young Michael as being the Ted Bundy type; someone who kills and tortures animals without any regret. A young Dr. Loomis is worried about Michael's behavior and is more concerned about it than his own mother who shrugs it off as a phase. So in the end, the birth of evil ends up being explained as a combination of nature and nurture.Strangely enough, by giving us this origin story that is actually based in reality, we're left feeling sorry for Michael Myers rather than being afraid of him. In the original, Michael was born to what appeared to be an upper middle class family living in the heartland of American suburbia. Now he's out of shape and fat, constantly wears masks because he thinks he's ugly, and out killing animals. So one night he kills his sister and stepfather, and the sister's boyfriend too, leaving his youngest sister alive. The young Michael (played by Daeg Faerch) comes off as lacking character and emotion, but just doesn't seem scary. He still listens to music and gets picked on at school, eventually he even fights back. But this birth of fear story just doesn't do anything to scare the view in anyway. But the second half of the film, to some extent, makes up for the first.As we all know, fifteen years later, the older Michael Myers starts ripping through the teenagers and elderly people of Haddonfield. He's back to finish the job by killing his little sister, Laurie. There's something in this portion film I didn't expect because of the weak first half; it's scary. And not just scary, I mean incredibly disturbing. There are moments like when Annie (played by Danielle Harris from Halloween 4) is dragged across the floor, naked and covered in blood, screaming at the top of her lungs. There are some of those ""Turn around! He's right there!"" type moments that a slasher film isn't complete without. And of course, when the screen goes silent and all seems well, someone manages to get stabbed right through their throat while the sudden shriek of the background score makes your blood curdle. I have to hand it to Rob Zombie because it's moments like these where he really does deliver.All in all, the 2nd half of the film offered some good things, but in the end, Halloween turns the most feared slasher in history into someone the social workers would want to heal and rehabilitate. Final word, wait for the DVD for this one.",Halloween

Here we get to see the making of a serial killing psychopath machine! Outwardly, Michael is unemotional pure unadulterated evil. Inside, a smoldering anger of a young child left to ferment in his hatred of all those who surround him, & mostly, his hatred of himself.A terrifying portrait of what can be wrought on to others by a person whose years of systematic abuse by his family, & by those who ostracize him from society, filled with malicious school bullies, to a psychologist exploiting him for personal monetary gain & fame.

Maybe he should have tried something less ambitious. Like, 'Frogs' perhaps. Actually, this was worse than 'Frogs'. Second, if you don't know how to make a movie, why remake one that was so perfect? An homage? No, a travesty. This film screams of a director that has serious issues with his own ego and masculinity as he tries to create a world full of 'hard' people leading 'troubled' lives but it all comes across like an after school special for troubled kids or a commercial for 'The Church of Latter Day Saints'. The acting and direction is painfully forced. It's like Rob Zombie wants to add to his image of a scary, tough horror-rock icon but knows nothing about it. He was likely a rich kid from a nice suburban neighborhood that grew up with nice parents and learned everything about 'horror' from bad comic books and cheesy heavy metal record covers. The world of Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' is silly, melodramatic, cartoonish and just plain painful to watch. Avoid, at all cost.",Halloween

345,RebelXStar,"The darkest souls are not those which choose to exist within the hell of the abyss, but those which choose to move silently among us",4,30 October 2016,"In the 1978 movie, Michael Myers starts out as an angelic looking blonde haired little boy who stabs his older sister to death for no explainable reason on Halloween night.In the 2007 movie, Michael Myers is a grungy, greasy product of white-trash who tortures animals and stabs his older sister to death on Halloween night because she wanted to have sex with her boyfriend instead of taking him treat or treating.He also kills her boyfriend - presumably because he is the reason she wouldn't take him trick or treating-, and his mother's boyfriend because he's an unemployed deadbeat who bullies him.In fact, the only people who Michael likes, and therefore escapes his rage, in his family are his mother, Deborah, who was working (as a stripper) at the time of the murders, and his baby sister, 'Angel' who is subsequently adopted into another family after Deborah commits suicide due to the stress of having a psychopath for a son.The two remaining siblings grow up leading very different lives; Michael is committed to a life inside a mental institution while Angel is renamed Laurie and grows up in a nice neighbourhood with two loving parents.Several years later, on the night before Halloween, two hospital employees decide to get their kicks by raping a vulnerable young female mental patient inside Michael's cell and it's then that the now adult Michael breaks out of the hospital and makes his way back to his home town of Haddonfield in search of his now teenage sibling, leaving a bloody trail wherever he goes.The rest of the movie is then an almost scene for scene remake of the 1978 movie with Michael tracking down Laurie as she babysits alongside her friends on Halloween night.Some people like to give props to Rob Zombie for trying something different but as someone who is neither very familiar with Zombie's other work, nor a fan of what I have seen, I can't say that excuse sits well with me. It's not that I'm opposed to seeing a different interpretation of the story or even giving Michael a backstory it's just that the 'bad childhood' angle is so dull, predictable and lazy. Seeing an angelic Michael's descent into murder and rage would have been far more compelling.I'm also not a fan of how Zombie has a tendency to create all of the male characters in his own image and the constant (constant!) dropping of f-bombs.With that said, there are a couple of aspects that I do like - for instance the ambiguous time period setting of the first half of the movie; it's vaguely seventies-esque, but never explicitly established which makes for interesting visuals.Malcolm McDowell does a decent job of Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis but doesn't hold a candle to Donald Pleasance.Danielle Harris, who played Laurie's daughter in Halloween IV and V, makes an appearance, this time as Annie, Laurie's sarcastic, snarky best friend from the original movie. I also like how the sibling story arc flows with more ease, though considering this aspect wasn't added until later in the original series, that can be put down to hindsight.",Halloween

So for people who find '70s movies more or less in general to be awkwardly paced and out-of-style, I'd recommend seeing this one as the new reference for ""Halloween"". The original has nothing more to offer except indie-film-flair, from bad acting to bad editing.Some geeks pretend the original had suspense, but having a creep in a mask, who is from the very beginning depicted to be the devil himself, stalk a bunch of young girls is not suspense, it's just dragging out the inevitable killing spree.Other say the horror used to be that one didn't know WHY Myers killed people, what made him tick.

347,atliel,Who Let Rob Zombie Write This?!!!!,3,3 April 2008,"What happens when you give a horror fanatic like Rob Zombie the liberty to do as he wishes on a horror franchise like John Carpenter's ""Halloween""? Unfortunately you get bored to death with one cliché ridden scene after another. What the hell happened? I didn't think his first two films were bad, not great, but not awful either. I figured the major problem here is the same deal you'll get from Tarantino or Rodriguez, they're film enthusiasts. They're better skilled at creating tributes to the films they love than adding any original ideas of their own. That being said the film isn't a complete remake. If you've seen the original ""Halloween"" you'll remember that it starts with Michael breaking out of the asylum. In the new revamp version Zombie, in the first act, gives us a glimpse of what Michael was like as a child and what led him to be locked away in an asylum in the first place. Oddly enough I think the first act (all the scenes that eventually lead into his killing spree) is excellent. I would have rather have seen a film about a child growing up into the killer instead of just a simple explanation for the sake of exposition. Imagine what a riskier and much more controversial film that would have been! And what a way to reawaken the franchise which was originally hit or miss anyhow. Regardless, once Michael escapes the asylum we are treated to simple slasher film clichés with no rhyme or reason for half the killings. Were any of these people in his way in the first place? How does he know to find his sister? Basically he just goes on a killing spree for the sake of a killing spree and several times I found myself yawning and losing interest. Forget about tension because without that rhyme and reason you get none. I wanted to enjoy this film but it was a total let down.However, I have to give Rob Zombie credit for playing the original Misfits ""Halloween"" in the background, nice touch.",Halloween

Michael had far more presence in this film and I personally cared when people died in Zombie's version as he knows how to show violence realistically. In the 2018 version people die and you simply don't give a hoot. Even though it was ""supposed"" to be this epic sequel the only death I gave a hoot about was the girl babysitting the black kid who was hilarious. The failure was not only was Michael killing totally random people, there was pretty much zero suspense. You would think they'd be able to get it right after all these years but even Zombie filmed the last half of the movie closer to how Carpenter filmed his version. The 2018 version looked nothing like Halloween's style and other than Jamie Lee Curtis can you really say you cared about any of the characters because I've watched it about 3-4 times now and it just get worse every time. Zombie's version got better. He had better music, better pacing, and he brought a bit of humanity to Michael only to strip it away by being locked up. By making it more realistic, the deaths feel far more real and gritty. Carpenter's version has by far the most atmosphere but it was not as scary as Zombie's. The true Shape is Nick Castle, don't get me wrong but Zombie's version hands down felt the most REAL.

350,Zombie-Kermit,I actually don't mind it.,5,26 March 2009,"Now before I start, I just want to make this clear: I adore the original movie. For me, it's one of the definitive horror movies, and is my second favourite horror film, ranking only just behind Dawn of the Dead (Sorry Michael, I just love them zombies). I was kind of disappointed to hear they were remaking it, but was still looking forward to seeing the movie, as I generally am. Remaking Halloween was a move that was always going to cheese off a lot of fans of the original. It was unavoidable. But I can respect this movie, due to the fact that I could tell Rob Zombie had a direction he wanted to take the story in, rather than just a straight up remake, made only to make a tidy profit. And yes, I do understand that the direction it was taken in really missed the point of the original. As Zombie said himself, he set out to make Myers similar to the likes of the Wolfman and Frankenstein, a sort of sympathetic character. So, they've given him a face and a back-story. It's not something they should have done, because what made the original so scary was that to us, Myers was nothing more than a mask, a shape, a figure of nothingness. To make us feel sorry for him is not such a good thing. But at least it's easy to view as an alternate story, rather than a canonical past for Michael Myers. Had it been a sequel, there may have been issues there, even though I don't really consider most the sequels to the original canon. The last thing we needed was another Halloween Resurrection. Ugh.So, regarding all that, I figure I will do the rest of the review treating this as a stand alone movie, and try to avoid any more comparisons to the original, since it's just too dang hard to compete with. Alright, one more comparison... There was too much grunting and moaning from Tyler Mane's Myers. He was scary because he was silent in the original. Sorry... I'm done now.The back-story given to Myers was not a very revolutionary concept. Just a kid having a rough childhood and such. It wasn't really that bad. It had some pretty cool moments, and the kid who played young Myers didn't do such a bad job. He was portrayed as a little too much of a Momma's Boy for my tastes, but I guess that's what they wanted him to be. I guess in the end, he did well for the role he was playing. He was shown to be more mentally unbalanced that downright evil, which again, was the direction they stated they wanted to go with. The parts of the movie with Myers childhood started off a little lame, but gradually got better, especially when we started getting some gnarly kills. Sheri Moon Zombie did a pretty good job as Michael's mother, when she wasn't shouting and swearing in an over the top manner.After the ""prequel"" sort of scenes, the movie became more of a remake of the original, except with plenty of little tweaks made to the story. Overall, I preferred this section of the movie over the prequel-like scenes. Tyler Mane did a good job playing the serial killer... I won't say he did a good job playing Michael Myers, since he was very different. Mane's Myers was much more.... angry. He would wreck stuff and throw things to get to his target, rather than just lurk in the shadows. Oops, does that count as a comparison? Sorry! But yeah, I guess what I mean is, he did well playing the dangerous, powerful killer that he was meant to play in the movie. He wasn't extremely scary, but he was pretty cool. Kind of like the movie itself. I know that may not seem good enough for some people, but it was all I was willing to hope for when seeing the movie. It was good to see Brad Dourif in the movie, who is famous for playing another killer I love, Chucky! I also really liked Malcolm McDowell's performance as Dr Samuel Loomis, Michael Myer's psychiatrist. The rest of the acting in the movie was nothing great, typical horror movie stuff.Overall, I think it was a good slasher movie, which is a genre that I'm really into. As a remake, you will probably hate it, but as it's own movie, I really don't think it's that bad. This is not a fantastic movie, but it's entertaining enough. I am really glad that we are getting a sequel as well, since it will allow the franchise be taken into a different direction, and I look forward to seeing what Rob Zombie does with it. I think it is a good way to revive a franchise that died years ago, and with any hope these new movies will help push people towards the original for years to come.",Halloween
351,newday98074,A really bad movie,1,15 December 2007,"Whatever made the original Halloween a decent film is lacking in Buffalo herd size droves in this version. Halloween, the event, has an aura, a history, that was drawn upon in the original. Zombie's Halloween pretends to reflect that history bur really is another slasher film with no invention and an especially ugly veneer. I don't believe Zombie has one ounce of understanding of the genuine human condition, and certainly no empathy for it. His persona is a 12 year old voyeur who wouldn't understand true communication and value. The original Halloween drew upon that part of humanity that sees humanity as improvable. Zombie's people are without souls. His movies are garbage. Let's hope this sort of thing finds the refuse pile as is deserved.",Halloween
352,ozymandiaskingofkings,"Better than expected, but still a bit of a mess.",6,1 September 2009,"As a huge fan of Carpenter's original, I was dreading Zombie's remake, but to some extent I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's no masterpiece, but it's significantly better both than I anticipated and than most critics said it was. Really, Zombie's Halloween is a game of two halves. The first 45 minutes act as almost a prequel to the original film, showing Michael's childhood, and the period between him killing his family and his escape from Smith's Grove sanitarium in which he is being treated by psychologist Dr Loomis. The second half is far more pedestrian and is essentially a retread of the original film.Of these, it is the first half which is by far the more interesting of the two. I know Zombie has been much criticised for his decision to demystify Michael and his attempt to explain his previously intangible evil, but I actually feel that these scenes are very effective. True, giving Michael a redneck breadline background (complete with an abusive stepfather) is completely misjudged and less terrifying than the originals hint that his family was quite normal and middle class, but in truth Myers evil still isn't explained. The scenes of Michael at school, victimised by bullies and causing problems for teachers also don't work really well and the original murder isn't handled well at all, especially compared to Carpenter's brilliant first person perspective.What follows this however is far more interesting, as the film follows Michael's time at the asylum, filling us in on the 15 years glossed over in the original film. Especially interesting is the depiction of Michael's relationship with his psychologist Dr Loomis (played here by Malcolm McDowell), as we witness not only Michael's gradual degeneration from angel faced boy to mask obsessed mute, but also Loomis' transformation from concerned and compassionate therapist to a figure unhinged by his obsessive need to comprehend Michael's evil (slowly shifting more into the character as played by Donald Pleasance in the original series. These scenes are effective, restrained and, in the scenes with Michael's mother visiting, poignant.The problems with the film start as soon as the second half, the remake element, begins, as Zombie begins to basically just retread the original, and fails badly at it. Not only is the film far too similar to Carpenter's masterpiece to be an effective film in its own right, and Zombie for some reason keeps intentionally reminding us of the superior original, using lines from Carpenter's original screenplay and even retaining the iconic score.In essence all he produces is a 'highlights' film, missing out all the slowly ratcheting tension and more psychological scenes of the original and just going for a not particularly gripping stab-a-Thorn, significantly upping the gore, but losing much of the terror and edginess of Carpenter's film. As a result, characters are significantly cut down, and whereas the original had plenty of scenes between the horror which let us get to know Laurie and her friends and actually care about them, here they are simply underdeveloped knife fodder. Laurie is fine but her friends are impossible to give a damn about. The acting among the teen part of the cast is also very variable. Scout Taylor Compton is pretty good and quite likable as Laurie, but the others never really break their characters beyond 1 dimension (though to be fair Zombie doesn't give them much to work with).Malcolm McDowell steals the film though. His interpretation of Sam Loomis is less Pleasance's unhinged harbinger of doom and more a believable liberal academic trying to comprehend Michael's evil, but trying not to lose hope. It's a fine performance, but the problem is this interpretation lacks the urgent mania that Pleasance brought to the role and, as more of a friend to Michael than a nemesis, it's harder to root for him.Visually the film is impressive, with effective cinematography, set design and lighting but Zombies direction is far less so. He gives the impression of a man who knows nothing about tension, throwing plenty of shock and gore at the screen, but little subtlety or suspense. Zombie's film is far seedier than the original, highlighting the sex and violence and giving us much less character development, making it very hard to care. He also stuffs the film with unlikeable white trash caricatures, from Michael's stepfather to a bunch of rapist orderlies at the asylum, none of whom ring true and who belong in a completely different film. It's unnecessary, bringing too much of a scummy exploitation feel to the film and not enough of the lean, classy, intelligent horror which was the mark of the original.The trouble is, for the most part, the film is a brainless retread, and a pointless one at that, missing out important scenes, inserting redundant ones and trying to recreate some scenes shot for shot, while lacking any of the flair, innovation or suspense that Carpenter demonstrated. It feels like watching a tribute band performing your favourite song rather than the real thing, and the tone is totally wrong, bringing in more seedy nastiness but less plot or purpose.Predictably, its nowhere near as frightening as the original, or for that matter, for all its gory pretensions as visceral and shocking as Rosethal's underrated Halloween II. Sure, it's better than parts 4-6, and never does anything as ludicrously awful as 5's crying Michael or 6's incomprehensible Cult of Thorn storyline, but it's still totally redundant, doing nothing new, scary or interesting.It's not an awful film, and is worth checking out for a slasher fan, but if you're anything like me, after you see it you'll immediately dig out the Carpenter version to see how it should really be done.",Halloween
353,cny_cd,Unnecessary sub-par remake of a classic.....,1,22 January 2010,"This is a film that should have NEVER been made...period. The original Halloween films was one of the most innovative and frightening films ever made. The original started the ""Slasher Series"" films of the late 70's/early 80's, and was the best first film of any of those. When I saw this was being remade I was both curious and mortified, but I still had hope that perhaps they would do this classic film justice. Boy, was I wrong. This film was sub-par on so many levels I really don't know where to start. If you like good horror films, stick with the original ""Halloween"", and avoid this as if Michael himself were chasing you.......",Halloween
354,chexmix,naturalistic explanation of the supernatural?,4,11 September 2007,"While I found Rob Zombie's ""recast"" of _Halloween_ to be entertaining, I did not find it as effective as the original. This is probably a ""default"" reaction to a remake of a beloved genre classic, but in this case the reason for me is fairly clean-cut, and that is what I will focus on here.In a nutshell, I think the problem here is that this revised and extended ""with backstory"" version clamps a psychological base onto a supernatural tale, and in so doing robs it of the oomph that supernatural tales want to have. In this way it is similar to the ""Gothic"" novels of Ann Radcliffe: there'd be hauntings and spectres galore, but in the end they would all be given explanations. In this version of _Halloween_ that order is reversed, and we have a dreadfully unhappy and ""tortured"" childhood offered as the psychological ""explanation"" for someone growing up enormous and impervious to repeated blasts of .44 Magnums.As many have pointed out, Carpenter's original was chilling because Myers was never ""explained."" One of my favorite moments in the original is when, in reaction to a policeman's wondering what kind of a man would do such things, the Loomis character snarls ""This isn't a _man_."" Zombie insists both that he is, and that he isn't, and because this is kind of incoherent, it fails to make as much impact.I for one don't want my horrors ""explained.""",Halloween
355,kenvandenbussche-2,The biggest fiasco in movie history!,1,31 October 2007,"Planning to do a remake can be a tricky thing. Sometimes they result in masterpieces such as the 1991-classic ""Cape fear""; sometimes they become the most awful nonsense ever made such as the 1998-garbage ""Psycho"". The truth is: it's not that hard to decide whether a remake is a good decision or a big mistake. There is only one simple rule and that's this. Don't meddle with classics! A remake should only be made if the original film is flawed or totally forgotten.The original 1978-version ""Halloween"" is neither. It's a perfect thriller-horror movie featuring great acting performances by everyone involved along with the brilliant cinematography of creator John Carpenter. This is one movie that will never die out! I believe it is one out of four extremely important thriller-horror movies that have genuinely revolutionized their genre. The other three are: ""Psycho"" (1960), ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"".I have never used these very words before, but I cannot think of one single positive thing to say about the 2007-version of ""Halloween"". Director Rob Zombie really did everything wrong when making this movie. This remake has more holes than Swiss cheese, and lacks common sense and feeling as it races blindly ahead.First: it spends way too much time trying to humanize the evil character Michael Myers by showing us an utterly boring background of depressing childhood. Michael Myers did not become an evil person because his upbringing was a very tough time for him. He did not become an extremely dangerous and seemingly unstoppable monster because his mother was in love with a foul-mouthed loser and his sister teased him from time to time. That whole section of Michael Myers the troubled kid was simply pathetic. They spoon-fed us too much information. His lack of motive would have kept this movie mysterious and chilling.Secondly: because the director wasted half the movie showing us a Michael Myers as a murderous child, he irreversibly started to rush things as soon as we got to lay our eyes on the adult, white-masked version. Because of this huge mistake, Rob Zombie doesn't find the time to properly set the frightening mood imperative to a thriller such as this which evolves around the scariest time of the year namely Halloween. Why Michael Myers never really stalks his victims nor rarely watches them from a distance in this remake, is beyond me. He almost immediately attacks them and that is not how Michael Myers operates; which is why this film falls flat on its face and fails to be genuinely scary.The mask itself was authentic but for some stupid reason they decided to make him much taller. Michael Myers is not a giant per se, he's just an evil and entirely emotionless human being and as such: the personification of fear! Moreover: the actor does a terrible job as well. In this movie, Michael moved too swiftly when in fact he never seems to change his pace when pursuing someone. This altogether adds to the already creepy atmosphere. And why did the adult-version of Michael Myers look like an over-sized Kurt Cobain when not wearing any sort of mask? This, and so much more, is why this movie is not a superb thriller like the original one, but an exceptionally dumb and boring slasher film.To make matters worse: the scenes in this remake that match the ones of the original come across as a painful déjà-vu but the scenes that are entirely different are just plain stupid. All characters are one-dimensional and I honestly couldn't care less what would happen to them. I couldn't even bring myself into finishing this movie. After an hour and a half, I walked out of the theatre because I got so worked up with the extremely low quality of this irritatingly-unscary remake.The acting is not bad but it's a joke when compared to the original cast. Malcolm McDowell isn't really that awful, but the character Dr. Samuel Loomis will always carry the face of the brilliant actor Donald Pleasence; to me. Just like Laurie Strode will always be connected with Jamie Lee Curtis and certainly not Scout Taylor-Compton. Take a look-out for actress Leslie Easterbrook. Her role is a minor one, but you might still recognize her from the ""Police Academy""-movies where she played the tough and sexy female cop Captain Callahan. Brad Dourif plays the part of the local sheriff.In short: One can only take a wild guess as to why they wanted to make a remake of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". I, for one, think this movie has failed miserably on all levels. This is truly one of the all-time worst thrillers ever made! This ""Halloween"" has become the epitome of boredom.",Halloween
356,kennymasterson,Charmless Remake,4,24 September 2021,"Young Michael Myers murders a handful of people including his sister and stepfather on Halloween night as a small child and is sent to a mental hospital under the care of Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) until he ultimately decides he can't cure him. Michael breaks out on the eve of Halloween and returns home to terrorize the other sister he left behind and her friends.Whether through writing or acting, the three female leads comes across horribly and you're actively rooting for Michael to tear into them. While it's brave of Zombie to take the complete opposite approach of Carpenter's original, it doesn't ever gel into anything particularly compelling. The violence is far more graphic and brutal, but the film is never suspenseful or scary.",Halloween
357,moselekm,Great Remake,8,5 July 2009,"Okay, I actually have no interest in scary movies. I don't find them AT ALL interesting. They usually have no real story, just boring killing tagged with bad acting. However it was my friends who force fed me the original Halloween and then to watch the remake right after and I liked them both.I guess I can't really hold my own on speaking of scary movie genres, but I thought that the remake was outstanding. It gave an entire story to the killer, Michael Myers. Starting from age 10 to age 25. It also took a good amount of things from the original with a few added twists.What I liked the most was the story not only behind the man in the mask, but also behind the girl who he chases so frantically. I think Zombie has created a gem that will be able to live on in Carpenter's shadowed works. In my personal opinion this is my favorite Zombie film. (Although, I tend to dislike outrageous acting combined with grotesque violence) - (Don't get me wrong, I love gore and violence, but Zombie does a hell of a job to adding a sense of emotion that causes anxiety).",Halloween
358,mylucylumpkins,Too bad you can't rate with negative stars...,1,10 July 2011,"Is it really fair to rate a film that I have not watched in it's entirety? I would not consider it judging a book by it's cover, more or less just reading the first couple chapters, realizing it's even crapper than the cover made it look, and tossing it into the recycling bin. I gave this film a fair shot. Everyone knew it would not even compare to John Carpenter's Halloween, but I thought... I can't judge it compared to Carpenter's, it would be like trying to judge horse crap compared to gold. I had the opportunity to see the film for free, and realized it wasn't even worth that, I should have gotten paid for watching what ever much of it I did see.Most films and film-makers acquire fans based on what it is they're bringing to the table., so a remake is to me an attempt to rob the fan base of someone else, but we are really way too smart for that. Did we need an explanation for why Micheal Myers kills? No, he's the boogieman, enough said. Did we need to turn him into a backwoods, abused, traumatized, home-grown psycho? NO! He is the innocent boy=next-door turned boogieman, that is the beauty. There were repeated scenes of overly violent and sexually violent behavior that were not only unnecessary but unwanted. It made me honestly sick to my stomach, but not in the way I believe it was intended to. My stomach did not churn due to great work on special effects and gory goodness, it made me feel sickly and exploited, like the way you would feel watching a child abuse story on the news. So, chin up all you introverted long-haired males out there, living in your mother basements with blow-up dolls taped vicariously in your closet, this one is for you.",Halloween
359,BruddanChrist,I really enjoyed it,7,1 February 2008,"When Rob Zombie was offered the chance to remake Halloween, he went to John Carpenter to gain his blessing. Carpenter's response was, ""Make it your own."" Zombie has achieved something few filmmakers do in remaking a classic. He has taken the original version and added more meat to it.Meyers's character development is very interesting. We first see him as a subdued boy who (allegedly) kills small animals to feel superior, then follow him as he progresses into a repressed, zombie-like murderer who kills everybody he comes across. When comparing the 1978 Meyers with the 2007 Meyers, the latter version is much more frightening (though, Tyler Mane deserves much credit for that). Carpenter's Meyers is a robot; Zombie's Meyers is a monster.Zombie's ensemble of supporting actors is one of the film's strongest aspects. Most of the Devil's Rejects cast returns, all portraying much different characters. Danny Trejo and William Forsythe give particularly memorable performances.In light of today's Hostel/Saw horror violence, Halloween is rather tame. While it certainly surpasses Carpenter's version in both content and intensity, Zombie practices some restraint in how much violence is shown, leaving much of the horror to sound effects and imagination.I honestly don't understand why people are so hard on this movie. The ending drags on for a bit, but otherwise it's a pretty solid film. Remakes have become regular ventures. You can either resist them and be unhappy with half of the movies released, or welcome them and hope for a good ride every now and then. Halloween is a great popcorn flick! Just sit back and enjoy yourself.",Halloween

Also I am fan of the band Powerman 5000, which vocal is Spider One, Zombie's brother.The film wasn't so bad. Michael Myers was killing the people very cool. But the storyline was little bad. Also it was annoying that Michael was killed hundred times and then was becoming to kill again and again and again. (Also I aren't watched the original movies) I wasn't like in the film that many sex. Kiss-kiss and Michael hire.The end was bad.I will vote 6/10.

361,shalabodov-32997,Not as bad as people say,6,19 October 2018,"Rob Zombie has a reputation for making exploitation flicks with some style but zero brains. I can honestly say that this is the best Zombie has to offer.No Halloween sequel or remake can top the original, it's a known fact. Halloween has established itself as one of the finest horror movies in the industry and when you're Rob Zombie, you know you can't beat Carpenter. So you create something different.Now, this movie has many problems, majorly due to Zombie's middle school script writing. The dialogue is mind-numbingly stupid and sometimes even annoying to listen to. Michael Myers' step dad is insufferable as a character and should not have even existed. Sheri Moon Zombie does an okay job, she's not annoying to observe. Malcolm McDowell legitimately tries and he is probably the best part of the movie, he is given a lot of screen time and it was a smart decision. Tyler Mane provides a scary Myers, he is so enormous and menacing that you can't help but get goosebumps from his portrayal of the infamous serial killer.Most of the kills are pretty violent, which is always a treat, but none of them have much impact on the story, all of them just fill in the plot and not affect anything of high importance. The backstory for Myers is pretty dull to watch, partly because not much is happening, but also the kid who plays young Myers is pretty terrible. Also, when Michael kills his step dad, you can easily see the fake mask with blood on the step dad's throat.I would suggest seeing it if you're a big slasher fan or horror fan in general, just don't expect much going in.",Halloween
362,crousbrandon,One of the much better Halloween movies in zombie style,7,10 November 2019,"Rob zombie did good here explaining myers past, its much better than the awful sequel's that followed the original timelineWhile I am not a huge fan of the Halloween franchise overall, I did not like the original , or its sequel's much, I would follow this timeline any day of the original, I think zombie has crafted a great slasher fil m here, not scary though but gory in his signature style,
You basically for the first act of the movie follow young Micheal through his childhood, then him breaking from the asylum to search for Laurie .
We get some good acting here, standouts are Sheri moon zombie and Malcom McDowell and daug fearch who does a great job as Mrs myers, Dr loomes and young micheal respectively.
Overall I've never liked any of the Halloween movies except rob zombies ones and the 2018 one.

363,nickilancaster,Not as good as the original.,3,30 September 2007,"I was so excited about seeing this film as i liked the original and i thought it would be way better but i was wrong. Rob Zombie what have you done! Right from the opening scene i didn't like it, in the original it gets straight to the point and i think its far more scary not knowing really why Michael is a cold blooded killer. In this film it shows a good 40 minutes of why he is so messed up and quite frankly its boring. You would think that a film with more killings and way more blood would be better but it is not. I believe they knew they couldn't top the original and so went for cheap thrills by showing way too much blood and showing too many boobs and people getting it on. It was a let down for me really although some scenes were good and if it was just another horror film i would rate it better its just that its suppose to be a remake and it doesn't live up to the standard of the original as it takes too long to get into the heart of the story and after a while i was bored. Also Michaels family were so stereotypical the annoying slut for a sister and the weak mother who puts up with s**t from the alcoholic step dad, if i were him i would wanna slit my step dads throat too. But you see my point, by showing his family like this it makes you connect and sympathise with Michael which was what was so great about the original because you never knew what made him snap which is far more scarier. I know it shouldn't be exactly the same as thats just a copy of the original not a remake but for some reason i didn't like it, i think sometime less is more. Yes the killings were better in a way as you see more and it is very gory (which i love in a film) but it just played on the fact that they had the money to do that and so went over the top with so many unnecessary killings. Overall i would say it was below average and i wouldn't watch it again, lets just say i cant wait for Saw 4 to come out then i can see a really good horror film.",Halloween
364,darthMisaskernew,"F-bombs, sex, and no story! WHAT IN THE WORLD DID I JUST WATCH?",2,12 November 2018,"I saw this film in theaters and thought it was the most confusing, bizzare, and laughably dumb thing I've ever seen. Years later I think the same thing! Rob Zombie's music is AWESOME and I loved his first two movies, but MAN did he screw up big time on this one! For one, there is no story at all. It's just random scenes of people saying the most vile and over the top swearing ever put to screen. I think there was some sort of rule in the contract that said Zombie had to put an F-bomb in every single sentence. It isn't cool or badass like in Pulp Fiction or Dawn Of The Dead, it's just stupid. With zero plot structure (Laurie Strode doesn't come in until the last 30 minutes), it just feels like an extended music video but you replaced the music with dialog and sound effects. Secondly, all of the characters are AWFUL. The dad played by Bill Mosely is THE WORST CHARACTER EVER PUT TO CINEMA and not in a good way. It's like his dialog was written by an egdy 8th-grader! The mother is stupid! She finds a decapitated cat in her sons backpack and is like ""hm, weird"". WHAT??? Michael Myers is a whiny brat who never shuts up and is killing people because his sister (also an unlikable scum) didn't take him trick-or-treating. Seriously that's the best Rob Zombie could come up with? Even Laurie Strode is hugely unlikable. Every character is obsessed with sex and swearing, and it's annoying. Why would anyone approach a 7'0 tall known killer and name call him??? I don't know, but several people throughout the movie do just that. Third, every character looks identical to Rob Zombie! Why??? It's almost like that Nutty Professor movie where Eddie Murphy plays the entire family. Even Michael Myers looks like Rob Zombie for some reason. Finally, the movie just isn't scary. There is no atmosphere, no creativity, no thrills, it's just boring. More funny if anything else. Not a single kill was scary! What happened to the incredible atmosphere and tension from the 1978 film? Sure, Carpenter is the much better filmmaker, but it's like Zombie was trying to shock its audience more with sexist and racist Tarantino knock-off dialog instead of genuine thrills.

Almost the first hour of the runtime is showing why Michael got this way and giving a backstory, destroying the suspense immediately. The casting is TERRIBLE. Zombie only got the casting of Dr. Loomis right. Everybody else looks like they're getting ready for a Lynyrd skynyrd concert. Zombie turned Myers into Jason Voorhees as a Wwe wrestler. He's tall, jacked, and brutal. Way out of character for Him.The direction is terrible, the casting is terrible, there's too much unnecessary swearing, it doesn't do the movie it's trying to remake justice.....the only reason I say it's watchable is because it's so bad you can't look away",Halloween

Instead of him being the embodiment of evil on earth, he's just an abused social reject with a stripper for a mother, rude tramp for a sister, and an abusive drunk for a stepfather. With this household, it's no wonder he snaps and goes on a killing spree.This extended prologue, while misguided, is still the only interesting part of the film. Once the film hits the hour mark, it reverts to an almost shot for shot remake of the original film but without that film's scares and well crafted suspense. Zombie and co. Have also gone out of their way to make sure the teenage babysitters in this retelling are as crass and annoying as humanly possible so you're rooting for Myers to hack them to bits.",Halloween

370,Bub_the_zombie,wonderful adaption,10,22 November 2007,"What people need to realize right off the bat is that this isn't a film by John Carpenter. It really pains me that some people can't let go of nostalgia and enjoy a good movie. You've got slasher fans complaining about the lack of decent slasher flicks, and when one rears its glorious head, they throw off on it simply because it's a remake.Rob Zombie is probably the best horror director in the business today. I'd go as far as to say the past fifteen years. 'The Devil's Rejects' was a modern day masterpiece. It's plain to see Zombie's genuine love for the genre, and with Halloween '07 it's no different.We start out with a young Michael Myers, being brought directly into his dysfunctional childhood - Pole dancing mom - Alcoholic, verbally and physically abusive father figure - Slutty sister - The only true form of normality and pureness in the trashy home is his baby sister.Zombie pretty much sticks to the basic beginnings of the original 'Halloween', but adding a disturbing glimpse into a disgruntled childhood that the original didn't explain. A lot of people's gripes come from the fact that Zombie actually shed some light on why Michael did what he did. Was it because he was a product of a shitty childhood? Probably not - And I think the kid who played young Michael did a great job of proving it went much deeper than that.I'm going to make one complaint in that Linda, Annie, and Laurie weren't the likable trio that they were in the first - and I'm not sure they had to be in the new version. Films are flavors of the day like anything else. Kids these days (sad but true) aren't truly likable. After this being said, I do think the young actress who played Laurie Strode did become more likable when the action got started.There's also a lot of gripes by fans of the original that Malcom McDowell didn't play out well as Doctor Loomis. Personally, I don't think casting could have done a better job. I think he was about as close to the real Dr. Loomis that we'll ever get. There's also a lot of flack being tossed Zombie's way in regards to Loomis' dialogue. Again, I thought it was absolutely fine. Wonderful acting on McDowell's part.One can't talk of a Zombie film without mentioning cameo appearances. Ken Foree, Clint Howard, Brad Douriff (not as much a cameo), Courtney Gaines - Just to name a few. All did a great job to boot.The score - What can I say. For the most part, the original score was recycled, only spruced up a bit. I'd almost swear I heard a few licks from Halloween 2 in there somewhere too. The added score was masterfully done. I could almost feel the raw power in some scenes as the score and camera coincided to give Myers an 'earth shattering effect' - making him seem like an oiled machine, shaking the ground as he walked, or viscously raged something all to hell.I almost forgot - Sherri Moon pulled out a wonderful performance. She proved here that shes more than capable of playing broader parts - more than a maniacal killer with the mind of a teenager. Great acting.All in all, Halloween '07 does what most horror films these days simply can't do. Zombie is such a true fan of the genre, that it shows in everything he does. To be a true fan only means that it's conceived in the mind of someone who knows the genre inside and out already. It's certainly a plus and it certainly only adds to the all around dark and depressing nature of the film.The camera work was filled with close-ups, almost giving a smothering presence and a much more intimate feel. I also commend the cinematography department. Halloween '07 is chock full of familiar atmosphere, capturing a very seasonal-like tone that adds that certain feeling most suburban neighborhoods associate with Halloween. I think Zombie put all his blood, sweat and tears in this flick, and personally thank him for it. A somewhat sad tale in the end - a depressing outlook on how a little unconditional love and a feeling of being needed can mean the difference in the mind of a child - how when the stars are aligned just right, when all the circumstances are in place, a child can host the very evil that leads to homicide.",Halloween

That's not horror, thats just gore.2. The Rape Scene- Don't get me started on this... So why? Why did they add that scene in? FOR NO BLOODY REASON AT ALL. It was sick and inhumane, nobody likes to see a man raping a girl. Of course all the rapers out there would.3. Laurie- Oh please- I wanted to shoot her brains out myself. ""Ahh, please help me! He's going to kill me!!!!!!"". The old Halloween was far more better.4. Death Scenes- Too much, too long, too early, too late. The whole movie is just kill and kill and kill and kill.

However, this remake seemed tremendously mishandled.To delve too much into Myer's back story is to rob us of one of the most frightening aspects of the character. The fact that we don't know why he does what he does or what makes him tick is erased when you make him an angry abused redneck child who wasn't allowed to go trick or treating. It also a common problem with Zombie's films that he tries for over-the-top dialog that doesn't mesh well with the gruesome action of the film.Again, I'm not a ""don't f*** with the original"" purist, but I think this one would have best been left alone.",Halloween
374,akuma634,Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it did,1,28 August 2007,"I saw the work print and the only really difference is that in the final cut they removed the rape scene, tacked on a little more blood, and changed the ending. Regardless of what they do ""more blood"" won't make this movie any less awful than it already is.So it starts off with the young Michael Myers who is a fat, ugly, spoiled brat with not one likable trait. His mom is a striper, his dad is a drunken sob, his sister is a slut. And yes, that is as deep as his family gets. It's like Rob Zombie just watched Jerry Springer and took notes. Every character in this movie aside from Dr. Loomis, Michael's mom, and Laurie have very little dialogue and there is little to no character development. Everyone in this movie was written as a one note stereotype without any likable features. It's all promiscuous women, sex obsessed men, white trash, preps, and that's really it.So you have a cast of people that you are never even given a reason to care about and you just wait for them to die. Also there is no suspense in the whole movie. You see Michael first and then you see someone put them self in a vulnerable situation minutes in advance. You always get a heads up way in advance before anything happens. When someone does die the kills are very lame like he just does the same 3 kills over and over again and it's mainly just stabbing or beating someone over and over and usually after the first strike the rest is either off screen or the camera is running all over place so you can't even tell what your looking at.The music was very misused. In the original Halloween you can have a camera walk up stairs in the dark and then edit in the Halloween theme and it becomes creepy, here it's like they just used the old Halloween music at random and didn't even bother trying to make it add any tension. There are also some various classic rock songs that show up for no reason other than to say this is set in the late 70's.The story is very boring and just drags on and on. The so called back story of Myers is that he was an obnoxious kid who could somehow over power and kill people a lot bigger than him. Instead of him stealing his mask from a store he kills a guy who was on screen for less than 5 minutes and takes the mask from him. Also as a kid he talks but then after demanding to be let out of the mental hospital and being turned down after asking 3 times in a row he never speaks ever again. The first 30 minutes or so are just him as a kid. Laurie doesn't show up until about the 2nd half of the movie and she just isn't even the slightest bit likable or charismatic. Also Dr. Loomis is very sympathetic for young Myers even when he stops talking but after the 15 years later gap he is convinced that Myers is the Devil in the flesh and must be stopped at all costs, they never really explain that plot hole.So all you get are people who are disposable and only there as props for Michael Myers. In the original Halloween it was about the characters and John Carpenter said that Myers was little more than a prop to get the story across. So this remake just went in the complete opposite of the original. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but 5 minutes into I knew it was awful and I still sat through this mess and it only got worse. Somehow it's worse than Halloween 3-8, I don't how thats possible but it is. Do NOT waste your money on this movie, even if you can get a free pass just see something else. This movie doesn't have one redeeming quality and is a slap in the face to the entire horror genre. Do yourself a favor and rent the original Halloween.",Halloween
375,BloodStone,Nothing special or memorable (unlike the original),5,4 September 2007,"Well RZ did the unforgivable: He humanized Michael Myers. Thus destroying the mystique & aura of pure evil that encompassed his very essence. Instead we a get a MM raised by pure white trash. Myers is talkative & has a good repoire with his mother (even months AFTER the first initial killings) but then (for no plausible reason) turns on a dime into a stark raving mad psycho who says nothing for the next 17 years. And how did he become so incredibly strong & big by not eating? I never felt like I was watching ""Halloween"" because there was no significant tie in per say to the Holiday (the kid wore a mask 99% of the time anyhow). Naturally RZ ratcheted up the gore & shocks & threw in some nods to the original & it's sequel but many times John Carpenter's score was misplaced (i.e. used in places in the film where there was no need for it.) Oh and Sorry but, Malcolm Mcdowell is indeed a fine actor but he's no Donald Pleasance & I never really bought into him as Dr. Sam Loomis. The other girls in the film I couldn't have cared less about even if MM had decided instead to rape them all to death with a tree branch.Annoying little twats!SPOILER WARNING..............................................................It made little sense that MM would dig up his sisters tombstone if the only thing he was interested in was re-uniting with his baby sister not in killing her. And why was MM moved from his cell & for what purpose ESPECIALLY on 10/30? Why did MM decide THEN to ""make a break for it?RZ's film is a definite improvement over his previous two & it wouldn't be half bad if he had decided to make this type of serial killer movie WITHOUT calling it ""Halloween"" In short, this film did nothing to enhance the legend of Michael Myers rather it weakened it by making him into nothing more than your average run-of-the-mill serial killer.Rating 5/10 {On a positive note: Danille Harris does show off her tits for quite awhile in the film :) }",Halloween
376,tvsweeney-39052,Good without Comparisons,8,27 October 2016,"Comparisons are Odious...so they say...but they happen, especially in the case of the Remake...As for the movie itself...there's nothing new as far as the plot goes...it's good...in its own way, centering on more of the WHY of Michael Myers this time around, although I wish they'd given us a peek through that tangle of hair at the face behind the mask. Though there doesn't seem to be an evil entity possessing the 10-year-old this time around, it seems Michael is more driven insane by his incarceration and ill-treatment than anything else. As far as I was concerned, there were very few characters in this movie who didn't deserve to get theirs. They were all pretty despicable. Even a sane person would've been sorely tempted to off everyone of them. It also appears that in this particular world, all teenagers are foul-mouthed sex-crazed little beasts who can't speak a word without the one following or preceding it being a vulgarism or profanity and they live either to have sex or beat up on anyone smaller or different.That's the lovely world Michael lives in...and when he returns to it after his escape, it's not to kill Lori Strode but to simply reunite with the baby sister he adored as a child......and that, in my opinion, is when the story begins to bog down, because after that, it's all slash-and-crash.It's a good movie, for those who haven't seen the original and won't make comparisons.If this sounds like a negative review, it's not. It's simply that the original kept intruding and there were a few spots that glared and interrupted the plot's bloody flow.The cast of characters is a roll-call of the well-known of horror and otherwise...Brad Dourif, Dee Wallace, Malcolm McDowell, Danny Trejo (in a sympathetic roll for a change) and others with 6'8' Tyler Mane towering over all of them...silent, hulking, relentless...He's a worthy successor to Kane Hodder and the others, and I'm certain remakes of the rest of the franchise are forthcoming.",Halloween
377,vince200002000,Second Best In The Series Behind The Original,7,1 September 2007,"I read many reviews on this movie. The mixed feelings people had on it kind of worried me. However I was very pleased when I left the theatre. It had somewhat of a creepy atmosphere to it and the acting was OK as well. The only problem I had with this movie would be that it was a little slow paced and was a little longer then it needed to be. Some might complain about the dialogue having to much profanity, but I don't agree with that. Most people talk like that in everyday life nowadays so I'm not going to hold that against Zombie. There was some corny dialogue though, such when Lourie said ""Was That The Boogyman?"" was just laughable along with some other dialogue and some bad acting at times. It was In my opinion one of the more decent remakes compared to many other trainwreck horror remakes that have leaked into theatres over the years, but this was actually decent.",Halloween
378,hypostylin,Rob Zombie provides some unique and some not-so-unique touches.,6,31 December 2007,"The first act of Rob Zombie's Halloween delves into the origin of my favorite movie maniac (thankfully without any of that idiotic Thorn Cult business from Halloween 6). While the scenes of Michael Myers' childhood are plausible and disturbing, they are rather predictable and mundane, following a clichéd worm turn back story. However, it is in these scenes that Rob Zombie showcases his unique flair for direction, as he aptly mixes a sensitive focus with his trademark gritty aesthetic.The latter half of the film, unfortunately, falls into the mire of any other slasher retread you find cramming the multiplexes these days: lots of stylized color correction, musical stings, and murky scenes of generic carnage. The goings on are livened up, however, by the countless cameos from some of the genre's superstars, including Ken Foree, Dee Wallace, and Sybil Danning. Ken Foree is bad-ass here, just as he is in everything he does (even Kenan & Kel!). And how great was it to see Danielle Harris being pursued by Michael Myers again? All in all, Halloween 2007 is not a bad re-imagining. Not necessary, but not bad.",Halloween

380,horrorflicklover,"Not as bad as I expected, but not worthy of it's name.",7,17 August 2008,"This film is so divisive for me personally. On one hand, I happen to like it as a film. On the other, I hate the fact that Rob Zombie finally made a horror film worth watching, and he completely gutted and dishonored a classic franchise to do so. I try not to let my personal feelings about Rob Zombie's career get to me. On that note, I think he's a terrible musician, director, writer and anything else he's endeavored in that I'm unaware of, you can bet it sucks too. I was always a metal kiddie, but I never caught the hype regarding White Zombie, Rob Zombie's solo career, or any of the films he's made. This movie had a real chance for me to give a fair shake to the man where it was warranted. And I still walked away divided. On it's own, I think Halloween is a great film. It kept me entertained all the way through. It was coherent, steadily-paced, engaging, and had an admirable body count. This would have been an outstanding re-imaging of the original Halloween had it not been for two things. Two things that, as much as I like this film, also make me really hate it because of it's namesake.These two things are: 1) The complete destruction of the very thing that made Michael Myers who he is: His mystique. 2) Being trashy and classless when it had no true reason to be. On the first note, Halloween fans have always known that there's one truth about Michael Myers: He's evil. There's no explanation for it, no rhyme or reason for what he is. So far, two sequels have attempted to explain ""why?"" Halloween 6 (another atrocity), and this film. Each time, it all came down to fixing what isn't broken. Zombie had a golden opportunity here. A chance to give Halloween fans what they'd long-wanted: A look in to the early days of Michael. How did he react to the world around him at home, school, etc? We already KNEW what kind of family and such that he had. No, Michael Myers is NOT a product of his environment. That's why his character was so intriguing. He had a loving family, siblings, good neighborhood, et. al. The fact that he became what he did makes him part of an entirely different group of people: Those who are built as disturbed. And Michael's disturbances went well above all. We thought we were getting what we wanted. What we actually got was the destruction of what made Michael and endearing figure in horror history.On the second note, this film kind of plays down to it's audience. Horror films in the 2000's kind of dropped a lot of pretenses, and went straight for the gore. Not that 1980's slashers didn't do the same thing, but the classic slashers of that decade still had class. This film kind of delved in to ""cheap shock"" elements at times. It just lacks class where it should have had it the most. This is fine for another film. And I can accept that horror films have evolved. But Zombie only got it half right. He still bottomed out the movie for his audience, dishonoring it in the process. The Haddonfield scenes are where this film really shines AS a Halloween film. That's what the entire movie should have been. An updated re-imaging of the original. The Haddonfield scenes do the franchise justice. But the entire first half of the film, while I liked it for what it was, it didn't belong as a part of the Michael Myers story. I don't want the exact same movie, don't get me wrong. That's where the 1998 Psycho went wrong. But the re-imaging of the work was what it should have been. Not the rewrite/re-imaging hybrid that it was.It's a tough call. As it's own film, I like it. But I'm still irritated by what it did to the franchise. I'm sure the readers of this review can relate. For instance, Hannibal (2001) had the same complaints. On it's own, it was good. As a Hannibal Lecter movie, not so much. That's what I think of Rob Zombie's Halloween. Even when he made a good movie, he still bastardized a franchise and meddled in things that have always failed it's namesake. If none of what I said matters to YOU, then by all means, check this movie out.",Halloween
381,IcyRoses,Unnecessary and Not The Good,3,12 July 2010,"I am completely against remakes unless the original film was not very good, but could have been. Which brings me to Halloween (1978), a perfect film in every sense of the word. So, what would bring today's filmmakers to make a ""re-imagining"" of it? MONEY.It takes the original story, adds a horrible back-story that involves stripping and spousal abuse, and then completely forces us through the movie with graphic, unnecessary deaths, including a brutal attack on a poor nurse. At least in the old films, the characters had an agenda, they weren't innocent middle aged people who couldn't harm a fly.Rob Zombie should have also cast some people, who ya know, could act...instead of the local theatre amateurs, who curse there way through the film. But, the film was badly written and lighted as it was, so does it matter that much?",Halloween
382,nrabond007,Revitalized through subtlety,8,4 September 2007,"Nothing will never truly live up to the original, although this film gave it a good run. The differences were staggering and the plot holes were evident (how did Michael know that Laurie was his grown up sister, and since when does Michael know how to drive, how does Michael move the gravestone without being seen, and why does Michael kill the janitor that was so good to him in the institution?). In the ways, however, that there were no plot holes, it was at points superior to the original. Instead of Michael just killing for no apparent reason, we get an in-depth look into his family life and inner-psyche, something which the original never presented. Michael Myers is truly a deeply troubled character, so driven by hate that he can never truly die off, he will always be Michael. I generally am not a fan of the gorefests which Rob Zombie has embraced as his own, however there is a subtle brilliance to all his work. ""Halloween"" is his masterpiece. Well done, Rob, you got it right. I give this film an 8.5 of 10. Happy film watching!!!",Halloween
383,funnygy,"Way, WAY better than I expected",9,31 August 2007,"I'm not a big fan of the recent trend of remaking all the classic horror films of the '70s and '80s, but I decided to go see the new ""Halloween"" anyway, if for no other reason than I'd never seen any of the original films in a theater. (That, and I figured they couldn't do much worse than the god-awful ""Halloween: Resurrection"", the most recent entry before this remake.) IMHO the original ""Halloween"" is one of the greatest horror films ever, and certainly the best ""slasher"" movie (unless you count Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", but that's another topic.) I really expected to be let down, even though I haven't seen any of Rob Zombie's other movies.For the first five minutes, I thought, ""Great, they took this classic American slasher flick and turned it into a white trash festival."" But once Michael started talking (which he never does in the original film) something clicked, and I was hooked. The new film takes the Michael Meyers ""mythos"" (if you will) and fleshes it out, giving the audience a frightening insight to the true horror that exists all around us before eviscerating us with the shocks and gore we really paid to see.The movie loses some of its momentum when it jumps to the present day, when too often it reverts back to simply restaging some of the trend-setting scenes from its predecessor - Laurie staring out the window at school and seeing the weirdo in the coveralls and the white mask staring at her, only to vanish seconds later. But hold on, friends - just when you think you know what's coming, the new ""Halloween"" veers off on its own course, and from then on all bets are off.One of the most significant updates to the ""Halloween"" legend is the development of Dr. Loomis, the Van Helsing to Meyers' Dracula. The original Loomis (played memorably by the late Donald Pleasance, who kept returning for sequel after sequel despite his age and - in later years - ill health) was little more than John Carpenter's answer to Captain Ahab. Each film saw him trying to convince another group of skeptical law enforcement officers of the imminent slaughter, never to be believed until the bodies started piling up. The new film's Loomis, however, is a more complex character; he's not the selfless hero the old Loomis was, but he's not quite a villain either, as long as one can forgive him for giving up on Michael to turn his experiences into a cottage industry of ""true crime"" books and public speaking engagements. When Loomis and Michael are reunited later on, there's more going on then can be seen in a first viewing.Zombie's ""Halloween"" succeeds on all fronts. It brings modern touches to a format that had long since fallen into cliché without changing it so much that it becomes unrecognizable. It manages to restore the menace and dread of the iconic Michael Meyers character in an era when masked psychopaths usually prompt the audience to laugh rather than gasp. Most importantly, it delivers the goods horror fans demand but includes enough depth and subtext to make it more than just cinematic junk food.In short, I was pleasantly surprised with this new version of ""Halloween"". Like Zach Snyder's redo of ""Dawn of the Dead"", the 2007 ""Halloween"" could never replace its predecessor, but does make for a very admirable companion piece to a horror classic, blending the old and the new into an entertaining and thought-provoking fright film.",Halloween
384,WebKinect,Much Better Thank Expected!,6,31 August 2007,"So we start off with Michael being 9 years old. He doesn't have a particularly nice life, he is picked on at school and has a very abusive step father but his Mother adores him. Oddly though, he does appear to have tendencies to abuse animals and would prefer to wear a Halloween mask because he believes he is ugly.One day he loses it and goes after one of the boys that bully's him and kills him in the woods. He goes home and kills his step father and his elder sister while Mum is at work but protects his baby sister. 11 Months later he is sent to a mental institution where he is befriended by one of the cleaners and his psychotherapist (Malcolm McDowell).A new cleaner joins the staff and liked to bully Michael, just as he was at school and then one night said cleaner brings in his brother to rape a female in-mate and think it would be fun to try and get Michael involved. Needless to say, Michael isn't too happy about this, kills the cleaners and escapes.So here the murders start while Michael is searching for his baby sister.So, is the movie any good? YES! Its much better than some of the earlier offerings of this franchise but its certainly not scary, saying that i didn't find the original scary either! To all those people complaining about 'a good horror story is not about knowing why he became evil' - Get a grip! It was you guys who 30 years ago wondered why Michael was evil, why this little boy was compelled to kill his family! THIS IS A Fictitious STORY! If you wanna watch one of the better sequels (although this is really a prequel), of the Halloween saga then you should definitely watch this, its interesting and as fun as any other slasher flick.Is it going to win any Oscars but then I'm sure its wasn't made with that intention ;-)",Halloween
385,nujuv,If you consider the whole series...,7,29 September 2007,"... this film by itself does a pretty good job of reinventing the story. Lets face it, it pretty much petered out after just the first film. The only redeeming thing about 2 is bits before the hospital... and its been pretty much downhill.The performances by the teen girlie's is pretty lack lustre - though the new Laurie does a good line in terrified as the film draws in.Brad Dourif turns up and isn't used at all - despite having potential to be a narrator for the whole piece. This brings me to another point-there is too much squished in this film. It is hard to care about the teen girls as they are painted as a side line. Malcolm Mc Dowell does well in Donald Plaeasances place and the film is well shot, if lacking the subtle creep of Myers into the frame of the original. Tyler Mane/Daeg Faerch do great as Myers, the only off change is the trailer trash background doing the usual American movie trick of giving villains a rough background to justify their evil somehow. The first had a far superior inexplicable evil thing going on.See it - dread the sequels - but this is quite a solid turn.",Halloween
386,austinkunkle,A new trip on Halloween,10,17 November 2016,"People always say they hate remakes...but Halloween was probably a great remake in my opinion. Everybody always talks about Micheal Myers being the most brutal murderer. Well they certainly showed it in this one. Other than Micheal's intense killings,there was also the fact that they showed more of his childhood being completely messed up than how we pictured it. Compared to 1978,which was still great,2007 shows more than what we should've seen. In 1978,Micheal tries to make a pattern to kill each of his sisters every 15 years,except we never knew Laurie was his sister in the old one. That was more of the mysterious thing ever to why he was after her. Then the sequel to 1981 came and we knew why. In 2007,they just gave away the obvious story,but just added more killings to it. The 1978 version makes Micheal Myers really scary and spooky. Micheal in 2007 was just really intense,completely crazy psycho,and just really bloody. I believe,in my opinion that my list of top Halloween movies in order are 1978,2007,part 2 1981,part 4,H20,Resurrection,part 6,part 5,part 2 2009,and I'm not adding part 3 because it was just horrible.

And really, it's not boring, pointless, drawn out, and all the other things people are calling it. I would say that most of the negative comments here are really subjective complaints that chastise the film for not being what the writers want it to be, totally sidestepping what the film actually is and what it does. I'm not saying the film works totally from beginning to end, because it doesn't. But there's more good here than not. Zombie takes this kind of story seriously. His focus on Michael displays a disarming sincerity that gives the film's best moments the kind of weight missing from the most recent, generic horror films.

390,baileygiannini,"A REMAKE THAT DIDN""T LIVE UP TO IT'S EXPECTATIONS!",4,30 June 2018,"Everyone who read my movie review of Halloween (1978), they know that I'm a big fan of the Halloween films. However, Rob Zombie has a very poor ability to create scares and frights, unlike the original, Rob Zombie relied on Shock value with lots of gore to try to strike the fear into horror fans. Sadly, that's not how it always works. Sometimes what we don't see, is scarier than what we do see. He didn't know what to show and what not to show. I remember on the trivia on IMDB, that one of the facts was that Rob Zombie didn't want his remake to go up against Saw IV. In my opinion, if he's afraid to face another filmmaker who makes horror films, then he shouldn't be in the filmmaking industry at all. We need creative filmmakers for us, the audience, in all genres. Not only that, but they need to be brave. The fact that it wasn't released because they were afraid of what might've happened if it had gone up against Saw IV, that means that Zombie isn't as good of a filmmaker that he says he is. If he wants to stay in the film industry, he might want to consider taking some filmmaking classes at a film school. Someone needs to show him how to make a really horrifying film. Carpenter gave Zombie his complete support on remaking the film. After he encouraged him to make it his own, probably not just for him, but for his fans as well, Rob Zombie said the opposite. He said that Carpenter wasn't very supportive, I'm glade that Carpenter shot back an assertive response during an interview. Zombie definitely deserved it. As for the 2007 remake of Halloween, focusing on the film itself, I felt that Zombie could've taken more time to come up with more creative plot points. It could've also used more professional sounding dialogue, all of the swearing seemed to be never ending, all of the adult content could've been taken down a notch or two. My best advice for people who want to see the remake of Halloween, get it on Netflix or amazon streaming. If this film ever comes back to the theaters in the future, don't go to see it, you're only putting money in Zombie's pocket. There's no real thrill ride here. After fifteen to twenty minutes into the movie, you'll begin to realize that Zombie copies pretty much everything that Carpenter had created in the original film. In which shows that Zombie couldn't rely on his own creativity. All in all, 3 & 1/2 stars out of 10.",Halloween

At least this one is way more better than Halloween: Resurrection, which I consider it as a spin-off.After Christopher Nolan chose to reboot the Batman films, it has been a trend to do remakes of the classics, but Nolan hasn't failed at all to reboot a franchise. However people like Michael Bay (A Nightmare on Elm Street & Friday the 13th) and Zac Snyder (Man of Steel) are one of those many names who actually just destroyed the pride of the classics. But does Rob Zombie hit this list or not, is what I'm going to talk about.Rob Zombie has failed to improve the scare from the classic. Instead he has focused more on the back story of the young Michael Myers, and that's a great thing. We all wondered what that actually happened on that Halloween night when the 6 year-old Michael killed his sister Judith. The first 55 minutes of the film was absolutely great, so we should give Rob Zombie an applause for that! However the second part when Michael returns to his hometown, Haddonfield, is when the movie starts to turn bad! There are so many mistakes and so many goofs compared to the original.If you want to see a horror movie I prefer you to not see this one and WHATEVER YOU DO, don't even think about giving your time for the sequel.

392,DelBongo,"Black is not a colour, folks",1,8 May 2008,"Classic movie monster Michael Myers as pointlessly 're-imagined' by a petulant imbecile. There isn't one iota of suspense in the whole wretched thing, and Myer's new (absurdly simplistic) character embellishments could quite easily have been dreamt up by a five year old under general anesthetic. By pretentiously attempting an all-out character study instead of a straight homage or remake, Rob Zombie has ended up cluelessly violating several fundamental rules of the horror genre, thus devolving Michael Myers into a psychopath with less chill factor than a mildly irate Michael Palin brandishing a foam rubber mallet. When the depressing truth that a drooling simpleton like Rob Zombie can maintain a career in Hollywood is finally the butt of droll jokes rather than the painful industry death knell of today, people may be capable of watching this stupid, stupid, stupid hunk of bunkum and having a laugh at it. Viewed today, with its lurid, lingering death scenes, its complete disregard for cinematic artistry and craft, and its unbelievably, catastrophically, seismically dumb script, it is akin to an agonizing brain assault. But gawping at Zombie's unbelievable stupidity only goes so far. When he shoots the brutal gang rape of a helpless female mental patient from the leery, almost jocular perspective of the rapists rather than their prey, it becomes almost impossible to stomach his hoity-toity claims that he's some kind of subversive artist rather than a mildly perverted misanthrope. After the rape, Michael Myers escapes from the institution and from thereon in, murders absolutely everyone that he meets, with one exception: the rape victim. Why? Empathy for a fellow asylum inmate? Something Oedipal? Nah, its because the MPAA would've slapped the film with an NC-17 rating in the States and kids wouldn't have been able to see it. What an artist! I watched this film from beginning to end in a constant state of funereal head-shake-o- vision. John Carpenter's original film was a masterpiece.

I did also like the refreshing take on the back-story of Michael Myers. It was very interesting, but not really scary. Halloween is a very intense and disturbing film, but most of it didn't feel incredible. The acting wasn't bad, especially compared to a Horror flick. This is barely scary, but Zombie's attempt at making Michael Myers interesting was well done. That's what I like about Rob Zombie. His unique visions are very vivid and even if they don't exactly work like he wants them to. I do respect his effort.

Now I will grant you this I did enjoy the movies first half where we watch the seeds of evil being planted in little Michael, but once the movie attempts to remake the original it fails miserably. The good Most of the first half. The kid who plays little Michael is pretty good, he conveys evil quite well and has that disturbed look. Sheri Moon Zombie who delivers a fantastic performance as Michael's stripper mom, she gives some life to a character that is other wise just text book trailer trash. William Forsythe delivers a good performance out of an otherwise toxic sci pt. The first murder of the school bully is truly unnerving and I love the new Halloween theme song because it is traditional yet edgy. The rest of the actors all deliver fine performances no need to drag this out. The boobs sue me I'm a man! The bad The dialogue, sweet $#$#ing Jesus I feel like the dialogue skull f*cked my brain in to stupid submission. Most of the murders scenes because they lacked suspense. The entire second half which is a quickie remake of the original and reminds the viewer of how much better Carpenter did it. The superhero sized Michael am the only one who found that ridiculous The continuity the cops go to the wrong address and so on. The characterization especially those of Laurie, Annie and Linda. The little kid wearing the adult Myer's mask. And finally MAJOR SPOILER HERE Killing Doctor Loomis what in the hell does that solve? There are many more problems to be sure but those are my main complaints in a nutshell. Let's not forget the original Halloween is a classic of suspense and terror and in my book the best horror flick ever.

396,SonicBoom77,Halloween (2007),6,1 October 2007,Well first before this movie i wasn't a big fan of the Halloween films first watched the first film a few days before the re make came out i also watched the 2nd before the re make came out i seen the re make opening day and i thought it was average. 40 Min's fit just fine for Lil Michael myers screen time the story went smoothly and the film went 50% rob zombie and 50% classic Halloween people say to much sex and swearing. that may be true but it only fit it to be more believable the only thing i didn't like was towards the ending i think rob may have not been thinking there but because of this film i am a huge fan of the Halloween series. 5/10,Halloween
397,BuddyBoy60,simple description:amazing slasher remake,10,29 October 2008,"I only watched this movie this morning and I was awed as a horror film fanatic by the movie's special spark. In the beginning of the movie I was still visualizing the complete plot and trying to relate . At early middle part I started to stare at the screen and seems excited of what is going to happen next. I really enjoyed watching this movie. The things that made this movie a genuine terror is the actor that played Michael,when he is still 10 years old,Daeg. Daeg's performance was the one who made the movie spectacular.His acting, it made the viewers enjoyed. I don't care about the comparison between the original and the remake. Of course the original is the best but people who are comparing somehow don't know the function of this remake. You are wrong if you are thinking that remake's are dis appointing, yes it is true sometimes but the true function of this remake is to reborn the horror fame of John Carpenter's Halloween. So don't compare this two masterpieces because they have their own way of impressing the viewer, they have their own sparks. So for me they're both great works of two horror film directors. Well done John and Rob for this work of art. So I rated this movie**********/********** and a special ****/***** for Daeg. so Michael Myers see you again this next Halloween.",Halloween
398,SteveDonnachie20022001,The Remake Era,2,20 November 2013,"I remember when I was 14 years old. I was in high school and a friend talked me into horror films and I remember hearing a lot about the original 1978 Halloween film. I had heard it was one of the best horror films ever made. And when I did see it I became a fan of the films and I understood why the film was one of the best horror films ever made. Still is. It was dark, creepy, good story telling, good acting but it also proved it could be more then just a slasher film about a killer killing people in a town on Halloween. And it wasn't surprising that Halloween inspired film makers to try and do something as good as or even be better then Halloween throughout the 80s-90's era of horror films. Years passed and after several Halloween films we entered in the era of remakes. I had already seen some good and some bad remakes in my run as a fan of horror. Some remakes were on par with the original while some actually surpassed the original film. I thought My Bloody Valentine 3D surpassed its 1981 original film. I thought the remake of Night of the Living Dead in 1990 was on part with the 1968 original film. But when I had heard they were doing a remake of Halloween I became a little curious and worried at the same time. The questions began to pop into my head. How would it do, would it live up to the original. In time I would find out I remember seeing this film for the first time and I just felt that this film tried to do something different from the original but instead made more mistakes then it intended. The biggest mistake was the beginning of the film when we were introduced to Michael Myers. And how we got to know more about his childhood and how he came to be a killer. I have always known and felt that during a horror film you cant ever explain too much about what you want to be scary. This was the mistake Rob Zombie made In the 1978 film we knew Michael Myers killed his sister. But while we wanted to know more about Michael part of us didn't. That's what made the original Michael Myers more then just a killer wearing a mask. Michael was a evil presence that made you want to know more about him but you didn't want to. The whole backstory into Michaels childhood was explained way too much where when he did become a adult and return to his hometown he was just a guy wearing a mask. He didn't have that dark evil feel to being Michael Myers. By explaining too much into the fear Rob Zombie eliminated the whole purpose of a Halloween film. That was to be scared. And while the film started out different with the whole backstory into Michael Myers when the time did come to the main story it was really just a film trying to copy the original. The kills might have been different but overall it was basically the same film. I don't hate the acting performances in this movie. I understand the actors could have done just as good if anyone directed the film. I will say its not the worst Halloween. But this film couldn't live up to being as close as the original",Halloween
399,cdipatri,Zombie's Best Work Yet,9,30 August 2007,"I was fortunate to get a surprise ticket to the sneak preview tonight and couldn't be happier that I already have a ticket to see it again tomorrow. In my opinion, this is Rob Zombie's best film yet. John Carpenter should be very happy and Debra Hill and Moustapha Akkad should be smiling and partying in the afterlife. This was a very good remake. Happily not a copy like the remake of Psycho. The whole back story with Michael as a child was chilling and Daeg Faerch is one scary, talented little actor. It was a great mix of familiar stuff from the original and new additions from Zombie. What I Liked: The darkness and camera work was really fitting and gave the film an eerie feel. All the action was in your face and the sound effects were off the hook . . . you could almost feel every stab. There was plenty of ""jump factor"" moments that made me come right off my seat. All the actors did a great job especially Malcolm McDowell, William Forsythe and Scout Taylor-Compton. Daeg Faerch has a great future and I'm looking forward to seeing good things from him. I really love the mask and I'm considering getting the Michael Myers tattoo on my leg altered to reflect the new mask.What I Didn't Like: This may be a small thing but in the scene where Dr. Loomis, Michael and his mom are eating lunch, why did the adults leave Michael in the room with a metal fork. With all the kid did, I thought that was a big oversight. But, then again, the gruesome attack on the nurse wouldn't have been the same. All in all, I think this was awesome and I'll enjoy watching it again tomorrow and I'll be at the store the day the DVD comes out. Also, a big thank you to Danielle Harris. You are HOT!",Halloween
400,Jothos,Rob Zombie = NOT SCARY!!!,2,8 May 2009,"Ugh, why did Rob Zombie have to re-do this movie? All he does is try to make his movies look cool, and hip. John Carpenter had a talent for suspense, and eeriness with the first Halloween, and many of his other films. Rob Zombie simply does NOT have this gift. I loved all the T & A, of course, but I also wanted a good movie. And the main character, Laurie Strode, played by Scout Taylor-Compton was simply a bad choice I think. The only thing she was good at was screaming. That's possibly why they went with her I guess. But all her scenes where she's trying to appear like a bubbly teenage girl look SOOO forced in my opinion. Rob is trying SO hard to make the first half of the movie look like everyone has such a happy small town perfect life, so when things turn evil, it looks even more horrible in comparison. But that is so evident in every scene of the first half of the movie, that it all looks so fake. The only 2 decent performances in the whole movie were of course, Dee Wallace, and Danielle Harris. Michael Meyers was not scary or creepy at all in this movie. Most of the choices Rob Zombie made in this version were puzzling, and didn't fit well in this version at all. Sorry Rob. Your movies CAN be cool. But don't try and re-create a film that had such an impact because of how genuinely scary it was, and think you can pull it off, and get as good of a reaction as the original. Oh, I see you're already making H2, the sequel. Do me a favor and kill yourself before filming raps, so perhaps a talented director can take over, and fix whatever crappy scenes you already shot. :-)",Halloween
401,hallmitchell,I walked out,1,24 November 2007,"First time I've ever done it. Pointless and Brutal. Full of blood. No suspense. Just seems an excuse to show relentless gore. I have never seen the original Halloween. So I thought I would check out the remake. Big Mistake. There should be a new rule in Hollywood. Just like you don't make sequels to Jim Carrey movies without Jim in them. Don't make prequels for Villains.Star Wars, Hannibal Lecter and now this. Rob Zombie is obsessed with foul mouth trailer trash. Why I don't know. I was really looking forward to this. If Rob is to improve of as a film maker I challenge him to drop the relentless violence and go for the suspense angle. Don't see this film.",Halloween
402,Dillypogo,Halloween: A great remake,8,21 August 2008,"Horror remakes are so common nowadays and the majority of them are terrible and don't match up to the movie they're remaking. But, Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween is actually pretty good. We follow 10-year-old Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch), a troubled boy who murders his father-in-law, his sister and his sister's boyfriend on Halloween night. He is sent to a mental institution where he escapes 17 years later and goes back home to Haddonfield, starting a killing spree.About a year before this was released, I was on the internet when I heard about a rumour that slasher movie Halloween was going to be remade by Rob Zombie. Two things went through my mind: ""Oh God. A remake of Halloween? This is gonna be horrible"" and ""Oh God. Rob Zombie's doing it? This is gonna be horrible."" In fact, the only reason I watched it was because I was curious and I've got to admit I was surprised at how good it was.Daeg Faerch gives an excellently chilling performance as the young Michael Myers and is a promising start to his acting career. Malcolm McDowell was perfectly cast as Myer's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis and he also adds star quality to the film. Director Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie makes an appearance as Myer's mother (hmm.....I wonder why she got the role.) Seriously though, she does do a good job of it.Any remake will be compared to the movie it's remaking and Zombie's Halloween doesn't let down. Although John Carpenter's original Halloween surpasses Zombie's remake, the remake still lives up to the original. It works as both a prequel and a remake of Carpenter's original due to it being done in two halves. The first half shows Michael Myer's first murders and effectively delves into the character's motivation for this and the second half shows his escape from the mental institution and his killing spree which pretty much made up the 1978 version. I was surprised to find that I preferred the first half and found it more interesting than the slightly too clichéd second half.My only problem with Halloween is that it isn't really very scary. The thing that made the original version legendary was that it was genuinely creepy and its supernatural element helped with that. Zombie's Halloween has its moments but as a horror film it doesn't really work, although it's still one of the best remakes out there.It might not be as good as the original but it's still a great movie. I give it 8/10.",Halloween
403,Sam_Movie_Buff,Rob Zombie is the director. Need I say more?,1,12 February 2008,"I knew this ""remake"" was never going to surpass the original. I mean, I'm all for remaking classics. Sometimes the remakes come off better. But Rob Zombie should have known from the get go, you can't remake Halloween - you just can't. It's impossible. The film is a horror classic and will remain one for centuries. He could have however, tried and made a decent attempt, but he didn't even succeed in that. This ""Halloween 2007"" is in one word: Insulting.Yes. Ineed it is, insulting to the original. Pathetic even. Rob Zombie (The Devils Rejects) turned ""Halloween"" into another one of his trashy, sexed up, so called ""horror movies."" It could have been anyone else. Why, god why did it have to be Zombie? The cast mostly consisted of ""The Devils Rejects"" Z listers (he tends to do that in a lot of his films - why I don't know! These actors are nothing to brag about) The acting was appalling - terrible. The movie ran at a snails pace. The first 40 minutes of the movie is about little Michael, just before he kills his family. Rob tries to connect with the audience, giving us reasons why Michael is so bad. Why he is so twisted and evil. Why he makes these horrific decisions. Almost asking for sympathy. What Zombie doesn't realise is, what makes Michael tick isn't all that interesting. There is no need to know. It's much scarier that the reason Michael likes to kill is because - he enjoys it. He loves it. This is terrifying! This is what made the original work. He was always named ""The Boogeyman"". Pure evil. No soul. No heart. All he wanted to do was kill. Zombie's version is basically saying Michael kills because he had a terrible childhood. That's not scary. Doing this made (2007's Michael) your average, bland horror killer. Michael Myers does not have a conscious. He doesn't have a soul. He is PURE evil. Rob claims his version isn't a remake, it's simply his take - yeah right. After the boring 40 minutes about Michael, the rest is basically the original jammed into the remaining 50 minutes. He focused so much on Michaels back story that he actually forgot he was in fact shooting ""a remake."" He failed on all accounts. There was no tension, no suspense, no fear. It's just a pointless remake. In the first movie you got the impression Michaels parents, sister and living life was pretty normal. His parents appeared to be sophisticated, sensible - normal parents. What did Rob do? he managed to turn Michael's living life into a trailer trash show. Like something from The Jerry Springer Show, and of course he had to make Michaels sister a total slut. ""Laurie"" was another issue. In her first 2 minutes on screen she manages to display a sex joke. Do we all remember Jamie Lee as Laurie? Very virgin like. Not Rob's version, but that's no surprise - his idea of horror is ""The Devils Rejects."" He has no intention of character development. Another ridiculous scene was Michaels ""Escape scene""/ Sex Scene. Yep, you guessed it! Rob found some way to turn Michael's escape scene into a short porn preview. Are you surprised? Probably not if you've seen his other ""projects"". As usual with Zombie, the word ""F-u-c-k"" must have been said 123,000 times in this movie. God forbid Rob do a horror movie with no sex or sex dialogue.All in all ""Halloween 2007"" is disastrous. I dreaded the day Halloween was going to be remade, but I never thought it would lay in the hands of Zombie. There are two types of horror movie. One is the original Halloween. A movie based on pure suspense and real terror. The second, a filthy horror/porn session that basically sums up what Zombie is about as far as directing goes - your direction was abysmal. You managed to turn a well respected, classic horror movie into another one of your filthy, trashy B type horror's. I really hope the rumours of Zombie doing the ""Friday The 13th"" remake are false. I don't think I could stomach it.",Halloween
404,diegoavilarodriguez,This is good movie but a lousy remake,4,20 December 2008,"OK,first things first, the way you enjoy actually depends whether you saw the original Halloween. If you have seen the original Halloween then will not fully enjoy this film and if you haven't then you might enjoy this film. The first time I saw this I was actually hoping this movie to be better, but no it was a more like a re-imagining of John Carpenter's Halloween rather than a remake. It takes away what made Micheal Myers scary, it turns Micheal into a victim of society when he is suppose to be a naturally evil killer. Though it was cool how Rob showed what Micheal went through inside the hospital, but the fact that Micheal Myers'characteristics were changed was in fact a real downer. Now this movie did have a lot of gore(more than the original) which from a certain point of view is the upside to this movie, for me it was cool the fact it contained more gore than the original. Now to me to only bad parts this movie was the fact that Micheal Myers was changed into a victim of society and the ending which really disappointed me. Again this movie's aspect depends on whether you have or haven't seen the original.",Halloween
405,shammuk,Not a bad film,7,8 July 2008,"I've never seen the original one. I went into seeing this film without any expectation so I guess I didn't dislike this film as much as most of the people that has seen the first Halloween.I don't think that Rob Zombie is trying to give Micheal Myers a soul. It is clear in the beginning of the movie it says ""true evil are those who break free from the abyss"" not in those exact words but something similar. I think that is exactly what this film was about. He showed Micheal as a child who is still somewhat normal then he goes and kills those he hated in his family and sparing his little sister and mother whom he loved. At that point I would say he's in the abyss and still haven't become truly evil. Then after he got institutionalized Rob Zombie shows the process of him breaking free from the abyss and become truly evil. He even killed those that were nice to him in the mental hospital. I think Rob Zombie achieved what he wanted very well in this film. Yes there were a lot of rednecks and white trash in this film but that didn't really throw me off. I think the sex scenes were a good fit. Sex and violence always goes well together.I think it's unfair trying to compare this film to the original. Clearly it is two different films.",Halloween
406,RM-Montoya,Halloween (2007): I like rob zombie movies...but this one sucks,2,27 July 2021,Michael Myers is not evil becuse he had a bad home life or whatever's this movie is trying to show. Michal is evil just because!Michal Myers is one of those movie villains that you can't explain.Rob zombie screwed this one and the 2nd one. Hell this one is at least a little good but the 2nd...,Halloween
407,ElectricWarlock,One of my favorite remakes,10,5 March 2013,"I feel like the moment it was announced this film was being made, people automatically hated it without giving it a chance. I recognize the fact that the original film is a classic and love it just as much as any other horror fan does, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy this film as well. While most remakes are just about the same as the original for the most part with only slight adjustments such as using modern special effects, newer technology, and popular actors from today; this remake actually contributes something to the story by going into more detail about Michael's past. In the original movie, Michael is simply born evil and has no real reason to become a serial killer besides the fact that he was born that way. In this movie, Rob Zombie saw it necessary to give Michael a backstory and make the fact that he was born into an unstable family as the reason he became a killer. That is considered a clichéd and unoriginal reason to some, but to me it seems completely realistic and believable. If you read about real life serial killers like Albert Fish, John Wayne Gacy, Ed Gein, and Henry Lee Lucas, there seems to be a trend that most of them grew up with rough childhoods in an unhealthy environment so it makes sense that would be the reason Michael would kill. The ""born evil"" explanation suits the original movie, but this isn't the original movie. I think the reason given as Michael becoming a killer suits this film and if people want to watch the original Halloween, they should watch it and skip this remake. People complained when the remake of Psycho was exactly the same as the original and then complained this one was too different and changed Michael's backstory too much. Should remakes be the same or different? Make up your mind.The acting in this film is incredible. Daeg Faerch, Danielle Harris, Scout Taylor-Compton, Malcolm McDowell, Tyler Mane, Dee Wallace, Sheri Moon Zombie, William Forsythe, Brad Dourif, and Danny Trejo were all amazing in their respective roles. There wasn't a weak performance in this entire film. Everyone who acted in this film gives their performance all the talent they have and you can tell they really enjoy what they're doing which is very important to a film. If the actors are bored, you can certainly tell are bored and that makes the viewer lose interest as well. I didn't notice that whatsoever from this film. The great acting is what makes this film because you honestly believe the actors and actresses really are the characters they portray in the film. Only a brilliant director could elicit such great performances from an actor and I believe that Rob Zombie is a brilliant director. He is the best horror filmmaker of the 21st century and I don't think people give him enough credit. Because he is also a successful musician, people think music is the only thing he should be allowed to be good at. I honestly think that is the reason people hate Rob's films. All of Rob's films are excellent and all horror filmmakers who plan to do any remake in the future should watch this film and learn how to do a remake right.",Halloween
408,Kevbo1985,"Impossible To Beat The Original, But Zombie Does It Justice",8,7 November 2014,"Being a fan of his music and his theatricality, it was easier than I expected to go into Rob Zombie's re-imagining of the horror classic ""Halloween' with an open mind. Considering the original film (and its sequel) rank amongst my highest horror flicks, this was no easy feat from the onset. Balancing my fear of disappointment, as well, were Zombie's first two films, ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and the sequel ""The Devil's Rejects"", which I found to be very entertaining.I can quickly summarize my thoughts on this film by saying that, in a side-by-side comparison, looking at Zombie's ""Halloween"" is like looking through a different window to catch a glimpse at the same sight. While the object itself is the same, the perspective is slightly different. Instead of simply thrusting the iconic Michael Myers on us, as Carpenter did, Zombie attempts to introduce us via polarizing back story and a slower build to the final product. In this way, Zombie not only offers a unique perspective on a classic villain, he does so with a modern flair for emotional introspection. Also modernized is the audio, which is something I cannot give Zombie and everyone else responsible enough credit for. The sheer weight of Michael Myers' attacks is felt audibly more so than visually, and Zombie was clever enough to underscore the original ""Halloween"" theme by using it sparingly, instead introducing an industrial/symphonic score that does wonders for impact and atmosphere.No doubt about it, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is easily one of the better horror movies I've ever seen. He does the original justice and never veers far enough from the beaten path, leaving a familiar and uniquely visceral, but more human and tragic, Michael Myers to terrorize us.",Halloween
409,horns-1,Wished it been done differently,7,12 October 2007,"I liked it, but it could have been better. Once the movie fell into ""remake"" territory it lost effect. I liked the young Michael Myers story. Would have liked to see more of Michael and Dr. Loomis in the institution, more dialog, more of the years, more of him growing and even more murders along the way. In my opinion, this could have worked. Michael could have even escaped, or tried to, as a teen, murdered, and failed to make it back home before being caught and re-institutionalized. Then the film could have ended with his last escape on Halloween and him getting his mask and knife. The ""remake"" scenes felt wrong to me, like reenactments you see on America's Most Wanted or Forensics Files, etc. I guess someone who's never seen the original HALLOWEEN will have a better time with the latter parts in this version. It's good but not as good as I'd hoped. There's no chance any remake has going up against the original and being spectacular, so I think Zombie should have made an entire film leading up to the first. The ""remake"" scenes weren't hard-hitting, all the new scenes were.",Halloween
410,Jeffronthi-950-543134,Grindhouse Myers,4,19 January 2019,"Over-the-top, unbelievable dialogue and writing from Rob Zombie nearly killed this for me as a whole.White trash taken to a hellish degree is one way to explain Michael's behavior, but it only serves to make this a revenge flick, as you will no doubt come to empathize with him. Also, the white trash dialogue is so over-the-top, it is unbelievable, and nothing I have ever seen before - and I am from a broken home! I grew up in chaos, in the Midwest, and the scene had no resonance with me, though the scumbag stepdad and poor conditions ring a little true. So, this, to me, is just stylistically grindhouse. It is purposely exaggerated, and I am just not feeling it. Too much.The rest of the movie is rather bad. Loomis sucks. Laurie sucks. Lindsey sucks. The dialogue sucks (not that the original was terrific). Young Myers definitely sucks.Only saving grace was that Taylor Mane was great as Michael. He was a ferocious, believable force. That is it.Stylish and watchable for the superior part II, but nothing special. It's just grindhouse Myers.",Halloween
411,chris-832,Watching your toilet flush will be more entertaining,1,24 September 2007,"I loved the original. I love movies. I very rarely ever turn off a movie. Even ones that are the worst of the worst (Batman & Robin) that are entertaining just because they are such a train wreck.Rob Zombie's vision can be compared to an eighth grader creating a paint-by-numbers version of the Mona Lisa, except he uses different colors, doesn't stay within the lines, includes a 5 panel comic strip explaining why she is sitting there and smiling, and she's showing her breasts.This movie grossed as much as it did for one reason only - he stole the original storyline. First, there's no need for a back story for Michael Meyers. He's a psychopathic killer, that's all that you need to know. It doesn't matter the why, it only matters that what. But since he insisted on a back story, couldn't it have been less cliché of the dysfunctional household? At least make it vaguely compelling. Secondy, Laurie is a foul-mouth mean-spirited bitch that I was hoping would die. Third, the editing (especially the cut at the start to the title credits) were laughable when they weren't just jarring. By the way, I knew Laurie was the smart nice girl because she wore glasses, but none of the other girls did. Wonderful subtly (cough). Fourth, it was so bad that I had to stop watching. If you have an IQ over 95 and/or over the age of 16 you'll probably want to do the same.However despite the mess he made, I don't hate Rob Zombie. I think he is doing the best he can do with his limited film making abilities. However I damn Hollywood for actually pushing this defecation as main stream entertainment.I'd like to have a sit-down with you and Michael Myers. Can we take a meeting? @$$holes.",Halloween
412,trix_n_min,Predictable But Deeply Disturbing,6,6 April 2008,"I've read many of the comments about this film, and while I do agree it is overly gory and I do not like how Michael is made out to be a victim of circumstance and nurture, I do think there are good points as well. First the negative, I don't know if Zombie's point was to make the viewer empathise with Michael, because I didn't. Lots of kids come from screwed up families and get bullied and they do not turn into serial killers. He is crazy, and he would be just as crazy in a perfectly normal family. So I don't like this ""feel sorry for Michael"" plot. On a positive note, I'm not sure if Zombie is trying to make us feel for Michael as much as he is trying to make us see that Michael has been insane from day one, and making him into this frightening walking time bomb, where you are thinking that his family & bullies have no idea what they are getting themselves into. Possibly his family are not there to make us feel for him, rather to make us feel for them because we know the lunatic they are crossing, and he certainly will punish them. That is the feeling i got from it. Another negative, I do think there was too much gore and not enough suspense. In scary movies, the thrill is in the chase and knowing someone is being killed but not seeing it. Seeing the blood and murder doesn't make it scary for me, it is just gross. I also do not understand why the rape scene in the hospital was there. I found that scene utterly disturbing, it made me sick, and I don't see what it had to do with the movie. It was gross and uncalled for. Actually having the viewer glad that Michael killed the rapists is just stupid, because he is meant to be the cold-hearted villain in the movie, not everyone else. I also think this movie dragged on for too long. There were too many murders that were unnecessary, and in the end I was just hoping he'd catch Laurie so the movie would end. The chase scene went for way too long, and the character of Laurie was annoying and irritating and her friends were really over the top, i wanted them to get butchered. Having said all this, however, the movie did scare the bejeezus outta me, I found the actor playing child Michael to be extremely talented, and extremely scary and disturbing. The adult Michael was just too big - way over the top. Also the sex scenes = murder happened way too much. This film did it's job in scaring and disturbing me, so I suppose for a not-so-obsessive Halloween fan it is worth a watch. But overall, I'd say this film deals a little too much with the poor-Michael concept, and the victims are faceless nobodies the viewer doesn't care about.",Halloween
413,ImmortalCorruptor,Disappointed old fan,1,30 August 2007,"I think Rob Zombie missed the point on so many levels, so many times here.I saw a sneak version, and the credits had him as the ""writer and director"". No credit to Carpenter. Shame, sir.It also spent the first hour showing how Michael was the victim of terrible torture, and how everyone he killed didn't deserve to live. For some reason, his family in Illinois spoke like Texans...we get it Rob, you like Texas.What Rob doesn't get is that films like TCM, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St. and Friday the 13th were cool because they were examples of living urban legends. If you were a ""bad"" kid, the monsters would get you.Rob has decided that the monster shouldn't be an urban legend, but a vigilante you should cheer for. Well, why not write a screenplay about that and not ruin a movie that didn't need to be remade? An hour or so into the movie, it gets into the ""after the asylum"" segment, finally. We're introduced to the babysitter, and have no reason whatsoever to care about her. At this point, the movie down-shifts from 30 mph to 10 mph without warning. Our hero Michael is supposed to be an immortal killing machine, an urban legend, punishing teens who do wrong, but instead looks like a member of Slipknot that got lost and wandered into the wrong music video.Thanks Rob, for getting rid of that annoying ""suspense"" and ""implied violence"" and ""shadowing"" that the original was so full of.We get it. Please go back to making movies about Texan killers with your trophy wife cast first. Hollywood, please get Michael Bay to do the remakes of Nightmare on Elm St, Friday the 13th, Evil Dead and Poltergeist so that old fans like me will know it's not worth wasting the time to watch...I honestly wish I'd been getting a root canal instead of watching the Halloween remake. At least something constructive would have been done with my life.",Halloween
414,yngpsych,Okay but not great,6,29 August 2007,"Although technically well made with some good performances, this re-imagining of the original classic never comes close to the suspense and horror of John Carpenters masterpiece. That is not to say it is not worth seeing. The first half is the story of Michael as a child living with his white trash family and this, for me, was the most interesting part of the film. Sheri Moon is quite good playing his mother who works at night as a stripper to support her family and truly loves her little boy. When she is told by Michaels school principle that her son seems to be torturing small animals, she does not believe it. Then on Halloween, he kills his sister, her boyfriend, and his mothers boyfriend, sparing only his baby sister...Laurie. As you know the rest of the story, I won't bother telling it, but it is extremely violent with at least 14 killings that I counted. Laurie in this version is okay but seems to scream a lot and is not nearly as resourceful as Jamie Lee was. Malcolm McDowell is the best thing here and plays Dr Loomis quite well...and Michael is quite scary looking, bigger and creepier looking. Still, there are just so many things that don't work in this film, that I am sorry to have to say you are better off renting the classic and watching that instead.",Halloween
415,cabartha,New breathe of the old story,7,27 December 2007,"Until now, all we know about Michael Myers was his strange and powerful will of killing. But in this one, we witness the born of his rage, disappointments, the reason of his unlimited hate on people and the sense of being wild. So far, I was thinking that he will not stop until his last family member is finished. But when you watch it, you will find the ""real"" answer of his purpose. The story is different than the original and I think you will like, even you will ask yourself if Michael is totally guilty or not. I mean, I believe that you will start to think he is not a callous killing machine. Recommend you to watch it in a late time of the day.",Halloween
416,movieman430,"An all together different, but not at all bad Halloween",7,31 August 2007,"This truly isn't a remake of Halloween, it's almost a different perspective of what is pretty much the same story. Instead of Laurie Strode as the main character, we get Michael. This aspect of the film is both intriguing and disappointing. Instead of spending most of it's time on Halloween night, Zombie's film spends about half the time building up to Halloween. The additional material isn't bad, it's actually pretty good, but it pushes out some of the original material that probably should have been kept in. The film almost plays as a companion to the original, just bloodier, more shocking, but missing some of the mood.The first fifteen or twenty minutes are spent with Michael as a child, we see the events leading up to his first Halloween night. This is interesting, but some of it feels like it could have been shortened to make time for other things. Daeg Faerch does a very good job of portraying young Michael, and steals some of the scariest moments of the film. Loomis's role is expanded and humanized; Malcolm McDowell makes the role his own and in turn creates something that doesn't feel like a rip off of the Pleasence character. We're treated to his break out from the asylum, which is actually done better than the original, the mental hospital scene always felt like the weakest in the original. Rob Zombie's Michael Myers is huge, Tyler Mane stands 6'8"" and gives the character a much more human, angry feel.The biggest fault is that we don't see Laurie Strode until close to 40 minutes into the movie. Halloween night is tragically compacted and therefore loses a great deal of it's pacing. The movie, in an attempt to keep the running time down feels rushed. The characters of Annie and Linda are shrunk down to fifteen minute rolls, most of which is spent naked. There is one scene that exploits the Michael is there, and then he isn't gag that the original used so effectively. Scout Taylor-Compton does a good job playing Laurie, unfortunately most of her screen time is spent screaming, what would have been her character development, apparently happens off screen. In the end, she isn't the main character, Michael is. Zombie, attempting to cover all the ground he had to and keep the movie under two hours cut out a lot of the long, eerie shots that kept the mood of the original in such a profound place.Zombie makes up for this by doing what he does best. Killing people. It might sound sick, but the death scenes in this movie are spectacular. It is very much a Rob Zombie film, that means it's very bloody. That also means, that no one just dies. They get stabbed, they crawl a little bit and then they get stabbed again. Michael kills much more physically in this movie, the original Michael seemed to have impossible super human strength, in this one you can almost see the struggle. The death sequences in the movie are fairly well spread out, they happen in three big chunks, young Michael, Asylum, Halloween night, giving you just enough time to breathe before the next set begins. Just like all Zombie films, the movie ends powerfully, but not necessarily effectively.Overall, Rob Zombie's Halloween is an uneven, but not at all bad attempt at ""reimagining"" the series. Unlike most horror films, this one could have afforded to be a bit longer and leave more room for mood. The first forty five minutes are very good, the last fifty of them are spent trying to cram a ninety minute movie in the alloted time. In the end, does it hold a candle to the original, no. But it does hold it's own and does a very good job at creating a very different but still frightening Michael Myers. It's leaps and bounds better than the sequels, but definitely falls short of the original. This is a must for Halloween, and Rob Zombie fans. The film is intense, fast pace, and fiercely entertaining. It's not cinematic masterpiece, but it's absolutely a worthy addition to the series, and might just start up a new one.",Halloween
417,marccfantozzi,Oh my God...,4,7 August 2021,Not the worst remake I have seen but a missed opportunity. The film is very vulgar and very different than the original HALLOWEEN.

418,LuckyMatt93,Absolutely terrible,1,24 June 2009,"It's official: Rob Zombie butchered a classic. Not only that, he's made even the worst Halloween installments look like masterpieces. In Carpenter's original as well as in most of the sequels (excluding Halloweens 5 and 6), Michael Myers was a scary as hell, mysterious figure; pure evil in the shape of a man. Zombie ruins Myers' mystique and creepiness by explaining that Michael Myers is simply another result of an abusive childhood. The first half an hour of Zombie's film feel like frickin Dr. Phil's version of Halloween; it's focused on the dysfunctional childhood of Michael. His mother is a stripper, his teenage sister is a skank, his stepfather is an alcoholic verbally-abusive couch potato, and he gets picked on at school -- somehow the idea of pure evil randomly emerging from middle-American averageness was a hell of a lot scarier than the ""fucked up childhood"" psychological profile Zombie had. Zombie turns the monster into some sort of anti-hero we're supposed to be sympathizing for. And sure, it's sometimes fun to cheer along with a villain, but honestly: the way Zombie does it is just plain embarrassing.The characters in this piece of garbage are some of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen in a horror film. Half of them are loud and obnoxious human beings, and half of them are annoying one-note sluts who you want to see picked off the moment they appear on screen. Even Laurie Strode, the main heroine who we are supposed to be sympathizing for, is nothing short of repulsive and loathsome. Not good.Halloween 2007 has atrocious acting, atrocious dialog, so much vulgarity it makes you think it was written by Jerry Springer, and an overload of mindless bloodshed, brutality, and nudity. It's a real shame he totally forgot about the most important element that made Carpenter's original a masterpiece -- suspense and tension. This retread is 35% worthless ""new stuff,"" 15% extra kills and gore (because surely that's what the original Halloween is known for: high body count and gore), and 50% material stolen directly from the source material. Zombie's script boils down to stereotypes, redneck trash, a hippie Dr. Loomis, numerous plot holes, and extreme contradiction.The only thing truly scary about this film is how much of a disaster it is.",Halloween
419,PraiseBOD,Disappointing remake,2,9 June 2017,"Rob Zombie attempts his own version of the horror classic Halloween by John Carpenter. Now I know it is sort of the point that he doesn't make the same film again and that it is only loosely based on it. It's still bad though.The film adds an extensive ""origin-story"" for Michael Myers. This is entirely unnecessary in my opinion. It takes away everything that made the original memorable and interesting: Michael Myers never uttering a single word. Now it doesn't leave much to the imagination: He's a sadistic kid, bullied in school and at home except by his mother. He get's angry enough and kills everyone except his mother (not at home) and his baby sister. In the original, he's a soulless monster that kills without any reason. Here he comes off as a revenge killer in some parts (why he spares his baby sister) but then turns into a ""kill em all"" monster. Then wants to reunite with his sister who he wants to kill again eventually. Also the scene where it shows that he buried his trademark mask and kitchen knife in his home to retrieve it after 15 years is just bad and contrived. The same goes for him using the mask while killing his older sister as a 10 year old.Furthermore, the suspense isn't as good as in the original. The original had a good buildup. This one here is basically just a simple killing spree from the moment Myers escapes. Some key scenes from the original were emulated but are nowhere near as good. The killer isn't that subtle anymore and comes way to close in the ""creeper"" scenes. The kills also happen way too fast compared to the slower and more deliberate first film.Also, the fact that baby Laurie was shown in Michael's childhood years ruins the whole plot. He spares her as a child and then wants to reunite with her after 15 years. Yeah killing all her friends and family is probably a good idea. The original makes more sense: There's a sister he doesn't know about and comes to kill her too.Overall a pretty unnecessary remake in my opinion. Better watch the original. It's shorter and to the point, and overall better written.",Halloween
420,mjsmjs-46362,Polarizing re-imagination of a horror classic,7,20 June 2017,"I'll start by stating whats already been said in numerous reviews of this film....both positive and negative....It's a Rob Zombie film, and you have to know that going into it. This isn't a film for those with weak stomachs. If you aren't familiar with Zombie or his works, both musical and in film, take a little time to research him before watching it so you have a better idea of what you're getting yourself into when you press the ""play"" button on Rob Zombie's homage to John Carpenter's horror landmark. I'll start with the negatives of this film. Zombie, as a filmmaker, labors under a philosophy of ""it's a horror movie, you're not supposed to feel comfortable watching it"" and goes to great lengths to make his audience feel repulsed and horrified. Problem is he takes it too far in a lot of cases. And I'm not talking about the level or intensity of the violence in this film (more on that later...). Rather, the vulgar, sophomoric depravity present in character portrayal, dialogue, and scenarios. The opening scenes show just how dysfunctional young Myers home is. Zombie wants to show what helped create this monster, but his over the top approach is unnecessary here. The mothers boyfriend is a charachterized version of every abusive alcoholic white trash stereotype in the book, making him border on unbelievable. Many other characters have this same treatment inflicted on them, and in all honesty the film does suffer from this. I get what Zombie was trying to do here, show them in a raw, unfiltered manner, but it's overdone. Less would have been more here, and it would have been equally if not more effective. Zombie's style of doing this is what I would imagine turned most viewers off to this film. Zombie wants neither himself nor his films to be accepted as mainstream, he tends to go just a bit too far to ensure that doesn't happen, taking to a forced and transparent extreme in most cases. The Positives... Casting...This film is overall well cast and actors deliver solid, believable performances in their respective roles, many delivering superior performances to their 1978 counterparts. Scout Taylor Compton as Laurie presented her in a manner that I felt created a more well developed, empathetic version than the Jamie Lee Curtis one.Casting Malcolm McDowell was brilliant on Zombie's part, and McDowell's Loomis was superior in every regard to Donald Pleasances droll, deadpan Loomis. The cinematography is a toss up, modern filmmaking practices aided Zombie in this regard.The violence...I find the number of negative criticisms on the level and intensity of the violence present in this film ironic and frankly pretty laughable. It's a horror/slasher film, not only that, it was made by none other than Rob Zombie....what exactly were you expecting? Rob Zombie's type of violence found here is, in my opinion, superior to most other slasher films out there. Modern slasher films are always trying to outdo each other and themselves with a constant evolution of inventive, creative and grisly ways to do victims in. Zombie doesn't resort to this. The violence here is primitive, raw, brutal, savage, and animalistic. Which is exactly what one would expect from a raging psychopath. Nothing creative here, the killer isn't trying to make art, he just rips you to pieces any way he can. This adds a level of realism and believablity to him that most slasher villains lack completely. And this has been one of the polarizing aspects of the movie as well, many loyal to Carpenter's version have been critical of making Myers a plausible human rather than the inhuman embodiment of ""pure evil"" he was in the original movie. Which version you prefer is purely a matter of choice, Carpenter's Myers is the boogeyman...Zombie's is the kid that lives a couple of doors down the street from you. Zombie nailed his appearance too...gone are the clean, pressed coveralls and fresh, unblemished, uniformly colored mask worn by Carpenters Myers, replaced by old, worn, greasy-dirty coveralls and a decaying, cracked and aging mask...creating a much more horrifying visage than his 1978 predecessor. Which one did I find more believable and scary? Zombie's Myers, no contest.Another criticism of Zombie's movie is his use of cliché material. First, I'd challenge any critic to name a single slasher film that isn't filled with them, it's a sub-genre you can only do so much with find the first place. Second, his use of them is as much of a nod to the predecessor film and others of the genre as anything else, I'll cut him some slack here on this issue.The real major difference between the two films is that rather than just drop Myers into the film with a brief flashback scene and a bit of dialoge setting up the backstory, Zombie devotes nearly half his film to it, showing what helped create him and the events leading up to his escape, as well as helping explain some of his motivations. Again, this is a debated aspect of the film in comparison to the original. Personally, I like what Zombie did here, it further humanized the character and made him more scary in my opinion.In conclusion, these are two very different movies. Zombie's version is loyal enough to the original, but more expansive, overall however it lacks the refinement and polish of Carpenter's version. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing....it doesn't make it better or worse, it just creates a different viewing experience than the original one does. If Zombie someday decided to re-release it after some additional editing, spit and polish, maybe omit a few parts of some of the earlier scenes, this film could easily jump up to the next tier in horror movie status. If you're a horror movie fan and you don't mind wandering off the beaten path a little in search of something different, give this one a try.",Halloween
421,mikelepost,Awful,3,16 June 2009,"I saw this wretched remake in the theaters when it came out and hated it, for three main reasons: First, Rob Zombie gives Michael Myers an incredibly clichéd and ridiculous white trash / abusive upbringing. This adds absolutely nothing to the character and in fact de-mystifies the whole story. Nobody really cared what set Myers off - the fact that he had an apparently normal middle class background until he snapped one day was intriguing. The Jerry Springer style background in the remake is unoriginal, silly and just dumb. There was also no need to make Myers out to be a 6'7 bodybuilder.Second, Zombie's grainy visual style did not fit the material. The original Halloween was low budget, but Carpenter's direction was fairly slick. The scuzzy 35mm film stock and meandering camera here might have worked for a remake of a grindhouse classic like Last House on the Left or I Spit on Your Grave, but it's totally at odds with the source material. Zombie seems to have exactly one visual style and that's it.Finally, I usually take for granted the simple things in a movie, like being able to set a shot, show who's standing where, convey action, etc. Then I see a film like Zombie's Halloween remake - a total visual mess almost from start to finish - and realize it must be a lot harder than it looks.Avoid this like the swine flu.",Halloween

Well, you're part right, part wrong. First of all, I like Zombie's movies. I like the House of a 1000 Corpses, and I love The Devil's Rejects. I wondered what would he do with the Halloween remake. I was very curious to see his vision of Michael Myers. Well, I liked it. Not loved it. You know why? Because it's a damn remake, that's why! I love the first 20-25 minutes of this film, it was great I think. I loved the young Michael, even though it was a bit cliché but Zombie handled it pretty well. Then came the movie that we all seen before, except it was gorier and bloodier than in the '70s. But don't get me wrong! I enjoyed the deaths, it was intense and I was thrilled by the end of the movie. It was scary and rough, bloody. Not like the classic Halloween. It's different. I prefer Carpenter's movie of course, but I don't hate this movie as most people do. I can't wait for the sequel, I'm pretty sure that it's gonna be fantastic!",Halloween
423,brooksy241095,Why Rob Zombie? Why?!,3,10 February 2008,"Personally, I don't like remakes, particularly this one. Rob Zombie did a terrible job! He replaced suspense with sex and nudity. The only good point about this movie is Michael's childhood. We witness that he is a tortured soul. Rob Zombie is a good musician and I have nothing against him but I just wish he didn't make this. Also, in this movie, Michael isn't as strong. Dr Loomis shot him 3 times in the back with a small gun and it took him ages to get up, in the original, he was shot 6 times with a big handgun and he fell off of a balcony and it took him about 10 seconds to get up. At the end, the police force shot him with handguns more than 20 times and he was dead, at the end of Halloween 4, he was shot by the police force with machine guns and shotguns and fell down a mine shaft and still survived.

426,patricklewallen,Let's Consider All Elements,3,27 January 2008,"Go into this movie expecting it to surpass the original and you will find yourself very disappointed. However, go into the movie without any expectations or comparisons, and you might be surprised by some of the strengths Rob Zombie put forth in his vision. Before anything else, let's get to the complaints. As expected from a Zombie film, the gore was beyond obscene. The beauty of the first Halloween was the simplicity of the plot over the unnecessary gore. This movie did NOT follow the same motto. Secondly, I found each episode of nudity to be entirely uncalled for. It was a typical, desperate attempt to gain the interest of adolescent boys. Guess what - I'm a twenty-two year old male, and it did nothing for me but cause an eye roll each time and take away from the power of the story. Cut the nudity. Very VERY rarely is it ever necessary in a film. Realize that. Finally, the story is entirely different from the original Halloween. The little Michael Meyers has a powerful role in this movie, and he gives an above average performance. The language was a tad overly vulgar for me in scenes, but that can be overlooked as the movie progresses. I give the movie a 6.5 out of 10, but wouldn't recommend putting it on the top of your list. It was alright though. Watch the original for a horror movie. Rating = C-",Halloween

I know Laurie is the main character in this movie, but I feel like Michael is the main character because we like spent the first 30 minutes of this film with Michael. I do like how Zombie gives Micheal character in this movie, but it was a bit scarier giving Michael no motivation because it made him feel like a killer with no reason but to kill. And Laurie kind of comes off as an a@#hole in this movie. Although later on it does get better near the final act. Malcolm McDowell does give a solid performance and Danielle Harris is decent. On a positive for Laurie, she is funny in one part. The story is OK. OK film, but Rob Zombie should fix his mistakes if he makes another reboot. C+",Halloween
430,ozlifter,Zombie's version is a mixed bag.,6,1 September 2007,"I'm a little torn on this one. I think the last half of Zombie's, which is a straightforward remake of the '78 version, improves upon the original, which was pretty overrated in my opinion. But the first 30 minutes of Zombie's version left a bad taste in my mouth. I thought it started off way too violent, and the characters used so much bad language that it seemed unnatural and ended up being distracting.Also, I just didn't like the addition of Zombie's lengthy backstory. I think Carpenter did it right back in '78 when he left a lot of Michael's history to the imagination. I liked how in the original Meyers came from a seemingly normal family. Here in Zombie's version, though, his family is so messed up, they drive him to becoming a killer.I think the acting in Zombie's film is better. Scout Taylor-Compton plays Laurie Strode much better than Jamie Lee Curtis ever did. Malcolm McDowell's okay too as Loomis, even though Zombie saddles him with some unfortunate hair for the first half of the movie. And Zombie's wife does a good job, even though I wish her entire storyline had been left out of the film.Another problem is that Zombie made Michael a little too big, almost comically big. I liked that he just seemed like a normal-sized guy in the original. It made him more scary to me.If you liked the original, you might want to check this out. But I didn't quite like it enough to recommend it",Halloween
431,forecastfortoday,The Destruction of a Classic,4,8 February 2010,"John Carpenter's Halloween is the Citizen Kane of horror movies. Everybody who watches movies already knows that. So, what Rob Zombie did was take the original movie, added a bogus back story, made the characters more stereotypical and obnoxious, added nearly twenty death scenes of characters that had nothing to do with the plot in the first place, and flavored the entire plot with a redneck subplot. Did I like the idea of Halloween being remade? Of course not, but did I think it had some potential? I certainly did. Honestly, this was the first movie I saw that had been directed by Rob Zombie and since I knew Halloween was the perfect slasher movie I had thought that there was no possible way it could've gotten screwed up. When I went to the theater to see the movie, I turned out to be wrong as hell.While the original movie starts out with a five minute prologue of little Michael Myers killing his sister, this movie expands the prologue into a twenty minute back story about how trashy and terrible Michael's childhood is which gives him his motive. After this gratuitously long back story scene, we are finally introduced to the film's heroine, Laurie Strode. Now, in the original Halloween Laurie is a shy, bookish, and alert girl but in the remake Laurie acts a lot trashier and vulgar in which she does things like fingering bagels, making pedophile jokes, and picking on the kids she babysits. The scenes of Michael stalking Laurie aren't exactly bad, some of them being genuinely suspenseful. So night comes and after about thirty murder scenes of characters that don't really matter to the story anyways, Michael comes after Laurie. Admittedly, the chase scenes between Laurie and Michael are actually pretty strong and even kind of scary to an extent. While the confrontation between Laurie and Michael is a little bit shorter and more to-the-point in the original, the remake takes the conflict between Laurie and Michael and makes it more of a cat-and-mouse game where Michael hunts through Haddonfield searching for his sister. The ending is pretty much the same, with an exception of Laurie going into a screaming fit that would rival the demented laughing of Sally Hardesty in Texas Chainsaw Massacre after she 'kills' Michael.Honestly, this movie is worthless until the ending comes around. Scout-Taylor Compton is fine as Laurie, but the way her character was drawn out and written out was dreadful. The acting is top notch to be quite honest, but I would much rather watch a movie with an original plot with bad acting than watch a 're-imagining' with good acting. I would never say this is the worst Halloween movie ever made, this movie is nearly as abysmal as Halloween: Resurrection or the sequel following this movie. Honestly, this remake could've been great had it been directed better without the white trash back story and the badly developed characters. The original had much more mystique and class with likable characters and a better build up. This one had an unsuccessful back story, unlikable characters, and a build up formulated of an asshole redneck picking on his stepson.",Halloween

433,innersmiff,Not really sure...,3,5 May 2009,"Where Zombie was going with this one. Halloween (the remake) is a film which doesn't really know how to deal with itself and ends up being a tad boring.I watched the original and the remake for the first time this month and I have to say, although not overwhelmed by the original, it is scarier and much more enjoyable. I think the fact that we are pretty much revealed everything all the way through (in the remake) takes away the impact. Nothing is left to the imagination, neither the back story or the violence. Nearly half of the film had passed, I was still watching ""back story"" and I was beginning to wonder whether the original plot involving Laurie was in it. Is the long sequence in the institute really necessary? It was rather depressing to say the least and took away the mystery of the character. Now I know everything there is to know about Michael, I really don't care anymore! Despite all that, it turns out that Laurie is indeed in the film, made slightly more sexual, less masculine but also incredibly annoying (the scene with the bagel.....what was that about?). The story from then on is just drab, packed full of cliché and whatnot. I find it difficult to recommend to horror fans as it really isn't very scary, neither do you feel sympathy or shock or any other emotion for that matter.Good things? I suppose the violence in the first part was graphic enough and slightly disturbing but in the whole scheme of things, the characters had so little development I didn't care for long.3/10",Halloween

He made Big Trouble in Little China (one of my absolute favorite movies to watch with Dad), The Thing (that's how you do a friggin' remake), and the ultimate slasher flick, Halloween.Before this movie was released, Hollywood had already remade the stubbornly independent Carpenter films The Fog and Assault on Precinct 13. At first I thought, ""okay. Good movies but not Carpenter's best. I'm fine with remaking those."" I never in a million years thought they would remake Halloween. 12 more sequels sure, but never an attempt to recreate the classic original. Boy was I wrong and boy were they wrong for making it.Christopher Nolan is oft credited with redefining the comic book movie with The Dark Knight. I agree with that statement and I'm willing to go one step further and say he first redefined the remake or reboot first with Batman Begins. After that 2005 release it seemed every remake and reboot made had to include an origin story for the character. This is where Rob Zombie really fails with his take on Michael Myers.First of all, horror villains don't need an origin story, least of all Michael Myers. One of the things that make a good horror villain is not really knowing anything about the killer. All you really need to know is how to kill him. Rob Zombie gives us the ""backstory"" of Michael Myers' insanity with this remake. I have several problems with this first act of the movie.In the original, you get the feeling that this kid just snapped one night and killed his sister. This remake ups the initial body count by having Michael kill his sister, her boyfriend, his mom's boyfriend, and the local bully. And through his environment at both home and school and how these people treat him, Zombie would have you believe one of the most iconic horror villains was born out of simply being white trash. It almost seems as if Zombie wants you to sympathize with Michael as this part of the movie progresses.They continue with this attempt at sympathy by showing Michael's time in the psychiatric hospital and his relationship with Dr. Sam Loomis (played greatly by Malcolm McDowell, probably the only thing better about this remake, no disrespect to Donald Pleasance.) All this accomplishes is bloating the run time and messes up the pacing of the story. Once again, Zombie tries to justify Michael's insanity when he kills a nurse for being bitchy to him. If that justified murder, there would be about 200 people left in the world. Then all of that sympathy is completely washed away when he kills the only person who treated him with respect, the immortal Danny Trejo.Wow, all of that and now we're finally getting to the actual story of the movie. So now Michael has escaped and is on his way to Haddonfield. It's at this point of the movie that we meet the spunky, charismatic, goofy Laurie Strode. Doesn't sound familiar? That's probably because she is the EXACT OPPOSITE of the original character. Laurie Strode's character and Jamie Lee Curtis' performance did what a lot of modern horror movies forget to do, make you care and root for the main character! I almost wanted Laurie to die first as I found Scout Taylor-Compton's performance flat out annoying.And it only gets worse from there. My main problem with this movie is it just isn't scary. I'm sorry, it's not. I've watched the original at least a dozen times in my life (I watch it every Halloween night) and it STILL scares the crap out of me. Zombie does a good job with the nostalgia factor by casting actors such as McDowell as Loomis along with supporters Ken Foree and Brad Dourif but fails almost everywhere else. The score is the ultimate horror theme and the modernization of that is off putting.But for me, the ultimate sin of this movie is the ending. Laurie has a gun pressed right into Michael's head, she pulls the trigger and her face gets blasted with blood. I thought, ""well at least Zombie knew better than to set up a sequel."" No. They made a really, REALLY bad sequel to this awful remake. There are some good moments in this movie, it's actually one of the less worse modern horror remakes, but the original is so dear to my heart that I can't forgive what they attempted to do with this.If you haven't seen the original I would like to welcome you to civilization, we entertain ourselves sometimes by watching movies and that is one you should definitely see. This remake, like EVERY JOHN CARPENTER REMAKE, should not be watched because it's flat out insulting to the original. This movie might be fine on it's own if you haven't seen the original, but why eat ramen noodles when you can enjoy prime rib? You want a good horror remake? Watch Carpenter's The Thing.4 out of 10",Halloween
436,rpannier,When trailer park trash result in movie trash,2,5 September 2009,"This movie had the most useless array of characters possible, with everyone more idiotic than the other. In this retelling, Michael is an animal torturer/murderer turned serial killer.His family is something out of a pathetically bad perverted comic. Malcolm McDowell completely wastes his talent on the Loomis role. The rest of the characters have as much depth as a shallow puddle and are as interesting as watching someone put a label on a deodorant stick.What I learned from this movie: 1. Mental hospitals allow homicidal killer use real metal forks when they eat. 2. Mental hospitals do not require their patients to shower. 3. Mental hospitals allow their patients to have filthy rooms. 4. Mental hospitals allow their patients to make hundreds of gruesome masks and hang them in their room. 5. Maximum security mental hospitals have a staff of one at night in a hallway with extremely dangerous patients. 6. These same hospitals have staff members that could barely graduate middle school that work with and taunt dangerous mental patients.7. When confronted by a murderous psycho, a police officer will only fire their weapon 1 time.8. In Haddonfield, teenagers often slaughter coyotes, cut them open, hang them set them in front of the grave of a woman nicknamed 'Satan's Mother.' And they steal her headstone. All as a Halloween prank.The things that hurt this movie the most are 1. Trying to give Michael a reason for the way he is weakens the suspense. It's far scarier when you see it happen with a nice, well adjusted solid middle class family because if it could happen to them, it could happen to anyone. 2. The first Halloweens focus on the stalking by Michael made for a better movie. 3. The hick, trailer trash characters turn the movie from a tight suspenseful movie, into a silly comedic farce. 4. The first movie had a group of interesting characters -- this had none.5. The scene where he holds her in the house is just dull and it fails in providing an suspense. No one believes he's going to get her, so there's no suspense.6.In the end when Michael comes back to attack her again, after having been shot carries no real shock value. It's just a lame excuse to keep the movie going for a few more minutes.7. There is no continual suspense throughout the movie to draw you in and keep your attention. The suspense is like watching a 5 minute video followed by a few commercials followed by another 5 minute cartoon.This movie went for stupid and it seems to have nailed it. Before you defend this piece of trash by saying, ""It's a movie."" I agree -- it is. A really crappy movie",Halloween
437,jasonklingensmith,Doesn't do the original justice...,6,10 April 2009,"I was very disappointed by this film. While it was watchable and entertaining, I thought it actually hurt the Michael Myers story. One of the scariest and most suspenseful things was not understanding why Michael Myers was the way he was, why he killed his sister at such a young age. The fact that he was a seemingly normal kid who just kind of freaked out was part of what made him scary. The back story of him as a kid, living in a broken household, with an abusive step dad almost makes you understand why he flipped out in the first place, and it's almost as though you're supposed to feel sorry for him. Also, Rob Zombie's style, which is more about gore and excessive in-your-face violence, doesn't fit the Halloween/Michael Myers mold. The series was built on suspense, fear of the unknown. Rob Zombie's version ruined that.",Halloween
438,wesleywisejr,A WiseGuy's Review: Fans of the original will LOVE this movie - A MUST SEE!!,10,31 August 2007,"I'm a 24 year-old die hard fan of the Halloween franchise, and was amped about this movie ever since I first heard about it. My expectations were pretty high since this is pretty much a remake and it looked great from the previews. Man, I was not disappointed!!! The beginning parts of the movie with young Myers are excellent, definitely what the original was lacking. It didn't drag on to me at all and was very interesting to watch. The second half of the movie is basically a remake of the original with a bunch of new twists and deaths.All in all it was an awesome flick with WAY more deaths and gore than the original. (I seriously think the death total is up around 15+) My only complaints are the 3 girls including Laurie. All 3 of the actresses were slutty and annoying. But casting the niece from Halloween 4 + 5 was definitely a nice touch. Original music, Loomis was great, and Myers was great too. It really did the original justice, and in some ways was even better. My only complaint was that there was not nearly enough of the theme songs used which is the main reason these movies are scary.Anyone who didn't like this movie obviously didn't like the Halloween series to begin with. I hope they make a 100 more of these movies, I will always go see them!! Definitely worth the price of admission!",Halloween
439,TheBigSnack,Michael Myers: Force of Nature?,9,14 December 2015,"Michael Myers must live victoriously immediately following the sudden materialization of Dr. Loomis, who is prepared to take full charge of a child who has developed a secret life of ritual sacrifice.Dr. Samuel Loomis in his final closed silent interview with Myers states he is leaving Myers and can no longer justify their relationship. This seems to reflect that Dr. Loomis was more prepared to personify a role model or guide a relationship than to officiate a professional therapy. However, Dr. Loomis is later shown to have a share in some duplicity when he undertakes a questionable new adventure as celebrity writer. His subject: former patient Michael Myers.After 15 years of sitting in a cell his world has chosen to cross the line in making itself known as a terrible loss.Perhaps an even darker question is could Dr. Loomis be secretly behind it all by experimentally letting all hell break loose?In Halloween Michael Myers fights for his freedom in response to surreptitious statements of aggression that lead Michael to don the mask of a poker-face.Halloween is Michael's quintessential power game as he in turn proves that 364 days of Halloween plus 1 makes all the difference in the world.Thrilling blood thirst and gore ensues with an ending that is passionately brutal and satisfying!The question: Is Michael a mere person or a force of nature?Philosophically a dictatorship is not impossible to detect, though it may try to parallel freedom it never does allow freedom: How are innocuous freedoms reflected in the lives of others if appearances do not reflect true life? The answer is that people are fundamentally cheated, and this is a hallmark of the dictatorship. True freedom only occurs when someone who is actually free chooses to act.",Halloween
440,SampanMassacre,Too Much Blood,3,24 February 2010,"Rob Zombie serves up human beings as fodder, most of them so overly vapid, annoying or evil they're just begging to die. The legendary Michael Myers gets a forty-five minute back-story as a little boy who's about as creepy as Jodie Foster in those old Coppertone ads. He's picked on by bullies, has a stripper mom and a white trash cliché-spouting step-father, and eventually goes on a killing spree, gets locked up in an insane asylum, and fifteen years later resembles Cousin It on steroids. He breaks out after slaughtering more deserving-victims, returns to the dilapidated house of his youth, dons his trusty (and iconic) William Shatner mask, and like the John Carpenter film in which this is based: wanders the suburbs in search of his long-long sister. Malcom McDowell's Dr. Loomis is a greedy capitalist who, after having treated Myers for years, pens a best-seller and becomes like a double-agent in an CIA film: find Myers or lose everything. And the character Laurie Strode, the focal-point of the original, is but a side-character as her banal friends, all written to be massacred with no interesting or memorable personality traits (each spouting forgettable filler dialog), become more pudding in the pie. How many times can one stab a human being, and how is this scary? Rob knows a thing or two about shock and gore, but doesn't build an eerie enough stage to merit genuine (implied) horror. Too much lightning without thunder.",Halloween

442,causeiwantto2001,"Stands apart from the others, and could restart franchise.",9,30 August 2007,"I was very excited about seeing this film, and nervous at the same time. If your going to see this film, it's best to expect a different type of Michael Myers, and also a very different impression of the eyes behind the mask. I found it hard to take it in, as it was happening. For me Michael Myers was a body of evil, without reason, or soul, and if that's what you want in this Michael, then don't see this movie. This Michael doesn't hide, and wait. This Michael is angry, and could care less what time it is, or who you are. His kills are understandable, and all the victims have a great deal in common with people from his childhood. Rob Zombie delivered a fantastic movie, and managed to explain many of the little questions many may have been left with in the original. I was very glad that the whole explaining the childhood, and seeing post Judith's death didn't hurt the character of Michael. He is very different then 1978 Michael, but Zombie has found a new way of keeping Michael mysterious. Instead of why is he killing, I was left with the question why isn't he killing. That question is almost as scary as a masked man killing without rhyme or reason. Daeg was a great choice, as was Malcolm McDowell, but the only character that was over the top, in my opinion was William Forsythe's Ronnie. They could have toned him down a few levels. This is a great movie for younger horror fans, but we all know that those that feel they ""know' Michael, may hate it (many haters are on this board already) If your open minded to a reinvention, then you'll enjoy this. If you want old Michael Myers, then stay home. This one is equally scary, but this one is a sort of victim himself.",Halloween
443,rexdaugherty,Rob Zombie's Halloween I loved it,10,1 October 2010,To me this one of my favorite horror remakes since The Texas Chainsaw Masscre (2003)I read a lot of other reviews that complain about the back story. I like the back story I mean come on people would you want a filmmaker like Rob Zombie to continue with the thorn back story or the one from Halloween Resurrection. Another complaint I noticed is its redneck white trash horror well only a small portion of the film once Michael is in the institution the redneck white trash stuff is pretty much over. Another thing I like about this one it does have a 70's feel to it just like Robs other films house of 1000 corpses and the devil's reject's however I don't find anymore better than the original Halloween it depends on your mood which one your watch if if you want a movie that leaves more to your imagination you'd watch the original if you want a blood bath where you see everything or more of it you'd watch this one,Halloween
444,bobfingerman,I Hate to be a Hater...,1,17 May 2009,"...but this was rubbish.Though Zombie's adept at creating it, relentless unpleasantness doesn't necessarily translate to compelling horror. The interminable opening 45-minutes of prologue (seriously), in which the audience is treated to Michael Myers's origin story, is dull, ugly and above all misses the point. This and the equally futile (and terrible) remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" make the mistake of adding wretched back-stories to their killers. In Carpenter's classic, in every way superior original, the enigmatic engine that propels Myers is precisely what makes him so scary. His motivation is pure evil. That's enough.The ugly family life in the 2007 version bogs things down and does what? Make Myers sympathetic? No. All it does is set up an improbable and somewhat annoying ""twist"" that doesn't pay off in the third act. Zombie knows how to do unpleasant. It's his forte as a filmmaker. What he doesn't know how to do is create likable characters. The trio of girls in this are cyphers, even (especially) Laurie Strode.This remake was unnecessary, tedious and a waste of time.",Halloween
445,timb75,"Love, hate with a white trash luster",4,14 June 2008,"This film is a bastardizing of an American horror classic. I'm a big fan of Rob Zombie but there are certain things you shouldn't mess with. Halloween being one of them. This film wreaks the original Halloween story. In humanizing Michael, it forces you to look at him in a completely different light. Plus the stories seem to be somewhat contradictory. If you haven't seen a Rob Zombie film before well you're in for a white trash smut treat. Seriously, any chance he gets he's throwing in a raunchy joke, a stripper and a good old fashion white trash fight worthy of Jerry Springer. On the other hand this story in it's self is great. It takes you deep into the mind of a future serial killer. That being said, anyone who hasn't seen the original Halloweens may enjoy this movie more then a die hard fan. To a die hard fan though this movie is heartbreaking. The stalking that makes Michael so great is just plain lame in this one. The kills are too quick and unappealing. The camera angles and lighting are crap compared to the original film. Newcomers to Halloween beware. This is not the film to base your liking of Halloween on. If you want to have the true Halloween experience pick up one of the original films from the 70's-80's. If you must watch this movie don't associate it with the Halloween series.",Halloween
446,jmayer2009,Could of been amazing!,6,10 June 2010,"I love the original film. It is a major classic thats still enjoyable today. When I first seen the trailer for the remake, I was so excited. It looked really good from the preview. But the final product did not turn out so well. This is actually a review of the directors cut of the film since i didn't see the theater version. So here we go: The movie starts out with a nice shot of Micheal Myers house. Then we see Micheal about to kill his rat, which was kinda creepy. But after this, the movie goes from good to bad in a matter of a few seconds. Micheal's family is now introduced. The family comes off to be the most white trash family on the face of the earth. The mom is a stripper, the mom's boyfriend is a lazy ass cripple, and the daughter comes off as a disrespectful teenage brat. This isn't a Halloween movie. The language used in this scene is also very disgusting.You pretty much know what happens after this. Micheal kills his sister, his sisters boyfriend, and his moms abusive boyfriend. This was pretty much the highlight of the movie. This scene is very brutal and is very creepy and nasty. Exactly what horror should be like. I hated the characters introduced in the beginning except for the mom and Micheal. I could care less about the others.After that, Micheal is put into a mental hospital and we see him deal with a lot of boring crap. Then it skips a good amount of years until Micheal is now a tall troll will long ratty hair. The next scene is what got to me the most. Micheal is in his room making masks when suddenly some security guards come in with a female patient and rape her right in front of Micheal. This scene was so unneeded and so out of place. It was disgusting garbage. I know the theater version didn't have this scene but i will always know that Rob Zombie thought this scene would of been good in the final cut. You know the whole story after that. It pretty much just is about Micheal killing people close to his sister Laurie. OH MY GOD...Shocker! All in all, i really didn't like this film. If Rob Zombie hadnt of made the first half of the movie a backstory about Micheal, then i probably would of really liked this movie. Rob tried to make us feel sorry for Micheal and i don't like that. A few things were okay though. The music was really good and the acting was decent. The good things in this movie could not save it from being bad though.",Halloween

This movie is really only for Zombie fans, and die hard horror fans. So don't watch this movie expecting a good horror movie like The Shining. Michael's back story was played out very well, and very violent. The acting was top notch from everyone. The second half of the movie may nit be as good as the first half was, but it is still good. It perfectly has everything anyone can want in a horror film and more. The cast was great, and there awesome cameos from William Forsythe, Danny Trejo, and even Sheri Moon Zombie. The suspense in this movie was excellent. One of my favorite, if not my favorite scene in the movie, would have to be the ending. Extremely suspenseful, and shot extremely well, jut like most of the movie. I was on the edge of my seat every time Laurie pulled the trigger, then all of a sudden, SNATCH!! BANG!!! Awesome. A lot of people may argue that it's nothing like the original, and that it's just a lot of white trash. *sigh* I guess some people can't accept Zombie's style. Whatever. I say give it a go.

448,RockGrey,Good Beginning Becomes A Poor Last Half !,6,1 November 2008,"I must say that I really wanted to see this film for four reasons. First, Rob Zombie has real talent as an entertainer regardless of what format his story-telling takes place. Second, this is a Halloween movie which means that of course I wanted to see it to find out how Michael Myers is portrayed. Third, there is Danielle Harris in one of her few returns to a big budget film in recent years. Fourth, I really hoped this would add up to a good film precisely for the above three reasons. The problem was that it was an extremely mixed bag for me. The first hour was excellent for the precise reason why some people question the original movies. Little is shown in those films as to why Michael does what he does. Some hint is given, which the sequels expand on quite well, but some expansion is necessary due to John Carpenters' lack of explanation. This film spends much of the first hour providing that explanation. As such I loved that portion of the movie. Learning why Michael Myers turned out to be a - with all apologies to Robert Bloch et al - psycho was a valuable story. However, everything after the scenes right up to the first scenes with Laurie Strode played by Scout Taylor-Compton are a disappointment, and the reason is that there is no characterization on the part of the young woman. Even in the original "" Halloween "" ( 1978 ) before the television material was added had a lot of scenes and dialogue and behaviour showing them as characters we could relate to. In this film, they are not that much more than stereotypes - Linda as bitchy cheerleader, Annie as the supportive best friend, and Laurie as the reliable girl next door. Stereotypes by themselves are not bad as long as they are made into good characters. That does not happen much here. As well the characters of Tommy and Lindsay and even Dr. Loomis are given shorter thrift in the film in its' last half in particular due to fewer scenes showing them learning of the mysteries of the day ( eg. Tommy isn't bullied at school, Dr. Loomi is never shown investigating Michael Myers childhood home, etc. ). All told it serves as a good character piece for Michael Myers - Daeg Faerch is terrific as the 10-year-old Michael Myers, and Tyler Mane is appropriately vicious as the adult Michael Myers. As a set piece for horror where the story overall is sufficiently well told to be regarded as a classic to match the original, it does have a serious weakness, and that is that it weakens over time rather than building to the crescendo that the original did. That is not to say that the performers did not do a good job with what they had as I believe the acting was all good especially in the case of the leads. It is just that they did not have as much good material to work with as they could have which means while "" Halloween "" fans may enjoy it they will likely not regard it as the best film in the saga.",Halloween
449,worldriot,"Rob Zombie - You ruined my childhood, you selfish little man.",4,7 September 2007,"And so it goes that Rob Zombie, great horror mastermind and irrelevant metal vocalist, takes on one of my personal favorites in the Hollywood horror genre and promptly reduces it to the value of a single piece of dog feces.I rated this film a 4 not because it had much value, but that I simply could not bring myself to give it the rating it truly deserves - a zero. The film starts off in decent fashion, giving us insight into the mind of the childhood Michael Myers, yet the film fails to explain why exactly this background is even relevant. All I know is that the little kid cast as Michael in the film looked like he did more drugs than Sheri Moon, who played his mother. That's a lot of drugs. The only scenes he didn't looked completely stoned in were scenes in which he inexplicably appeared to gain 75 pounds in his face. An odd phenomenon, and one of the few pseudo-interesting things happening in this movie.Aside from the blubber-faced stoner kid, we are treated to a girl cast as the heroine who literally begs the audience to hate her. The person who actually did the casting for this film must have had serious drug/alcohol issues to cast the little punk Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie in this film. Not only does she display the single most annoying voice in the history of horror cinema, her character is one that I actually WANTED to see get beaten repeatedly with a blunt instrument. Her acting ""skills"" aside, her dress, her appearance, her character lines...all simply cried out ""Please Michael, kill me for the pleasure of the audience"". Unfortunately, like so many things in this movie, that wish is not delivered as Laurie survives through the entirety of this travesty of a film.Terrible cast aside, let's look at key scenes that were omitted. The classic laundry room scene, the equally compelling scene where Tommy sees the ""Boogey Man"" carrying his victim around the neighboring house as he stares out the window....these classic scenes are totally gone. Scenes from the original that Rob did remake in the film are pointless, almost pathetic in their attempts to top the original scenes. And the fact that the film establishes Laurie is Michaels sister from the get-go is a terrible idea that completely erases the creepy ""randomness"" of Michaels attacks.In closing, if you want to see a classic horror film, see the original Halloween. If you want to see a classic horror film get completely raped and pillaged, see Rob Zombies Halloween.",Halloween

This movie tries to rationalize Michael Myers violent behavior to a very traumatic back story. He kills because he has had a difficult childhood. Pretty thin plot based on those rules many people have had similar upbringing and haven't turned homicidal it's as if it justifies his behavior.Movie lacks style with excessive violence replacing real scares. The Laurie Strode character is annoying in this remake you want Myers to kill her so you aren't subjected to 20 minutes of hearing her scream. It's really that annoying I know the producers care less about quality and only green light it because it's a proven formula.

To add sadistic violence and gore is my guess. I don't mind gore in any way, but this movie had not a single scary moment to me.

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!",1,3 September 2007,"I've only ever walked out of two movies in my entire life, and both of them were directed by this useless hack Rob Zombie. The ONLY reason I attempted this film is because I am such a fan of the original and good horror films in general. This was such an awful movie, I was offended to have wasted the better part of an hour an a half daydreaming and dosing during its run.I knew I was in trouble when from the start the amount of vulgar language used was literally every other word of dialog. I also knew it was going down the toilet when everyone, including the early version of Loomis, had long 'metal dude' hair. It was all such a bad joke. The attempted back story to Michael was juvenile and ridiculous. Then seeing Michael as an adult, I couldn't help but think of Chewbacca. By this point I was taking cat naps.Rather than go on and on about how godawful this disastrous piece of crap is, I will just tell you that by the time of the bazillionth scene of a shaking camera following the Strode girl's endless screaming, this time into an empty swimming pool, I had to get up and leave. I was smart enough to only pay a matinée fee, though still stupid enough to think there would be anything worth redeeming from this mess.Rob Zombie is a talentless waste of space, and the fact that people pay him for the worthless films he makes is amazing to me. If you like loads of bad language, sex in dirt and insect-ridden environments, bad acting, bad dialog, then you are a proud Rob Zombie fan. How pathetic. The world is going to give crap like this remake millions, yet a true horror classic, such as 'Session 9', has only a cult following.",Halloween
457,kt3234-1,Carpenter's was better,2,24 December 2008,"Rob Zombie, I believe, is an untalented filmmaker who re-imagines things to their utmost extreme in order to give the audience a cheap scare, and I mean REALLY cheap scares.First off, Michael should not be presented with a back story. Carpenter presented Michael as an absolute--we know almost nothing about him, save that he was incarcerated in a mental institution and escaped to kill Laurie Strode in Haddonfield. No more explanation was needed. Michale was creepier without a back-story, and it presented him as a more evil character with even stranger motives. The audience is unsure exactly why Michale is trying to kill Laurie Strode, but we were only told to watch, and we enjoyed Carpenter's version.Zombie, on the other hand, likes to think too much. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but a thought keeps coming up in my head that says Zombie got the inspiration for Michael's back-story just sitting around and trying to think of the most gruesome ways to turn the boy into a murderer. In a way, Zombie is sympathetic to Michael, and it makes the audience feel for the boy, something they should never do with Michale Myers.The back-story, though I wouldn't call it much of one, has Michael living with an abusive step-father and a slutty sister, who gets killed after sleeping with her boyfriend. After House of 1,000 Corpses and its sequel, I feel Zombie is only good at thinking up THESE scenarios, and it makes his movies very painful to watch.The horrid casting of Malcolm McDowell (might be an error on spelling) cheapens the character of Sam Loomis, a role fully expressed by the late Donald Pleasance. It seems this piece of casting was just so fan boy Zombie could get a look at the aging actor who frightened us so deeply in Kubrick's Clockwork Orange. The same can be said of Ken Foree (the man in the truck stop stall whom Michale kills), who worked in George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead. I felt Loomis should be presented as an American character, not British. I have no qualms with McDowell as an actor, but his performance does not fit here.All in all, the cheap set up of one of America's most beloved serial killers is wasted by it's cheapness of character casting, dialogue, and overall plot arch. It is not for the faint of heart in terms of Michael Myers' fans, but rather for the idiotic buffoon who would rather watch style over substance.2/10",Halloween
458,diglers69,Disappointment...,1,13 September 2007,"Well... where should I start?I was really excited when I heard about this remake coming out! Did I like it? No! And here are the reasons:1) It claims to be a remake, but it's a totally different story! 2) It ain't a whole new concept though, because the original Halloween plot is used (and in a pretty bad way).. 3) It's SO not scary.. It can hardly be called a horror movie! 4) The pr-story about Michaels childhood is SO cheese and naive (it could have been a good drama, but it's not, because of trashy dialogs and cheep storyline) 5) I got bored in the middle of the movie. 6) If you make a remake, you risk with everyone going to compare it with the original, and in this case the Carpenters movie is so much better!So, it ain't a horror movie and it' ain't a drama! You can't even call it a thriller! Just a week film, Zombie made, 'cause we all know he loves horror classics (just as much as we all do)! House Of 1000 Corpses was really great (allthough it's much of TCM concept used in it), still it's amazingly fresh and creepy! Halloween was not! Sorry, Rob~ 3 out of 10!",Halloween
459,benmcfee,This is the way re-makes SHOULD be done,8,6 May 2008,"I have seen both of director Rob Zombie's earlier flicks, and I was, frankly, unimpressed. It was clear that everyone involved with these films was having a good time, but it was at the audience's expense. So naturally, when I saw this film in the theatres, I expected more of the same: unpleasant, badly acted (on purpose, I imagine, but still), and thoroughly sadistic. I was surprised, and delighted. I have to say, this is probably (dare I say it) even better than the original Halloween - which was a masterpiece in its own right. Here's why:Zombie has developed every character in this show. He dwells on the early part of Michael Myers's life, taking ample time to show us the abusive environment he was raised in, and his early psychopathic tendencies (torturing animals to begin with, moving up to bullies at school, and finally, his alcoholic, abusive father and his neglectful sister). We also see, from the people he doesn't kill (his mother and his infant sister), that he didn't start off as a complete psycho. He was lashing out at the things that made him feel powerless. Then, in steps the law, locks him up and, once again, the power is gone. So Michael simply shuts down.From this, we understand exactly why he becomes the empty psychopath that he is described as being in the original film. To me, this is what makes this all the more scary. You can't reason with him, because the only experiences he's ever had with people have been terrible ones, which explains his absolute contempt for human life. This is the key to a good horror movie: the feeling of utter helplessness. If you ran into Myers in this film, there would be no question that he could, and would, kill you. Rob Zombie knew that there was more to this character than we'd been previously allowed to see, and he knew that it was scary as hell. He hasn't done what so many other people before him have done with re-makes, and simply used an old title to sell a schlock film. He has literally re-MADE the masterpiece, and remained true to every part of it: the scary and the cheesy. All faith in him, that I had once lost, has been restored, and then some.",Halloween

I was all willing to let MY Halloween go and just watch and accept but NO. I had a serious problem with the muddled and confusing take on Michael Myers. It upset me and frustrated me that he was not given his respect and was made into a mere mortal. Im sorry, the suspense and mystery was taken away and he stood naked in front of me and Im not okay with what was shown to me. I wasn't scared. I wasn't held in suspense. It wasn't the scariest movie moment to me. It was laughs. It was awkward moments that didn't flow well. I did not like this film, and dammit, I wanted to. Im upset. I feel the director was not clear on his vision. He didn't know what he wanted and I felt the great disconnecct. Damnnit!!! I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Im upset.

Or at least tries to when I saw this horror film the craziest and most interesting but not a good twist to the movie was first off Rob Zombie says he tried to pitch it and picture it as two movies but in my opinion it felt like three movies jammed together you have Young Michael Myers in the sanitarium and in the beginning of the movie you have Adult Michael Myers in the film in the sanitarium and he escapes and then you have Adult Michael Myers returning to haddonfield. To much information in one movie After you see this film you won't be scared of the original anymore if you see this movie you'll know all the secrets and all of the information of Michael myers nothing's kept untold in the remake of Halloween it all unfolds when he's a child and a when's an adult. This film wasn't horrible or terrible it could've been worse it wad okay but not in my top five movie catigory in my top ten or top eleven yes. It was just average nothing great in the movie theater not good enough DVD it's a okay for. See it then on DVD. For overall rating I give Halloween 2007 5 stars.,Halloween
462,mullen1979,This is a scary movie,10,29 August 2020,"This is a Rob Zombie film and is definitely not for the squeamish or easily disturbed. It definitely steps out of the more pure and innocent story telling vibe of the 1978 original and I believe that's a primary reason it gets a lot of hate. But again, it is a Rob Zombie movie and one should expect nothing less of an exhausting blood soaked, covering the eyes nightmare of a horror movie experience.
Whereas in the original HALLOWEEN, Michael Myers is portrayed as a force of evil with little explanation, the 2007 entry brings about a reinvented story of Michael Myers with a lot of back story and explaining his decent into madness. A viewer must remember, the 1978 original and the 2007 remake are completely different movies. 2007 is simply ones own reimagining of a legendary tale.
Zombie takes the storyline of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode that was established in both 1978's HALLOWEEN and 1981's HALLOWEEN II and combines them both into one cohesive story.
There are many throwbacks (love notes if you will) to John carpenter's original. It's a gritty movie in contrast to 1978's squeaky clean presentation. It's raw, unapologetic, disturbing and very scary.",Halloween
463,MJohnsontalker,"Behind the eyes of this director one finds only blackness, the absence of any talent to remake this movie.",1,1 September 2007,"I think my Summary pretty much sums it up but I feel I should go into detail as to why.I went to this move, willing to give it a chance. I liked house of 1000 corpses, and the Devil's Rejects. They were great in their own right.First off, the original Halloween is an immortal classic. It was a movie that was top quality, and has made millions of dollars in sales on merchandise related to the film.Secondly, if it isn't broke, don't fix it. The original Halloween didn't need be remade, but if one felt it need some 'modernizing'....then stick to the original concept. Don't go around showing me about how poor young Mikey had a drunk for a father, a slut for a sister and stripper for a mother. I could also give a care that he was picked on by a bunch of bullies at school.The original Halloween made it clear. One day Mikey snapped, killed his sister and never spoke again. This whole business in the new movie of him killing one of the bullies who picked on him, his father and his slut sister, was just a big waste of film. Then after he commits these terrible crimes, we are expected to see him as a 'normal' child again, until he never speaks again? Give me a break. Rob Zombie, your 'unique' vision falls short of even impressing anyone. The only redeeming quality that this movie has, is that they do have some parts that hold true to the original. They also throw in some of the original music and songs. Well thank you for at least making an effort to impress.Rob, stick to what you do best. Leave the remakes with someone with better talent.I give this move a 3 out of 10. It would make a good rental, but as recreating a legend, or unleashing a new vision.....to this I laugh.",Halloween
464,atlanticcanuck,Not Worthy of the Title,2,6 September 2007,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I went in with an open mind. After all, it is not easy to remake a classic. Especially when the original Halloween was perfect. Nonetheless, this movie is a major disappointment. It starts off well enough, and I did enough the background of Michael. However, when it gets to present day, the story line skips through sections and you get the feeling of bad editing. Plus, all the jumping around leads to no character development and a group of teenagers we could care less about. To put in plainly, there is no suspense in this movie. Even though Zombie adds his own touch and scenarios to the story line, he never gives the audience a feeling of dread. Unlike the original, there are no moments of, ""run'"" ""look out behind you"" and all the edge of your seat stuff. It's just cut to scene, kids are killed, cut to next scene.Even the cameos are wasted. Take the Spiderman movies for example. In each one, Bruce Campbell steals the scene he is in. This movie had countless cameos by some of the best in B movies and horror films. For the most part, none of them leave a mark.At times this movie feels like a remake, at times a sequel, and at times a re-envisioning. Never does it feel like a good movie. definitely not worthy of the title.",Halloween
465,angry-man,How not to remake a film...or make any movie for that matter.,1,31 August 2007,"What can I say. My expectations going in were very low, but Zombie managed to make an even worse remake of the Carpenter classic than I could have imagined. To talk about the script, the direction, the acting...it would all be a waste of time. Zombie has succeeded in making one of the most boring, unsuspenseful, cliché, uninspired, flat, meaningless movies I've ever seen. I can almost never say this about a movie, but there is in fact nothing redeemable here. This is as bad as it gets. It's so bad, it's not even funny or fun to watch with a crowd. The level of gore isn't even that impressive, in fact it's rather tame. Zombie's results here (or lack thereof) have done nothing but to give horror a bad name, and set the commercial standard for mainstream horror films to a level not far above subterrainian sludge. This movie is so bad it makes even some of the worst movies I've seen look half-way decent. Not worth the time or the price of admission. Not worth the rental, not worth spit.",Halloween

He also did a great job of using blood for the brutality of the murders vs. just for the scare tactics.The back-story was great, thought one note: ROB ZOMBIE NEEDS TO STOP CASTING HIS VERY WOODY WIFE.

467,TheFilmProf,"Old tricks, no treats.",1,10 September 2007,"In the taxonomy of redeeming values, one could include social, scientific, artistic, political, comedic, moral, etc. And it's nearly impossible to find any creative work that can't be defended or justified under one of these categories. That is, until now. Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is devoid of any redeeming value. It not only plumbs the depths of deprivation, it sets a new low-water mark for tasteless dreck.This has nothing to do with prudishness, squeamishness, or easily offended sensibilities. It has to do with poor scripting, bad (read ""no"") character development, predictability, gratuitous gore and ultimately, just plain meaninglessness. Even the most abstract, non-narrative, experimental genres of film have a point that can be ascertained, albeit with some difficulty in some cases. But ""Halloween"" has no point. In the end, it is merely a series of unmotivated, contrived, gruesome vignettes that, cumulatively, add up to nothing. The film uses every cliché known to bad cinema: Doors that don't open, guns that don't fire, victims who fall and crawl when they can ill-afford to do so, under lit scenes that attempt to falsely create a sense of impending mayhem, some horrific, vile and pandering dialogue and the monster who just won't die. Mr. Zombie uses them all. It's hard to escape the notion that there is nothing intended or achieved beyond fundamental shock value.Billed as a 'retelling' of John Carpenter's original, a somewhat, if only marginally better version, this edition of ""Halloween"" supposedly provides an explanation of the causes of Michael Myers' homicidal psychosis, to wit, his excessively foul-mouthed and dysfunctional parents, who, as characters are as creek-shallow as the rest of the cast. The only one I felt sorry for was Malcolm McDowellthe actor--not Dr. Loomis, his character. How he, the quintessential, ultra-violent Alex de Large of Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" and the multi-faceted Mick Travises of Lindsay Anderson's ""If"" and ""O Lucky Man"" and the H. G. Wells of ""Time After Time,"" got roped into such an awful piece of cinema is a mystery.Thematically and cinematically, ""Halloween"" is virtually identical to Mr. Zombie's two previous films, ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects."" In fact, except for the titles, the three films are nearly indistinguishable from one another as they all suffer from being stuck in the same stylistic rut. While Mr. Zombie does push the envelope of bad taste, there's no evidence that he pushes his own development as a filmmaker, and shows no directorial growth in his progression of films. What he overlooks in his bloodlust is the idea that showing less can be more effective than showing more, as in the ""Psycho"" shower scene when the knife is never seen striking the victim. Leaving nothing to the viewer's imagination and, instead, hammering home the obvious, can be the undoing of a film, which sums up the problem with ""Halloween."" Slasher films may well be the cinematic equivalents of bottom-feeders, but it doesn't necessarily follow that they have to be abhorrently distasteful and bad, or that they can't strive to achieve some measure of redeeming value.Where Rob Zombie will go from here seems painfully apparent. Having painted himself into a corner from which it may be hard to escape, he may be his own next victim.",Halloween

A re-imagining could lead to more films, and most importantly quality sequels.But from the moment it started, I realized this was a complete mistake.From an utterly pointless and clichéd back story, which does nothing to develop the Myers myth (if anything it makes him less frightening), to a rushed end of the film that has NO suspense or terror - I was SHOCKED at how terrible this film was.The man most responsible is Rob Zombie. He is just awful at every turn.The script is mindless and so poorly written - it resorts to the lowest common denominator at every turn. The dialog is mind-bogglingly stupid and cliché. Nobody...and I repeat nobody....does a good acting job.And finally the pace of the film is a car wreck - no build-up no tension nothing. Michael just shows up everywhere and kills everyone.

I was so waiting for this movie to get released that I couldn't stand it. The original Halloween has been my favorite movie for many years. Of course whenever there's a remake, be it a song or a movie, we always compare it against the original. That may not necessarily be fair, but that's just how it is. When I finally got to see this movie, I was expecting a masterpiece. And as soon as the movie started, that's exactly what I thought it was. Only Rob Zombie would have the balls to begin his movie with a KISS song (I'm a huge KISS fan so this was like a sacred thing for me). And then, Michael Myers and his family are all of a sudden total white trash. No one wants their favorite serial killer to be white trash. And there were NO sexy people in this movie either. And I agree with the last comment...I wanted Laurie Strode to die in this version. She was such a BAD actress and she definitely doesn't do Jamie Lee Curtis justice.

473,cewasmuthiii,Poor Take on the Original Classic,4,22 October 2007,"I went into the theater with very few expectations except for one: This new Halloween movie was going to have great atmosphere and chills. I was confident it would be one scary movie and I was really looking forward to it.The first ten minutes go by and I'm laughing quite a bit. I thought to myself, is this supposed to be a comedy? Am I in the wrong theater? I figure maybe Rob Zombie made it funny at first as an odd way to hook the audience.Suffice to say, I'm still waiting to be scared. This movie had no atmosphere and did not scare me in the least. Sure, some of the killings were gross but none were scary. And where was the 1970's style horror atmosphere? I thought Rob Zombie loved 1970's style horror movie making (as do I). Halloween is 1970's horror served up on a silver platter.This isn't a bad movie overall, very average if you ask me, but it is a less than stellar Halloween remake or re-imagining. It just doesn't work as a different take on Halloween. It's almost as if Rob Zombie took an old story he created about a kid with a totally messed up family life who becomes a serial killer and said, ""Hey. I'll just make this kid Michael Myers."" His ""explanation"" of Michael Myers, while very well acted especially by the little boy, just didn't ring true to me. The boy becomes a serial killer because of a bad family life? Cliché and uninspiring to say the least. The footage of him in the asylum was even worse. Awful and boring are words I would use to describe the asylum footage. And the writing and acting for the Dr. Loomis character was laughably poor. It got to the point where I laughed every time he was in a scene.*** Spoiler*** And the ending. The endearing quality of the original 1978 film is the ending. The imagery of seeing Dr. Loomis looking out the window at the spot where The Shape should be is the most compelling and powerful portion of the film. I literally was so scared I couldn't even move when I saw the original the first time. Fantastic imagery and a fantastic ending to the movie.Rob Zombie chose to include the silly ""Laurie Strode is my sister"" add-on angle from Halloween II but chose an ending that is neither clever nor endearing. It's your average bloody girl somehow is lucky enough to survive and kill the knocked out bad guy. Folks, that's not what the original Halloween is all about.I guess I assumed wrongly that Rob Zombie understood what Halloween was about originally. Or, maybe, he didn't have complete creative control as claimed. Either way, what I saw was a decent horror movie but a very poor take on the original Halloween.",Halloween

It took me twenty-four hours to finish it because I couldn't put myself through such miserable torture. The only movie that is more painful to watch is ""Hostel Part II."" I implore ALL people to stay away from this, for I believe that most shall, or almost should, be disappointed with it. The movie did have its moments though. For example, I did like how the first half of the movie was embracing Micheal's past. However, the rest of it desecrated what good moments it had. The two biggest disappointments were Rob Zombie himself and Malcolm McDowell. Rob Zombie had made the fantastic horror flick known as ""The Devil's Rejects,"" so it was almost a personal loss to see his career defiled because of this ""movie."" Then on the subject of Mr. McDowell, I KNEW the man could have done better than this. Once one sees, ""A Clockwork Orange,"" I feel that one will try to deny that Malcolm was even in this so-called ""movie."" This brings nothing new to the horror genre.

475,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Rob Zombie's Halloween,9,8 August 2012,"Halloween: Resurrection came and went without much notice. It did poorly at the box office and was poorly received by critics and audiences alike. Even though the ending left room for a sequel, the possibilities for a ninth Halloween film were looking somewhat bleak. Original films like The Ring (although a remake) and 28 Days Later were fairing well at the box office and it seemed like the generic slasher film was coming to another end. But in August of 2003, Freddy vs. Jason was released and ate up box office receipts. It seemed like the sure fire way to make money and bring audiences back in droves was to combine icons like Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger into one movie.Another way of doing this was the reboot. Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Dawn of the Dead were two of the first and both did quite well with audiences. Horror was booming and it was looking good that a new Halloween film would emerge.On November 11, 2005, sad news hit the world of the Halloween franchise. Moustapha Akkad had died. The producer and man responsible for the continuing legacy had been killed. Along with his daughter, the two were killed in Jordan when a suicide bomber detonated his bomb. It was a sad day for his family, his fans and the world.Malek Akkad, his son, took over the reigns and in 2006 began the process of making a new Halloween film. He, like many others, jumped on the reboot idea and hired Rob Zombie to direct the latest Halloween. And on August 31, 2007, Rob Zombie's vision of Halloween was released on the world.This Halloween, by far, is the best Halloween film since the original. It outshines every sequel, including the great H20 and it brings new life to the series. Zombie added much to the story rather than just making a straight out remake and in the process fleshes out the characters and gives them more meaning.The first hour of the film takes place following Michael Myers from a kid to an adult, from a torturous home life to the murder of his family to the sanatorium and his eventual escape. The rest of the movie is a remake and homage to the original film.Dr. Loomis, now played by the great Malcolm McDowell, has more character than ever before. He has feelings, is troubled and feels not only responsible for Michael but like they are part of each other. Michael Myers as a boy comes off great. He is troubled and menacing and evil. We see anger and pain and trouble in his eyes and face and when he grows up we see it all in his eyes as the brooding adult he becomes.Tyler Mane plays the adult Michael. He is a big man and he plays Michael brilliantly. His portrayal of Michael is probably portrayed here the best in the whole series, and yes, that includes the original. He is large and scary and says a lot with his eyes. He moves right, he acts right and after 8 Halloween films, if a viewer was to picture Michael Myers in their head, Tyler Mane as Myers is what they would picture.The rest of the cast (minus Sheri Moon Zombie) are all great in the roles and bring lots to the film. Sheri Moon is the weakest link but even still she isn't terrible. The casting is great and features horror and film icons in many roles. Brad Dourif, Ken Foree, William Forsythe, Dee Wallace and Danny Trejo all make appearances (and that's just the tip of the iceberg). Danielle Harris of Halloween 4 and 5 is back too, this time playing the best friend of Laurie Strode, and she makes a welcome return to the series.The music too is just top notch. Tyler Bates original score is haunting and noisy; modern and scary. He incorporates the original haunting theme in many areas of the film and really blends the two together well. As well, all the songs one remembers from Halloween and the sequels are present in this movie and show up as little homages through out. The music really works well and brings much to the film.Great cinematography and great colours are present throughout. This is by far the bloodiest Halloween and the props and make-up department do a great job. Zombie's directing is excellent and he has created a jarring, tense and nerve racking experience. The editing is well done too, although the film could maybe be cut by about ten minutes, but otherwise everyone has worked at the top of their game for this film.Rob Zombie's Halloween is filled with terror, scares, blood, gore and nudity. It has terrific directing, great acting, excellent music and the best of the best of the brooding Michael Myers. Although not as simple as the original, and maybe just a tad to long, audiences will be thrilled and exciting when watching this film. It brings Halloween back to it's basic, while at the same time it brings a whole new slew of originality to the story.Whether one is a Halloween fan, or a horror movie fan who has never seen a Halloween film before, they really cannot go wrong by sitting down for two hours and watching Rob Zombie's immaculate version of Halloween.Film Rating: 85%Breakdown (How Halloween: Resurrection scored 85%):Production Design: 9 out of 10 Cinematography: 9 out of 10 Re-playability: 9 out of 10 Originality: 8 out of 10 Costumes: 8 out of 10 Directing: 8 out of 10 Editing: 8 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Music: 10 out of 10 Script: 8 out of 10",Halloween

Well, I do not know about you but being 6' 2"" and 240 lbs. the first Michael did not scare me in a physical way. But the new Michael, my Lord, I would not even think about trying to take this guy on. he is physically and mentally intimidating. The mask has been upgraded as well to be even more sinister. I love the first movie from 1978, I own three different copies of it. Was it better? Yes in some ways it was. The new Halloween is better also in some ways. I had no problems either with Zombie fleshing out the origin story and the young Michael was almost as vicious as the older Michael. The story itself did use some elements from the first one of course, but it also was it's own movie which made it less predictable. So what if the kid came from a broken home type environment and was picked on in school, at least this was some kind of answer to why he was. In the original we have to just assume he is pure evil, but why that particular kid? The other children were not that way. When watching these types of movies you have to let go of the past and keep an open mind to what direction this Halloween could take in the future. My biggest hopes that a Halloween III will finally be made that actually has Michael Meyers in it. And maybe we will not get such a confusing story line that we saw in all of the past Halloween movies. Halloween 6? Good grief that was horrible and then we go back to the Jamie Lee Curtis saga like 4, 5, and 6 never happened. If you are a fan of Halloween and Michael Meyers, give this movie a chance. No, it is not your father's Michael Meyers but do you really want to see the exact same thing again?",Halloween
477,DanOS1994,Halloween (2007),7,30 October 2010,"Well if you have seen the original Halloween you'll understand the basic story and plot of this film, I personally haven't seen the original (but I want to). This film shows the dark, unhappy childhood of Michael Myers who becomes mentally unstable, it starts off by him killing small animals for enjoyment. Then Michael snaps he starts killing people and it flashes forward to when he's about twenty-five years old and goes on a killing- spree. This is one of those basic horror films which are aimed primarily at Teens (Contains a lot of sex and bad language). I also thought I would mention it contains full-frontal female nudity (Just in case your wandering if it's suitable for your child/teen). I personally recommend this film as I thought it told the story very well and had good action scenes etc. I recommend this for 15+ even though it's an 18 and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. 8/10",Halloween
478,omgakeem,Not as bad as some say,8,1 November 2020,"Watched this Halloween night, I enjoyed this movie, honestly more than the original, I really liked the history of why Michael became a killer, answers about the mask, why he wears it, his time at the asylum. In the original he kills his sister, no reason given and he's now a monster. This movie shows how Michael Myers should be, just a non-stop machine. I like how Rob throws actors in you know like Sid Haig, William Forsyth, Clint Howard, Mickey Dolenz. A couple things I didn't care for, I hate the shaky camera, like it was filmed with a handheld, I'm sure Rob Zombie had his reason. I'm wondering about the nudity, these girls are in high school, I do recall Laurie's mom saying she was graduating this year, so I guess they were 18 years old. Besides these things the film was really entertaining with a lot of kills and blood which I expect when it's Michael Myers. Now I have to watch Zombies Halloween II.",Halloween
479,cblazo,"An open minded, but disappointed Halloween fan.",5,3 July 2011,"I am a huge Halloween fan. I love the simple feel to it. I was actually excited when I heard this was coming to theaters. I was at the first showing and couldn't wait. I thought Rob Zombie was going to do an excellent job and he was the man to do it. Boy was I wrong. In an interview with Zombie he said he would go to the roots of the movie and keep it simple. He did a little but barely.He kept the sequencing the same but thats about it. The atmosphere was great and the scores were cool. Those were my positive attributes. I think he goes too far into Michael's childhood. I think the time spent on his childhood should of been only a fraction of the time. I also didn't like the fact that Michael came from white trash. It's better that he came from an upstanding, modest family and not deviant trash. This is Halloween, not 1,000 corpses or Devil's Rejects. The size of Michael was ridiculous and the kill scenes didn't leave it up to your imagination. Now I know this is a remake and not the original, but come on. This is Halloween. Don't ruin the name for the newer generations to come. I would always want generations to come to remember Carpenter and what he gave us. Not Zombie and what he LEFT.",Halloween
480,daveelmorto,So most people prefer the endless clones over an engaging albeit far more violent remake?,10,25 May 2021,"Looking at a lot of the reviews here it is apparent that people seem to not like Rob Zombies Halloween remake (And I think that is an understatement) however I get the feeling that no matter what this film turned out to be it was going to have it's staunch critics. If Rob Zombie had not stuck to the original plot points and ideas he would have been blasted for being too different from the source material, here I felt he found a good balance in that he he told a backstory which was the part that he made his own (as John Carpenter hoped he would) right up to the point wjere Michael breaks out of the asylum, which in the original Halloween is the point we pick up the story after Michael being put away.If you saw House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects then you know the stylistic choices that Rob Zombie is going to make walking into the film so I have to wonder why all the negative reviews?The second half of the story plays out like a straight remake of Carpenters classic albeit with the aforementioned stylistic choices in that it is a million times more violent than the restrained original, but again you knew that when you walked in. My thing is that I feel that Zombie made Halloween for a modern audience brought up on ultra violent films from that Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw franchises and had he not he would have come under massive criticism for it.I am a massive fan of this movie and Rob Zombie as a film maker and some may think that may influence my opinion and that is fine. (I can tell you that his seque l to this as a Halloween film I am not a fan of, but as a slash and dice film it isn't bad but I digress)
True horror fans should have a less prejudiced re-viewing of this (And I will admit that I have only seen the work print and the director's cut) because this is a truly great rendition turning a great 1978 thriller into a brilliant modern horror classic to be.",Halloween

Theres nothing entertaining here, its just a miserable experience from start to finish. Theres no tension or dread or anything but unrelenting bleakness.

His back-story has been kicked around by fans since before the dawn of the interenet or WWW.& if this was a New ""Vison"" or some other lame excuse way you want to say ""Re-Make"", why wasn't there any mention of 'THORN"".? The sixth installment also reveals that Michael at some point in his childhood was chosen by a cult to bear the Curse of Thorn. The cult believes that a child from one family must be chosen to bear the curse and sacrifice their entire family in order to save the rest of the community from death. The curse apparently makes the user immortal or grants the ability to self-resurrect once dead, and gives other super-natural abilities like superhuman strength. The curse is what the cult believes causes Michael to stalk and kill family members. It is not known exactly how many family members Michael has killed outside his immediate family. He has at least two biological family members still living: John, Laurie Myers Strode's 17 year old son in Halloween H20 and Jamie Lloyd Carruthers's infant son from The Curse of Michael Myers...????

483,spellcaster-1,Halloween the way it should have been,8,29 August 2007,"Oh wow! Where oh where to start? First and foremost it's no surprise that I'm not a big fan of remakes, or spin off remakes, if you will. To date there has been only one movie remade that I felt was better then its predecessor. And that film was THE HILLS HAVE EYES. Well it seems I've been taken aback. Having understood his direction and enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses but despising The Devils Rejects I was in between on whether or not to like Zombies directing style. He was one for two in my opinion. But now! Now this; a remake of Halloween, are you serious?It seems they were. They've gone and taken one of the best films in American cinematic history and remade it. And Rob Zombie of all people!! Well I can be man enough to admit when I'm wrong. Mr Zombie. You should be proud of yourself. You sire have created something I feel will be one of the talked about greats for many years to come. Let me skip to the explanation and just explain it! The major difference in this version as compared to the original is that instead of having Michael standing out on the sidewalk with the butcher knife then fast forwarding to 15 years later. Rob Zombie does just what I've always wondered why they never did. He's shown ""WHY"" Michael was so messed up. As a young boy Michael didn't really have a chance. Coming up in a sub level family with the siblings; mother and a typical bad step dad. From experience we can all pretty much say it's safe to agree this is a perfect formula for chaos in any household such as this. He gets picked on at school and at home so what did they expect would happen?? On Halloween 1963, in the town of Haddenfield, 6-year-old Michael Myers played miraculously by newcomer Daeg Farch, snaps killing his step dad by tying him to the couch with duct tape while asleep then cuts his throat. After a baseball bat to a victims head and the infamous butcher knife slashing he picks his baby sister, Laurie, up and sits on the stoop waiting for his mother to return home. Estranged and mentally unstable, Michael is imprisoned in Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) for the murders he's committed.As Dr. Loomis tries to befriend Michael he seems to get through to him for the better part but that soon diminishes and Michael refuses to talk from this point on. Several years go by and Michael is now a grown adult. From what seems to be the turning point in this story is when Dr. Loomis speaks to Michael telling him he's moving on that there's nothing left for him to do. Since Dr. Loomis departure things at Smith's Grove Sanitarium have gone to crap. They've since accumulated orderlies just seeking that paycheck with no care of patients. One dumb ass even goes so far as to pick on Michael and brings in one of the new women patients and violates her with help of another orderly in Michaels' room. Killing the orderlies and from this point on we see what we once new as the only Halloween there was..I could go on and on about how much of a brilliant movie this was but if you don't want to watch this movie from what you've just read then I don't know how to persuade you into doing so. As previously stated Rob zombie took a brilliant movie in its time and added what I feel a lot of people wish they could have seen, or known. He added a face to what we've seen. He's added a conscience. Michael wasn't just a straight up pussy ass slasher he was a young boy who never had the chance, so he took it! The acting herein was excellent and spot on but props need to go out to young Daeg Farch. His performance was better then the majority of adult actors I've watched. He was creepy and his demeanor from the get go makes you keep one eye open while watching him. Zombie must be very pleased he had such an excellent actor at his disposal. Now don't get me wrong this baby was laden full with excellent actors from Danielle Harris to Malcom McDowell to the man himself, Tyler Mane or X-men fame as Michael Myers. And for all those die hard Carpenter fans, don't worry, there are plenty of nods to him from Zombie here and once it gets to Michael arriving in Haddonfield it does follow pretty good with the original, just sped up with a little more bite by our killer at hand. By that I mean that instead of him just walking around with a stupid freaking knife in his hand stabbing people, he actually picks them up and slings their asses around like rag dolls. This was a much appreciated addition. In my opinion it gives Michale some backbone and adds a little more fear. Anyone can stab you. But can they pick you up, swing you around and then stab you???? If you only take my word on one film review you read, please let this one be the one. Rob Zombie's Halloween is one hell of a good movie, one that will go on my shelf as my favorite films of all time. Thank you Mr Zombie for giving us something different and keeping with that odd gritty style you do so well.",Halloween
484,steveneven,Surprisingly not as bad as the crowd makes it out to be,5,8 July 2014,"Look, I understand why people would hate this movie. For one, all the characters are unlikable except Sheri Moon Zombie. Two, this movie solely depends on gratuitous nudity, sex, violence, and swearing. And three, this movie cannot make up its mind. It tries to be part prequel/sequel, and it fails on all accounts. So why do I claim that this movie is not as bad as its rancid reception?That is because I was never bored. There is something about this gritty/brutal atmosphere in Zombie's tour-de-force here that just grabs you by the throat like Michael would. I feel like Zombie wanted to give you an uglier, more realistic approach, sans some questionable motifs made by Michael in the second half. Anyway, this movie has some great cinematography. First off, the first death is staged outside where the leaves have this nice orange hue, and it just feels like Halloween. Michael's mask when he was younger, and even his mask when he is older, is just eerie. I also feel like Michael here is vicious. He cannot be stopped. He is uncompromising- destroying everything in his path.Although, Zombie would have been better off reducing his two-hour long rendition to a more concise hour and twenty minutes. I feel like he should have just kept the remake. The homages to Carpenter's original were great like the score. I also feel like he built some solid tension in certain parts, and he nailed the look of Haddonfield in this one. I was not disappointed. But the first half just feels weird and a bit dodgy. I understand that Rob Zombie wants you to feel for our villain, but having your mother a stripper, an abusive father, and a sleaze ball of a sister was all a little much. And, that he would snap into killer mode so fast. And, even take it out on the sister's boyfriend? Really? I also thought that the scenes with Dr. Loomis were kind of out of place. The whole thing just felt weird because it is not ""Halloween"". It is almost like a ""Behind-the-scenes"" or some ""Halloween"" spin-off. It was not a bad effort, but I would not congratulate it either.However, I cannot ignore how awful the dialogue is. I appreciated the grittiness of it, but my GOD that is some foul language. I mean, I can digest the language in Tarantino and Scorsese films but here? It really is like redneck language. This is truly despicable if people talk like this. And having unlikable characters? It makes it easier for the audience to hate them and want them dead. Thankfully, they have a little take-out by Michael. I also thought the ending was... abrupt, for a lack of a better word. I thought that Zombie should have handled it in a different way. If this review seems a bit shorter than my other reviews in the Halloween series, it is because I cannot really say too much about this movie. Zombie's ""Halloween"" being a remake in the second half is just hiccuping Carpenter's originals- sans some changes. And, those changes were not for the better. Whether you like Carpenter's better, if you have an open-mind, I do not think this film will offend you too much. The pacing is almost MTV-fast, the deaths are pretty memorable, and Zombie has some good suspense in the later half. However, Zombie's ""Halloween"" cannot match Carpenter's smart and uber suspenseful original.",Halloween
485,coltjessica,Halloween fan for life,7,22 October 2021,Now this is not a terrible movie. It cannot come close to the original or others of the collection but I appreciate the add to the collection. I will watch anything labeled Halloween and connected to Michael Myers for the most part theyre all good enough for slasher movies. Hell pt 3 to this day is the biggest let down in this whole collection. Why? No MM. So this one is 10x better than that for sure. My biggest gripe in Zombies versions is the shape being 7ft tall and pure muscle. That is a mistake. Michael Myers was a meer average build and height man. He did not scare you from his stature just his silent cold stand still or slow moving silence plus he had super human strength. Never understood the addition of this monster who would be so obviously scary no matter what he did and who went up against him. I did like the attempt at showing Loomis and his 15years with Mike but in the end the original never truly needed it. That was good story telling. This gets an ok and respect regardless for the attempt.,Halloween
486,cchires,Another tragedy on the Anniversary of Princess Diana's Death,2,1 September 2007,"I had the unfortunate experience of seeing ""Halloween"" last night after weeks of anticipation for the 'new version of a classic story'and for me the excitement died within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The opening scenes are a disaster as the early years of Michael Myers show his family in a manner that reminded me of the Jerry Springer show. The big mistake I think is that the back story is drawn out for an hour when it was trimmed to 10 minutes in the original; this kills pace and mood. Furthermore, the whole introduction provides no insight into why young Michael kills anyway(he had a thing for masks?). Finally when the story catches up to present day Halloween, the movie has to rush through the scary parts to get to the final meeting between Michael and his surviving sister (by the way, how did he know Laurie was his sister?). The tone of the film kept switching from black comedy to suspense to gore fest so many times that I didn't know what the target response was supposed to be and many of the people around me began to mock what they saw on screen. There were many laughs of disbelief from the audience, some of my favorites were: the scene where Laurie, in hiding, had to cry just loud enough for the killer to find her, when she runs back into the house after she tried so hard to escape, all the dialog of the teenage girls (my female companion last night assured me that this was not how women speak at any age), the Mean Joe Grisly scene, and the part when Dr. Loomis tries to get Michael to stop killing by saying ""It's me, Samuel"". What school of psychiatry did he go to anyway? As for the ending, all I can say is that it is so vague ans infuriating, that even though I couldn't wait for this trash to be over, I still couldn't believe that is was.",Halloween

488,leumas3765,Should be required viewing in film school for what doesn't work,4,15 September 2007,"If I had a cool fake last name and a semi-successful pseudo-metal band in the 90s, maybe I would be approached to direct a ""retelling"" of a horror classic to make a ton of money for the studio.If I was, I would keep in mind all the elements that made Halloween '78 so popular and leave them exactly how they were, such as prolonged steady-cam shots to give the sense that of The Shape's point of view, a minimal but chilling soundtrack to add to the tension, a brave heroine who isn't a helpless idiot, and keeping the antagonist off screen for at least the first half of the movie to build the tension. This was the formula for all the ""great"" horror and suspense movies, such as Psycho, The Exorcist, Jaws, and the first Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and I would keep true to it in my Halloween remake.The only things I would fix in my retelling would be little things that my larger budget would certainly allow. I would make the sets of Haddonfield, Illinois in October look less like Southern California in April. My actresses portraying teen-agers would not be in their late 20s or early 30s, and I would eliminate small holes in the plot like the opening scene of Michael's sister making out with her boyfriend upstairs for only 40 seconds before he leaves, and the sheriff responding to a break-in at the hardware store during normal business hours (usually, burglar alarms don't sound during shoplifting.) I would also pick a year that my remake was supposed to take place and stick to it. I wouldn't confuse the audience by having people with sort of retro fashions and hairstyles driving pristine cars from the 60s and 70s and kids on stingray bikes that haven't been seen in 25 years, but at the same time modern police cars and cell phones.I understand Rob Zombie's temptation to answer questions that all of us have had about Michael Myers, such as why is he so intent on killing people and why does he insist on wearing a mask? The problem is, in answering the questions and telling about Michael's background, Michael becomes more human and therefore less scary. Even Zombie's choice of explanation is suspect. The audience expects a tormented kid from a crappy home to turn out disturbed, but a bad kid from a seemingly normal home seems a lot scarier, since it could happen to anyone. (Halloween '78 got this part right as well.) Not everything in this movie is completely inferior to the original, hence my rating of 4 stars. The sets look thousands times better than the original. The actresses seem more believable as teenagers than in the original, and we get to see a lot more of them. The new scene of Michael ripping up floorboards in his old house to get his mask and knife was pretty cool, too.As for the rest of the movie, it is an interesting study in what truly comes across as suspenseful on a screen. Is a powerful, 6'8"" antagonist scarier than one who appears and vanishes into the shadows? (probably not.) Does gratuitous gore and language actually distract from the suspense? (yes.) Does the inclusion of well known rock-songs for more than 5 seconds at a time really kill the mood? (absolutely, and it also interferes with the classic soundtrack. This was also a problem in Halloween 2.) Are dizzying, quick, MTV jump cuts scarrier than long, steady shots? (see for yourself and decide.) In a way, Rob Zombie had an impossible task of making a sequel (even if it was called remake or retelling) when everyone already knew about Michael and what was going to happen, thereby removing almost all of the suspense. However, that doesn't excuse leaving out the opening title sequence with a simple black background, pulsating theme music, and the off center, poorly-carved Jack O Lantern giving a sense of foreboding. I am almost certain there was a fantastic, eerie version of the classic 5/8 theme played on an out-of-tune honky tonk piano that was played in a trailer for Halloween '07. It would have worked perfectly for such an opening sequence, but sadly, it was omitted for the actual movie.Don't expect a lot from this movie (like being scared or entertained) but if you watch it to study what truly works in horror movies and what doesn't, it is worthwhile viewing. When it comes to horror, less is more, since nothing is more powerful than the viewer's imagination.Remember that, Rob.",Halloween

490,savagerocks,Dreadful!!!,2,2 September 2007,"I was hopeful that Rob Zombie was on the right path. I like some of his music so I raised the bar a little on this movie. Like other Zombie films this one is Excessive in every sense of the word. A loose re-make of the 1978 film with less style and a higher body count than it's predecessor. Gives us a background of Michael Myers as a screwed up kid. Which makes the movie not as scary, because not knowing what makes Michael Myers tick is more frightening than giving him a Ted Bundy/Jeffrey Dahmer style background. I thought Devil's Rejects was a decent movie so I thought this would be better than it was. Movie scores a higher mark because it is slightly better than the ""Curse of Michael Myers"" Also, I liked that some rock music was added to the soundtrack. I'm a fan of the original film and maybe 3 of the sequels, this one made me feel like I was beaten over the head with a sledgehammer for 90 or so minutes.I think it's all subjective agree to disagree. Halloween has a lot of fans on both sides. In my opinion this wasn't a very good movie and a lot of people disagree with me and that's cool. Whether it's a remake or a prequel it lacks the style and simplicity that made the original and a couple of the sequels so good. Even some of John Carpenters later films lacked these two elements style and simplicity. For what it's worth this Halloween is for a different generation. For those of you who commented that you can't compare this one with the original.If you call Your movie Halloween and use the title character in your movie you are subject to comparisons to the original movie and any or all of the films that preceded your version.",Halloween
491,VivaLaGloria18,Better then some would expect,8,5 June 2008,"Before I say anything against this film I want to say I DID like it. But only just like. I'm a huge fan of the original 'Halloween' series. The first is my favorite horror movies and Michael Myers is the only character that genuinely scares me. I am a fan Rob Zombie also and believe 100% in his work. In some ways I really did like this version better then the original, in other ways I thought it was just not as good. I thought it was very interesting to see into Michael's past but i think it was also not a good idea to humanize him which takes away a lot of the scare factor. I think that the less you think of him as human the scarier he gets for he really is beyond human. The violence is no where near as bad as people played it up to be. Definitely not anything you haven't seen in a R movie before. One of things I truly loved about the original is it was slow. Slow in a very good way. lengthy scenes of Michael lurking in shadows or approaching his victims. In this one its much faster. Faster to the point one or two scenes is so hectic, rushed and chaotic I was confused as to what was going on. I know this is said to be a 're-imagining' and in some places it is but in others its a scene for scene and line for line remake. And all of it is blended in with the new material and made it so confusing you might wonder which version you are watching. The acting is great in lots of places but lacks badly in some.I'm truly impressed with Daeg Faerch's proformance I think he'll definitely go on to be a really amazing actor he's already proved he is. Sheri Moon Zombie as always was awesome. I was really not impressed with Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis. Though I will grant that filling Donald Pleasence place cannot be an easy task. Scout Taylor Compton did well but I really don't think she played laurie right. Overall this movie is good. It lacks in some places but it is worth watching. I recommend seeing the original also though.A side note though, none of my criticism is in any way disrespect towards Rob Zombie or his ability to direct. I cannot describe how much I admire him and his work.",Halloween
492,jtpapp,An insult to the original in every way,2,9 March 2011,"When I went to the theater to see this film on opening day, I had moderate expectations. I love the original Halloween, and I couldn't see this film ever matching up to it. So I had already decided that the film couldn't ever match up to the suspense and fear that John Carpenter had created with his film. But I liked that Zombie was going to try and add more of an origin story to Michael Myers. This would have been his own stamp on a series that had grown pretty stale over the years.This is not the return of the Halloween franchise in any shape or form.The script seems like it was written by a group of 12 year old boys who just learned curse words and some things about sex from their older siblings. At no point in the film does any character have any good or even meaningful dialogue. It's mostly swearing and crude sexual references. And I don't mind things like that in a movie if they at least make sense in the context they are used in. Zombie aims to offend with his dialogue, not actually advance the plot or make the audience care about any of the characters. In this he succeeds, and in doing so, makes it seem like he wrote the film for a 12 year old audience. The dumbed down dialogue isn't as bad as the horrible acting though. The acting from all involved is just horrendous. Scout Taylor Compton is laughably bad. Malcolm McDowell is probably the best of the group, but he isn't given much to work with in the script. I still can't believe he actually agreed to be in this film.As far as Zombie's promise to deliver a more fleshed out back story as to why Michael Myers is driven to murder, frankly, there isn't really one. Every scene that Zombie tries to use to show why Myers murders people comes off as forced into the script, and they care no real fluidity in the rest of the film. It is almost as if Zombie compiled a list of traits of serial killers, and then took that list and just made a scene around each trait.There is obviously a lot more blood in this remake than in the original. But again, this doesn't make the film better or even make it interesting. It simply is there when another one dimensional character dies.Judging by this directorial effort, Zombie does not understand how to generate fear or even use music cues to heighten suspense. There isn't one scene in this film that involves suspense, just a few jump scares. He throws in the stalking music from the original Halloween early in the film ineffectively, and continues to just throw in random songs and sounds throughout.I really wanted this film to be just OK, especially after Halloween: Resurrection and H20. But unfortunately, this is just a film from a wanna-be director that has an inept script and a bunch of bad ideas and offensive scenes that don't add up to a good film. Zombie failed on all fronts with this film. I usually understand why people like certain films and can understand why they defend them, but this film is just bad. Even viewed as an exploitation film, it isn't even interesting on that level and had very few original ideas if Zombie was trying to go for a more exploitative angle.This film is a complete insult to the original Halloween in every way, and shouldn't even bear the name.",Halloween

I am not a big Rob Zombie fan and have not enjoyed his previous movies - House of a thousand corpses, The devils rejects... But this is pure brilliance, this is not a mockery of a classic original, in fact it's better. I watched this movie when it first came out and bought it as soon as it was available on DVD and since then I have watched it 7 times and it still impresses me. All the actors in this movie were on top form, especially Sherry Moon Zombie, she pulled off a compassionate and caring mother so well she should have been nominated for an academy award. The directing was top class and the plot was top class, so whats the problem. I have all the other Halloween movies but this one takes the cake. Well done Rob Zombie.",Halloween
494,Tha_rick-me,It's a sin! I should've felt sick...,2,1 November 2009,"And yes... it really is a sin. It is a sin to remake John Carpenter's masterpiece of horror, which was as scary back then as it is today. Firstly, let's analyze why the 1978 original Halloween was such a masterpiece. Mr. Carpenter and Mrs. Hill managed to write a horror flick with a villain so evil that he (if we can refer to it as him) did not have any reason nor ratio, and he needed neither of them. Something like The Shape (a.k.a. Michael Myers) is like the Charlie Chaplin of horror. Its pale mask, its pointy hair, its workman's outfit... It is a force of unimaginable evil, as one can say that every human being has certain ethics. No, the shape has none. Mr. Carpenter's camera-work was one of the best ever seen in horror cinema (along with its none-slasher counterpart, Kubrick's masterful 'The Shining). He doesn't need to show The Shape, he wants us to see what it sees. It makes you feel sick when you jump to the conclusion that you murdered Judith Myers. When he doesn't show us the events as seen by the killer, he is inventive enough to just introduce a shoulder, a shadow, a glimpse of evil, and we know that we're in some serious trouble. The challenging cinematography and the realistic script are even more ominous (""He's 87!"" ""He still can look"" ""Probably the only thing he can do""). The Shape in this movie is menacing and ominous, no big budget, but great effect.Now, the 2007 re-imagining-re-make. The quite realistic dialogue has been replaced by hundreds of f-bombs, wannabe-drama and uninventiveness, as if it were obligatory in a modern day horror movie. The camera-work was replaced by gritty, ugly and direct camera, which removed practically every thread from the film. The brave but quite dull and square Laurie was replaced by an uninspired performance by Scout Taylor-Compton. The original Dr. Loomis, played by the great Donald Pleasence, was replaced by Malcom McDowell. Now, McDowell is a great actor, but only when playing a bad protagonist himself (i.e. A Clockwork Orange). Talking about bad protagonists, during the original Halloween franchise (which generally sucked, except Halloween, Halloween 2 and H20), Michael Myers became more of a protagonist, everyone came to see him killing people. This concept was further exploited in the remake, as Mr. Zombie seems to want us to pity Michael Myers, to give him a reason. It isn't his fault, but another abusive character's. Remember, Mr. Zombie, Michael Myers used to be an antagonist who killed and stalked people we even used to try to care about, we don't pity Myers, for he is a mindless evil force. Rob Zombie, by showing the childhood of the troubled Michael Myers, sucked all the energy out of the movie, whereas the original was almost shot in the time it actually took place (inside 2-3 hours somewhat, only a few shortcuts), while the new one takes place in about 16 years, which makes the remake not only unimaginative and ruined, but also dull.It's a sin... (remember that, Mr. McDowell?)1,8 for the cool sound of mr. Zombies name.",Halloween
495,rblade963,Do we care?,4,9 September 2008,"I cannot rip up the beautiful camera work or lighting or anything technical or even the performances of the actors as I felt Rob Zombie did a excellent job creating a great visual film with talented people.However... Here is my main problem with this film. -spoiler-Do we care how Mike grew up? Would it have mattered if Mike came from a strict religious back ground were he begins to sink into the darkness of evil or if he was raised by a loving family but had emotional problems and sank into the darkness of evil. What would it matter? Mike is a born product of pure undying evil. That's the bottom line why try and explain the obvious. What does it matter about the touchy feely ideas of Mikes childhood ... who cares. Are we to believe that this makes it more real to understand how he grew up so we can get into his mind and understand the killer better? Rob should have tackled one of the sequels to the film that were really bad. Like Halloween 4 for example now I would have loved to see better sequels and this is where a director should use his energy in improving the crap sequels that are produced from a classic movie. Halloween the original film is something I feel didn't have to be re-made it stands on it's own.Simply some classics should be left alone Mr. Zombie would have done better at a remake of the Wizard of Oz. Where we could get into the mind of the wicked witch and understand how she grew up and why she is so hateful. Yea, real important to know. Wish people would really leave the great classic films alone.Just my humble opinion.",Halloween
496,ChristinaZee,And then there was three....,8,30 August 2007,"Rob Zombie... What can I say... The man is a genius! I was lucky enough to get a copy of the screening copy for Dimension Films, since the theater release is not until Friday the 31st. I watched this film last night and all I have to say is whoa... I have been waiting for this film to come out since I first read about the production of this movie back last year... I have built it up to be so big, and I was not let down at all!! I know that a lot of people will be not to thrilled with this rendition of the film, since it is not the exact remake of the film. This is the Rob Zombie's vision of Michael Myers that makes him all so real... He personifies him in this film, he makes him more than just a boogie man with a mask... The first 45-50 minutes of the film shows Michael as a young boy, before the murders, during the murders, and after the murders. The part played by Sherri Zombie is the best one in the film, she nailed it! The thing about this movie is that I have always wondered why he was like this... Sure in the first one it gives you some back story, a little insight, but to see this actor portray a psycho and a lunatic, from age 10 and younger, it hits you deep. It makes you think ""Am I paying enough attention to my children? Am I missing the signs?"" This movie ended the only way it could, which is real. Rob Zombie, god what a legend... He has made movie making an art again in a world filled with churned out Hollywood crap... I think that a lot of directors should take some pointers from him on how to properly devlop a story and shoot the film... He did an awesome job! That movie was f*ing great!! Watch it if you feel like you are ready for something real... I know I was!",Halloween
497,randomorwhat,The classic was classic...this was frankly poor,2,28 April 2008,"I'm tired and highly bored, having had to sit through almost two hours of pretentious, predictable and overly-dramatic hyperbolic film. Considering how over the top that sentence was, symbolises my feelings about this film. The mediocre actors suffer from a poor script, which could be written by a Hollywood book of clichés, the scares (though minimal) were obvious to the point of semi-plagiarism. Indeed, the one positive element was the hilarity which the exaggerated film brought to a late night's entertainment. Some parts of the film deserve merit. It was in the breakdown of the stereotypical horror elements in which Zombie creates an effective atmosphere, but far too often, he falls into the typical traps which standard horrors have done before him. Kill moments - mediocre at best. Not horrific enough to be considered 'Saw'-worthy (not that's a good thing) and not ridiculous enough to be considered Friday the 13th II's pure fantasy. No intelligent elements which 'Scream' brought to the screen. Attempts to multi-dimensionalise characters was laughable, and though efforts were made with our killer, I felt such little pathos with any single member of the cast, that I would rather have been watching Halloween: Recurrection. At least that I could have laughed and not felt bad. I mean, Jesus, some people actually liked this piece of tripe.",Halloween
498,carolynvargas,One time watch for horror fans.,6,25 October 2018,"This version of Halloween tells the same story as its 30-year-old predecessor but plays with the time line. The prologue (initially set in the early '60s and now in the early '90s) has been expanded from about 10 minutes to 45 minutes, thereby providing us with more backstory. However, the meat of the tale - Halloween night in Haddonfield today - has been condensed by about one-third. This has the unfortunate side-effect of rendering the characters as poorly realized copies of their original selves. Worse still, Zombie abandons the tense, atmospheric tone of the original for something more plodding and savage. Halloween ('78) was characterized by suspense and terror; there are few, if any, scares to be found this time around.",Halloween
499,takashi_kupo,Halloween Has Never Been So Old and Lazy,4,1 September 2007,"Rob Zombie has some making up to do after writing and directing this piece of barely professional work.First of all, if you have any attachment to the first one than you're going to have nothing but contempt for this film. Secondly, if you are at all passive about horror films and their debauchery upon realism, and non-sensible logic, ...then you will still be unforgiving to this movie. I'll point out the good things in this movie first. It's a very small list so we should get through it quite quickly. -The soundtrack is awesome. The rock and roll anthems and chimes are well placed through out the film and make for some interesting scenes, especially coming up to the point where Michael actually kills his stand in father, and sister, her boyfriend, and his mother's stripper scene (Sherry Moon Zombie OWNS in this scene...and let me tell you...I'm pretty gay, and that was pretty hot.) -Sherry Moon Zombie: Although you could debate that she needs some acting lessons, I would debate that she just needs better direction in a movie, because she plays her characters well (even if we have seen it in previous Zombie movies). She was the best thing about the first half, save for the boy who played Michael. -The Cast was a good ensemble. ..enough said. Now let's speak of the bad things in this movie. - Michael is unbelievably sadistic. No one will believe why he is so undeniably evil, because they don't have a proper back story. The opening scene is a butchered convoluted mess of yelling parents, UN-loving siblings, and hurting animals for who knows what reason. Also, when he kills his first victim, it's not very believable the way they pulled it off. - Dr. Loomis was a hooker. Terrence Stamp needs a kick in the balls for doing so badly as the new Doc. - The score is awful in placing of such is what made it so unbearable. Zombie was criticized for using Carpenter's old score too much and said himself that they would use it as little as possible, but I counted four times that they used it and not once was I satisfied with hearing it on screen. - The Screenplay was horrendous and suffered from bad one liners, to realistic dialog, to bad horror clichés, to badly delivered monologues. - It wasn't scary. Period. I jumped once but that's because I was texting my friend the whole time about how much it sucked. All in all, it was just a total let down with the trailer being so nicely done. But being based off of a classic it sets itself up for even more of a crash and burn effect. The first half's let down was the story that should have set up the myth a lot better. It had the actors, just lacked the direction. The screenplay was awful here as well, but the saving grace was Love Hurts to Sherry Moon Zombie Stripping at her club. The second part suffered from bad everything. The actors held together well though. That's pretty much all. See it if you like, to satisfy yourself. I mean, horror fans are bound to creep in for Halloween and Zombie, but I just felt he either you take him as an unprofessional who needs to go back to studying, or he took the project too lightly, got arrogant and lazy, and set this burning pile of poop with nice actors on fire. Just Sayin'",Halloween
500,traciecavill,"Half Original Ideas, Half Slave To the Original",5,27 December 2019,"It'll be hard to even think of John Carpenter's original film during the first 45 minutes of the film. It uses a more grungy version of Carpenter's theme song and is a story of a young boy murdering his sister on Halloween night, but that's about all that feels similar. Like it or not, Zombie has brought in his trailer park aesthetic to make the childhood of Michael Myers a living nightmare. No longer a seemingly harmless little boy from a normal family who turned cold-blooded murderer at age 6 for no reason, this Michael Myers seemed to never have a fair shot at a normal future. Stuck with a cruel sister, a string of even more useless and abusive stepfathers, and a well meaning but slightly more self-obsessed mother just trying to make ends meet, the kid was bound to turn out unbalanced.Indeed, the first 30 minutes of Zombie's Halloween are sometimes over the top with their language, but do tend to be aspiring to bring something new to the table. As crudely executed as they are, you get the feeling that you'll at least have an experience you won't forget and that will shed some new light on a familiar, well worn story.It's a pity that Zombie's Halloween does away with this approach mid way through. Michael has his murder spree, gets sent to a mental hospital, and goes mute at some point in his teens and becomes a cold, ruthless killing machine more akin to Carpenter's take on the character than Zombie's more articulate prologue.It quickly becomes a movie that's doomed to please no one - the fans who want a slavish imitation of the original or the ones looking for something new and interesting. By the finale, it's nearly copying scenes shot for shot from Carpenter's film and executing them with less style and ease. The Michael and world from the prologue doesn't seem to mesh with the world from the rest of the movie.A good remake should tell a familiar story in a way or style that makes a re-telling useful or interesting in some way. Rob Zombie's Halloween comes incredibly close to doing that, but drops the ball a little over midway through.",Halloween

502,guillaumerouy,A decent Remake.,8,12 August 2008,"Halloween 2007 is a decent remake.Different in many points than the Original, far more violent and gory, however not scary at all.The movie is divided in two parts. The first part, the most interesting and the difference with the original, present the childhood of Michael Myers. His family nest is purely evil (while in the original, nothing is said about his family, which seems to be normal). Zombie is showing us actually young Michael as a victim : being born and growing up in a very dysfunctional and unbalanced family, and a victim of nasty bullying at school. The result : an evil child with an angel face.The second part is - more or less - the revamp and proper remake of the original. Lots of similarities, nearly the same story. Except the end.While we could have some compassion regarding Michael's state, we lost it when, as a young adult, he managed to escape from his prison, killing everyone, including the nice staff of the institution he stayed for 15 years, and the people who had been nice to him. Now Zombie show us the truth : Michael is... a machine. A killing machine, a Terminator. No brain, no emotion, no mercy.Another difference is that the Psy who is trying to heal Michael died at the end. And also Michael himself, as he received a shot straight to his face.In a whole, this movie is not disappointing. However, Zombie's notorious reputation as a director is there : Abuse of the F word. Long hair - hard-rock type - characters. This movie lacks of fine good acting indeed. In particular Mac Dowell's performance, which is far to be impressive.Use of the original Carpenter's score also reminds us of the original, and is a good asset to the film.In a time when horror films remakes are common in Hollywood and generally very disappointing and purely commercial (""The Omen"", ""The Fog"", and many others), Zombie's Halloween managed to deliver a decent remake, different from the original and worth a viewing for the fans.",Halloween

504,rascal67,Rob Zombie's reshaping of a genre classic is a failure!,2,26 November 2007,"After the impressive 'Devil's Rejects', I eagerly awaited this remake of John Carpenter's seminal 70's horror classic. With Zombie at the helm I had high expectations, but alas, these went unfulfilled. The first part chronicles a young Michael Myers home life, which I feel is totally unnecessary and failed miserably in trying to give Myers some kind of warped reasoning for his psychotic state of mind—nature vs nurture??? The psychology wasn't erudite or edifying enough to ring true. Who Cares what made Michael the monster he became: Michael Myers just is and that is what makes him a personification of pure evil. His enigma is more terrifying than his pathology.The second part–detailing Myers return to Haddonfield several years later–just doesn't hold a candle to the frightening masterpiece Carpenter created almost 30 years ago. As in the best horror films, style and atmosphere should mirror substance to give the viewer something to grasp on too; especially when there is a meager story at play. There are no real genuine scares here just arbitrary shocks and the look of this film is ugly and harsh with unappealing performances from it's main protagonists.Zombie's first 2 cinematic ventures were homages to horror and action films past–ala Tarantino style and succeeded due to his love and passion for the 70's era and mood. He may have done better making a sequel to the abysmal 'Halloween - Resurrection' rather than this turgid remake of the original vision. Watch Steve Miner's terrific ' Halloween H20' instead; or better yet, go back to where it all began.",Halloween
505,MrP823,What a mess!,1,30 August 2007,"Cuz it sure wasn't Halloween. I admit it, I got curious and when a friend told me he had obtained a bootleg copy (which I don't really agree with nor with downloading music illegally), I watched it. What I saw was not only so far removed from being Halloween, it ceased from being a scary movie at all. Not even one second of suspense or build up exists in the version I saw. Even worse is the disjointed feeling I got from watching the intro until the dreadful and boring conclusion. Michael Myers is certainly not The Shape in this movie at all, he's a sympathetic victim of his surroundings who appears usually in plain view throughout the story. In this film, Myers truly is just a guy in a suit with a mask on. No mystique. Period.It's clear that Rob Zombie feels that his visuals must speak for themselves and are so disturbing and so provocative, that they must be scary. Well they aren't. Neither is the transition from the story of a psychotic boy to a 7 foot giant stalking some girls we meet well into the movie. The pacing here is strictly amateur night. Then again we are talking about Zombie and he is an amateur. He's obviously very much in love with himself too.Yes, I'm aware that the theatrical version will be somewhat different, but unless the whole movie was scrapped in favor of a more developed and effective re-telling, I can't imagine that most of the scenes I saw won't still be there left in tact, along with the overall tone which makes up this very pointless and unnecessary experience.",Halloween

507,savagebiteme,Dreadful,2,30 October 2013,Only slightly better than Halloween the curse of Michael Myers. Zombie pretty much lays out that Myers had a screwed up childhood and sets the stage for the later bloodbath. I know this is an update of the original movie but it lacks the charm and scares of the Carpenter version. What makes the original better is that we don't know why he kills he just does. Basically with a higher body count. This movie lacks any real style except in your face violence. I know it's a horror movie and it's supposed to do that. It's about a subtle as being hit over the head repeatedly for 90 minutes. New audiences will Love it. It makes me appreciate the Carpenter version even more.,Halloween

I will only say this much - Michael Myers is - according to Rob Zombie - not scary, just a total as*hole. Even though we're tortured with hours about his childhood and his psychology, in the end he kills people for no reason, even (especially) people who were nice to him.The movie wasn't scary in any way - it was simply disgusting, and ultimately very sad. A dysfunctional family is literally torn apart. A loving - and loved - daughter loses both of her parents and is terrorized by their killer. A doctor who tries to help and find hope in a small child is forced to kill him - and is killed for his trouble. A lonely janitor who thinks he's made a friend is killed by that very friend - a week before his retirement.Yes, Michael Myers is indeed a total pr*ck. But as much of a jerk as he is, it's Rob Zombie who is truly irredeemable - a misanthrope, a misogynist, a homophobe. Well, more than one can play at that game, and what goes around comes around. Suffice to say that I hope Zombie himself is one day disemboweled, his own throat slit, his own anus split open with a barbed dildo. You think I'm kidding? I don't hear anyone laughing.",Halloween
509,Newairbus,"Freud Is His Middle Name, Isn't It?",6,16 November 2007,"Carpenter's original, made or rather released in 1978, has had an incredibly long shelf-life in video rentals. It spent the whole 80s there, whether the question was of self-respecting or -loathing outlets, uptown or downtown. We don't know whether Mr. Carpenter meant his work to be a classic that shouldn't be dusted down. He was part of the posse of Romero, Craven & Hooper, whose mission was first and foremost to scare the **** out of people across America, reflecting the despair at the time; oil crises, urban decay, stagnant technology. Those young men were ""punks"" beyond the world of pop music and their ethos was very much the same; ""Anarchy in America"". Because he has not portrayed himself as a latter-day, say, Hitchcock, an arbiter of Horror and Good taste, could it be that Mr. Carpenter has given Mr. Zombie his blessing for making this movie and is indulging in the end result? After all, Mr. Zombie has had a lot of modern advantages at his disposal that weren't around in 1978.What I want to credit the man for is dusting the dusty VCR version down and making it fit for a DVD release. I believe that the loved the original so much that he wanted to create a version of his own at the expense of his reputation. I see that in the end result where others may only see failure and disrespect. Accordingly, Mr. Zombie's enduring quality might be his tendency to make fright explicit when others make it implicit. There can be three causes for this: A) He is insensitive B) He fears failure unless he raises the stakes Or C) Mr. Zombie just befriended too many back-slapping Bam-Margera types in his social life during this project that a more subtle movie would simply not have been enough. The movie is cut neatly in two parts/hours, as if with a cleaver. The first part is a prequel to all Halloweens, old and new, Halloween 0 so to speak, which details the downward spiral of young Mike Myers. Being part of the white underclass, Michael learns to resort to violence as a first resort. He starts by tormenting and slaying guinea pigs and other hapless critters. It is suggested that he becomes HIM due to his upbringing in hopeless circumstances, for he's not inherently evil. However, there are tons and tons of poor f-word-users who grit their teeth and survive to the next day without murder. And reversely, the middle and upper classes have produced a handful of psychopaths (most famously, ""American Psycho"") with no evident socio-economical-verbal provocation. Home can be Hell, but it doesn't transform its rejected residents into the Devil. The devil is out there, not in here, so the pornographic demographic explanation must go down the drainpipe. As far as I'm concerned, universal reasons for evil are psycho-, not socio-. Logical.After Halloween 0 comes Halloween I, i.e. a remake of the old one. A lone babysitter is the ""love interest"" of the slasher, for reasons revealed in the beginning and the end. This time the babysitter is a loquacious Lindsay-Lohan type unlike original Jamie Lee Curtis, whose job was a more tense and brooding girl. Namely, it is more scary when vile things happen to THOUGHTFUL girls rather than BRAINLESS chicks. It's that Jodie-Foster factor. The brainless somehow deserve **** to happen, since they already are, in a sense, good for nothing in particular other than entertainment. The original Myers family tragedy was set in 1963 and the 11/31 in 1978. The update, rather nicely, sets the former's events as the starting point - judging from the KISS t-shirt on young Mike - so the 11/31 of the update must be taking place sometime in 1993 (a grunge year). This calculation is based on Myers's 15-year incarceration. That could explain the snooty girls, their walk and their talk. At the time of the events Myers would be around 26 years old. What is good and palpable about him is his stature. He is 2.2m tall and greasy hair covers his face from prying eyes. He is a perfect killer, unsympathetic but efficient. He harvests like a machine. Prisons really should not have gear for weightlifting, for how otherwise could Myers have obtained this brawn? It's all the more unlikely that the only one who could kill him is a feckless teenage girl. But it's always like that. Check out ""King Kong."" ""Halloween 0+1"" is actually a variant on the old Beauty & the Beast story. A B-movie, in other words (pun intended).",Halloween

Well, it started off that way, but it's basically a prequel and remake in one movie. The first half is just an unnecessary backstory that gives Myers too much humanity, and takes away his pure evilness, and the second half is just an overly violent rehash of the original. It's not really scary so much as it is kind of disturbing at times, and it pales in comparison to the original. It's pretty bad for the most part, but it's not terrible. It's actually one of the better horror movie remakes I've seen. Michael wasn't scary, Laurie didn't work for me considering Jamie Lee Curtis' excellent portrayal. I did, however, like Malcolm McDowell's performance as Dr. Loomis. It may not be comparable to Donald Pleasance's performance, but it was pretty good I think. Overall, Halloween is just a remake.

Rob Zombie, who I personally feel has directed two great horror movies with 1000 corpses and Devils Rejects, has completely and utterly ruined a classic movie! Yes I know he was never ""remaking"" the original and he was always planning on ""re-telling"" the story from a different perspective - but seriously Mr Zombie, why bother? All you have done is taken great characters and a great story and just made it into a useless, pointless piece of twaddle which should be locked away in movie hell forever! I think spending 55 minutes of movie time building up a character we already know was just stupid, I think making the likable main girl from the original into a foul mouthed, sex obsessed plank was just a waste of time and I think all of the random killings were just plain unnecessary! I award you 1 star Mr Zombie for this terrible movie and that is just because I liked that bit at the beginning where you froze young Michael Myers running away from school and played the classic Halloween theme tune - if you hadn't put that bit in you would get 0 stars!

I am a member on you tube and a lot of people were saying this isn't a good movie. I thought i was in for a disappointing film. I was glad i was wrong. I liked the fact that no one knows if Michael died at the end. What i think is that Laurie kept pulling the trigger and no bullets were coming out and it was kind of like Russian roulette. But suddenly Michael grabbed her arm which you have to observe when you see this film. This could of made her aim go from his face to his shoulder or somewhere near that. But it is definite she got him because of the blood on her face. I really liked this film because when your in it, it doesn't feel like the original series it feels like a whole new start, which is what it could be if someone makes a sequel. Rob Zombie is definitely not doing another but Tyler has signed on for another. So this means there is about a 98% that he didn't get shot in the head because Rob wanted to make Myers human and as everyone knows no one can survive a shot to the head unless its at an angle.I would recommend you see this film if your looking for something different. And there was none of that thorn rubbish which i was glad about.",Halloween
516,vdecaire,A slasher film remake that has actually earned my respect!,7,12 April 2008,"Rob Zombie, as you all most likely know, is one of cinema's most eccentric director, and with ""The Devil's Rejects"" he show'd us what fun and how depraved psychos can be, but rather in (a surprising remake of John Carpenter and Debra Hill's 1978 chiller by the same name) this film he explored the character of the hunter and the hunted, although no development actually takes place; I'm glad that at least one slasher film does what it can in character exploration, and shows the struggle and hurt of the protagonist. With a interesting role for Malcolm McDowell-a good one at that- who plays Dr. Samuel Loomis, the character who tried to find the decency in the killer, a quest that was never completed, but instead, Myers got worse. And a killer was born. The plot revolves around Myers, and goes from the terribly depressing and harrowing exploration of his childhood with a caring but absent-minded mother, an abusive step-father, and an older sister; who all somehow lead Myers to his downfall. On Halloween night, a night he treasures, no one will take him out trick-or-treating, instead he sits in the kitchen contemplating whether he should forget about Halloween, or pull the biggest knife you've ever seen and chop up his family, all except his mother and baby sister. The killings in the film are done tastelessly, and that somehow makes the image Zombie was trying to create even stronger, the more guts and nudity in the film, the more potent the sub-text is to the viewer. The second part of the film, following terrible digression at the mental hospital, and suicide of his mother, he escapes and makes a road trip all the way back home, for Halloween night. He stalks his baby sister (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends, only to create a bloodbath for the three baby sisters. An intelligent point of both films, is when the child that she is babysitting is going on and on about 'the boogyman' there actually a soulless maniac out there waiting to spring. There are certainly very intense moments in the film so no children or squeamish should even think about watching this, but fans of Zombie, slasher-horror, or just looking for a good movie will like this film. The scene where Laurie Strode (Taylor-Compton) is up in the rafters of the abandoned Myers' house, and Michael is using a giant log to smash holes where she is hiding will literally make your heart stop. I doubt that if McDowell wasen't in it, Zombie haden't have directed it, this would be yet another typical clichéd film.",Halloween
517,Mdgeist316,"Excellent beginning, terrible ending with too many out of place scenes.",4,12 February 2008,"I had pretty high hopes with this one. Rob Zombie impressed me with House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. However, those were movies that fit Zombie's persona completely and the fact they were his original creations. Halloween is not a movie that can be handled lightly, and Zombie fails in this one to show his flexibility as a director and writer. Where this movie really shines is in the first hour. Michael Myers development and background was very well done. I don't tend to think Myers was the product of some white-trash family, but it was good for what it was. Sherri-Moon Zombie was excellent in her role, and I was very impressed to see that she can be a great actress. End the movie with his development and relationship with Dr. Loomis, and it would've been a classic.The big problem is the true ""remake"" part of the movie or at least when Myers becomes an adult. This is where Zombie's writing and directing fall apart. When we do reach the familiar scenes, Zombie forgets to leave out of that ""white-trash"" mindset that worked with his other movies. The girls who were victims this time were whiny and bitchy, not to mention very unbelievable. If you've seen the scene with Laurie and her mom in the opening, you'll know what I mean. Who really talks to their mother like that? Then, as expected, Zombie increases the violence meter and the death count dramatically. He also adds in a couple of sex scenes with our two female victims. The ending was equally ridiculous. By this time, I didn't care anymore as it showed me that Rob Zombie should stick to original works, and never touch another remake again (maybe he would be better suited to remake something like Last House on the Left).Overall, it's a slightly entertaining movie. The first half was very, very good and by far the best part of the movie. The second half is where it ultimately fails. If Rob Zombie is to become a horror icon, he must learn to be flexible when making certain projects and realize that gore is not a replacement for tension and building atmosphere. It upsets me because this movie was bordering on being one of the few really great remakes if it weren't for the out of place moments, and Zombie's need to turn his characters into guests from the Jerry Springer show. It's entertaining, and I could watch it again. However, this is one I won't be seeking out on my own.",Halloween
518,rogerebertisfat,Horrible script and dialogue+horrible directing=GARBAGE,1,2 September 2007,"I read this review online and agree with it 100%. I also added a little of my own two cents:The young kid playing Michael does a good job. But that's about the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Overall, it's the same old trendy remake bulls**t. Oh and for the record, I thought his first two movies were pure garbage as well. Zombie needs to have an accomplished screenwriter help him polish his scripts and help with dialogue 'cause that dialogue is horrible. I've said this before, I swear all the time, but his characters use of swear words is so over the top that's the words actually lose any kind of power they have. It actually becomes silly as hell and extremely annoying. Really dumb a** scenes like Michael, instead of driving by slowly and watching the girls from a distance, walks around in plain site. Then he just stands there in the middle of the street, literally, and stares while the girls react in a very unrealistic way by yelling at him and saying ridiculous things like: ""Hey you f***ing creep, you want some of the young stuff? Well come and get it you f***ing perv!"" and ""Hey! A**hole! My daddy's the sheriff so why don't you go crawl back under the f***ing rock you came from?"" That's some pretty f***king horrible dialogue. There's also the ridiculous scene where adult Michael somehow locates Laurie's adoptive parents and kills them for no-apparent-reason. And I don't know what's up with Hollywood and this new love of that horrible shaky-cam, but I didn't expect it in a horror movie made by a supposed ""old-school horror fan."" The only good thing about the back-story was the little kid who played young Michael. Other than that, it's pointless. So little Michael got yelled at by his stepfather, big deal. He was ignored by his sister and bullied a bit in school, boo hoo! So he wasn't taken trick-or-treating? Oh no! LOTS of people have experienced this. Why would that make him a killer? His mother loved him and treated him good. Now, if his ENTIRE family beat him through his whole life and he got beat up and picked on throughout his school days, then maybe it would be believable that he would become a psycho killer. But Zombie didn't show enough abuse, in my opinion, to make a believable reason why he kills. Rob Zombie said in some magazine interview that he wanted to ""make things line up and have a reason WHY Michael has that mask. It's not just like oh, he robbed a hardware store so if they didn't have that mask then he'd be wearing a Ronald Reagan mask 'cause that's the one he stole?"" So that's why Rob Zombie thought of the genius idea that Michael's sister's boyfriend brought the mask into the house? THAT is some amazing reason ""WHY"" he has that mask? That kills his argument because if the boyfriend would've had a Yoda mask, then Michael would've been wearing a Yoda mask. Anyway, that's something trivial that doesn't really ruin the movie. What ruins the movie is the unrealistic dialogue, the pointless back-story that really doesn't convince why Michael becomes a killer, the horrible shaky-cam, and the horrible direction. ALL of the characters, especially Dr. Loomis, are way too calm and nonchalant about Michael being out and killing people. How am I supposed to believe that Michael's THAT dangerous and scary if no one, not even his doctor, is freaking out about it? And for f**k's sake, Michael broke out, murdered a bunch of people to deliver an old picture to his sister???? Is Rob Zombie serious? How RETARDED. And why the hell doesn't Michael talk to his sister, who doesn't have the slightest idea who the hell he is by the way, when he CLEARLY has the ability to SPEAK? He's very capable of speech since his youth, so why would he just hand over an old picture and then stare like an imbecile? Overall, the movie just plain sucked. Definitely belongs in the same boat as one of the crappier remakes. But honestly, even if it weren't a remake, everything I mentioned still would make for one crappy movie. Seriously, the original ""Halloween"" wouldn't even have to exist for this movie to be garbage. Oh I also forgot to add, and I know that a lot of directors do this, but why the hell does Zombie use the SAME actors in EVERY movie he makes? Especially putting his talentless wife in all of his movies is really annoying. If she had any REAL talent, wouldn't she be in other people's projects that weren't directed by her husband?",Halloween
519,rob30316,Worse than I feared,3,21 October 2007,"Remaking Halloween is a daunting task, but I thought Rob Zombie, of all people, would at least show the original the respect it deserves. Not so. The most terrifying aspect of Carpenter's classic is that Michael Myers is never explained--he exemplifies that aspect of human nature that we try to ignore. While making Michael the abused product of disgusting white trash creates a sympathetic villain (which is always interesting), it also undermines the real horror of the film. No amount of violence and gore can compensate. And there's violence and gore galore. So much, in fact, that half way through the film I was yawning at the brutality. I just stopped caring. And why would I care about the spoiled, obnoxious protagonists? Without warning, you're plunged into the shallow, myopic world of high school cheerleaders. Laurie Strode doesn't even come off as being smarter than or 'above' the others; she's equally annoying and pathetic. I was disappointed that she didn't die. This may be the worst installment in the Halloween series. Despite the extreme violence, despite the high body count, it's a castrated version of the original. Carpenter's film was much scarier and far more insightful. I give it 3 stars instead of 1 because of the scenes with Sheri Moon Zombie--not because she was in them, but because they were really emotional. You had to feel for her trying to love such a disturbed child. The other star is for what I think of as Zombie's trademark--no one in his movies dies without making you sympathize with their pain and fear. In most slasher flicks, the victims just die--Zombie really shows them hurting and afraid. It's very unpleasant, but I have to give him credit for not glossing over murder. That's my 2 cents, anyway.",Halloween
520,john_perry,"I appreciate the new direction, but still...",5,11 March 2009,"I went into Rob Zombie's version of ""Halloween"" not expecting a simple rehash of the 1978 classic. I was not expecting another ""Scream""-era slasher either. Given Zombie's previous film, the solid ""Devil's Rejects"", I knew this baby was going to be gritty, grisly, and disturbing.For the most part, I was right. The film explores Michael Myers' past more than the original - his upbringing right up unto the point where he is institutionalized. This half of the film I quite enjoyed, as we get to see Zombie's version of how Michael grew up, and why he became the psychopath he did. Especially due to the performance of Sheri Moon Zombie - she completely abandoned her ""Baby Firefly"" character to bring forward a touching portrayal of the loving mother of a disturbed child.Then, halfway through the film, it flashes forward to present day for Michael's escape. This is where the film stumbles. Instead of introducing 3 cute, likable teen would-be victims, we are introduced to 3 obnoxious, potty-mouthed, completely despicable vixens. In addition, while the performances are OK, the dialogue was so awful that I found myself squirming.In conclusion, I think Rob Zombie did a better job on a ""Halloween"" remake than most of today's horror directors. In general, it should have either been left untouched, or kept as a prequel. I would have much more enjoyed an entire movie that explored Michael's childhood, but ended before his escape.",Halloween
521,chrisbarker187,No.,5,25 October 2014,"(sighs) Well, it's no surprise Halloween was going to be remade. But for f**k sake, this is just crude. First of all the back story is horrible. ""Lil' Mikey"" looks like a ""Lil Girl"" and it seems virtually impossible that a small chubby ten year old boy/girl could turn into a 6'9 freak of nature. The plot is basically the same as the original so there's nothing to look forward too. The swearing is atrocious, the nudity is unacceptable, the kills and body count are OTT. And one thing that really pisses me off is that Danielle Harris is a f**king slut in this one, so that ruined her image from H4-H5. Michael has long hair and the mask, granted is one of the best in the series, well, the clean version anyway, is all rotted and Michael looks more like Leatherface. Haddonfield was supposed to be a quiet town, but in this it's a white trash, hillbilly, foul mouthed mess. All in all, this film is bad BUT it could have been worse. I suppose this film does have some positives. The acting was fine, the cast was fine, the theme was good, the setting was good, Tyler Mane was good as Myers, Malcolm McDowell was a good Loomis, Scout Taylor Compton was good as Laurie, and Brad Dourif was good as Sheriff Bracket. But yet again this film is still bad.",Halloween

I really recommend this movie and also if you can watch the Haloween 20 years later movie it will help you to understand more, may be as many people you will fall in love with the story, and its OK because its well thinked.

And the first couple times I saw it, I was i love with, I even gave it 9 out of 10 stars on here.2 years later and so wisdom in my head, I've come to realize how much better it could have been. I honestly think Michael shouldn't be this much explained, point blank, I feel like I'm going for the ride with him, not with the victim, which to me isn't scary or all that interesting.Yes some scenes were great but most were just hard to watch (i.e rape scene, all the swearing.) And it's not because I think swearing is bad but when every other word is ""fuck"" or some other swear word in tends to be very unrealistic and makes me WANT the characters to die.Hopefully this summer's H2 will be a little better, but I'm not expecting much.",Halloween
524,marshallemerica,A remade thriller worth seeing x2 really WOW,9,2 September 2007,"OK I have to give Rob Zombie a pat on the back for this movie he remade. There are rules when re making a classic movie that have seem to become boring and over done. Mr.Zombie broke all of them with this remake. First he pretty much stuck with the amazing shots that get you along with the angles that cause you to jump or get your heart beating faster. Second the make up slash costumes were the best that they have ever been in the Halloween series amazing, so he has the first one beat on that aspect. And of course the music was good you think Mr.Zombie would blow that aspect I think not!!! And the part that seems to matter more then anything the acting???? I can not really complain for the talent you expect in a teen slasher film some of the screams were suntanning amazing. The performance of our killer was just spectacular the death scenes have been toped with the remake still not over the top not as low as hostels brutality, but tasteful just like the rest of the movie showed. The only thing I did not like was the useless nudity and yes I am a male too love women, but not needed in this film. They say that sexual business and horror work well to a degree but not for me. So this is getting a 9/10 from myself just a movie you should see, but I would jump in a seat at the box office and not wait!!!!!",Halloween

I like the fact that there was more background info on Michael than the original had. But there were some things I think they could have done better. I think that they should have picked a better young Michael. This kid is a good actor but come on, killer? No. Also, they could have surprised me more, all the deaths were to predictable and somewhat corny. The only death I didn't see coming was the murder of Laurie's foster parents. But everything else was to predictable. Also, I think they should have hid the fact that Michael's suppose to be invincible from people who've never seen the original. But instead they give it a way when he first gets shot by the cop. Some stuff, I expected, as in all the gore, thats basically Rob Zombies trademark though so I had to expect that. This film was okay, it's not going to scare the bejeebus out of you but it's worth seeing once. It will never top the original by any means though.",Halloween

This is a love it or hate it movie and which side you are on depends on how attached you are to the original.To those of us that are big fans of the original series (even the shitty ones)and buy into ""The Shape"" being unexplained pure evil, carefully stalking his prey with no emotion; this version of Michael Myers is more the angry wrestler type that breaks a lot of things with vengeance as a motive just doesn't represent the Halloween franchise as we know it. That's all there is to really say about it.If you never cared for or never even saw the originals then you will probably enjoy this for the horror movie it is.

It does show a lot more of MICHAELS childhood and some of the reasons of why he is the way he is. Now listen, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN!!!!! This movie is a lot more graphic and adult in nature than the original. From extreme gore to some very explicit language and explicit full frontal nudity. If you take younger children you will be covering eyes and ears most of the night! The first 30 to 40 minutes seem to drag on abit, but after that hold on tight.

It is yet another drawn out Horror Flick. The Plot of the story was basically the same as any other Halloween Movie but they added in the ""beginning"" of when he was a child.Which was it seems the only difference in the film.This Movie held my attention for the first 30 Min's then I just continued to watch it because I had thought it was going to be just what the Warnings had stated, after the movie ended I couldn't wait to leave. The Warnings say that it was ""Rated R for strong brutal bloody violence and terror throughout, sexual content, graphic nudity and language. So overall you saw the same amount of blood and gore as the last 8 Halloween films. I would say overall this movie is more a of suspense than anything else. I jumped out of my seat twice but thats only because I wasn't expecting some parts that occurred to have happened the way they did. I would say that if you wanted to see a Real Horror film go complain to the Directors and the Company that made the film.These Cheesy horror flicks have been going on for some time now, its time for a change and if we as the People who view these films don't act on anything then we will continue to have these childish films forever.",Halloween

Zombie made this film the way he felt it should have been and I respect him for that. In my opinion a little bit to bloody for my taste, but that's what was so great about the original it was scary enough without the blood. I did like that Michael came from a dysfunctional family which differs from the classic where he came from a normal family. Coming from a messed up family kind of shows why he is whacked.

And it wasn't overdone. I don't think I've ever seen a two hour horror movie, but this kept my attention from the beginning to the end. It was kind of good to see Michael Myers as a person and not just a faceless killer with a mask and a butcher knife. Now, I'm not saying I feel any empathy for him. He was still a complete psychopath. But I thought the movie did what our generation wants from any movie we see....a little bit of substance.

Maybe mostly due to the fact that I'm older now and have seen many films in the last decade, some great some not-so-great, I would put this in the not-so-great category. The first half of the movie I found completely boring, full of unneeded terrible dialogue and acting, and even a rape scene if you're watching the directors cut. The second half of the movie, while much more interesting, seemed mostly like an excuse for more violence, a Rob Zombie selected soundtrack, and nudity; although admittedly with better acting. While the idea of Michael's backstory is an interesting concept, this version depicts Michael as a completely heartless killer; murdering the innocent psychward guard in the first half, and later attempting to murder Dr. Loomis... It's like the first quarter of the film wants you to sympathize with young Michael, but any other scene leaves Michale completely uninteresting as he becomes merely a vessel to deliver more gore and violence.
For so many years I've called this movie ""my favorite Halloween""... Nothing will ever be as good as the original.",Halloween

The original is special and is obviously more tension based rather than gore based, but Zombie makes films that go overkill on gore which is what I liked.
The backstory definitely dragged don't don't get me wrong but if you wanted some kind of origin for Myers it's not horrible, on the other hand if you still want to see Myers as a almost supernatural force of nature the original is definitely the route to go.
Overall I'd give this a 7/10 and call it a change of tone for the character of Michael Myers and a definite must watch for a slasher movie fan.",Halloween

The original is perhaps my favorite horror film, it terrified me as a kid and I still watch it a couple of times a year. What stands out is that that with very little gore Carpenter managed to ramp up the thrilling tension to breaking point with the use of suggestion and that fantastic score pumping away in the background.The remake goes in the opposite direction, it is filmed in a very matter of fact way, almost like a documentary studying Michael Myers from childhood. The first long scenes set the tone for the rest of the film, constant arguing and swearing in Michael's home in front of a small crying baby, Michael's sister, very dark and they leave a bad taste in your mouth. It is much more Michael's film than Laurie's film. The murders happen with almost no tension or buildup really, cold and vicious, gore gore gore.It is to be applauded that they tried to do something very very different with the same story but at the end of the day I just didn't find it satisfying, I wanted excitement, there is very little, I wanted jumps and thrills... they go for clinical examination.

539,mikestaley78,Destroying a Classic!,2,23 September 2007,"I like a lot of viewers had high hopes going into this movie. Usually I am a Rob Zombie fan, as he has made some good horror flicks in the past. This however was not one of them. I agree with a lot of folks that the back story on Mikey's upbringing made him seem human and not as scary as the original. The original Michael never uttered a sound except the disturbing breathing sounds uttered from his mask. This character talked for probably the first 30 minutes and actually was kind of funny when he was talking to Dr. Loomis. He seemed like a dorky kid who one day started slaughtering every person he encountered except his mother and baby brother? sister? I thought it was a boy until the plot developed further. When he grows up he is ridiculously huge and looks like a member of Slipknot. From here the movie really begins to derail badly. Shamelessly ripping off lines from the first movie, quick sex and even quicker violence is only half the problem with this movie. My personal favorite was the Ben Trammer reference from the first movie that was thrown in there for obvious comic effect. Where Rob Zombie really failed in this movie was how Laurie Strode was portrayed. In the original Jamie Lee Curtis was a sweet, naive girl who was scared to talk to boys and had an innocence about her. This incarnation of Laurie Strode is your typical high school slut,and ultimately we don't care if she lives or dies. My least favorite part of the movie was the darkness of it and the insane fight scenes between Mikey and Laurie. For like the last 30 minutes they are fighting in what seems like pitch black. I understand what Zombie was trying to do, but it was annoying. Because of this, the viewer really did not know what the hell was going on. Laurie was in the walls, the ceilings, the fence and the whole time Mikey was jabbing his knife or stick into these attempting to kill her. It was hard to even see what was going on. Then the movie has a false ending and then really ends. Who cares at this point? What a shame. My high point of the movie was seeing the lovely Danielle Harris topless for about ten minutes. All in all this movie was a waste. Poor story, bad coloring in the film, although nice topless scene with Danielle Harris. Preceed at your own risk.",Halloween
540,Souless27,I've only seen the first 45 minutes...,1,17 July 2008,"And I can say that this is truly a major insult to the original. I honestly want to just ask Rob Zombie....'Why? Why do you continue making the worst films of our time with the exact same type of characters, plots, direction etc that most people time and time again hate?! Don't waste your money! Save it and go to a shrink!' There's the obvious abysmal acting, retarded dialogue and lack of direction that make this film just absolute dung but the insult to the original comes from Zombie's molestation of the original Michael Myers tale. People will call this a 're-make that delves a bit deeper into Michael's origin' but in actuality it's just Zombie's own duplicated, idiotic story with the title 'Halloween' slapped on it in order to dupe people into actually watching his crap.Zombie goes into this whole extremely dysfunctional, abusive, sexually perverted childhood thus making Michael the monster he is. And I have to just shake my head in disgust as Zombie COMPLETELY misses the root horror of the original (and the following 100 sequels) in that Myers never had a reason to commit any of the atrocities that he did. No one knew why he was so evil and why he killed anyone that came within range. He didn't have the traumatic childhood past of Manson or Gacy...he had the perfect suburban family and he murdered his sister in cold blood at the age of six (not ten...again Zombie you miss the f'in point!). No reason, no remorse...in fact no emotion at all, like he was in a trance. That is the basis of the whole Michael Myers horror.I'm actually just getting myself worked up writing this review so I think I'm done.",Halloween

542,SinnerStar,Had This Been An Original Film It Would Be A Horror Classic,8,17 September 2007,"When I first heard of a Halloween remake (""it's actually a re-imagining"" someone involved with the film quoted) I was utterly disgusted. Where have all the good writers gone, can no-one be arsed to make a genuinely new film, there's so many re-makes out there they're coming out of my ears, I can't hear my self think! Apart from Saw there have been no original horror films released for a decade, and unfortunately Saw has opened up the flood gates for too many horror/torture films to be released that they are now old hat.I think back a year or so and you have another John Carpenter classic being re-made - The Fog - it was utter tripe, worst film ever! So with semi-bated breath I sit down to watch Rob Zombie's Halloween ...... and I was blown away.The back story about how a cute little kid became a mask wearing psycho is excellent, no boring chat for half of the film with no real action but great story telling, great acting and some great acts of violence.This is what I wanna see when I watch a horror movie and it's even got the original John Carpenter synthesizer theme tune (you could play that tune during a Bugs Bunny film and you'd be looking over your shoulder for someone lurking in the shadows) Why it was deemed this film needed an updated version making, I don't know, how Rob Zombie went from awful House Of 1,000 Corpses to the bizarre sequel The Devils Rejects to a remake of Halloween is anyone's guess, but I am glad he did.Point to note - Malcolm McDowell acted his socks off !",Halloween
543,Jericho1138,One of the re-makes that sucks sh@^!!!!,5,9 November 2007,"OK, I'm 16 years old. But despite my age I have seen the original Halloween. And I have to say that this film is crap. At first I liked the movie, but after I thought about it I realized this movie sucks. The 1978 original was really a 70's movie, the actresses were pretty for that time. But now they're average looking to us now. They weren't skin and bone skinny they had some meat on their bones and they wore clothes that weren't that revealing. But in this 2007 Halloween it really showed how far Hollywood has sunk. The actresses in the 07 version were so skinny they looked the twigs, they wore clothes that showed almost everything. But granted in this remake it took place in present day. The actress that played Lorie Strode has this high pitched annoying ass voice that made me wanting her to die. And I kid you not, every girl that was killed in the 07 version showed their boobs at one point in the film. The only reason I give this movie a 7 is b/c that it was more about Micheal than Lorie. Lorie was just more of a target. And the other reason is b/c Malcolm McDowell played Dr. Loomis, he's one of my favorite actors. So 7/10.",Halloween
544,coco200066,My Review...Don't spend your money!,1,23 September 2007,"God Awful...don't bother! The original Halloween is such a classic and in my mind no need to be remade, however if your going to remake it, please make it a good one! I personally think Rob Zombie sucks when it comes to movies, not because there isn't gore and horror but just because he sucks at making the characters and story line believable.In this remake, you don't know if your looking at scenes from the 70's, 80's or what, yet the guy who plays Donald Pleasant's character is carrying a very modern cell phone! Malcolm McDowell is a good actor and I am surprised that he went for this part, it was very weak and I feel sorry for him that he has had to add this to movies he has been involved with! On a side note, his character seem so self absorbed in the movie that honestly I am not surprised poor Michael Myers stopped talking, he was probably hoping the good doc would shut the hell up or eventually go away lol! I could see that maybe Rob Zombie was going for the more ""real"" Michael Myers, a screwed up kid and why he was that way. If left at that and nothing to do with Halloween, he could have had something really good IMHO, however the constant back and forth of making Michael Myers ""real"" as opposed to a remake of the old movie was just annoying and God awful! My advise, AVOID THIS MOVIE WITH A TEN FOOT BARGE POLE, as we say back in the old country lol! Or if you have to absolutely see this tragedy of a bastardization of a cult classic, don't even rent it, borrow it from some other poor sap that paid the rental fee!",Halloween

546,criddic2,Another pointless remake,3,2 June 2008,"The original Halloween was fresh and different, and it remains an entertaining film. I can understand why years and years of sequels and imitations have diminished its effectiveness for some people. The newer generations are used to slick CGI and big-budgeted gore-fests that move at break-neck speed and don't develop their characters. So maybe they feel that ""Halloween,"" ""The Omen,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Birds"" and the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" lack action or feel ""dated."" I disagree with them on that point, as I think if you watch any of those without dwelling on when they were made or how CGI might look in them, you know with a fresh attitude, most people would come away having enjoyed them. Not all of those films were masterpieces, but each one was a true original that inspired countless imitations over the years. The influence of each of them has been felt for decades in the film world and in the popular culture.The real problem with Rob Zombie's remake is not that it is a remake, or ""reimagining,"" but that it doesn't tell us anything very interesting about its characters. Did we really need to know what Michael Myers' childhood was like? No. Dr. Loomis tells us a lot about him in the first movie. Why do we need a visual of every move Myers' made? That is the why horror movies don't really work anymore. There is no mystery. Every detail is explained and seen; every drop of blood has to be shown, and every thought each character thinks has to be spoken out loud. It's all so unnecessary.What happened to suspense? What happened to shadows and the hint of something sinister? The first ""Halloween"" movie, the only true original in the entire series, played with our fears and our expectations. It used a relatively small, make that incredibly small, budget to great effect by being creative. The bigger budget for this latest merely makes the makeup effects and the sets a bit slicker.I will credit Mr. Zombie with knowing his way around technical details of film-making, but all his effort has gone into a completely pointless remake. We learn nothing new worth knowing about Michael Myers or his world. There are minimal chills. It fits snuggly into the mediocre pile of sequels that followed the 1978 film. It may be slightly better made than some of them, but feels just as stale as Part II or IV.",Halloween
547,davidtmanforever,"It's stupid, cheap, pathetically predictable, and - worst of all - boring as all hell",1,3 September 2007,"Before I say ANYTHING about this movie, I would like to point out that I am a big fan of Rob Zombie's music and I think his band is the best rock band ever, second to Led Zeppelin. I have never seen the original and don't plan to, after this abomination from hell. I had a terrible night, last night. I feel as if i have sucked two great big dog-cocks, because I just got back from seeing Halloween and guess what? It sucked more dicks then stoned gay freaks on a Saturday night!!! The first five minutes of the movie were actually pretty funny, but then it just gets stupid. It's stupid because there's nothing special about it. It's just one of those cheap-ass guy-trying-to-kill-everyone movies. Also, Rob Zombie made it. I was hoping to hear his songs during the killing scenes. His songs like ""Dragula"" and ""Pussy Liquor"" I love his music and all I got was a f#@$ing stupid-ass music score with a bunch of scary orchestral music. And the movie is so boring and pathetically predictable, that I actually walked out on it, within the first 1 3/4 hours. This was the very first movie that I EVER WALKED OUT ON. I'm serious. And when the girls screamed, it was like being raped in both your ears. It was boring, it was stupid, it was acted terribly, and I just wanted it to end. I gave the movie a chance to be liked by me (a huge movie fan). But this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've seen some bad movies before. Like ""House of the Dead"", ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"", ""Norbit"", and others, but this is so horrible it makes the films I just named look like GOOD MOVIES! The only thing good about the movie was the hot girls and the first 5 mins. Other than that, it sucked f#@$ing ass. I give it a well-deserved 1/10. The worst movie I have ever seen, 2nd to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"". Avoid it at all costs. I just wanted to let you know, so that you wouldn't make the same mistake, I did. Have a nice day.",Halloween
548,arcticlvr1,"Rob Zombie's ""Halloween""",7,31 August 2007,"I want to start out by saying that for all you Halloween fans...THIS IS NOT JOHN CARPENTER'S VERSION!!!! THIS IS ROB ZOMBIE""S TAKE ON THE MOVIE. I am a huge fan of the John Carpenter/Debra Hill ""Halloween"", which at the end of the movie in the credits the line says, THIS MOVIE IS ""BASED ON THE MOVIE BY JOHN CARPENTER AND DEBRA HILL"" I wish I could highlight based a little more. Anyway, being a fan, I went into this and put the old version behind and thought of it as a new movie. I enjoyed the beginning of telling the story of how Myers became the murderer he is. I also enjoyed the final act of the movie that is loosely based on the original version. As far as the increased bloodshed, cursing, and nudity, well, I loved it.There are some things I didn't like though. First, I think some of the actors were poor, and that took away from the second act of the movie. Also, Zombie should have went a little more in depth of what drove Myers home to find his sister since he took all the time to show how he became who he is. And the ending, which I will not say, but will tell that it left me unfulfilled. Other than that, the movie is well worth seeing if you are a horror fan and are looking for a new take on an old classic. Just remember, forget about the original and think of this as a new movie and you should enjoy this film. The reviews are mostly negative and that is just not true of this movie.....I didn't give this a 9 rating because of the acting in the second act.",Halloween
549,guse23,didn't expect much but still,3,3 September 2007,"What can I say about this movie? It wasn't meant to live up to the original Halloween. But at the same time I feel it should have at least attempted. While it did show much more effort than the Black Christmas remake, that's not saying much. While I found it interesting that Zombie would try to go back and create a real history to Michael, which I could see satisfying a lot of Thorn Cult haters, to try to explain how a child goes from kid to killer, it seems appropriate to suggest that next time Zombie go out and actually do some creative research so we're not watching a tired cliché background that can be seen in every other psycho movie with the vocab. of the F-word used as every other word. Only good thing that came of this is the character of Deborah Myers who was actually likable and well played. But did we really need a ""Love Hurts"" montage between her and Michael? Zombie's idea to reinvent this movie was basically just to make it more vulgar and enforce his prejudice view against the good guys. His obsession with making the villains the heroes and the heroes into nothing is what, to me, ruined the movie the most. What made the original Halloween so great wasn't just Michael it was the strength that was Laurie. The chaste and sweet schoolgirl pushed into a kill or be killed situation, and when she arose to itbeautiful. The closest we got to that in this movie was a pair of glasses and a chair through a window. This Laurie had no real personality, lacked smarts, was whiny, and while was somewhat likable was more so annoying. By the way she was pretty dirty mouthed (esp. in front of her mom).It was interesting to see the rewrite on Dr Loomis but we saw so many sides of him stretched through time he didn't have any sort of effect on us. You can say ""hey the actor did a good job"" but nothing about the character he played. Lynda was so pointless in this movie they should have just molded her into Annie's character which would have added greatly to the story. Also Sheriff Brackett made Deputy Dewey look like Sheriff Brackett from the original Halloween. But on more then one level I give kudos to the Strode family.This movie proved to be repetitive. (sorta spoilerish) Two similar death beatings, two breasted attack scenes, two ""carry the body away"" scenes. Another issue which Rob Zombie needs to learn is that if you're gonna cram death scenes down our throat because you can't figure out how to work the story together better at least try and make them good.The infamous Myers mask. Looks not badunless it's on a child! It ruined the Michael Myers image and gave a ridiculous Herman Munster vibe.Zombie's attempt to make a movie half prequel half remake was a success, if you cut the movie in half. First half and second didn't mold as well as expected. And the entire movie came out more a made for TV autobiography movie. Did I see an evolution of Michael? Sort of yes. But it was done too cliché and shallow to really be effective. And with that fifteen year jump that just killed it. So really a movie specifically made to recreate a character from scratch until the final scene where he would be the killer we'd watch in awe, really came down to a bland story and a lame reattachment in a decent mask.Worth seeing? Not really but sure why not? Probably best to wait until it hits DVD.",Halloween
550,lostanddelirious85,Zombie was completely wrong for this.,3,28 July 2008,"I think anyone expecting this to be a true remake of John Carpenter's 1978 original should be warned that this is a Rob Zombie film, and if you've seen either of his previous efforts then you should know what to expect.Zombie is a shock rocker, and he's carried that with him as far as his film-making efforts go. So why exactly he was chosen to helm the remake of a film that relied on subtle imagery and suspense is beyond me. And predictably, this film has none of the qualities that made the original such a classic.The problem isn't that Zombie had a different vision of the material, but that his vision is just plain bad.To begin, this movie is littered with so many cringe-worthy lines, I almost felt embarrassed for it. Malcolm McDowell seemed to have been handed the worst of them--some of his dialog in this film is just truly awful.The kitchen scene in the film's opening is laughably bad in its attempt to portray the Myers' home as this disgusting trailer park environment. Because of course, Michael's violent tendencies have to be explained by way of his poor upbringing.The main ""meat"" of the film, the stalking of Laurie Strode and her high school friends, doesn't come around until nearly an hour into the movie. Then we are treated to a rushed cut and paste ""remake"" of the original that moves along with barely any time for the viewer to invest any emotional connection with the characters at all.I didn't give a damn whether Laurie or her friends lived or died, I was so detached from them.Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be a capable actress, but pales in comparison to Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. She does her job, but doesn't bring anything to the role. The rest of the characters are typical Zombie creations: loud, obnoxious, foul-mouthed and incredibly annoying. Zombie seems to have the monopoly on creating gratingly annoying characters, especially female characters.As for Malcolm McDowell, I am at a loss to understand how an actor that worked with Stanley Kubrick could put it in such an awful performance. His line delivery in this is terrible, as was his whole over-the-top performance. At times I got the idea that Zombie was intentionally going for this approach, but I remain undecided.The suspense of the original is replaced by moments of brutal violence and gore, which means this is body count movie in the strictest sense during the last half.I was also disappointed that, for a movie being set on Halloween night, this film had very little Halloween atmosphere to it at all. Oh, we do see Jack O' Lanterns and some paper decorations, but the true spirit of Halloween night is missing in this.I did enjoy seeing Danielle Harris make a return to the big screen as Annie, however. Too bad her character was paper-thin and she wasn't given much to do.In the end, there's nothing to really recommend seeing this movie. I guess as an exercise in sheer violence, it does okay, but as a scary, suspenseful movie, it fails miserably. You just can't mix the style of ""The Devil's Rejects"" with ""Halloween"" and expect a positive outcome.",Halloween
551,moonpig82,Not as bad as i expected it to be,7,9 July 2008,I put off seeing this film for a long time because i think the original Halloween is fantastic. However the other night there was nothing to watch on TV (again) and i was in the mood for horror so i watched it. And i enjoyed it. It was nowhere near as good as Carpenter's version of course but i've seen a lot worse. One of the things that put me off from seeing the movie was knowing there was a back story for Michael Myers. I didn't agree with it at first but i ended up thinking it was a good idea. It was the best part of the film and interesting to watch .I noticed that Sherri Zombie has been criticised in other comments for her acting but i thought she was fine. None of the acting is Oscar worthy but it's adequate enough and it was good to see familiar faces such as Brad Dourif pop up. The teenage characters aren't as irritating as in other films and Laurie is still a likable character. Michael Myers resembles a heavy metal rocker in places but he's more powerful. The film is much more gruesome than the original but none of it is that bad and it's all really well done. It's not scary and it's predictable when it comes to which characters will be killed off. There's also a really cheesy moment i could have done without-young Michael sitting outside his house after his sister has refused to take him trick or treating while Love Hurts plays but none of it's flaws would stop me watching it again. And it's much better than The Devil's rejects or the awful House of 1000 Corpses.,Halloween
552,somesunnyday,Gets good when imitating Carpenter,6,29 November 2007,"Sometimes, some things are better left unsaid Mr Zombie. The first half of this film that goes into great detail about Michael Myers terrible childhood is so graphically violent that it makes you squirm and feel nauseous during some scenes. Mind you, this feeling is not to be mistaken for being on the edge of your seat, like any good horror movie should do.The reality is, who really cares about the background of a slasher monster? Although, I quite liked the idea of describing Michael as the ""perfect storm"", a human that has just the right combination of natural inclination, coaxed along by their environment to become a killing machine such as Mr Myers.The second half of the film that copies the original feel of Carpenter's version is when things start to get interesting. The use of the original music score and Carpenter's tricks of the trade combined with the knowledge of how vicious and dangerous Michael Myers is was quite effective I thought. That was 'edge of your seat' stuff.Anyhow, hats off to Zombie for doing a pretty good job overall.",Halloween
553,toytrainbob,A Utter Failure of a Remake,3,9 September 2007,"Take a classic film with a simple theme of a purely evil ""boogie man"" and turn it into psycho babble where every change to the original story greatly weakens the film. Why I like the original is the idea of a man born purely evil and one who cannot be destroyed. The fear that you can raise your children well, come from a middle class small town American community, do everything right and still create a monster. Now change the story--make the child older, put a family in the town of Haddonfield where they were complete misfits, give us a left wing explanation of how to create a psychopath, develop no characters, make me indifferent to the towns plight, change the film into a slasher movie but add a new dimension--pure sadism and you still haven't got a complete picture of why this film fails.I don't want an explanation of why Michael Myers is evil, it only hurts the horror dimension of this genre. The fact that the explanation is so out of place with the idea of middle America that I get the impression that the director just never understood the original movie. Carpenter's psycho-thriller tribute to Hitchcock is completely lost in the remake and what we get is a stilted story of brutality. I rarely ever recommend this but please skip this film.As I left the theater, I was not only bewildered about the poor effort of the director but how one could remake Halloween without the view through the eyes of the mask or the shower scene yet keep the worthless idea of the sister angle that followed after the original. I liked the idea of a remake of Halloween. If done with some creativity, thought and flair, it could be a real tribute to the original. This wasn't it. Although the ""boogy man"" never dies, let's hope in this film, he does.",Halloween
554,theboywhocouldfly,Moustapha must be rolling in his grave.,1,1 September 2007,"How sad that a classic, seminal horror film could be this maligned in a remake. Zombie is living proof that just because someone is a ""fan"" of a certain type of film it doesn't mean that they should MAKE that type of film.Zonbie proves with this film he is a one note director: vulgarity, nudity, violence and profanity are his subject matter, while likable characters, character development and any amount of suspense are jettisoned so he can move on to the next expletive, breast, or bloody body as quickly as possible. There isn't a character in the film who doesn't make sexual references or swear. Even Tommy, (the little boy who the Laurie Stode character babysits) mentions that Lyndsey, his schoolfriend, ""smells like her"". Who wants to sit through two hours of such sad repellent characters?Carpenter's original, a simple, straight-ahead suspense film had little blood and intense suspense driven partly by the fact that the Boogeyman of the film WASN'T jumping out of the shadows every two seconds. In fact, part of what made the original so scary was the fact that Michael often did NOT appear at times when one was sure he would jump out. In this version, one could set one's watch by how often Michael comes creeping out of the darkness, usually in the exact same set up for every kill: victim in the foreground and Michael walking up in the background. Again and again. Repetitive and dull.Zonbie could have made a depressing study of a troubled little boy and his psychiatrist and never called it ""Halloween"" and come out of this debacle with reputation more intact. But when the focus suddenly and awkwardly shifts to the Strode character and we see the events of the original condensed into about 30 minutes, its impossible not to judge the film by the impressive merits of the original. That's when one realizes Zombie has no true focus or thrust for a storyline and that his ""reimagining"" of a classic is an immense failure. Don't look to this detestable film for even a modicum of suspense and maybe you won't be disappointed. The biggest ""BOO!"" in this film should come from the audience.",Halloween

559,emuhlee15,"Nice try, Zombie - Oh, wait, did I say nice? I meant awful.",2,5 January 2009,"Well.I really hate this movie.A lot.To start at the beginning, let me just say that this is typical Rob Zombie. Excessive profanity, sexual violence, really long greasy hair, and the preference of in-your-face gore rather than suspense. I assume this is because Rob Zombie is incapable of creating suspense, as he shows in the second half of this movie. Every attempt he makes at doing so falls flat.The first half of the movie is part family history and part hospital melodrama, with one scene that's there for no other reason than to show off his wife's hindquarters. Zombie attempts to provide an ""explanation"" for Micheal's profession as as psycho killer by providing him with one wacked-up family of characters that seem to have stepped off the pages of Zombie's movie ""The Devil's Rejects"". This, in effect, makes Micheal a lot less scary, and the film even goes so far as to try get us to SYMPATHIZE with this brutal killer. Puh-lease.Zombie's one strength is in showing some blood and gore, which is good, because otherwise, the second half of this film would be completely and utterly pointless. As is, it's only 98% pointless.Nearly an hour into the movie, we finally meet Laurie Strode - and after doing so, I wish she'd waited even later to make her entrance into the movie. I'm not exactly sure how high the bar was when casting an actress in this role, but it must have been prrretty low. Taylor-Compton is almost too bad to be believed. The character of Laurie has been reduced to nothing more than a teeny-bopper, and a really unlikeable one at that. I wish Zombie had written a death scene for her in this movie. THAT might have made the film a little better.(Although, as an aside, her parents, or adoptive parents I suppose, are what I would have imagined Micheal's parents to be like.) At this point, the film disintegrates into a boring gore-fest in which the only object is to see how high the body count can get before the credits roll. There's no suspense. No terror. Nothing. People die, the most annoying character gets to live, end of story.Geez.",Halloween
560,austinwheeler-1,A longtime Halloween fans view,9,5 September 2007,"I pride myself for being one of the biggest Halloween fans around. I saw Halloween when I was 5 and have loved it ever since. Now that I'm older and appreciate movies for more in depth reasons, I like it even more. When I heard Zombie was making a prequel/remake of Halloween, I was a little scared. But after having seen it I think it only adds to the Halloween legacy. This movie is not perfect by any means, but it is very good. It is my favorite horror movie of the past few years, maybe since the first Saw. The movie is very gory, but not just gory for the sake of gore. The excessive blood and such are there to demonstrate the psychotic soul that Michael Myers has. Another complaint people have is about the lack of character development. I think its important to understand that while the original Halloween was the story of Laurie Strode, Rob Zombie's Halloween is the story of Michael Myers. So while the characters all had their differences from their originals form 1978, we had a preconceived understanding of what they are all like. Myers, on the other hand, we knew very little about coming into the film and now know a lot about coming out of it. I also think their is a difference in how most people go into Horror movies and what their expectations are these days. While in the 70's as a society we rooted for the good guy, I think we generally go into a horror movie these days wanting the killer to kill just about everyone but the heroine. So really, their isn't much of a point in trying to get us to care about everyone, because we won't anyways. Finally, to Halloween purists like myself, just give it a chance before you hate it. If you go into this film expecting the worse you will not enjoy yourself no matter how good it is. There are enough of the classic elements of the film and enough of the likes and plot from the original to make you happy, plus its different enough that you will be interested in what happens next. Why would Zombie try to straight up remake the original Halloween? That would be stupid and inevitable a failure. Instead he put a twist on it that adds a little depth to the original. I'm sure whoever directs the upcoming 2 sequels will butcher them, but Zombie did not. You just have to watch it with an open mind.",Halloween
561,therockin_rooster,The beginning well defined,6,26 January 2008,"Being a true fan of the Halloween series, the moment I heard that Rob Zombie was going to take the helm of writing & directing a remake, I felt shivers down my spine. In my heart of hearts, I wanted him to have nothing to do with this film. All I could imagine was Rob going out of his way to spread as much blood and gore as he possibly could with this film.As the release date drew closer and I did my homework on the film, I learned that Rob really put himself into this film and took the time to mold it as carefully as he could. So I decided to give him a fair chance and went to see it on opening weekend with an open mind. As the lights in the theater dimmed and the opening scenes started to come into their own, I actually found myself anxiously awaiting for the plot to get rolling.What I found was that I was pleasantly surprised with the result. I think what Rob did for Michael's origins was masterful. We finally get the chance to understand just what it is that drives Michael over the edge. If there was one thing I really liked about the Halloween series above all the other horror films that followed was, Michael was complex, as opposed to Jason and Freddy who are strictly one dimensional. I always found myself wanting to know more about Michael, almost as if he is a dark puzzle waiting to be pieced together.Rob went above and beyond my expectations as for Michael's background and even gives us some real insight into the origin and loyalty to Michael's trademark William Shatner mask. The first 40 minutes alone were quite intense and of all things; educational.However, this is a horror movie so it did have it's share of violence, but it was well placed, well planned and well done. I found myself willing to believe that what was on the screen was actually happening. Which, as a movie goer, it's all one can ask & hope for.My only real criticism is, about three quarters of the way through, the movie seems to get lost in itself. After doing such an amazing job building it up for us, I guess I just expected more from the climax. By no means does the climax fall flat, but after I left the theater, I was far more impressed & taken back by the story telling given during the first half of the film.Final word; as a fan of this genre and the original, I highly suggest this film. Enjoy!",Halloween
562,nZulauf71,"""I heard that on Halloween night, the boogeyman comes out at night and attacks kids.""",7,3 November 2011,"I am a big fan of the 1978 ""Halloween"" and at first I was a little skeptical if this movie would live up to the originality of the first one. In some ways it did, like having the famous lines and scenes from the original in this Rob Zombie version, but it was still not as good as the original.Don't get me wrong I still throughly enjoyed this movie. In a way it was different but it was also like the original. I did like the things Zombie added such as the whole beginning part of the movie, where it shows Michael Myers as a kid. Showing his start of killing with animals all the way up to his family. And I really liked the scenes in the asylum, where his counselor, played by Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange), and Michael had all their meetings all the way up to Michael Myers being a grown man. One thing that bothered me was how the camera was so shaky. When I read another review about this movie someone said the same thing. I didn't think much of it because sometimes I like it when the camera does that, but in this case I hated it. Every time Michael Myers attacks or someone is running the camera goes crazy and this really bothers me.The cast has some good actors and some in there just to get naked. I wasn't fond of Scout Taylor-Compton, who played the main character Laurie Strode. I will not even compare her to Jamie Lee Curtis who is on another level. I felt like she did not have much of a experience acting, she was just not good. Daeg Faerch, who plays Michael Myers at the age of 10 is amazing. He was legit and scary and a psycho. Of course Sheri Moon Zombie is in it and she actually does a real good job as Michael's mother. And the other good actors are of course Malcolm McDowell, as Dr. Loomis. And Danny Trejo (One of my favorite actors) has a small but good part of being the janitor and keeper of Michael for 20 years.All in all, I did enjoy this movie just not as much as John Carpenter's Halloween. Like a friend said, If you love the Halloween franchise you probably wont like it. But if you look at it as a Rob Zombie film you will.My Final Review: 7 out of 10",Halloween
563,Cannibully,Don't hate it just because it's a remake.,8,5 September 2007,"I loved Rob Zombie's Halloween. Far better than the original. You can hate it all you want just because it's a remake. But that's faulty logic. Just because something came first does not make it better. Frankly, I never liked the original. I wanted to like it and I honestly tried. Three times. Each time I fell asleep. Finally, on my fourth attempt I made it all the way through. Upon finishing the movie I realized that I really did not care for it. I found it horribly drawn out and boring. A kid kills his sister for no apparent reason, escapes 15 years later much to the dismay of the poorly acted Dr. Loomis, returns home to stalk some teenagers and occasionally actually kills one. Yawn. No rhyme or reason. No story. No action. Boooooring. This time around we actually get to know the kid a little bit before he kills his sister (among others). We actually see that he is quite disturbed and we actually see him snap. We see some of the factors leading up to his breakdown, but not so much that it slows the movie down. In fact, the first half of the movie where we get to know young Michael is arguably the better half. You see what makes him tick, but you never feel sympathy for him. He's nothing more than a monster. You see him deteriorate further in the institution before finally shutting down completely. Skip ahead 15 years and he is now the adult, lurking Michael Myers that we all know and love. Only now we know how he got there. Much of the rest of the movie at this point is a pretty straight-forward remake. Except that stuff actually happens. There is much more brutality and gore, which is to be expected of a Rob Zombie movie. There really aren't any surprises, but this is a remake after all. As much as I love Rob as a film maker I would not want him to throw in some big twist just for the sake of making it his own. That would somehow cheapen it. Instead, Rob takes the high road and stays true to the original. He just gives us a little more to enjoy than John Carpenter did thirty years ago. All due respect to John Carpenter. The man gave us a classic that will remain in movie history and in our hearts forever. For that we can be thankful. Rob Zombie simply fleshed it out a little bit more and gave us a truly great horror film to be added to an otherwise dead franchise. I would think that Michael Myers fans should be pretty ecstatic about that.",Halloween
564,Norrel122,What's Already Borken Is Broken Even More,5,14 June 2008,"The budget behind this film should have been donated to Sheri Moon Zombie so she could get some acting lessons. To watch her spill her lines is so painful. You just want to reach out and show her how it should be done.Apart from that, the movie is average. A better movie could have been picked to remake. The concepts of reality don't really apply and I dear not go further in an attempt to not disclose any spoilers. Horror movies are rarely noted for their storyline but the good ones still try to maintain some level or reason. This movie goes wherever Rob Zombie's drug induced mind took him. Yes we know growing up with a hillbilly stripper single mom is a horror in it's self but get over your childhood Zombie!You've seen this already with Jamie Lee Curtis and she did it better. Keep in mind that this is the 9th part to this series. Adding more blood and gore didn't help to improve it.",Halloween
565,robbie71,"Don't think about the original, embrace it as something ""new""..",8,18 December 2007,"The problem with most reviewers is that they don't like the fact that the remake is almost a complete new movie. Sure, it tells the same story and it has the same characters but still it is completely different to the original one. You can also see that Rob Zombie loves the original ""Halloween"" and he pays a lof of hommages to it. I am a big fan of the original one AND I am also a fan of the remake. Unusual? No, I just see it as another movie and not ""just a remake"". Honestly I think it is one of the best slasher movies ever done!! It is much more violent than the original one, here you get more stabbing, more gore (John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" practically had none)and more terror. Often there is a high tension on the screen, very similar to the French shocker ""Haute Tension"". This is the best Rob Zombie movie so far. He didn't just remake a classic, he made his own masterpiece in which he pays homage to the original. I rate it like the original one: An excellent ten!!",Halloween

567,dansocean-349-194279,Just not the same,5,9 October 2021,What made the original Halloween great was it just felt as if it could happen. Normal family normal neighborhood in a normal setting. Rob's spin just makes you not even like the victims. The hole thing just felt loud and out of touch. Just wasn't for me.,Halloween
568,markmywords85,The Best Possible Vision of an Inevitable Remake (with a few missteps),7,31 August 2007,"That Halloween would be remade was an inevitability. With the success of the Texas Chainsaw and Hills Have Eyes reboots, the grandaddy of all slashers was bound for revival. That being said, Rob Zombie's love of the original is what saves this from the pitfalls of the aforementioned films, i.e. going for ""music video"" editing on TCM (abandoning the grainy, voyeuristic feel of the original) and sheer brutal violence in Hills (nowhere to be found is the family vs. family story that made Craven's story a classic). Fans of Jamie Lee Curtis' turn as Laurie Strode in Pts. 1, 2, 7, or 8 (though if there are any real fans of 7 or 8 I have yet to meet them) be warned: this is definitely a Michael-centric story. As a longtime fan, I found this to be appropriate. The dynamic established in the first film and subsequent sequels was much more Loomis-Michael than anything else. And while McDowell is not as iconic as the late, great Donald Pleasance, finally seeing those mysterious years hinted at in the original series is not disappointing, like the Star Wars prequels, but a true treat for fans of the franchise. While some is left to the imagination (Loomis' failed relationships and being ostracized for investing so heavily in Michael), Loomis, merely a harbinger of doom in the original series, becomes more tortured and human than ever. Kudos to this addition.Now onto the biggest plus for this re-imagining: Daeg Faerch and Tyler Mane. The man and boy behind the monster will be forces to be reckoned with in genre film-making. While Faerch overacts a bit when confronting the school principal, his believable portrayal of hard material carries the first act. And when Michael reaches the point of no return (in a predictable but nonetheless jarring scene), his transformation is shocking. As for Mane, he is to Michael what Kane Hodder is to Jason: the definitive version. Some fans are upset at the 6'10"" build of this new incarnation, but his size transforms Michael into a force of nature, rather than a supernatural boogeyman. He can take punishment simply because he is a killing machine, surviving on the will to destroy. And Mane's natural progression of the character established in the first half is noticeable: he is still fascinated by the violence he inflicts, perhaps repulsed but compelled to destroy nonetheless.The supporting cast is great. The teenage trio is believable (if you don't think so, try driving your younger sister and her friends somewhere and just listening in on their conversations), the cameos are appropriate and add to the film, and the violence is shocking but not overdone. Zombie abandons the relatively slick look of Carpenter's original (no steadicam here) and adds his exploitation-influenced style, without going overboard on grainy pseudo-artistic noodling. Still, Zombie is finding his own voice as a director, and the jarring hillbilly/dysfunctional-family-breeds-soulless-killer first act can be overly reminiscent of The Devil's Rejects, which aside from some blatant CGI violence is a flawless exploitation film. *SPOILER ALERT* The sometimes inappropriate retro soundtrack is distracting, specifically a bizarre juxtaposition of young Michael and his mother set to Love Hurts, as well as Michael's first scenes as an adult outside of the sanitarium, in which Rush's classic ""Tom Sawyer"" blasts through a truck stop. At least it wasn't more Lynyrd Skynyrd.Many fanboy critics will likely lambaste Zombie for one of 3 things: 1) It is too much of a Zombie film in the first half. 2) It is a predictable retread in the 2nd half. 3) Michael is a psycho killer, NOT a boogeyman, but how does he manage to find Laurie?What a conundrum for Zombie. While he seems to have constrained himself to making a fairly faithful remake in the second half, he does buck expectation by making Michael human, and perhaps a bit superhuman. He is driven to kill when stabbed and shot, and he manages to find long lost sister Laurie by sheer instinct. Okay, so he is STILL a bit of a boogeyman, but I was able to suspend my disbelief on this point. *END SPOILERS*The movie is not perfect, but not the soulless retread fans could have received (TCM and the execrable TCM: the Beginning). For this longtime fan of the series, it's nice to know someone who loves Michael Myers was able to take the reigns as director and show that love on screen.",Halloween
569,Nightman11,Just another modern horror blunder,5,21 December 2007,"I'm not an expert on the Halloween saga so this review is strictly based on Rob Zombie's interpretation. I enjoyed his other films, but this one lacked the creativity I thought he possessed. Never have I asked so many question out loud during a movie than I did this one. Numerous scenes were utterly ridiculous and laughable, as the screenplay sounded like it was written in a day. Zombie focused too much on making the characters grungy by all the cursing and sex, when he should have been concerned about making them likable. That way when they were being chased by Micheal Myers, we would actually want them to get away. Instead I hoped for him to catch them just for the mere hope that the murder scene would be interesting. His motive is very unclear and his ability to walk away from three shots to the back with a 357 Magnum baffles me. Where in this movie does he acquire invincibility? I'm not saying there isn't an explanation, but Rob Zombie sure doesn't have it. Overall, this movie falls right in line with all the other modern attempts at horror that Hollywood just can't seem to get right. This film was completely unnecessary and I hope Rob realizes he made a mistake.",Halloween
570,Number2,Danielle Harris topless is the highlight of the movie,2,31 August 2007,"You have no idea how much I wanted to love this movie. It starts out as 45 minutes of text book reasons why Michael Myers became a killer: loner, abusive live-in father figure, stripper mother, bullied at school, KISS fan, tortures small animals and is the middle child; followed by nudity and gore. Sorry, I just read that sentence and it sounds like a good movie to go and see. Well it is not. William Forsythe is perfect as the abusive male figure in Michael's life. Sheri Moon Zombie is getting better as an actress, although it is hard not to picture her as Baby at some moments. Danny Trejo turns in the most sympathetic character role of the whole movie. I could have cared less about Scout Taylor-Compton's Laurie Strode character, it's not her fault as an actress, it's the STORY. It revolves around Michael not Laurie. Udo Kier, Clint Howard and Sybil Danning's talents are wasted as cameos.Michael Myers is a cross between a member of ICP (Insane Clown Posse), Slipknot (both of which are bands, not much of a stretch as it is directed by Rob Zombie), and the wrestler ManKind ( again not much of a stretch seeing that the actor playing Michael Myers is former wrestler Tyler Mane; who I loved as Sabertooth in X-Men). Things that just bugged me were in the original (1978) Michael steals the station wagon to transport the headstone, here I guess he could have used Lynda's boyfriend Steve's van. The 911 call is made from one house yet the police show up and enter a house five houses down the street AND on the opposite side of the road.",Halloween
571,hammerfan1,New Halloween Exceeds Expectations,9,10 September 2007,"Fans of the 1978 original need not worry about Rob Zombie wrecking their favorite franchise. The producers took care of that with Halloween 6 and Resurrection. This is a chance to start fresh with a new take on Halloween. John Carpenter created the modern ""Boogeyman"" with the original film. Since then, we have been bombarded with copycat killers with no reason for their madness. Rob Zombie takes us back in time with the 10 year old Michael Myers, and shows us how Michael became the ""Boogeyman"". The first half of the movie is essentially Michael's backstory. This should have been a very boring build up to the nightmare that everyone knows is coming. Under a lesser director, this would have been true. But Zombie makes Michael's hellish home life seem interesting and disturbingly entertaining. Anyone who has seen ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" knows how Zombie can accomplish this. He does it by making his characters real people. They don't speak or act like every other Hollywood character. They don't say or do what you would expect in a movie. They simply say and do what real people in that situation would say and do. It's raw, simple, and crude. And you can't take your eyes off of the screen while it's going on.The most fascinating part of the film focuses on the relationship of Dr. Loomis and young Michael. We see a bonding between doctor and patient that is akin to the bonding between father and son. This makes the film all the more tragic because we all know where their relationship is heading. Malcolm McDowell gives an amazing performance as the complicated Loomis. In the original film, Donald Pleasance's Loomis was the protector of Haddonfield. Here he is protector of both Michael and the town. The first part of the film is mostly story building and character study. The second part is a pulse pounding, edge of your seat, cover your eyes journey into a nightmare. If you feel sympathy for Michael during the movie's first act, that will disappear ""the night he comes home"". This is the part of the film that is a remake of the original. And it is pretty loyal, taking only a few liberties and speeding the story up slightly for length purposes. Scout Taylor-Compton and Danielle Harris as Laurie Strode and Annie Bracket give brave performances in the second act as their characters struggle to survive. Malcolm McDowell is great in this part of the film as well, as he changes from doctor to hunter. Even though there are some disturbing killing scenes in the first half, they are not particularly scary. In the second half, however, the audience is jumping and screaming as Michael goes on a killing spree with absolutely no emotion. The ending is sudden and shocking and leaves the audience reeling.Overall, this is an amazing movie. If there never had been an original ""Halloween"", this would be an instant classic. It is dark and brutal, yet beautiful and entertaining in it's own original way.",Halloween
572,flamethrower72,This is the reason everybody hates this movie!,7,7 October 2007,"One of the only reasons this movie is hated so much is because Rob Zombie chose to remake it. Everybody said, ""the movie should have never been remade, it was fine the way it was."" I agree. But he was not just remaking it, Rob Zombie also made a back story for about a good 40 minutes and explained more about how Michael went wrong. And Rob Zombie said he did not want this to be like John Carpenters HALLOWEEN. He wanted it to be his own vision of this movie as if Carpenters never existed. Now some things I liked about this movie was, First of all, the death scenes were great. 2nd, it actually portrayed how real teenagers act today. 3rd, this was a great plot and showed how Michaels Life was and how he became so evil. And third, for once in a lifetime, this Michael Myers actually scared me more than the Halloween movies usually do. This movie has some good acting and killing scenes, and a great unexpected ending. Overall, I give Rob Zombies HALLOWEEN, a 7/10, or a 3.5/5.",Halloween

A swift, majestic kick to the groin by Rob Zombie and this monstrosity that he dares to name after John Carpenter's classic. Zombie almost completely changed the mythology of Michael Myers, and turned all of the original cool characters into sniveling wastes of skin. Why did he have to try and make Michael so that we'd have sympathy for him?! Huh?! We're not supposed to have sympathy for Mr. Myers! He supposed to be pure evil on two legs, not a tormented soul! He's supposed to break out of Smith's Grove to try and kill Laurie Strode, not to track her down and get on his knees for forgiveness!!! Oh my God, I wanna just puke in my soup after watching this pile of horse feces on screen! Rob Zombie: talented musician, horrible director. I knew the Halloween series on going downhill the moment I saw number 5, number 6 was a SLIGHT improvement, number 7 tried to let the series end with dignity, number 8 brought it back to take a dump on it like 5 & 6, and this one finally put a bullet in its head. It breaks the heart, it really does. If you are looking for a homage or loyal remake, don't even bother. If you're looking for a completely new story, disloyal to original mythology, go for it.",Halloween
575,Phill_E,"Mmmmmm, No.",4,20 September 2007,"No, just no. This movie was a complete bomb in my mind, and I thought it would be for everyone else. It seems the new generation horror watched must love watching pointless gore. I feel weird saying this since I'm 15 and my favorite movie is saw 3, but still, this movie was an insult! The beginning starts out with a white trash family being idiots toward each other, and none of them having a reason for their stupid actions. Mainly the deranged hillbilly that lives in their house. But Mike is the worst, he has sick thoughts and actions that carry out into the first 30 minutes of the film. I don't want to get into to much, in fear of giving spoilers, but this whole part is pretty crappy. So if you do see it, maybe just skip the first half hour and watch the rest of it.OK, so mike is an adult now, big woop dee doo! More importantly, we finally get to see the 3 slu..... not so lady like girls that call themselves actors: Laurie: The once loved fighting female, now turned into this sad little girl who would most likely been texting the whole movie if it weren't for the all grown up 7 feet tall Mikey. Not the worst acting, but definitely takes away from the cute naive girl.Linda: First off, if you take out all of the parts where she is either having sex, naked, or cussing, she would be on air for about 1 minute. You can't really tell if she is a good actor or not, because she barely does anything, but she does give an disappointing scene after her and her grease-monkey boyfriend explore the birds and the bees.Annie: In my opinion, the worst of them all. She takes the role of the, I'm to cool to follow the rules, character. The acting is by far the worst, booooooo. That's really all I need to say.The only thing I would recommend about this, is the fact that Michael still kicks peoples butts. This invulnerable killing machine still reigns terror over the people in the movie. Even as a little child.In short, don't see it, unless you haven't seen the original, then be my guest.",Halloween
576,Videogamer595,"Zombie Zombifies this True Classic, but not in a Good Way",1,11 March 2012,"Being a die hard Horror fan (no pun intended), I have seen all the classics such as Lugosi's Dracula, Nosferatu, Karloff's Frankenstein, etc. But, I saw this film and, at first, really liked it. I was about 16 when it came out, so I was at that age where ""Blood 'n' Guts"" were awesome and everything else sucked. I left the theater thinking to myself that it was an awesome movie; my hormone-raging body was quite satisfied after seeing blood being spattered all about and seeing a few good pairs of boobs.Fast forward about 3 years.I, finally, watched John Carpenter's Halloween as it was called for as a homework assignment I was assigned in my senior year Film Studies class. I had watched it with every bit of excitement and quickly found myself thinking that this version was so much better than Rob Zombie's version. So, you're probably saying to yourself, ""alright already! Get on with the review!"" Don't worry, it's coming. But, back to the story. Anyway, as soon as I finished the original Halloween, I put the remake in and watched it a second time. This time, I compared the two. As Zombie's remake came to a close, this is what I thought, upon viewing the original Halloween and the remake, a second time.Not only did this movie ruin my respect for Zombie, it completely obliterated it. His ""remake"" of a truly great classic ended up in sheer disappointment. He reworked the whole story and added in his classic touches (you'll notice them when you see them). If you know anything about Rob Zombie, you know he is all about 2 things: Boobs and Blood. Yes, this combination does work out pretty well, for some movies, but not this one. And, like I said, I am a HUGE horror fan, but this one doesn't even deserve to be given one star. It destroys all the slasher movies and puts them to shame. Overuse of swearing, 100's of random ""F"" words, implied incest, and so much blood it makes the video game franchise ""God of War"" look like a Disney movie, it takes ""over the top"" to a new extreme. Zombie's remake put Michael Myers to shame and disappointed many of the fans that have been fans of him since 1978. Zombie makes movies that are targeted for those people that enjoy seeing over-exaggerated mutilations and DDD breasts. And, if that doesn't set you over the edge, he casts his son, who, might I add, is named Pussyliquor (yes, that's pussy ""licker""), as Michael Myers as a kid! Haddonfield would be bowing their heads in embarrassment, if there were such a place. A couple more things to add while I have the ""Warning: may contain spoilers"" checked off:>The step-dad makes a remark about how his step-daughter has an eye pleasing buttocks. Was it necessary to have that in the movie? Absolutely not! >Buckets of blood were used to show one stab wound. Overuse? You bet it was! >The scene at the truck stop with the black guy was pretty funny, I'll admit. But, that doesn't make up for the other 110 minutes of pure garbage. >This has to be one of, if not, THE worst career decision Malcolm McDowell has ever made. But, his performance was pretty good. >(Only available in the Uncut version) the scene where the two security guards rape the prisoner was pretty unnecessary and sick. Last, but not least, a few positives: Tyler Bates, who plays Myers as an adult, did a fantastic job. His performance was somewhat stellar. Everyone else did a poor job. So, all in all, this film deserves no stars, whatsoever. Zombie should stick to music rather than movies; he wouldn't lose as many fans then.",Halloween

This is a horror movie with no character depth and no suspense at all: You know what is going to happen at at all times.But I can't understand how a dull catatonic boy who grows in a sanatorium just creating masks all the time (it doesn't seem he takes any time body-building) can become a 2 meter-tall super-strong bullet-proof man! How can you give any credit to whatever happens next??? Hell, he could as well lift the entire house and destroy the whole planet, I wouldn't be more surprised!I just don't like to be made a fool...So I am lead to believe this movie is about some super-human beast who has grown a natural full body armour... maybe he is a cyborg, we wouldn't know because nothing in the plot makes any sense at all. He just kills randomly.What a waist of time, really. This movie is not only cheesy, but it made me angry. I wish Mike Myers killed Rob Zombie! I am surprised why such elaborate film production and directing is waisted just because the plot is completely non-sense. I mean besides the last part of the movie is completely dark, the production and directing is actually quite good. The plot elements is what make it sound all wrong . Why do they do it this way?

578,bennyjayruss,Not Bad... Could Have Been A Lot Worse!,7,12 August 2018,"We all know and agree that John Carpenter's original Halloween film is a masterpiece in its own right, one that is almost impossible to top. With that out of the way, let's look at this competent reboot. Zombie decided to begin the story with an overlong display of Myers' rough upbringing, which I suppose gives it that different edge to any of the previous Halloween films. For the most part during these sequences, the acting could be better and the overall atmosphere should have been creepier. We were supposed to be looking at a child with the devil's eyes, but all we saw was a misunderstood little psychopath that wasn't all that intimidating. I commend Zombie for attempting to do the backstory justice, but it was all in vain. Once we get past the small glimpses of originality in the script, we then move onto the slasher portion of the film which takes up roughly the last hour. Zombie surprised me with the crafty way he recaptured the spirit of the original Halloween. The acting from Laurie and the two children was thoroughly convincing, and for brief moments the atmosphere was thrilling. It was a worthy recreation in my view. At two hours long, this movie should have felt like a slog to get through, but it was engrossing enough to keep me interested until the end. That's more than I can say for a couple of other Halloween films produced over the years. While some of the character depictions (particularly Laurie's) were horrendous, I was pleasantly surprised at how competent the movie was. My special shout-out goes to Malcolm McDowell for doing justice to Donald Pleasance's immortal portray of Samuel Loomis.Finally, I would rate this film somewhere around a 6 or 6.5/10, but I feel the overall rating on IMDB is too low, so I've bumped it up to a 7*.",Halloween
579,ReZetamama,Much better than expected,8,14 June 2014,"Spoiler Alert! I respect the fact that everybody is entitled to their own opinion; however, I do not understand some of the very lowest of ratings given to this movie. I remember when the original Halloween came out. It scared me to death. Once the original is seen, however, you cannot forget the whys and the hows, so a remake is destined to disappoint simply because you already know that Mike is a killer child, that Laurie Strode will be his baby sister and a few other events from the original. Keeping in mind that you already know the spoilers from the original movie, I thought this re-make was well done. Was I afraid? No. However, I found myself held in suspense in spite of knowing the events from the original. That's no easy task. There were a few changes in the way of additions that made the movie make more sense. It was not as gory as other reviewers described, but I guess everyone's tolerance level for gore differs also. I have seen much worse gore depicted on CSI, Hannibal, and other TV shows; not to mention the cable shows. Have any of the people who whined about this movie's gore seen any Game of Thrones or Dexter episodes? I guess not. *chuckles* Anyway, as a remake goes, Rob Zombie did a very good job. Even the fact that the movie has an actual ending and cannot spark other sequels is appreciated by me. Very good job! The only reason that I did not give it a 9 or 10 is because it is a remake after all. This is the best score that I can give any remake.",Halloween
580,KJacob73,"When you want the heroine to die, the director has failed!",4,2 October 2007,"What a travesty! Not so much that Halloween has been remade, but that Zombie's take on Michael Myers begins so well only to end up being a turd.I resisted seeing this upon release, but finally gave in when it available to me for free. The idea of one of my favorite films of all time being messed with just didn't sit right with me.I must admit that for the first 50 minutes I was genuinely captivated. Originally I was appalled by the prospect of fleshing out Michael Myer's childhood. What made it work was that this was clearly Zombie's vision. I could accept it because I didn't feel that this had anything to do with Carpenter's Michael Myers. It felt more like Zombie's fantasy of what Michael Myers childhood had been like in a white trash family and how it led to his murderous spree. Of course the scariest thing about the original Myers is that there is no apparent reason for his evil. He's a blank slate which all sorts of fears can be projected on. For Zombie that projection is having a stripper mom who has a boyfriend who threatens to ""skull f*&k"" her. This all works because it is clearly Zombie's universe.The film goes down hill and I mean tumbling down when Zombie enters Carpenter's territory. The film becomes all to familiar in that its plot begins to mirror Carpenter's original. By no means is Zombie able to pay homage or even copy Carpenter in a compelling manner. What has to be the worst aspect of this is the actresses who play the three teenage girls. All of them are horrible, and what's most unforgivable is how awful the girl is who play Laurie Strode. This is the character who was played by Jamie Lee Curtis, who gave an iconic performance in the original. All this girl does is shriek and talk like some valley girl. Imagine this line, ""so like was that the boogie man"". Now I'm not sure if these were her exact words, but that's what her character is like. The biggest abomination of this fiasco is that it's not even scary. The set pieces just make you wish you were watching the original. Zombie only comes close only once to an effectively scary scene when Laurie is trapped in a drained pool. She can't get out and Myers is in hot pursuit. What kills this creative sequence is that you really could care less if the girl lives or dies. More will actually probably wish her to die. When you want the heroine to die in a horror film the director has failed.",Halloween
581,CelesteChere,Zombie 'trashes' a classic!,1,8 March 2008,"Rob Zombie truly disgraced the legend of Michael Myers with his disgusting view on how this movie should go. But where to start? Let's start with the fact that it was so cliché of him to do the whole 'my family was bad to me so I'm gonna kill people now' routine. In this movie, Rob decides to make Michael some white trash kid in a white trash family. With a disgusting cripple step dad and a mother (played by, SURPRISE SURPRISE, Zombie's real life wife who can't act!) who is basically a hooker for a living. And a nasty older sister. It was insulting as well to women. Apparently to Zombie women are all wh---. Well in this movie they were. And although this wasn't in the actual movie, there was a rape scene filmed and put in another version of the movie which was beyond disturbing. Is this what Zombie thinks about doing to women? The rape scene wasn't in the theatrical movie and had no relevance to begin with. Every word that came out of someone's mouth had something to do with sex or drugs or masturbation, followed by a cuss word. The swearing in this film is non stop. And apparently Zombie thought only guys would go watch this movie, well girls did to, and let me tell you there were NO attractive men/boys in this movie. NONE! All of them were ugly! So he denied the ladies and gay guys eye candy as well. The story sucked. This movie seemed to care more about how many boobs it could fit into one shot with barrel loads of blood flying EVERYWHERE rather than on the story. Zombie should stick to writing his god awful songs instead of ruining movies. Now this was the view of someone who actually has respect for classics, unlike the teens of this god awful generation who thought this movie was brilliant and think that boobs and lots and lots of blood make the movie. WRONG! The story is what makes the movie. What's even scarier than this trash film (which wasn't scary at all actually.) is the fact that teens of today are trying write scripts on their own, and sadly, if you thought the movies of this generation sucked, get ready because in about 5, 10, or 15 years from now they are going to get even worse because these teens have NO vision. Hollywood has gone down hill. It's official.",Halloween

583,narbo,"Awful, even if you didn't love the original",1,31 August 2007,"I was not a huge fan of Rob Zombie's first two movies. I thought both were okay films, but believed that he had potential to develop into a great director. When I heard he was remaking Halloween I had to wonder: why? Remakes stink for the most part, but at least directors take on mediocre films and TRY to make them better. However, the original Halloween is well regarded film that has aged gracefully. I immediately doubted Zombie's version would be very good, but I never expected this disaster.Zombie turns this into a story that focuses on Michael more than Laurie. This does not work. What's the point? What made Myers so scary in the first place was that he was a blank slate (hence the blank face of his mask); a force of unstoppable evil that you could project your worst fears onto. Zombie tries to humanize him, but I can't imagine how he thought this would make the film more scary.The whole film is shot in a sort of shaky hand-held way a la '28 days later'. In that film it worked: the film set up a deserted Manchester and THEN zoomed in on its characters and their struggles. Here, Zombie never lets you see anything or soak up the environs. Haddonfield is supposed to feel like your typical quiet suburb; Haddonfield MATTERS within the context of making the original Halloween work. Zombie never lets you see what's happening, even the kills are such a mess of shaky camera work that there is no effect. You never know exactly how people have been killed. Suspense! Where's the suspense? Carpenter understood suspense. It drove the original. Zombie just pummels you with murder after murder. You never invest in any of the characters. You don't care about Laurie at all. Horror parodies often mock the standard horror scene of someone running from an attacker only to find a locked door where they pound on it hoping for it to be opened by someone on the other side; and of course the door is opened just as the killer nears their target. It maybe cliché, but that type of scene can work. But you have to care about the person reaching for that door!! I never feared for Laurie because I never cared for Laurie here. Why does every male in this movie have long hair at some point? Why does it appear to start in the late 1970's and then when it says '15 years later..' seem as though it is present day? The seventies ended more than 15 years ago! Remakes generally stink. This is the worst of the lot. Rob Zombie apparently did not understand the original Halloween or what made it tick. It sucks that they remade an already great film (and this will likely turn off any potential new fans to the franchise). It sucks even more that Zombie was the one to do it. But worst of all it sucks that Zombie failed so miserably.",Halloween

585,hferdon,Somewhat enjoyable,4,23 January 2018,"Here's the thing: I've been watching all of the Halloween movies back to back and I've enjoyed each one for different reasons, but the one that kind of pulled me off of the kick was this movie, the 2007 make of Halloween. I'm the kind of person that feels if there is going to be a sequel to any movie, you need to continue the story with the same actors and the same type of storyline. This version kind of diminished my excitement for several reasons. 1: I've ignored the fact that in every movie, there's a slight sex scene which is tacky for every kind of movie, especially for horror/ thriller movies because the eyes should be on the killer hunting down the victims, not woman's boobs and a man's butt. It's just very trashy. 2: I understand that Rob Zombie wanted to tell his version of Halloween because it's a refreshing and different look at the infamous story of Michael Myers, but I felt the movie to be too raunchy with not just the boobs and butt, but also that grotesque sex scene in Michael's cell. It was absolutely stomach wrenching and was definitely throwing me off from watching the movie. 3: The actor who played Michael Myers looked to be 35 and Laurie to be like 15, when in reality, it should've been different because in the original movie, Laurie was born 2 years after Michael was admitted to the hospital, making them 8 or so years apart, so they got it a little different. 4: One thing I can give to Rob is that he gave the audience a good idea of how Michael could've turned evil because he had a horrible home life, which can turn anyone into a psycho, but even giving us that idea was a little too risque and flamboyant.5: I'll also give him points that Rob tried to stay pretty much true to the original with the fact that, like the original, Michael escaped after years of therapy, goes back to his old house, and starts planning on how to start making his killings, even having the original music when Michael was around was a great idea. 6: I understand that even with a continuation of a saga like this that you don't have to go exactly to the word with the original story, but it would definitely help because when you have different actors, it doesn't feel like the same story, and should be considered to be called something else. 7: The fact that Laurie was so wimpy when Scout portrayed her, she was a brave woman taking on Michael; it's just sad. The reason I gave this movie a 4 is becasue:Pros:
Stayed pretty true to the original story with the characters and the location.Gave the audience an interesting look on how Michael turned evilGave the audience a look into how Michael spent some of his time in the hospital.Gave the audience an interesting idea on why Michael liked masks and seeing his cell covered with masks of different colors.The way the movie ended was similar to the first movie in the sense that Michael was shot at the end of the first movie, and he was shot in this version.Cons:
Different actorsBad actor portrayal of Michael looking 35 and Laurie looking 15.Didn't make sense on how Michael found the iconic mask in the floorboards of his family home when there was no mention of that mask in the beginning of the movie.Scout's portrayal of Laurie was too wimpy.Too much nudity to even fathom watching this movie again!Too much dirty cussing to make someone never wanna watch this movie again!",Halloween
586,hodwatt-20518,By far the worst remake in cinema history...,1,5 March 2017,"I might as well spoil everything that happens in this abomination disguised as a film because It'll save you an odd hour and 40 minutes of your life. Will I spoil the whole thing though? Let's just see what happens... Rob Zombie basically takes everything that made the original such a classic and flushes them down the toilet. It seems that Rob Zombie finds excessive swearing to be cool so he has every character drop the F bomb every 2 minutes. Now I'm not one of those people that gets all offended when people swear, in fact I myself love to swear, but it is so overused in this film that it just becomes sleazy and irritating. The movie is extremely violent, more so than the original, but that aspect did not bother me, however some of the death scenes in the film are so badly executed that they had me face palming. There is a scene where Michael Myers kills Laurie Strode's (step)father and it happens so fast that you hardly have a chance to even acknowledge what in the hell just happens. He just appears out of thin air and slashes his throat in literally 2 seconds flat, and you as the audience are like, ""what in the hell just happened??"" There is a gratuitous rape scene that was completely unnecessary and should not have been in the film at all. It seems as if Rob Zombie just put there for shock value. I don't have a problem with rape scenes in films, so long as they are relevant to the plot, which is definitely not the case here. I felt absolutely no sympathy for most of the victims. Michael's sister is a skank and Laurie's school friends are annoying, so it's actually a relief when they are killed off. Even Laurie Strode herself, who was a likable character in the original film who you cared about, is hard to feel any sympathy for. Do yourself a favour and skip this movie, I mean crapfest. To call this thing a 'movie' is insulting to movies.",Halloween
587,andreaxonicole,Idk how to feel...,2,17 August 2018,"Like...This was suppose to be a remake right? But Zombie decided to definitely put some different twists into this.

Even Michael capturing Laurie and just admiring her. Like this could have been a completely different movie all together and could have named it something else.

The acting is pretty good along with the set and costume design. I love the original film and it's one of my favorite horror movies so it seems like I should hate this movie, but I don't. Rob Zombie wanted to make this his own movie and I respect that and think he did a pretty good job at it. Some people don't like that but it's better than a shot for shot remake. The first half of the movie is quite better than the second half but the second half still does a good job at having very intense scenes and creepy scenes of Michael stalking. The movie is pretty realistic on kills wise and doesn't go for the outlandish stuff you might see in other slashers. I will say this also has a great making of documentary that may have boosted my opinion on this movie a little bit, also could've been that I'm a big Rob Zombie fan. I will support this movie, but I can't really say the same about the second one",Halloween

A cell phone shows up, modern cars here and there. I think the little things needed more attention to put us back in the first films stage. So many things were overlooked. Exceptional parts to notice are how well the back-story was played out. I do think that the additional murders were not necessary it the childhood scenes of Myers.

This was my first experience with the Halloween franchise and I got the middle finger from Rob Zombie himself.
I felt nothing but boredom and disgust as the plot revolves around teenagers having sex or being gruesomely murdered. The plot doesn't deviate from that and I was left with a bad opinion of the franchise for many years until I saw the original and changed my mind.

592,joel-28,Very ambitious interpretation of the Michael Myers legend,10,31 August 2007,"Rob Zombie basically looks at the Michael Myers character as if it all really happened. This very imaginative interpretation goes much deeper than the original version and shows how the abused and neglected Michael winds up going on a murderous rampage at age 10, first beating the school bully to death with a stick and casually walking away to get ready for trick or treat. Following more verbal abuse from his mother's boyfriend, his step (?) sister and her boyfriend he puts on his clown mask and does away with them in a graphic bloodbath. The first of many. So the film struck me as being even more violent than Devil's Rejects although with no ""special"" moments like the motel scene in Rejects. At some point I realized my jaw had been dropped for about 20 minutes straight as when MM escapes from the asylum it's one violent death after another. Things calm down just a bit while MM makes his way back to Haddonfield, then the bloodbath starts all over again. I firmly believe that Rob Zombie does his best to portray such characters as Michael Myers, Capt Spaulding, Otis etc as if they really existed. So my final analysis was if the Haddonfield massacre really did happen, and there really was a Michael Myers etc, then this would have been the film they made based on the true story.",Halloween

However, I feel that I was watching two movies at once. The first was a great prequel explaining all the ""why's"" that Carpenter and Hill purposely left out. It was fantastic and made my skin crawl. The second was, in my opinion, a bad remake. I felt that the screenplay was adapted awkwardly. It seemed to have too much Carpenter and not enough Zombie. I don't know if this was intended to connect the older generation with the new, but it didn't work for me.The movie was produced extremely well and has an awesome soundtrack. The point of view switch from Laurie's to Michael's was done perfectly. You feel sympathy for both characters as well as being afraid. If you are big fan of the original, you probably won't like this.

595,jockk407,Tonight on Jerry Springer: Michael Myers!,2,1 September 2007,"Just got back from seeing the ""re-imagining"" (barf) of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN. It doesn't even begin to compare to the original, but you knew that. But...if one attempts to take it on its own terms, as Rob Zombie seems to want the audience to do, is it worthwhile? The question is, regardless of the original, has Rob Zombie made a good movie? Well, the answer is YES, but it was called THE DEVIL'S REJECTS.What we have here is noisy, distasteful, pointless, and sloppy. Everyone speaks leftover dialogue from THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and what worked for those characters fails miserably for these. Every character in this film speaks as though they are 10 seconds away from throwing the first chair on Jerry Springer. Scenes aren't allowed to build, they jerk and sputter. The best moments come early, between young Michael and his mother (both played very well)...but even those scenes are constantly undermined by bad, choppy editing and surrounding characters (particularly the father) who are horribly written and seem to be played for laughs.The middle scenes in the hospital are interesting, but ultimately rendered pointless once the final (and worst) third of the film kicks in. Laurie, Annie, and Lynda are feckless foul-mouthed twits this time around, generating zero sympathy. Apparently in keeping with Zombie's theme from HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, the villain is the hero here, and this time it doesn't work. Since the only sympathetic characters are the supporting players who get pointlessly offed after barely a minute of screen time, the only one to root for is Michael. Is that really what Zombie had in mind? Judging from the reaction of the audience I saw this film with, it's what he accomplishes. People were laughing when characters were killed. Brutal, calculatedly cruel scenes are featured of nurses stabbed in the neck with forks, children beat to death with poles, teenagers stabbed to death multiple times, animals tortured (offscreen), and slutty topless girls strangled and beaten to death. The audience didn't scream, they laughed. It isn't because the film is funny...it's not. It isn't because the film is so bad it's good...it's not. I've never believed the theory of audience de-sensitizing due to TV, movie, and game violence. Until I witnessed this film.I've seen movies more violent, more disturbing, more exploitive. But never so pointless, all the while pretending to be about something...anything.Zombie's creation is a movie about morons, intended for morons. He is a talented and intelligent filmmaker who has made a movie driven by so many distasteful obsessions it practically throbs on the screen. But unlike his previous work, there's no point, not even for sheer trashy exploitation. Characters exist only to be killed. Women disrobe, everyone's vocabulary consists of nothing but four letter words, and the movie hisses and bangs and screams its way to a final, protracted, unexciting chase between an irresponsible babysitter we care nothing about and a 7 foot tall slasher with a Halloween mask fetish and an obsession with a sister he barely knew.By the time the film screeched to the credits and the lights came up, I had already fought with the four women in front of me (the dumb-ass mother had brought her three daughters, the dumb-assettes, who managed to giggle and snort and talk through a good portion of the movie). The argument continued after the movie was over, complete with name-calling. The entire theatre stared as they silently shuffled out.This is the reason I despise seeing movies in the theatre anymore. But I realized at least this nasty confrontation had given me something the movie had not: an element of excitement. These four girls had no consideration for anyone around them. They were rude, obnoxious, unreasonable and stupid.And as my friend and I vacated the theatre, it finally hit me...THEY were the audience this film was intended for.",Halloween

All the stuff unexplained in the original, the new version takes care of, and I really liked that.Second, it's been a lot better than a lot of remakes these days. It beyond trumped the Friday the 13th remake, that was just terrible. Compared to that, this is awesome.The reason I gave this a 9, not 10, was because the ending was kind of silly.

597,ThomEure,A New Michael For A New Generation,10,10 November 2007,"I tracked this movie from the time it was announced until it hit the theater. I grew up with the original Halloween (1978) and have been a huge fan. I probably purchased every video and DVD that has been released... currently I own three different DVD editions and the VHS 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition. I was a little nervous when I heard Rob Zombie was directing, mainly because I was not a big fan of House of 1000 Corpses or The Devil's Rejects. However, this movie was awesome. He took the story of Michael Myers and crafted it into a movie that totally takes Michael from being a faceless, indestructible killer to being a human being that life has dealt a raw deal to and the result is what you will see in the movie. Some may argue that it makes Michael less scary to put that human element in the story or to explain why he is the way he is. My opinion is that it makes the story realistic by identifying it with actual occurrences in society today. Everyone has experienced that individual growing up that never fit in or was picked on. That to me is the frightening piece of the story...it relates it to a ""this could actually happen"" scenario. Warning...do NOT go into this to compare it to the original...go into it with an open mind.

John Carpenter did a really good job by creating (in)famous Michael Myers and the hell of an art of the Halloween main music theme. Now it's Rob's turn to show us his point of view.I'm really glad that Rob chosed to stick with the original music play, let's be honest... it is the masterpiece. He gave us a deeper look into Michael's disturbed mind, deranged childhood and family... he gave us personality of the well-known psychopath.He cleverly arranged the plot and the development of our psycho. It's dark, twisted and obscene. Maybe he should left some parts of Michale's mind a mystery like Carpenter did, but again he gave us what most of us wanted to know.The acting is quite good, even though I was frustrated a few times by Laurie's and her teenage friends behavior. Let's face it... not all teens talk like that to their parents.The scenery looks a lot like the original setup, which is quite good... and he kept some of the original points and not just the crucial ones... but rememberable ones.All in all, like I sad, If you are fan of Rob's movies and you liked Carpenter's work, you should definitely see this.

His psychiatrist is so stuck on himself he is laughably played to all ham-handed glory, and the only redeeming quality about the film is killed off within the first 15 minutes and that would the comedic delivery of white-trashery by William Forsythe.Otherwise you have an overly long, twisted piece of tripe trying to stake its claim in the horror and terror genre when really it should be regulated to the garbage dump.Avoid at all costs.",Halloween
600,TeresofBlood,Loved by someone who hates remakes.,7,1 September 2007,"I saw the film last night and let me start off by saying I love the original. It is without question the best slasher film ever made. I went into this with not only low expectations, because of all the negative things I heard, but I also went in with no preconceived notions about the deviations it would make from Carptenter's original. As a fan of Zombie's last outing, ""Devil's Rejects"" I knew the style I could expect for the film.In the first act of the film we see Myers as a child. There are a lot of cringe worthy moments in the first act, like William Forsythe's over the top (and sometimes) funny redneck character. But overall it was very convincing. The scene with the bully in the woods was very disturbing to me. It was a great way to kick start the movie. The first act ends with Myers brutally murdering his family and I think this scene is very well done, and frightening; not scary as in Michael hiding in the shadows, but very scary to watch in a brutal ""Last House on the Left"" kind of way.The second act details Michael's years in the mental hospital with Doctor Loomis. There are some very compelling parts in this act, where we see Michael's slow progression from talkative, to deadpan. We see his mother's desperation as she visits her son. we feel a lot of sympathy for her character. She has perhaps one of the most sympathetic and powerful scenes in the movie. There is also some great, but understated acting by Danny Trejo in this act.We also see Michael as an adult in the hospital, now a hulking mass. I was worried when I saw how tall he was, but luckily the cinematography works in such a way that for most of the movie we can't quite tell he's that tall. There is a scene between adult Myers and Loomis, that is simple and short, but is very telling about Myers' character, to me. He feels things. He doesn't want to be given up on because he's always been ignored and given up on. I think the audience feels that vibe without it needing to be said. I felt it. Michael's mission is to find someone who could not/ would not ignore him.FINALLY, we get to Haddonfield and meet the girls. I think the fact that it took so long for us to get here is what angered die-hard fans of the original. I myself would have liked to see a little more of them before the crap hit the fan, but it certainly wasn't bad. The scenes between the three girls were very enjoyable and fun. I liked Zombie's incarnations of these three iconic characters. I think he did them justice in this new generation. When the killing starts, I felt it happened a little too fast. Bob's death felt seriously rushed; don't worry that's not a spoiler. All of the other death scenes very satisfying and very terrifying. Once again, there are very few jump moments in the film, but the fact that we know Michael is coming is what makes it scary. The climax of the film is also very terrifying and thought-provoking at the same time. Rob succeeded in making it scary again. He also succeeded in turning Michael Myers from a shape to a character.I think something that helped make the film scary was the cinematography. The shaky-cam effect got a little annoying at one or two points, but for this gritty, graphic horror style, it works beautifully. It gives the film a sense of realism, which I think is what it needed to bring back the fear. There is also a great music score accompanying the film in all the right moments. It is a rehash of John Carpter's original, incredible score and here I think it works as well as it did in the original. I can't say anything bad about the cast of the film. Everyone was great; everyone served their purpose to the film. Danielle Harris and Scout-Taylor Compton were excellent I thought. Both turned out very powerful performances - especially Harris. Malcolm McDowell had some cringe-worthy lines to deal with, but I think he was a great modern day Loomis. I don't compare him to Donald Pleasance in the original, but he was great in his own right.All in all I really loved the film; much more than I expected. For me, it's on par with the original. Not that I think this is better, but on a list of great movies I think they would fall about even. Those who go to see this hoping it will improve upon the arc created in the original by John Carpenter will hate it. In a nutshell this is a remake in concept alone - a young boy kills his family, goes mad and stalks teens several years later. It is a remake of the concept. Keep that in mind and you will love it. I without question will see it again.There is a lot to the plot that I don't mention in this review, but A. I didn't want to spoil anything and B. I didn't want to write a book. What I mention are the things that stood out to me.",Halloween
601,andrewlapointe,Rob Zombie's Halloween,3,31 August 2007,"Rob Zombie's remake of the classic Halloween has gusto going for it, but it fails in the end due to it's over excess and in-your-face messiness. This style worked very well in The Devil's Rejects but in a remake of a movie that was about subtlety and build up it doesn't work at all.Zombie also tries to humanize it's monster but does so in such a predictable way that it doesn't add to the horror in a good way. In the original we knew nothing at all about Michael Myers except that he was a quiet psychopath who's only purpose was to kill. His attempts to make him a bullied, neglected kid comes across like a brutal R rated version of an After School Special.That lack of development the old Michael Myers had made him more mysterious and scary. His family in this movie is made up of foul mouthed, mean spirited white trash who are hard to care about. In fact all the characters are over baked and shrill. Malcolm McDowell (a great actor) plays the role of Dr. Loomis (played with restraint by Donald Pleasance in the original.) McDowell's portrayal is over the top and scene chewing, which I guess is appropriate in this style of a remake but I wonder if he was playing him with the idea of making the character a parody of itself.Also when we get around to the three young girls, including the Jamie Lee Curtis character of Laurie Strode (played exceptionally here by Scout Taylor Compton) they are underdeveloped and not very likable. They are merely just meat put on screen so that they can be slaughtered in the next scene.The good points Zombie gets here are for the soundtrack (featuring the ominous John Carpenter score and some 70s classic rock, which Zombie utilized well in The Devil's Rejects.) There are also welcomed cameos by veteran B-actors such as Sid Haig, Dee Wallace, Danny Trejo, Ken Foree, etc.In the end, Rob Zombie's Halloween is too obvious, rushed, lacking in build up and it's sensationalistic. Hopefully he returns to original material for his next movie because he's much better off with that route.** out of ****",Halloween
602,knoyourrole04,"Please, everyone who doesn't like this movie, listen to this review",10,3 September 2007,"I watched this movie two times. The first time I watched it I compared it to the original and I hated it with an extreme passion. Then I went back to watch it again and I loved it. Rob Zombie told everyone of us how it was to be from the start, this wasn't a remake of a MOVIE. This was a reinvention of a CHARACTER. It was Zombie recreating in his mind, Michael Myers. He had to go with the name Halloween because Michael Myers couldn't be used with another movie title. The Carpenter Myers was incredible, unstoppable and needed no reason or background as to why he killed people the way that he did. The Zombie Myers had a bad upbringing, so what? Its not a slap in the face of Carpenter, its just Zombie's own interpretation. Carpenter's Myers was silently scary, not hulking, not busting through concrete walls, he was scary just by the mood, the stance, the music, it was a total movie work that made Carpenter's Myers work so well. Zombie took a different approach, he wanted you to be afraid of Michael Myers, no matter what, no matter if the haunting music is playing on the screen at the time.. No Matter if its night or daytime when you see Michael Myers you are supposed to be terrified and I think Zombie did it the way that he wanted, it served its purpose. He massacred people in a much more in your face, brutal way than Carpenter's Myers did and there is nothing wrong with that. Carpenter's Myers was so scary, still to this day is. Zombie's Myers is just as scary, just in a certain way. This movie stands alone everyone, don't compare it to the original. this zombie movie is good, the carpenter movie is great. Give Zombie a break, I think he did a fantastic job, I mean how can you fault someone for creating THEIR OWN PERSONAL vision, with the approval of John Carpenter by the way.",Halloween

605,thefiddle,Rob Zombie Knows Horror... Most Don't...,7,4 September 2007,"I just saw Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween and must say that I was very impressed. With most horror movie directors these days seeming clueless to their own genre, Rob Zombie comes to the scene as an audience member as well. He knows what he likes in a horror film and understands what the audience wants as well. Halloween has received much harsh criticism because it's not a replication of the original, or Zombie's style makes people uncomfortable... I would argue that these are the same folks who thought ""Wrong Turn"" was a real horror movie...Horror is probably the hardest genre in Hollywood to do. I wasn't a fan of Zombie's debut, House of a 1000 Corpses, but Devil's Rejects remains one of my favorite horror films to date. Halloween is not a perfect film by any means. It is a very different take on the classic, and Rob Zombie is a refreshing voice in a genre that has been robbed of any momentum. I personally think he is the best thing to happen to horror in a long time and I will go see any film his name is attached to.",Halloween
606,DistantJ,Amazing Remake,10,3 September 2007,"My trust in mainstream film critics is at an all time low lately, with more and more exciting new movies getting worse and worse critical reception, but I have finally been pushed to the point where I will never trust a mainstream critic again. I just saw Halloween...Dawn of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have been the most praised of the obligatory 21st century horror remakes, but I'd place Halloween high above all of these.Rather than taking the basic idea and creating a whole new movie, or trying to recreate the movie scene for scene, Halloween falls somewhere inbetween. It tells the story of Michael Myers in a much darker, more down-to-earth way and spends a surprisingly long time on it's prologue. We get a very depthy look into the life of 'the shape' as a child, and then at his time spent in the sanitarium with Dr. Loomis. Some people will miss the mystery of the original film (in fact, I'd say 'the shape' was no longer a fitting name), but after the ridiculous backstories, motivations and explanations from the infinite sequels, it's much better to see him return to being an evil maniac for his own reasons.Mikey Myers is bigger, badder and more frightening than he's ever been, and with his more realistic backstory and completely removed ""mythical being who can't die"" business, it feels so much more gritty and real. The killings are brutal, hard hitting and realistic. Not once do we see ridiculous cartoony disembodiments, exploding heads or amusing 'creative' killings - the murders in this film are genuinely frightening and the gore is as realistic as it gets. The mask is a surprisingly accurate recreation of that from the original film, and it's dirty, worn and torn look is reminiscent of the similar badassifying of Leatherface in 2003.I especially liked one moment when, {spoiler}rather than killing off one character, big Mike mortally wounds her and leaves her for dead, crying in pain{end spoiler}. It was particularly nasty and it's something you rarely see in a slasher film (I mean, normally somebody will receive a small wound and die instantly from it in these films.), it really got me scared.After being a little concerned about some of the acting in the early clips I saw, when I saw the full movie I was relieved, because it's top notch stuff. Malcolm McDowell is just as great at Dr. Loomis as Donald Pleasance was in 1978, and the girls are a lot more Hollywood and a lot less ""the director's friends"" this time around. As expected, the actress who played the little girl Jamie so stunningly well for a child actress in the old sequels did amazingly as Annie as well.It seems to have devided it's audience in half between people who like different aspects of a horror movie. A lot of people seem to be upset because it's graphic, gruesome and fast paced as opposed to the ominous, suspenseful tone of the original. I feel that this indicates Rob Zombie's awareness of the fact that in 2007 a knife-wielding man wearing a mask just isn't going to work like it did in '78.If you're a slasher fan and you can accept a few differences in tone, you'll love this twisted, darker, more gritty and more human take on the Michael Myers story for the Saw generation. Fantastic stuff!",Halloween
607,Murphy_87,A Near Perfect Yet Unsatisfying Remake,6,28 August 2007,"*SPOILERS* First of all Rob Zombie's style of directing has definitely come along way since House of 1000 Corpes and he really has done Carpenter and the fans proud by sticking to the original source material yet at the same time bringing his own style of horror and reinventing the series for todays audience of gore lovers.The first 5 minutes of the original Halloween are shown during the first 40 minutes of this remake where we see the young Michael Myers and his family and are given a few reasons as to what made Michael turn psycho. Whether this benefited the remake I'm not sure as it did slow the pace down at times but did dismiss the idea of a prequel ever happening but was a brave writing move as the young Myers had never been shown in any of the previous Halloween films. Thank God Zombie had the sense to use Carpenters classic theme once again which created brief moments of suspense and brought back the old Halloween feeling, without it the film would of been empty. Im sure samples was taken from other Carpenter themes including The Fog and The Thing and there was a new theme thats also used in the trailers and in the film towards the end that I liked. Zombie definitely was trying to give wife Sherri Moon some acting exposure as Michael's mom and in all honestly she did pull of her role and had a lot of early on screen time....whether u cringe at the 'Love Hurts' scene or you don't find nothing wrong with it being in a Halloween film i'll leave it for you to decide. I was surprised to see Zombie didn't include any of his trademark rock music.The remake did try to create some emotion aimed at the young Michael and at times he did seem an anti-hero especially in the last 5 minutes as the young boy and Dr Loomis relationship was established early on and re-visited in the final scenes. One scene in particular comes to mind when Michael shows Laurie a picture of when she was a baby being held by young Michael which was a nice touch to the film.Nearly every character in the first half of the film suffers from a Zombie haircut and at times i thought it was a girl playing the young Michael Myers due to having long blonde hair. Its clear from the first few minutes from the amount of swearing and sexual related dialogue that this is a Zombie film and definitely reminded me of House Of 1000 corpse and The Devils Rejects especially seeing Laurie later on fingering a bagel, although the language does tone down towards the end. Of course Zombie tried to shock us once again with a pointless rape scene that seems to be his director trademark now, it didn't do the film any favours but I did forget it once the film jumped ahead 15 years later.Zombie got together a great cast of horror veterans who really did give great performances, Laurie wasn't explored as much as Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie but I think Zombie was trying to show the relationship between Loomis and Myers more to suit his own ending. As for the gore....yeah its pretty brutal and there are a lot more murders and blood but nothing too shocking that hasn't been shown in Scream and the recent Texas Chainsaw films. Whether fans of the original don't like this addition of gore,then its really there own fault as they should of expected it from Zombie. Everyone knows the original was mainly about suspense and left the horror to the imagination, and between each murder there isn't enough time for any suspense to build. Like I said the final 20 minutes has most of the suspense as Michael kidnaps Laurie and Loomis races to save her.I liked the ending which was different from the original and I think was purposely done by Zombie to leave us on a whats now cliffhanger to see if he's given the go ahead by Dimension to do a sequel if this makes enough money at the box office. Basically Michael gets shot quite a few times, and you just see him lying there and assume he is dead. I think this was the best way to end the remake instead of making Michael immortal and swaying to the supernatural killer who cant be stopped as I don't think Carpenter intended the character to be Overall this is definitely worth watching and Zombie did a very good job and I look forward to seeing more from him. At times I wasn't sure whether the film worked or if I thought it was another pointless remake but I honestly think the last 20 minutes saved the film. Minus the rape scene and a few lines of swearing this film would of been perfect and was an excellent reminder of the Halloween films The original will always be the best and although this will be forgotten it wont be as quickly as some of the more recent horror remakes *cough* the hitcher, the omen, the wicker man. But a great remake for today and well done for Zombie for giving it his best as the idea of a killer has been done so may time since the original Halloween. Im sure this film wont escape criticism but its a damn good remake. Plus its worth it to see Danielle Harris get naked, although I'll never be able to see her in the same way the next time I watch Halloween 4 and 5, knowing she grew and looks sexy now.",Halloween
608,jeff-theis4,A compelling alternative to Carpenter's original,8,4 December 2017,"Despite all the criticisms that have been hurled at him over the course of his filmmaking career, Rob Zombie never fails to present an entirely unique vision with a definitive style, even when remaking one of the most beloved horror classics of the modern era. Remaking such a revered film is always going to be a risky task, and Zombie's retelling of John Carpenter's original has been polarizing to say the least. It has been decried by fans for failing to live up to the original's spirit, and of demystifying one of cinema's most iconic boogeymen, Michael Myers. It's obscene and violent, whereas the original is restrained and understated, and explicitly deals with Myers' psychology, which the original decidedly kept vague, save for the occasional ""pure evil"" speech by Donald Pleasance. Indeed, this remake differs so heavily from the original that it becomes something entirely different, which some will use as a criticism, but I can't help but commend. In an age of cynical cash-grabs, the Halloween sequels being perfect examples, this re-imagining opts to use the Halloween mythos as the means to tell an entirely different story, and to convey an entirely different experience. As a ""Halloween"" film, it can be seen as a disappointment, but if viewed on its own terms, it's a deeply unsettling and emotionally provocative tale of a twisted family reunion.The most substantial criticism of the film is that, by exploring Michael Myers' psychology and by humanizing him, it removes what made him so effectively scary in the first place, as the audience now has the opportunity to gain a sense of familiarity with him. However, that's presuming the intent of the John Carpenter's original onto this film, which set out to accomplish something entirely different. Rob Zombie has no interest in keeping Michael Myers in the background, but instead, makes him the central focus in order to trace his psychological evolution from demented child to enraged psychopath. This Myers isn't so much a personification of evil as he is a manifestation of rage whose humanity is stripped away over the course of the film. The original reinterpreted the boogeyman in a suburban setting, but this re-imagining takes you into the boogeyman's world, and forces the audience to experience his life through his eyes. Perhaps not the most effective slasher fodder, but personally, I found Michael's continual descent into madness to be disturbing, provocative, and even, perhaps, a little sad. Taken on its own terms, the film is a chilling portrait of a deranged mind, and the impact he has on those around him. Despite accusations to the contrary, the film deals with the theme of violence more than it exploits it, and the explicit gore is used to convey the uncompromising brutality of the carnage which Michael leaves in his wake. The foul language and vile characters desensitize the audience just as it does Myers, and while I could admittedly have done without the white-trash element, it feels more like a component to the story than a simple cliché.This is all, of course, without mentioning of the technical aspects of the film, which I find superb across the board. Say what you will about Rob Zombie's ear for dialogue, but visually, this film boasts a haunting atmosphere, and proves that Rob Zombie has speaks the language of cinema fluently. The performances are all convincing and engaging, especially from Taylor-Compton and McDowell. Taylor-Compton's Laurie has been criticized as being a stark deviation from Jamie Lee Curtis' portrayal, but her performance, save for an admittedly terrible introduction, is appropriate for Zombie's vision. Her bubbly charm and happy-go-lucky attitude both serve to make her an endearing character, especially in her babysitting scenes, and to also provide to juxtapose her with the brooding and enraged Michael Myers, played to perfection by Tyler Mane.McDowell has likewise been criticized for not living up to Donald Pleasance's intensity, despite the fact that this, again, is an entirely different take on the character. McDowell plays a more conflicted version of the character, who regards Michael as a danger to society, but also as something of a kindred spirit, even something as a friend, which is as perverse as it is fascinating. McDowell instills the role with sincerity and compassion, and creates a sympathetic character out of the good doctor, especially in the asylum scenes where he desperately tries and fails to help his troubled patient regain his humanity.Of course, fans of the original will take issues with the liberties Zombie took with the material no matter what, which is perfectly within their rights. Film is a subjective experience, and your perspective on a film will depend, in large part, on personal taste and preference. That said, if one is to judge this film, they should do so on its own terms, as they should with any film, because one is to do so here, they could find the merit of the film that I found. Some fans might even be enraged at the very thought of these films, and couldn't believe that someone could enjoy it. They might look at this film and ask, ""was that the boogeyman?"" In fact, I do believe it was.",Halloween
609,tbell-58449,Great movie if you have an open mind.,9,8 September 2016,"The remake of Halloween by Rob Zombie is very amazing. It drawn an attention from me from the beginning through the end. Rob Zombie introduced the cause of Michael Myers's mental illness which make the viewer have a deeper understand of him better than the old version (1978). The suspense and gore are still amazing although some of the scenes were the same as the original one. Overall, Rob Zombie was success in making the remake of Halloween. Some people might hate this version because they never open their mind for a new idea and always stick on the old one. The use bias and judge to rate this movie.

610,JMoviebuff0001,Very good update,9,31 August 2007,"A lot of people seem to be missing the point of this updated remake. When Rob Zombie talked with John Carpenter about re-making Halloween, Carpenter said to Rob to make it your own, don't just make a complete remake. That's why Zombie made it different and doesn't stick to the original script. Zombie decided to add his own vision of Michael Myers psyche as a kid, the hate filled home with the exception of his mom and of course baby sis Laurie. Originally the studios had plans to make Halloween: The Missing Years which would have shown Michael's path towards his psychotic state of mind in the institute, but Zombie came along with his script and got the go ahead. This movie is as good as the original if not better.",Halloween

In this Mike comes from a white trash nightmare and his mom cannot protect him from the scumbag loser she has taken up with nor his uber slutty sister. His penchant for cruelty was nicely established, but after a promising start it rolls down hill.

Yes, it's a remake, we all know the story but it had no story what so ever, all we see after michael myers turns into an adult is killing..too much gore...too much blood and they didn't focus in the story. Dr Loomis was portrayed badly..it seemed like the actor wasn't trying, Micheal Myers (adult) was played good in my opinion though.It had some decent killing scenes..but other than that, nothing interesting. 95% of the remakes are truly bad, this was no exception and if you are a fan of the original halloween, just don't watch it.

I like how the first half we get the backstory to Michael Myers and the second half is a remake. Like I said the original Halloween had a good story but the kills were too tame and it was boring. The remake took the same story and added the backstory of Michael Myers and you get one amazing horror film! This is an example of how a remake to a horror movie can be better then the original when done correctly! Thank you Rob Zombie for taking a movie that was mediocre at best and turn it into an amazing film. This movie is highly underrated and I recommend it to anyone! Screw the boring original!,Halloween

""utterly fantastic"" ""This is going nowhere"") It also spent a great deal of time depicting the trio of teens doing a bunch of other hum-drum activities that had nothing to do with the plot. IT WAS BORING. IT NEEDED REMADE. Rob Zombies version was more brutal, better executed, had more realism, even the nudity was better (Danielle Harris is a babe), and I might add, it spent more time addressing the initial plot, I usually don't even like remakes, but this is the BEST Halloween ever.

615,bigjonnyutah,"Well, It was better than Zombie's First two films",4,3 February 2008,"First off, I have to say that I am a horror movie fan. Which seems to be a contradiction in terms considering that the vast majority of them suck (yes, I will volunteer that). However, I did just come off of the elation that Hollywood had managed to make - what I felt - was a very good horror/suspense film with Stephen Kings ""1408"" So there was a glimmer of hope, for me.Plus, I do like Rob's Zombie's Music and his music videos. Unfortunately, this movie Is little more that yet example of Rob's desire to do a great horror film and turn up with - just another worn out plot line. His first film was little more than a Road Trip gone wrong movie, His second movie was nothing but a - well, I don't know what you'd call it but I certainly wouldn't call it good. And this at the end of the day is little more than a Slashing murdering serial killer bloodbath movie.Now I will admit that I actually like the first 30 or 40 minutes of the movie (I don't know, maybe its because I like a little more depth in the character than just ""He's evil""). But after he escapes from the asylum its just another slash and murder bloodbath.I felt that after once he ""came home"" - as it were - The plot line got thin, the characters got stereotypical of any actor in an attempt at horror, and basically the story got lost in the muck and mire of the film making.Now, that being said. I do have to admit that Rob Zombie has gotten better in his directing skills. You can actually see improvement in at least some of his directorial skills, but you HAVE to keep in mind that we are not talking about any Ron Howard, or Stephen Spielburg... We're talking about Rob Zombie, and He's got a long way to go. Although it is highly doubtful he'll do anything besides ""B"" style horror flicks.And ""B"" Style horror flick this is. Let's not fool ourselves, this is little more than a remake that has its good parts but in the end fails to deliver anything real scary.",Halloween

I will never forget some of the things I saw in them. Hell, I have a framed ""Devil's Rejects"" poster hanging up in my house. I could have only imagined the possibilities of what he could do with this! And this is what we got? Did he confuse Jason with Michael? In his interviews he said this wasn't going to be a remake but his own vision of it. Really?!? Maybe he should start blaming somebody else. It jumped back and forth from a remake to the ""new vision"" and I didn't really understand why. If he was going to keep some of the old stuff in it why take everything that made the original a classic out? I'm no film maker BUT, I KNOW I could have done better than this! If ya wanna see a better updated ""vision"" of a ""Halloween"" film, watch ""H20"". At least in that you feel like it is really Micheal Mayers behind the mask.

I Am Sad To Say That That Wasn't The Case. Some Actors, As Much As They Might Have Tried, Just Didn't Fit Into Their Characters, And Weren't To Believable. Another Flaw Was The Ending, I Am Not Going To Ruin It For You Because I Do Believe This Is A Must See For All Horror Fans, But From All The Suspense Built Up Throughout The Film I Must Say It Was Most Unsatisfying, So Don't Expect Something Like Devil's Rejects. As Promised Rob Zombie Delivers The Shocking Tale Behind Micheal's Rampage, It Was A lot Better Than I Thought, Giving Fans Of The Original A Reason To See It.Although I Thought This Film Wasn't Nessesary, And Made To Make A Cheap Buck, It Is Refreshing To Know That Directors Like Rob Zombie Are Keeping Horror Alive.Overall Rating: 8 Out A 10 Stars",Halloween

This Rob Zombie film is an ORANGE. (a very sweet, yet gritty/pulp-filled Orange). And it deserves a pedestal all its own.No...it does NOT ""trash the original"". Not at all. (Much like Zach Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' remake...it IS certainly a ""new take"", yet appreciative and respectful of its original source material, and yet IS its ""own film"" in every right).While I also shall grant that Rob Zombie simply cannot resist giving his wife a role to take her clothes off at any given point and time (he does. And do YOU truly mind? I mean, honestly? It isn't like Rob Z is married to ""Kathy Bates"" here). So Sheri Moon? Take em all off. Go for it baby cakes.But aside from that ""given entity"" in just about ANY Rob Zombie film...it is the BACKSTORY here that makes 'Rob Zombie's Halloween"" a magnificent feat.Zombie goes very, very DEEP into the mind of madness. Taking (what Carpenter made to be a mindless/soul-less/machine...""with the blackest eyes, the Devil's eyes""...and (literally) tells the tale of ""what made Michael Myers...""Michael Myers"".That...alone? Is worth every bit of your time. Absolutely and hands down. Tyler Mane is (again...hands down) THE BEST ""Michael Myers"" of all time. His performance alone of a young, bullied, tortured, trapped and wayward child...is nothing short of brilliant, if not ""Overlooked-Oscar Worthy"".We once praised a young Linda Blair for this EXACT type role. Same with a young Sissy Spacek. And dare I go so far as to say? We ALSO heaped praise upon that kid who played ""Gage"" in Pet Sematary.Yet TYLER MANE here is scarier and more-believable than even Linda Blair.I strongly-suggest (those whom knee-jerk-gave this film a 1 star review) that YOU rewatch this film with an OPEN mind.I will cede that ""Malcolm McDowell is NOT as good as Donald Pleasance"" and that ""Danielle Harris seems a bit out of place"". But she IS quite good, nonetheless.But his film DOES have SYBIL DANNING in a cameo! That alone, is good for 3 stars
But Zombie knows his cinematography and also captures the absolute gritty and disgusting 'realism' of a serial killer.And he GIVES the serial killer a reason to BE it.Watch it again and RE-review it.This film is 8 stars...period.Gritty, real and nasty. To its core.Anyone else? Would have ruined this film.But when it comes to ""grindhouse/realism/gutter-realism""? Absolutely...you want Rob Zombie on the job.You want a ship to overturn or a building to blow up? You hire Irwin Allen.Wanna portray the Mob? Hire Coppola or Scorcese
Wanna go deep/mental/weird? Kubrick.But if you TRULY want to understand ""trailer trash monsters?"" Then you definitely hire Rob Zombie.8 stars. Is ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"". (Anything less, said by anyone else? Deserves to have them get stuck in an endless time warp of having to watch ""Rob Zombie's Halloween 2"". (Yep. It sucked.)
But his HALLOWEEN Remake? Is a GEM.Watch it and re-learn.",Halloween
619,The-Guv,Why All The Hate?,8,4 October 2007,"I'm not a fan of ROB ZOMBIES FILMS, i prefer his music with WHITE ZOMBIE and his solo stuff. BUT! I am a die hard fan of the HALLOWEEN films. i've seen them all and love them all ( thought h20 and resurrection sucked major league ass). I liked this film.Yes this film is basically a shot for shot remake of the original but also by adding in an interesting back story which was good but it suddenly seemed rushed. my only problem was that there wasn't really a connection between Myers and Dr. Loomis when Michael escaped and Loomis caught up with him it didn't seem to gel.the casting was brilliant I loved MALCOLM MCDOWEL in his role, certainly lived up to the greatness of DONALD PLEASANCE. and Sheri Moon did remarkably well and even looked kind of hot in all fairness.yes I'm fully aware this didn't live up to the greatness of the original. the first was scary and disturbing this wasn't quite the case. but it wasn't a bad film, I enjoyed watching watching it and thats basically what i look for when i go to the cinema's * A film that i will enjoy*so watch it before you give it a bashing.",Halloween
620,sdtownse,WOW - - Workprint vs. Theatrical Release,9,2 September 2007,"First off I want to make it clear that the 9/10 rating is based on a review for the work print and NOT the theatrical release. The version of the movie that you will see in theaters is NOT GOOD. It is a complete deconstruction of a great movie in order to get the movies release rating lowered (in Canada is rated 14-A). The scenes are stupid and boring and the movie drags on and on for no good reason. The ending is a freaking train wreck and in all it seems very uninspired.The work print (which is the original cut that Zombie had polished) however is incredible! It is unbelievable how changing a few scenes can make or break a movie. The work print stays true to the series. The way Michael escapes from the sanitarium for example is an inside perspective of the original, where the theatrical release is just stupid. Even the end, which I won't give away for the sake of those who hate spoilers (I know how you feel), is completely different and much more effective and believable.Here is a breakdown for both releases:Theatrical release -- 4.5/10PROSthe stabbed into the wall scene is in here, excellent! - Michaels mask is much more menacing than previous Halloween titles - Sheri Moon Zombie is excellentCONSthe concept strays so far off path of the series that it is almost unrecognizable to the rest of the movies - the story seems to take forever to develop and the scenes are too intentional to be scary - there is no suspense - why is everyone left to try and crawl away? - ending is extremely dragged out and quite boring and stupid - Michaels character is uncharacteristically remorseless towards certain characters (don't agree, then watch the series you'll understand, #5) - Michael seems less menacing for some reason - Child Michael wears the white mask...STUPID!The Work print - 9/10PROSTrue to the series - Although it develops Myers in the same way as the theatrical release, it seems to maintain the menacing feeling the character is supposed to have - THE ENDING !!!!!!!! - The rape scene (I know it is terrible for all of you who have seen it, but it sends the story in a better direction than the theatrical version)CONSNo stabbed into the wall scene :( - The rape scene (see pros) - I still have that the child Michael wears the white mask. More funny than anything.Basically in summary download the work print, you won't regret it, but still see the movie in theaters to support Rob and maybe he'll make a sequel!Let's all just hope that the DVD will be a directors cut so it will leave room for a sequel. I hate the editors on the theatrical release. I can't believe Rob let them do that to his movie.",Halloween
621,ggoinghometime,First half - YAY! Second half - EH....,6,29 July 2008,"Just last week, I visited the Halloween locations (new and original) in Pasadena. That made me on the roll for my Halloween love again...I watched the original the night before, which is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and fell in love with it all over again. It would be better to refresh my memory and then watch the remake...You know, to compare...Let me start off with the BACK STORY of Michael Myers. I LOVED IT. I actually did...A lot of people can disagree with that especially the hardcore fans of the original series...A lot of people will argue that Michael Myers background should REMAIN A MYSTERY... But Rob Zombie was able to make it creative. To make it creepy. To not give TOO MUCH WAY, but a good bulk of why he is so insane...A psychopath...The kid actually looked kind of creepy...Enough of the back story. I loved it. That is that. Screw you. It was great. Cheers for that in the remake.The director's cut was slightly different. The only thing different was HOW Michael escaped...I actually did not enjoy it that much as the original...It was brutal and disturbing and sort of pointless in a way...That means it included a rape scene. Yay Rob Zombie...?I wasn't too into the new cast of girls...I HATED Laurie...She got better towards the end (which was the best 'present-Myers' part of the movie)...Her character was totally different from the original...Totally different than the conservative, wanting to be adventurous, smart girl in the original Halloween...There were a lot of little parts from the original movie that went into the remake that I did not like at all. When the boyfriend was getting the beer and got killed by Michael...And then Michael put blankets over him and had his glasses on, making him look like it was still the boyfriend...Dammit, he even HANDED the BEER to her...WHAT THE HELL? CHEES-Y.... AND it was TOO similar by putting the glasses on, which I hated...I'm not too sure with the second half of the movie...I'm not sure why. Maybe I am spoiled for loving the original too much? There was something about it that wasn't as innovative as I expected...There were some changes in the movie, as far as the plot goes. But that is okay, since it IS a remake... The best part of the second half probably will be the ending when Michael takes Laurie into the Myers house.Well, that's my 2 cents into Rob Zombie's Halloween.If you are a fan of the original, watch it. Don't refuse to watch it because you think it is 'destroying' the original...Just watch RobZombie's approach to it...It's different. You may hate it. You may love it. You may especially love the background of Michael Myers, but that doesn't change your love for the original HALLOWEEN.",Halloween

I am a fan of the Halloween franchise, and a fan of Rob Zombie's films. I REALLY wanted to enjoy this film, however it was bad all the way through. Zombie's reinterpretation left me with the same feeling of disgust I had watching Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes: I left the theatre wanting to see the original. Mind you, I wasn't disappointed because I expected a frame-by-frame remake, I just was expecting the usual one may want from a good-to-great movie: character development, believable dialogue, and good storytelling. Zombie's film lacked all three.",Halloween
623,yorel01,OK remake but to many plot changes and bad pacing make for a disappointing film,5,31 August 2007,I wanna start by saying I am a fan of Zombies House of 1000 Corpses and Devils Rejects I liked the characters in those films and actually found them funny in a twisted kinda way. That being said the original Halloween is probably my favorite of the old school slasher flicks so I was excited it was been remade and thought going in Zombie would do a good job with the film but I watched the film and it didn't work for some very simple reasons number 1 being Zombie change some key parts including the ending I'm assuming to try and make the film his own but I did not like these changes at all and 2 he really IMO screwed up the pacing both these things really hurt the film its not horrible just flawed and yes the original is better so the keyword for this film is disappointing. A lot of the comments on this film are by Zombie haters and there entitled to there views but the 2 reasons I mentioned are the real problem its not because Zombie is a bad director he just missed with this one and for those people who hate Zombie so much why would they go see it in the first place I give the film a 6 could have been better sure but definitely could have been worse.,Halloween
624,dunit013-2,Good for torture- porn,8,16 November 2008,"Advice to people who watch this movie. Do NOT expect a remake of Halloween. Because it's not. Not just because only 1/3 of the movie takes places on present day Halloween. Because it's a Rob Zombie movie. In John Carpenter's Halloween, the death toll was 5 people. There was very little gore(if any) and there was some nudity. This movie has lots of gore, sex, and the F word is used every other minute. The important thing is that it' entertaining. The acting is bad. But who goes into a slasher movie expecting good acting? Just enjoy this movie for what it is. Yes, the original is still a better movie. And if you're a Rob Zombie fan, this is his best movie so far.",Halloween
625,tonymanno,Better than I expected...,6,20 January 2008,"The first part of the movie gives us a back story--trying to explain why Michael Myers is the way he is...and it does not work. Worse yet is that Michael talks in this movie.The second part of the movie pretty much follows the original. It is more graphic, but nothing most people cannot handle. And there are a lot of things unexplained, like how Michael knows Laurie is his baby sister after all those years.The best part about HALLOWEEN is the ending. There is no way that MM survived this time.Ultimately, it is time to wrap this franchise up. One more movie to complete the storyline from #6. And one more movie to finish from #8. Actually, add the first 12 minutes of 8 to H20 and leave it at that.",Halloween
626,Morbid69,If your a fan of the original stay far away....,9,21 November 2007,"However, if your a fan of horror movies and thought the original sucked...by all means go see this movie! Rob Zombie has said in many interviews that this movie is nothing like the original. He added a story to Micheal that wasn't there before. Instead of creating a long chase scene between Laurie and Micheal he shortened it down...a lot.None of this is bad though! People have been complaining a lot about many things in this film, the language, the nudity, the violence, and the story.Language: Many people seemed to have been offended by the amount of cursing Rob Zombie used in this film. My question to them, ""Did you see any of his other films?"". I know many people that talk just like they do in this movie so it's not as unrealistic as people say.Nudity: Yes, there is a lot of nudity in this film. Get over it. I don't know about the rest of you, but if I want to have sex with my girlfriend, you can bet your ass I want her to be naked. Why should the characters do otherwise? I don't recommend taking young children to this, but come on adults, you should be able to handle it.Violence: Micheal Myers no longer cuts away the violent bits. He enjoys blood and gore just like every other slasher character. Who goes to a MODERN REMAKE of a slasher film NOT expecting blood or gore? That's just stupid.The Story: Yeah, it's changed. If your such a fan of the original and won't even give this one a chance...go watch the original again. Don't spend all your time on a message board pointing out all the differences between the two. Anyone who has scene the original can tell what the differences between the two are.Overall: Don't go see this movie if your expecting a frame for frame remake. This is Halloween mixed with Rob Zombie. It's going to be different. If your a die hard fan of the original and think nothing can top it, don't go to this one. If you didn't like the original, or never saw it, go to this one. Sit back and enjoy.",Halloween
627,crbr01,Don't waste your time or life,1,31 December 2008,"Sure, remakes can be good, don't get me wrong. Here is a problem with this one everything. The story, the characters, the director everything about the film was atrocious. Rob Zombie was the chosen director by remake kings Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the most worthless people on this earth. Rob Zombie is known for his violence, his cussing (look at his music), being hippie (everyone had long hair, even he does), etc. He made the family trailer trash with the *f* bomb in every sentence, making us feel sorry for a killer. The original made you feel a sense of creepy, unknowing why that this person killed his sister, not wanting to feel sorry for the killer which is the main point. The killer is supposed to be someone you want to die. We get to the original part of the film, with the remake. What do you know he messed it up! Zombie didn't even develop the characters any bit, you wanted them all to die. Sure, Annie Bracket, Lynda van der klok, and Laurie Strode. Laurie Strode was an idiot. She didn't know anything and she was a dunce. What can you say that is Rob Zombie? And wow! Dr. Sam Loomis, the psychiatrist of Michael Myers, was awful as well. You hated him too because he was just living off the story of Michael Myers. He didn't even care about anything else.I don't care what you think about the movie. I think if you're going to remake something remake something that was a awful movie. Don't remake movies that were a cult classic that were best of time. Find movies that had promise of its times (in this case, the late 1970s) and make it better. We never heard if John Carpenter actually saw the film. I'm guessing he didn't and don't blame him. Another movie he made was remade and done terribly. This movie doesn't even deserve a one. A ZERO!! ZERO!!",Halloween
628,dawson1973,Improvement on previous versions,7,14 April 2009,"Rob Zombie has taken the classic film and given it a much needed gore update (its not flooded with the stuff but its there) Not quite as good as Devil's Rejects but still adequate. The story has been added to by showing us Michael Myers as he grows up but essentially its the same killer, killing on Halloween night. You know what to expect but seeing the kid grow up to be what he becomes gives a more chilling aspect to the story. I would say that this is a good remake overall and would recommend. And the fact that my girlfriend wouldn't watch it is always a good sign! I really want to see more of Zombies talent as a horror writer and director.",Halloween

Michael is more bigger, badder and better than ever in this film; My favorite Halloween film. By far. With that being said, I really do hope you enjoy this film.

630,moviecroc,Wow.....was Rob Zombie serious?,1,14 April 2010,"Where to start. Well i will try and go through all of the things that are wrong with this movie. If there even is enough room.1. the age and actions of Michael when he is younger. Hello Rob Zombie! he was 6 not 10! And the fact that he was bullied, and abused was terrible. It's like Leatherface or Jason. And the original body count for the opening :1. Not 4. And they didn't even add to the story. His sister was a slut. His step-dad was an asshole. And the boyfriend was a stoned dick-head. Like almost all of the characters. Oh and his mom is a stripper? You're joking right? 2. All of the scenes in and out of the hospital: BAD. Michael talking and crying saying he wants to go home= NOT SCARY.3. Just the whole mental hospital scenes sucked.4. How big Michael gets. He is a monster. That's NOT scary. Its annoying.5. When he gets to Haddonfield, it's just horrible. All of the profanity (in all parts of the movie) is just terrible.6. Um Rob, bud, ANNIE dies first. And Lynda and Bob die in the WALLACE house not the MYERS house. I know its a small thing, but it bothered me.7. Annies death or whatever you like to call it. Michael wants to kill all of Laurie's friends. Paul wasn't her friend. And he completely changed Annies death to add more nudity. Of course Rob kept Lynda's the same cause there was all ready nudity.8. Laurie=ANNOYING. Her scream sucked. She just seemed annoying to me. I like Scout but she didn't good at all.Overall, there was NO SUSPENSE. Too much profanity. And over the top gore.Word of advice to Rob: actually watch the original. not fast forward to the nudity and gore (which is like 10 seconds all together) and not make your own crap to fill the holes.",Halloween
631,dbnafus-806-884251,A refreshing perspective with a substantive plot,9,14 October 2011,"Scanning the reviews, I can see most people who bother to write them view the first movie as a timeless classic or masterpiece that cannot be touched. That being said, I know I have seen the first movie, but am unable to recall much of anything about it. Frequently those who viewed this remake unfavorably complain about the movie's inability to terrify the viewer. This blows my mind, I mean, who hasn't been desensitized to horror since Hostel? Does anyone actually feel frightened by movies that is over the age of 21 anymore?As for the movie itself, it gives a very plausible reason why Micheal turned out the way he did, because simply being a mental-freak of nature for no apparent reason than genetic anomalies never made much sense. Most mental illness is self-induced over time with coping strategies employed by the victim, so giving him such a hostile environment with a predisposition to want to lash out made the persona of Micheal much more believable. Aside from the insight of how serious mental-illness can develop, the acting of the characters and the overall production played beautifully toward developing the plot. I was especially pleased to note Zombie had not made this into a ""gore-fest"" like Saw 3, and that kept the wonder alive in trying to understand this masked menace.Overall, a well edited and captivating movie.",Halloween
632,jtye20,Not tooo bad could of been better,5,16 June 2011,"I didn't get this movie i didn't get what Rob Zombie was trying to do with the second half of this movie.I Know this is a remaining 0f the first Halloween but why did he have 2 make a bad second half of a movie. Let me say this about the movie i liked the first half a lot i know it was alittle trashy but its was a nice beginning and a fresh take on Michael myers . lets start off on what i liked about the movie the introduction to Michael as a weird disturbed child who likes killing animals was the pretty screwed up not to mention the bully scene witch summed up what kind of movie this was going to be a trashy , unsettling look through the eyes of the bogeyman. now what i hated about the film was the second half witch is just a rush through of john carpenters original and not to the mention chick u plays Laurie strode is no where near as good as Jaime lee Curtis. Malcolm McDowell play a good dr lomis but no where near Donald pleasence original. brad douirf was good as the sheriff but should of been in the movie more Laurie's friends were OK to even though they didn't have much 2 do. As for the new look for Michael i like what zombie did to the mask making it look creepy and dirty and disgusting but Michael wasn't really scary he was just big as hell like a giant. even though i enjoyed the first half of the film i couldn't stand the second have of it but all in all a pretty good try by zombie could of been a lot worse",Halloween
633,Goldenage6,Finally A Decent Re-Make Of A True Horror Classic,10,13 September 2007,"I have to say I was extremely pleasantly surprised with Rob Zombies masterful work on his re-make of the horror classic Halloween. I have never been a fan of Rob Zombies movies so I went to the theater with doubt. Maybe this was a good thing, because was I surprised and entertained beyond belief. The back-story of Michael Myers was genius, and his dark larger then life appearance made me very quiver. I know it's virtually impossible to re-make classic movies, such as the Omen, When a Stranger Calls, The Fog, the list goes on and on. But, I have to say Mr. Zombie hit the nail on the head. Bravo!! I read a few critic reviews, and they were harsh and very unfair. All I know is that on this particular evening the theater was full, and a lot of screaming and squawking went on. When the movie was finished the audience did clap. Doesn't that count for something? Who are the critics anyway, it's we the people that matter! This may be the kind of movie that has a bigger influenced impact on a larger screen, so I don't know how well it will do on DVD? Sort of like War of the Worlds, great in the theater but missed something on the small screen. All I have to say to Mr. Rob Zombie is this, keep up the great work, I loved your movie, and less is more. Meaning, less blood and violence please.",Halloween
634,dmcbee1,Rob Zombie should stick to making music horrible music.,2,5 February 2012,When I heard there was going to be a remake of the original Halloween I winced. Halloween is a special film that accomplished a lot for a horror film by being suspenseful and well paced.......This film is it's exact opposite.The biggest problem with this film is that Rob Zombie's directing has the subtlety of a stick of dynamite. Michael Myers doesn't creep in the shadows; he moves chopping people up like a B movie horror villain. It's boring and predictable.The next biggest problem is that this film has no real plot. It follows the pattern A. Lumis warns Michael is dangerous. B. No one believes him. C. Someone has sex. D. Michael kills the people having sex. E. Repeat.I lost track of the number of sex scenes in this film. The only one that stuck out was the pointless and tasteless rape scene. Watch the original and save your time and money.,Halloween
635,ali-x,Don't Waste Your Time (Or Money),2,1 September 2007,"Halloween intrigues most of its viewers with a suspenseful trailer and the hype of being more appealing than the original masterpiece, with the use of new technological effects and advances.Movie-goers, do not be fooled. Let's go through this film in different aspects: plot, acting, soundtrack and the obstruction of morales.The beginning depicts Mike Myers' childhood as a screwed-up, broken home, contrary to the original, where his family was pleasant and it was unknown where his psychopathic mindset branched from. Oh, sob story. Ten-year-old boy gone wrong. Quite obviously. His victims were all murdered brutally, with knives, tree branches, baseball bats... you name it. The boy gets sent to an asylum, murders here and there and even manages to escape! He murders the staff of the asylum --- not to mention the fact that he's the ONLY PATIENT present. Oh-so-realistic. Also, he manages to walk to a ""Truck Wash"" and steals a truck from a grown African man trying to take a dump and jacking off to nude magazines. Woooow, so creative. Soon after, Mike Myers' returns to his sad town searching for his baby sister (since everyone else in the family is dead thanks to his deranged personality). He also has the ability to grow into a seven-foot ""boogey man"" when he refused to eat as a child AND master the art of silently breaking and entering without creaking floorboards in old houses at 250lbs. Too bad his victims didn't have that skill... Coincidentally, his murders often take place Halloween. Ooh, scary. Tormenting teenagers, scaring children into thinking the ""boogey man"" is real and killing townspeople on Halloween where other than his victims -- there is no population in this suburban town of Illinois. Pretty sad; no kids seem to be trick-or-treating. Enough spoiling, sounds terrific, doesn't it?ACTING! Yay, Zombie. Kudos for you selection of actors and actresses. Not to mention how absolutely fake your teenagers seemed to be the entire time. Of course, you probably had a tough time finding kids that were willing to fully expose themselves on widescreen... Nice job. Oh, can't forget your main character -- Mike Myers doesn't even talk! Nice breathing pattern you've got him set into for the mood. Even the mask thing you got going on; nobody can see him! He's behind his safety mask, and whatever he does while it's on, is a-o-k. Oh and really, I've never seen so many naked women in my life with my FATHER in the theater. Really unnecessary, really. That doesn't intensify your film; it totally ruins the suspense...YOUR SOUNDTRACK WAS GREAT! There was just so much breathing from Myers, congratulations. You've probably set the record for the most on-screen breaths audible in a movie! Nice thing you got going on there, playing the same songs over and over.Lastly, your obstruction of morales. Violence seemed to be very abundant. Oh, let's not forget the sex every ten minutes and constant vulgarity. Really, really realistic. What was the message here? Oh, yeah. Make sure your kids don't kill dead animals for a hobby, they'll turn into psychopathic murderers. Got it! Honestly, the web site is much scarier than the film. Okay, okay. No lying -- there were moments where you caught your audience off guard. Like, three or four? Okay, folks. Enough of this. Don't waste your time or money. Wait for the DVD; it makes a great comedy. The most memorable quote? ""Naughty, naughty girl.""",Halloween
636,JediColt,There was an easier way to do this....,1,18 September 2007,"Why didn't Rob Zombie just take the existing footage from the first film and dub all of Donald Pleasence's use of the words ""pure evil"" with ""white trash"" then get George Lucas to digitally replace Michael Myers with Larry the Cable Guy. Man I better not even joke about that, the Wayans brothers are probably on the phone with Larry the Cable Guy's agent right now to secure him for ""Scary Movie 5"".This is a movie about white trash, for white trash, complete with added gore and topless women. Not even Joe Bob Briggs commentary could save this from being the bore-fest that it was. Seriously, the only reason to explain a killers motivations is if those reasons are original or shocking. I admit to being intrigued when I learned Freddy's genesis was in the brutal gang-rape of a nun, and its thought-provoking to realize Leatherface doesn't have a malicious bone in his body, he was raised to believe humans are slaughtered for food, and doesn't have the mental capacity or emotional depth to find anything wrong with that. Those are interesting motivations to explore, but finding out Michael had a stripper mom and an alcoholic step-dad is hardly ground breaking material. Get ready guys, the long awaited motivations of the most evil killer in cinema history is that.......he had the same upbringing as Kenny from South Park.",Halloween
637,jackalman22,An atmospheric re-telling that drips with Rob Zombie's style,7,2 September 2007,"As with any remake, I approached this film with caution. Too often are remakes handled improperly, flawed wholly by the filmmakers' misinterpretations of what made the originals so effective. Every so often, whether in the horror genre or some other film category, a remake comes along that, for the most part, succeeds in doing its original inspiration justice.Rob Zombie's Halloween is indeed one of those remakes.More of a re-imagining than a strict remake (as a remake usually implies a carbon-copy of sorts), Halloween '07 brings us deeper inside the mind of Michael Myers, effectively bringing in elements of both tragedy and misfortune with regard to the legendary killer's motivation for killing. He starts out as highly disturbed youth, troubled by a slightly dysfunctional family and the verbal and physical abuse at school. The way young Michael reacts to these external factors gives us insight into how unhinged his mind really is, and despite the best efforts of those who care for him, his plunge into madness is almost inevitable. Keeping in tandem with Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects,"" one cannot help feel a trace of sorrow for Myers' downward spiral, regardless of how he handles his circumstances.The chain of events (with the exception of the third act) in this remake remain, for the most part, unchanged with regard to the original film's plot. Michael is transferred to the mental asylum and placed under the evaluation of Dr. Loomis. Despite the seemingly earnest efforts of Loomis to help Michael, we further see that Michael's situation is indeed a hopeless one as he delves further and further into darkness. His general apathy for the suffering of others is shown particularly well since, as both a child and an overwhelming adult, he continues to kill without consequence. Another element that was handled quite well was the concept of Michael's mask. The reasons why he makes and wears his masks are fully explored this time around, cluing the viewers in to why he behaves the way he does.Indeed, I thoroughly enjoyed Rob Zombie's take on John Carpenter's classic. The origins of Michael Myers were portrayed as a fairly believable, moody, and altogether tragic turn of events. Much like real life serial killers, the tell-tale signs portrayed by little Michael before his life as a killer begins are very realistic and accurate. Once he begins his downward spiral, you actually feel everyone's pain. One murder in particular that occurs when he is an adult is quite painful to watch, mainly because the person he kills is the last person you'd expect him to lay a hand on. Alas, the same scene effectively shows Michael's complete disregard for human life as his fall into madness comes full swing.The movie was far from perfect, however. Despite the strong and unique direction, I felt as though certain characters were underdeveloped. Sheriff Bracket was sorely underused, in my opinion, as were the Strodes. Once the film was over, I immediately found myself thinking that the interaction between Laurie Strode and her parents could've been fleshed out more. Between the parents in particular, some hints for the audience regarding Laurie's past would've fit into the film nicely. Furthermore, despite the brief length of her role, I wanted to see more of Deborah Myers' (played sufficiently by Sheri Moon Zombie) mental anguish upon her reaction to her family's turmoil.On the subject of characters, I just want to point out that Laurie Strode was portrayed and acted fairly well by Scout Taylor-Compton, as evidenced by plenty of the on-screen chemistry between her, her friends, and the youngsters she's watching over. Not to mention, her screaming abilities follow the footsteps of Jamie Lee Curtis quite well. Daeg Faerch, in a very creepy role, powerfully portrays a young Michael Myers. Malcolm McDowell, despite his character being somewhat underdeveloped, gives a fairly warm and well-acted performance as Dr. Loomis, and Brad Dourif was a welcome surprise as Sheriff Brackett.A worthy mention goes to Tyler Mane as the adult version of the new Michael Myers. While not much can be said about a silent role, Mane's on-screen presence is nothing short of daunting, and the fear he induces in both his victims (not to mention the audience) is nothing short of staggeringly menacing. The final confrontation in the third act is particularly well-shot, and the silence of his character is almost deafening as he attempts to reach out to one person in particular. Indeed, most roles, even the short-lived ones, were portrayed with an apt mixture of humor, fear, and charisma. A particular favorite of mine was William Forsythe's role as the estranged boyfriend of Deborah Myers.Aside from the technicalities, the movie dripped with atmosphere, personality, style, and overall believability. Rob Zombie's take on Halloween may have been different, but it is, in my opinion, both a valid and an effective one. The origin of Michael Myers' insanity was a great approach, hands down.All in all, a job well done on Zombie's part. In my opinion, the nay-sayers' arguments are not sound in the least; they simply cry foul at the very idea of a remake more than anything, and refuse to give the film a chance. Its departure from the overall mystique inherent in Carpenter's original does not hold water as far as I'm concerned. Zombie's approach makes sense, and the fact that we're inside Myers' head does not detract from his scariness. He's still incredibly imposing, and his disregard for human life is all too apparent as the film progresses. His silence speaks volumes, and the brief glimpses of his eyes are extremely haunting.Fans of the original can still prefer John Carpenter's original, but I urge all viewers to approach with an open mind. Gory, dark, stylish, and consistently entertaining, Halloween '07 drips with Rob Zombie's technique and overall quirkiness.Overall, a worthy re-telling of a classic with its fair share of twists.",Halloween
638,corkskrue,"A realistic review of Zombie's ""Halloween""",7,1 September 2007,"The bottom line: I liked it quite a bit, but it does have its flaws.Now so that you know where I'm coming from, I have enjoyed the original ""Halloween"" and most of its sequels for the last ten years or so. More recently, I have also enjoyed Rob Zombie's films, so naturally I was excited at the thought of Zombie remaking ""Halloween."" However, I really wanted to go in with an open mind and view Zombie's movie for the film it is.The first half of the movie is almost entirely different from the original - and I really loved that. Not because Carpenter's was bad at all, but I loved seeing an original, fresh take on it. I wish this had continued throughout the movie, but the second half is almost identical to the original film, just not as well paced. As if Zombie took his time doing a great job with the back story for the first half, but then had to rush through the rest of the movie. I was also sad to see Malcolm McDowell's performance was lacking in my opinion. In the first half, he does a terrific job with the new material, but in the later half he tries to be Donald Pleasence and just feels awkward in the role.And truly, that's all I can find to complain about. The rest of the movie was quite good. The violence is necessarily brutal, unrelenting, and realistic, and this gives much more impact to the death scenes (more so than a single knife stab can accomplish). There's not much suspense, but the it's truly terrifying watching Michael wound his victims and then continue to torture and toy with them before killing them, like a kid pulling the wings off of a fly.",Halloween
639,wb010b4494,origins,1,15 September 2007,"Just remember people, Darth Vader used to be one cool villain before his 'origins' were explained.So did Freddy.So did Jason.And now, Michael Myers. Thank you, fast food American sequels/remakes.To any young aspiring film fan, I can only say this . . . A few years back some people decided to remake Psycho. How many people refer to it now? Seek out the originals of every remake, never have a snack when you can have a meal. I leave it to you, however, to make up your own mind.Films are increasingly becoming more turgid thanks to visionless hacks like Eli Roth and Uwe Boll (though, kudos for the most stupid film ever, House Of The Dead).Wanna see a good re-imagining? Watch 'John Carpenter's The Thing'. I am sure Mr. Zombie would agree.This new 'Halloween' certainly has it's moments but like a lot of James Cameron films, the script sure could have used a polish. Sorry Rob, I know that nobody's perfect, I am just passing a personal comment. At least you've got three features under your belt in a relatively short time. Can't say I have, so who am I to pass judgement? Only a cinema fan.Did love Malcolm McDowell's performance in the film though. Top notch.",Halloween
640,curlies7,No suspense - gore can be such a bore!,1,3 March 2009,"Like so many of these graphic 'horror' movies, nothing is left to the imagination. Zombie is graphic and uses some clever devices, however, sometimes less is more: the audience should be permitted to visualise what is happening / what has happened without it being shown. Are modern audiences curious or need to be patronised by the director? Can't the audience visualise what is happening off camera without any graphic depiction or unnecessary sounds / musical score leading them to realise what is to follow? Maybe having nothing left to the imagination isn't the best of approaches to horror films when, realistically, the basis of being scared / shocked / horrified is found in the thrill of the unknown.Nevertheless, it seems that the modern movie audience is conditioned to receive 'shocks' and thrills in this way. I for one am not shocked by the graphic, but rather by what can be envisioned off-screen, for example, by imagining what might be happening behind the door of the scene of horror, where as Rob Zombie is the type of director who wants to open the door and reveal the gore concealed behind it. Thus I know what to expect from this calibre of modern horror director. Now, for what I could have done without:1. The ridiculous coverage of the initial murders by the media. The shot leaving Michael Myers on the patio when he is found by his mother would have been a good end to the first, lengthy background to Myers's youth and reason for murdering. Zombie did a good take on why Myers grew up to kill. However, the news coverage was not necessary; it only served to further 'enlighten' the audience as to the true horror of Michael's initial killings. The same murders the audience had just witnessed. Perhaps Zombie thinks that such reinforcement adds to the effect of horror; unfortunately, this detracts from it. (And when has an autopsy been carried out so quickly, with the details immediately released to the media teams outside whilst corpses are brought out to awaiting ambulances during live news broadcasts?)2. A further depiction of Michael's descent into a catatonic murderer. The idea of him being helped by the psychiatrist (portrayed by Malcolm McDowell, who uncannily bore a resemblance to Michael's stepfather) was good, but it seemed that Michael was more observed than helped. Such neglect only helped him become further alienated and eventually attack a nurse. Was such an attack due to the level of security granted him? It seems his supervision was meant to be high security but appears to be less severe. Wouldn't EST have been used to condition such deviants in the 1970s?3. 15 years later: I've finally given up with Rob Zombie on seeing Michael Myers as now a member of Slipknot and his threat to society finally realised with the tough level of security that now surrounds him. Malcolm McDowell is an aged Sting lookalike... and... Oh, I like the way in which Michael murders the guy in the toilet in order to obtain his overalls as a disguise (or as an homage to Carpenter's Myers). Seems that Zombie didn't want Mr Myers walking about looking suspicious, which would've worked if only he could've got him to remove that damned mask!Well, I could go on all night, which is more than this film did with me as an audience member! If suspense is your prerequisite to horror, then avoid this and check Carpenter!",Halloween
641,rj_details,A raw gore feast that also makes you think,8,10 October 2007,"A lot of people seem quite disappointed with this movie and they are wrong to be. It takes a classic film and adds much much into its mixture plus allows you to take a look behind the mask and into the monster that is Micheal myers.At times the movie's atmosphere had my nerves twitching and this is very rare for me. I think it is because things were very loud, bold with the added cold blooded theatrics to rattle the chains of mental anguish and raw horror. The filming was clever because at one point you get a visual shock from a swift violent act and the camera is like a simulator allowing you to move through things that seems to experiment with new perspectives. Plus the way in which violence is portrayed rings loud and clear with the sound effects and visually stunning aggressive scenes.Sexuality is also bold and daring that easily tells us how much further society is willing to combine horror and sexual violence seamlessly together. Some have shown disgust in the language used at the beginning of the film but that in itself tells us so much of how crude and sickening mans imagination can think up new levels of insane curiosity from mans dysfunctions and derangement's. From a philosophical view point it tells us just how much our society as lost its innocence to materials of taste and decency which is truly the real horror.Also shown is the impact that occurs from the less fortunate and depraved aspects of the living standards of today's western society which as been evident in creating most of our monstrous psychopaths. In fact at times we come across widely educated element's of what creates a psychopath yet tells us that we could be very wrong mind you as the film is fictional I will not stress this to much. On that point I got the feeling though that the film connects with the Hannibal film legacy.Things also seem to allow us to connect Micheal myers with man and adds a reality to the film which is what today's people like to watch. What will frighten us is that the soul can not be analysed so makes a great mystery and because of this makes the Myers character appears as if he was not meant for this world or maybe reincarnated from a previously tormented evil entity.It as a go at showing us how a person may possibly possess a kind of anger that is so profound that it wills a kind of indestructible being that feeds the ego of the inhibited to act out against the weakness's of mankind. At times things also venture into the realms of the animal kingdom in which humans are not much more and I feel this piece of work will awaken a kind of dark spark in anyone who feels and finds anything stimulating about the murders depicted.The acting is more visual most of time given to the turbulence of shock and reaction. Malcolm McDowell don't really move you into belief but given the script he ain't that bad. Overall at its best its a masterpiece of cultural horror adding some nice special effect to enhance the art, On the downside it ain't the classic it was based on which will cause people to pick at its lack of creepiness which the classic was full of.RATINGS Mainstream 7/10 will get what it wants from the general public that is a good turnout and a decent amount of cash.Cult 7/10 disappointing to fans of the original or perhaps not.Cinematography 7.5/10 stimulation style filming.Watch again 6/10 great for Halloween. Special effects 8/10 are very authentic, character seems like the original with added detail. Overall 7.5/10 a raw gore feast of reality vs fiction. I think this film must be viewed at the cinema or at home with large screen and loud setup. Also a great joke to play on anyone with a nervous disposition to horror films but not really.",Halloween
642,jdw5656,"I know, I know, but it wasn't too bad!!!",6,6 January 2008,"I have let this movie sink in for a few weeks now- the director's cut that is, because the only other version I'd seen was the work print version that my buddy had scored/stolen(it was floating around this wonderful internet thingy). Now I was against this remake initially because the original Carpenter masterpiece is a movie I hold dear to my heart, and I mean that with all honesty... I am more than a fan we'll say! The work print was junk as most work print cinema is when leaked online- Don't get me started on the editing in that mess but hey, that is why it's called a WORK PRINT so I cut Zombie some slack right there- plus I thought Devil's Rejects was a great throwback to 70's schlock/exploitation so I knew our little Robbie was growing as a film-maker. Anyway, to stay spoiler free and still give you gentle yet critical folks on IMDb my final opinion I will say that the movie ain't so flippin' bad!?!?!?! Yes, I said it-- It was pretty good. I'll stand by my 6 rating I had given it and maybe change it to a 7 with future viewings.Remember I had seen the Director's Cut which was obviously leaps & bounds or was it bound & gagged... we are talking about a Rob Zombie movie here- Anyway it was leaps and bounds better than the leaked version and from what I hear the theatrical one as well, which I cannot base any of this opinion on since the stink of a remake was still lingering while I was deciding to view Halloween in Zombie's happy lil' disaffected universe. The dialogue was a little much. I knew that when I asked my niece which had seen the remake in theaters and said that teenage girls do not use lingo like that, which I thought was legit since she was around the same age as the gals in the film. Then I remember her calling her boyfriend an ""f'ing ball-bag"" on her cell and that pretty much canceled her not so valid opinion of teenage language in a Rob Zombie tear-jerker. Oh, note to Katherine- You're mom called and would like you to stop flipping off the Spanish teacher, even if it's in Spanish. Anyhoo, the whole movie was a fun little surprise and I've watched it a few times now, and though some parts namely some of the lines and a few parts ripped from the original were a little tired- I thought that the whole take on Loomis(played well by Malcom, but long live Donald) was fun and his interaction with precious little Mikey(Doug Fresh is what I'll call him cause I can't pronounce that little Hitler youth name of his) in the sanitarium was well handled.Overall the movie was fun(editing and pacing fixed) and I do think Robert is a genre director to watch but I hope he goes back to his own films. I'd like to see what he has up his sleeve. Maybe a buddy comedy with Sid Haig and Hillary Clinton who plays Sid's brother of course. Wouldn't that be FUN? I know I didn't say much about the film mainly to ignore spoilers and comparisons to the original but check it out, and try, and I know it's hard but try to forget about Carpenter's for 2 hours and you might enjoy this version too, maybe not as a companion piece to the classic but as its own! And please no more crying about the white trash Meyer family at the beginning. I live in a trailer park in central Illinois and trust me it was pretty damn close to the things I have seen from neighbors. Instead of a car on the front lawn it's a home where I'm from... Give this intense chiller a shot if ya got the time. Oh yeah, and it is nice to see Danielle Harris still working and Carpenter Lives!!!!!!!",Halloween
643,brandonhelee,Half Brilliant Psychology Drama/Half a Terrible Re-Tread of a Horror Classic,5,29 July 2015,I remember being a 12 year old kid back in 2007 just getting into the Halloween franchise and seeing the trailer to this in front of Grindhose got me excited for it.With most remake's it is required to not compare them to the original and enjoy them for their own merits and that's the best mind set to be in while watching this film.I view the film as two separate films:The first half is dare I say a brilliant psychology drama about a boy who gets bullied has an abusive step-father then snaps and kills all of his attackers and now the real world now has to deal with those issues.Despite some really awful dialogue and poorly written characters this first half of the film is actually pretty brilliant study in the mind of Myers and is the real charm of this films addition to the Halloween legacy.The second half is a terribly done almost shot for shot remake of the original but without any of the class and style just a real disgrace of the franchise I know I said earlier that the films most be taken on their own but that's a major distraction a real poor filmmaking to not get you in this film but merely accidental getting you to remember the vastly superior original.I still love the flick but only for it's first half honestly you could just take out all that remake BS of the original and just watch the prequel then watch the sequel afterwords for a much better movie experience I still think RZH2 is not all that good but it's a Michael Myers and Halloween movie and has it's charm so I still love it just not as much as the others.,Halloween
644,duowcewy,"Very good - not Carpenter, but very good!",8,25 May 2008,"Rob Zombie continues to impress me with his more recent movies. I dreaded what could have been a more surgical or in-your-face approach to the juggernaut-style horror tale...and was truly pleased with the result. Is it all logical? Fairy tales aren't, and this version is straight out of the Brothers Grimm grimmer stories. I'll add that the picture/action compositions with the subtle use of focus, framing, color were top shelf. As usual, Zombie has some twisted jokes in there - but many are subtle interactions of soundtrack/action, etc. If you want to see something more than an endless chase, like the interplay of psychological and physical horror, watch this.",Halloween
645,sadakohere,Definitely one for teenagers or die-hard fans,4,21 October 2007,"The main reason I wanted to see this film was because I'm a fan of Malcolm McDowell - a brilliant actor specialising in cheeky/mischievous/cocky characters from the late 60s - mid 80s. I was pleased to see him in something again at last! McDowell was good playing a different kind of role than his usual, but I am slightly bias. The film itself was pretty straightforward plot-wise, easy enough to understand. Myers as a child was performed well, pretty convincing. That part of the film was of main interest to me. The child was indeed a psychopath and living in a house like that must have been what pushed him over the edge. The rest of the film was your usual slasher type and the murder scenes were bog standard knifings, etc. Quite boring after the first couple. After watching ""Halloween"" I suddenly wondered what happened to Brad Dourif's character, the Sheriff? Unless I missed it during a drink of my Pepsi Max! Also the film took quite a while to come to it's ending. The persual of Myers' sister went on too long and I was becoming bored. If you want real excitement & scene variety, I recommend you watch the ""Saw"" saga!",Halloween
646,Disc-Flipper,A Zombie-Flavored Halloween treat which will be a fun re-watch in the years ahead.,7,1 September 2007,"I enjoyed the Halloween remake by Rob Zombie and consider it a new horror classic. It was a lot of fun for the evening. It doesn't replace the original; I see it as another director's interpretation of the story.Complaint #1 - The opening title sequence of this Halloween remake was dull. I wanted a flickering pumpkin with the ominous synthesized theme! I wanted to get in the mood sooner! I liked that they used some of the same music from the original Halloween movie in various scenes, which was very cool. There was also some nice 70's and 80's tunes. I think they played ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" and ""Mr. Sandman"" at least two times each.There were a whole bunch of tributes to the original Halloween scenes, some with different surprising resolutions. Rob Zombie took some classic scenes which we all knew, and turned them upside down and sideways.A lot of the locations from the original movie were changed and re-arranged. I guess that made it fresher. I did not like the swimming pool scene, which didn't fit the Halloween feeling. But many of the other scenes had blowing leaves, pumpkins and other Halloween decorations on a dark night. Yes, there was atmosphere! There was much back-story to Michael Myers' childhood. He was one messed up little kid, played awesomely by Daeg Faerch. He had cool long hair and wore a lot of masks. I'm surprised the mental hospital allowed him to decorate his room with dozens of masks. Tyler Mane played the freakish long-haired adult Michael with incredible monster strength and height. I really liked his costume; best Halloween mask yet! Malcolm McDowell played a weak and scrawny Dr. Loomis character. He seemed like an old hippie with a big gun in the role. Not as fun as Donald Pleasance, the original Loomis actor. McDowell didn't seem to have much of the raving passion for tracking down Michael, so his characterization fell flat.The lead girl, Laurie Strode was played confusingly by a relatively newcomer girl Scout Taylor-Compton, who seemed a bit aloof and hysterical, and not the lovable virginal ideal babysitter which Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed in the original. I liked seeing Danielle Harris (Jamie from Halloween 4 & 5) appear to play the role of Annie; she showed a lot of herself. The horny teens in this movie were very dumb and annoying; their demises looked quite painful, but I didn't miss them much. At least they looked like the real age of high school teens, unlike the adult stars pretending to be teens in the 1978 original. The cute little babysat kids playing Tommy and Lindsey were great fun, and freaked-out quite well when ""The Boogeyman"" appeared on the scene.Famous horror and sci-fi actor Brad Dourif played Sheriff Brackett, and strangely seemed to disappear from the story altogether. He didn't bring any credibility to the role. Ken Foree's character was cheesy and did not fit well in the movie, with his overacting and dumb washroom stall scene where Michael acquired his coveralls. Sid Haig appeared as the musty-old cemetery keeper with goofy delivery of dialogue. William Forsythe and Sheri Moon made appearances as Michael Myer's crappy parents. Their dialogue was pretty badly written; and it was delivered very cartoonish and unnatural. Sheri only brought some believability to the role whenever she comforted young Michael. My friend said it was like a ""Devil's Reject Reunion"", and I agree. There were tons of other cameos as well, like Dee Wallace, Mickey Dolenz, Udo Keir, Danny Trejo and Clint Howard; I'm sure there were even more. I recognized a lot of faces, but couldn't put names on all of them.There were plenty of plot holes, but that made it more fun. I'm not sure how Michael was able to track down Laurie Strode from one location to another; or even how he found his baby sister so easily. Whoever did continuity on this film did a bad job, as things that were broken or bleeding in one shot were suddenly okay in the next, and some characters appeared or disappeared from the story without explanation.However the real strength of the movie was the incredibly savage kill scenes. The deaths looked quite brutal and painful. There was lots of blood spilled and splashed at each murder scene. The various blades and bludgeons looked and sounded quite painful. The variety of deaths was quite cool. Many people died in gruesome ways.Despite the silliness and the plot holes, it was still a very entertaining movie. I see it as a real treat which will be a fun re-watch in the years ahead. Better than some of the Halloween sequels.",Halloween
647,brandnewthursday3,i don't care if im not,2,1 September 2007,"...expected to be seeing an exact remake, but there were so many lame plot holes. it was obviously the 70s in the beginning(sister's big headphones playing don't fear the reaper, which is a song from...THE 70s; the mother's car, michael's kiss t shirt, etc;) and then it's 17 years later and it looks to me like the movie was taking place in the 21st century(the cars, the dress, etc;) that aside, this was a snuff film. where the original made you wonder why michael was such a psychopath, this movie forces it on you, by showing michael's menacing past and disturbing present states. further, zombie's direction made me dizzy. too many closeups of insignifigant things. not enough character development. the only good actor in this movie was the babysitter(sorry malcom macdowell, you disappointed me) all in all, this movie is a gorefest with no heart.",Halloween
648,RZDickRider_2,"Seriously, the best Halloween of the last 20 years.",10,5 February 2009,"Okay, one thing you must keep in mind with this Halloween is that it is not ""John Carpenter's Halloween"" it is ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"". Yes those two right there are completely different types of directors. Carpenter uses long straight narrow shots, while Zombie likes to move the camera and such ETC. I could go on for hours about how they are different but I am not going to.Okay, going into this Halloween remake I honestly did not expect it to be good. I thought it would be a stinker like the last couple of sequels (excluding H20). So I sat in the theater and approximately 30 or so minutes in I knew this movie was going to be good. We start out with young Micheal Myers which is a very fresh perspective on the series that has been sucked dry. Myers is tormented, has a horrible step dad, great mom, slut of a sister, so on. This is why I like the first part the most now: The kid that plays Myers (Daeg Fearch) is an incredible little actor, and is scary as hell! On another note Sherri Moon Zombie does incredibly great in her role too. Michael kills off his family besides ""Boo"", his baby sister, and his mother.Now comes the second part, Smiths Grove. In my opinion this is least best part of the 3. I mean don't get me wrong I love this part but the other two are better, and crisper. This ,like the first part,is also an original take on the movie. In Smiths Grove, Michael doesn't speak a word. Also this is where we prominently meet Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, who was also one of the best parts of the movie. Probably the second best scene of the movie happens in this part, I mean the Debroh Myers suicide. That part had me shedding a tear of sincerity for that poor poor woman. Also Sherri acting is top notch in that scene.Long story short Michael never speaks again, Loomis gets off of the case, and Michael breaks out on October 30th to find his baby sister in Haddonfield.Now comes the remake. Okay everyone here is the part where you need to hear me out one more time: This is ROB ZOMBIE not JOHN CARPENTER... therefore it will, as it should, be different from the 1978 classic. I didn't say better I said different. This is by far the best of the three parts for me: Laurie, grown up Michael, and Laurie's foster parents. The reason I love this part so much is because I believe, as much as others don't, that Laurie(Scout Taylor- Compton) and Annie (Danielle Harris) stole the entire movie and never gave it back. My reason for this is (Danielle) was, and is, such a great actor. In that scene after she had been beaten and stabbed, I felt so much for her. I felt sympathy for her, and wanted her not to die. Now Laurie... what a fine actress that 17 YEAR OLD (yes 17 at the time) is. I felt so so so real to me, her acting seemed real, it didn't seem forced, and lastly when she cried it looked like she just broke-down and lost it, and I loved it! The best part of the movie also took place in this part. It was when Laurie was in the basement and she is escaping, that part was so scary when she was crawling through the wall and ripping the wood, and then when he rips through the wall and grabs her I thought I was going to have a heart attack. (Also I give a shout out to the pool scene,Tommy and Lindsey honestly where they midgets? Lastly when he pulls her out of the cop car). But yes like every movie there are some weak links.... and the stinkers go to: The ""F"" word was a little bit overused but it is a horror movie so I can deal with it.Overall I give it a..... 9 out of 10 because: Laurie, Loomis, Annie, Debroh, Both Micheals, The Laurie chase scenes, Annie's almost death, The awesome gore, The ending, and lastly Rob Zombie (My new favorite director/writer).Thank you!",Halloween

I also enjoyed the beginning of Rob Zombie's version of Halloween. Letting us see into Michael Meyers' life before he finally snapped. I felt this made him scarier as this could really happen and now he wasn't some kind of make believe 'boogie man'. This could be some neighbor of mine or yours!**SPOILER ALERT**The story line building up in the hospital had a realistic feel too. I thought these were very realistic situations between Dr. Loomis, Michael, and his mother. All the way up to the late night guards taking their party into Michael's cell. Why would they want to do this? I understand the party, I think it's a great idea in the movie or not. However, why would you risk going into a cell with someone Michael's size and antagonizing him? It didn't work for me.The movie then had a realistic feel again bringing me back in. This lasted almost to the credits. It would have made it too if it hadn't been for those meddling writers. I found many problems with the movie having a feel of just lasting too long. I know it's a movie and these things are what are supposed to make it suspenseful and frightening. It just didn't work for me in this movie. I feel the movie dragged on for twenty minutes or more too long.And the credits! Who played whom? If it wasn't for IMDb I would not have known who played who with the exception of actors I recognized. Michael's doctor, Malcolm McDowell for instance from ""A Clockwork Orange"" or Michael's super hot milf played by Sheri Moon Zombie from ""The Devil's Rejects"".Putting the credits aside and if you can stay focused during the long, long ending. I could recommend this movie to a friend as it did have a great beginning and solid plot. I am only giving this movie six out of ten stars because of the ending seeming to go on forever.",Halloween
651,too_one_be,Not so much a remake as a re-invent....,8,14 January 2008,"I have been somewhat of a fan of ""Halloween"" since I was a kid. I started watching horror movies at about six years old. I tell people I grew up in the house of Jason Vorhess. The remake of ""Halloween"" offers a better back story to the man behind the mask. I have always asked myself when watching the movies ""What really made him snap?"" The Rob Zombie version answers that question. The torment of having to grow up in an institution would be enough to drive anyone crazy, especially a child that doesn't understand why he is really there. Seeing the things like putting the pumpkin on the guys head after he killed him and then taking the time to push his hanging body just to watch it swing is a child like thing for a killer to do. It proves that no matter how old he got he was still kind of like that ten year old boy who still didn't know that he was really hurting anyone. I recently watched ""Halloween: resurrection"" and found myself saying ""Micheal wouldn't do that"", or ""Man, that mask looks brand new"". After seeing a little more about who Micheal Myers is, I just didn't see resurrection in the same light. I liked how Rob updated the film but still used the same music from that time and the same from the original movie. In his version also, when the girls are talking inside the school and Laurie is seeing Micheal out the window, Micheal is standing in front of the original Strode house used in the original movie. He wanted to keep the same feel from the original which I feel he did. It has got to be hard to take something everyone has seen for years, and try to make a newer version and have the same people like it.

653,SorcererLink22,"Very bad, awful, no good, very bad movie",1,9 March 2008,"Okay, all you need to know is Rob Zombie's spin on a CLASSIC horror movie. I was against this movie from the beginning just because I'm such a sucker for the classics. But I was kinda impressed with House of 1000 Corpses and my friends wanted to see it, so I was drug to the theater to see this mess and honestly I wanted my money back. Actually, someone should have paid me to see this mess. Rob Zombie tries to explain too much, changing the Myers to the ideal white trash family of mid-west American. Stripper mother, abusive stepfather, tramp sister and a baby. He played the whole abusive upbringing on Michael Myers which lead to him killing his entire family, with exception of the baby and mother. The mother offs herself and for some unknown reason Michael tries to kill his sister when she grows up. The thing that went wrong with this was it was a remake of John Carpenter's Halloween instead of being a ninth installment. This movie would've been a great sequel, I will give it the credit where it was deserved, but a REMAKE of a classic there was just no way it was a good idea. Look at the remake of Psycho, for crying out loud people, leave the classics alone!! The only reason I gave this one star is because I have to and the fact that it hold the Halloween title, which would've been the only reason I would've given it no stars because in all the movies this is the weakest one. Yes the weakest one! Halloween 3 at least was original!",Halloween
654,dotmrt,Horrible remake and wannabe-horror movie,3,21 September 2007,"In the beginning we have a lazy-ass foul mouth (step-?) father nagging on everyone in the family. William Forsythe is a fine actor, but I think he really overacts on that one. Perhaps we are supposed to be disgusted of the father, but then I don't feel that we should need to feel sympathy towards Michael. Also the breakout of the ward was stupid. Guards are caught their pants down like idiots. And the ""blaming scene"" afterward is ridiculous. There are couple of another laughable scenes, like the girl in the end trying to get through the metal wire bed (which she actually manages) instead of simply going out of the house as the bad guy is blocked anyway. The movie has some incredibly dull and horrible dialog. And even charismatic Malcolm McDowell cannot save the day. I think that horror has been done so much better in numerous other forms that this movie is simply a redundant ""money collector"". To conclude my opinion, I was surprised and disappointed that was so little Rob Zombie on the soundtrack.",Halloween
655,MJalazo,A humanistic portrayal of Myers that offers something different,7,22 September 2007,"In my view, horror fans can be classified into two types: 1) those who prefer a tremendous outpouring of blood and guts, without necessarily needing a meaningful backstory if time/circumstances do not permit worthy character development, and 2) those who desire an understanding of the origin of the anger, which ultimately gives way to the carnage that ensues. For these fans, some semblance of character development is virtually essential. I do not feel that either fan is 'better' than the other, just desiring something different.Personally, I am the second. As such, I found Rob Zombie's version of this classic a refreshing take on the original, in that Michael Myers' childhood is effectively portrayed in such a way to give meaning to the violence. Astonishingly, Zombie succeeds in eliciting a level of sympathy for Myers, even in the face of some of his most horrific acts in the movie. Credit some stellar acting, particularly by his wife and both the child and adult versions of Myers, as allowing for a deeper look into the psyche of what would otherwise be a less purposeful killing machine. The 6'8"" Tyler Mane does a remarkable job of conveying a seething anger behind his mask, particularly while institutionalized. In my opinion, Mane does arguably the most wondrous job of communicating without words, of any horror villain of any generation.The supportive acting is also, surprisingly, quite good. The exception to this is Dr. Loomis, played rather unspiritedly by Malcolm McDowell. Donald Pleasance did a much better job in the original toward conveying an academician that was both astonished and forewarning of Michael's misdeeds. McDowell's portrayal comes across as almost a satirization of the needed concern exuded by Pleasance, which minimized Michael's horrific behavior to an extent.Most surprisingly, Halloween left me thinking, something that a horror movie typically doesn't do. Zombie succeeds in causing a fair amount of concern in this post-Columbine era, on the effect of social ostracization and familial abuse/neglect on the disintegration of the childhood psyche. It also begs the question as to whether an absence of love in a person's life is the truest source of our inner demons.The biggest shortcoming is that in the face of effective character development, most of this is subsequently lost when Michael goes on his killing spree after returning to his hometown. The second half of the movie therefore feels somewhat disconnected from the first, and almost comes across as two mini-movies tied together. I'm not sure if there was a plot remedy for this that would have worked, as the backstory vanishes with the demise of most of the primary characters.Overlooking this, it's a fine effort by Zombie and worth seeing, if you leave your impressions of the 1978 original at the door. It's a different take on a classic that works on a variety of levels, if you are looking for a somewhat more sophisticated interpretation of Michael Myers than a creature with no conscience.",Halloween
656,jrobert859,Horrible Remake,1,27 October 2015,"I really wanted to like this film. The idea of remaking a classic horror film like Halloween on the surface sounds interesting. It is interesting because you see fewer films today that use suspense over gore to tell a story. This is the old Hitchcock style that was used so effectively in the original film. It is what makes it stand out from modern versions of horror and why it is my favorite horror film to date. This Rob Zombie film however does nothing that the original did. It does not even follow a logical story arc that connects you emotionally to characters. Instead we get an overblown back story for a character, Michael Meyers, that does not need one. It is always what you do not know that is scary not what you know. By the time this film gets to the ""remake"" part of the original we know way too much about the masked killer and care nothing about his victims. In the original you cared about at least one character, so when that character is in peril you are on the edge of your seat. In this film you care nothing about any of these characters, they all are white trash idiots that you want to see die. As another reviewer mentioned there is something wrong with a film when you make the killer the hero over the heroine. Unfortunately you neither want to see the killer win or his victims, which is a major failure in film story.The acting in this film is not good. The dialogue even worse which is partly why the acting comes off so horrible. I have never heard more brainless dialogue in a film then this one. It does nothing to make the story better instead it does a great job of taking me out of it. In addition there are so many disgusting scenes that include a rape scene, animal cruelty, and a kid killing another kid. All of these make watching this film painful at best and almost impossible to get through. After the horribly long back story you get to the remake attempt. This is when I started to pay more attention but unfortunately there is not enough time to make any of it meaningful. Because there is no time we get the cliff notes version of Haddonfield and the original films death scenes. This does not allow enough time to connect to any of the characters that become his victims or build any suspense and fear. What little we get is more annoying dialogue that causes us to despise these characters. Even if there was more time we would still hate them anyway. It is just an example of bad cinema and it does not work. I am not sure who would find this film appealing. I am not sure I would want to associate with those who do. Maybe someday this film will get a decent re-makeup with a better filmmaker then Zombie. Better yet maybe we should just let the original stand on its own as the classic that it is. My advise to you, avoid this movie and keep 2 hours of your life for something better.",Halloween
657,ngoldmann,OK for entertainment but boring and predictable as horror movie.,3,9 August 2008,"The movie started quite interesting to me but as the killing and with that the main story begins, it gets pretty boring. Lots of special effects and realistic looking deaths but everything predictable and nothing new and frightening or thrilling. There wasn't one shocking scene or a scene where you are really into the happening of the movie, it was just plain killing. If you're up for entertaining or just gore and deaths, this is OK but if you want real horror, this isn't the right movie. So all in all I'd say this movie is probably good for most parts of the youth because it is kind of entertaining and nice to watch but only if you don't expect a ""good"" movie or want something that is really scary.",Halloween
658,servomst3k,Leaves a bad aftertaste...,5,20 September 2007,"There's not much of a point in comparing this film with the 1978 original, so I'll try to keep comments about the contrasts between the two to a minimum.What we have here is basically a documentation of the life and times of a kid gone horribly bad. Whether its some unknown inner force, terrible outer influences, or something else entirely that eventually turns little Michael Myers into a deranged maniacal hulking brute, the film does a good job of making the progression at least convincing. The development of Michael Myers is so well traced throughout the beginning and midpoint of the film, that the last third of the film almost seems tacked on. The struggle between the film's antagonist and protagonists is drawn out, much like previous reviewers noted, and seems dreadfully out of place. The imposing physical presence of Myers which dominated much of the film seems rendered obsolete by the confrontation during the supposed climax. Judge for yourself, but you'll probably agree with this analysis.Rob Zombie obviously appreciates a good amount of gore in his films, which I have absolutely no problem with, and neither would any seasoned horror fan, but his utilization of on-screen violence is a bit unnecessary in some instances. At this point, a comparison with Carpenter's original is required. The terror of Michael Myers, in 1978, was established by the potential of his madness and what he could unleash. In 2007, Zombie blows his proverbial load by depicting far too much violence in far too much detail for the thrills to be effective in any real manner. Even menial comparisons to other ""short on gore high on terror"" genre staples from the late 70s and early 80s would confirm Zombie's reckless tendencies.The production values are pretty above average for a strictly over-the-top slasher flick, and the acting by Malcolm McDowell in particular makes the film at least recommended for a slow Friday night viewing. While not entirely hype with no payoff, it comes a bit too close for my liking. Your best bet is to track down a really frightening Italian or British horror classic for this year's Halloween festivities instead.",Halloween
659,Mr-Awesome,Piece of **** sums it up nicely.,1,17 December 2008,"I'm amazed that anybody would fine this movie brilliant or good, when it's quite the opposite. The suppose point of this remake was to humanize Michael Myers which is fine I suppose since it is a remake but it's not even done well. We don't see any transition from a normal boy to a monster what the original did in 2 minutes the remake took forty minutes. Right when the movie starts the kid is already demented. Are we offered a reason why he becomes that way? His red neck step dads verbally abuses him ooh that's a perfectly good reason or not. His mom's a stripper! Oh and she also cares deeply about him and defends him. But his older sister makes fun of him! Although that's nothing to whine about. He's also bullied by like one kid. In the movies if your not being bullied by a gang of bullies you shouldn't even care. Don't let fans of this movie fool you it doesn't humanize Michael Myers in any shape or form. It just stretched out the origin of the original and gave the kid a trailer trash life style, a love for rock music (like Zombie) and long hair.

It's no longer scary the instant you explain them, I mean I've heard a rumor that in the new prequel to Friday The 13th they explain Jason's teleporting powers with 'tunnels' under the camp site? The first Halloween did a very good job by not explaining to us why this ten year old in a clown suit suddenly killed his older sister. But no, Rob just have to screw that over and explain Mike's childhood to us. Why? Because he felt he had to explain it apparently. Hell, he even changes Mike from an innocent 10 year old rocker with no acting talent.Oh and his Mom's a strip dancer and his father's a drunk...What? Seriously? Now that wasn't bad enough but the worst part is that none of the characters are likable. Hell, they're all unbearable and you wanted them to get killed off which isn't good since that adds no surprises to the audience, especially since you know who's going to ****ing die since this is a remake of an old movie.All the character swear like sailors, every female character is a bitch and they never stop swearing.

He killed all these people and left Annie alive, that was kind of odd, even the background of the movie having Michael Myers parents be like white trash was just stupid, i think a lot of people would end up being killers. Michael Myers was pretty much supposed to be just pure evil without there ever really being a reason, thats what pretty much scared me about the originals. I never really review movies at all because i am pretty easy to please but this was such a disaster i had to share my opinion:)",Halloween

There is no suspense, no real plot, the film itself just isn't clever or original even to the most imaginative person in any way possible.

663,geraldblake12,"Ignore the flamers, RZ's remake is first rate",8,30 October 2009,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is perhaps the most misunderstood of horror remakes/ re-imaginings/ recyclings because Hollywood can't come up with any new ideas/ whatever. Similar to his other works, he creates a sympathetic portrait of a despicable character, while answering some long asked questions. For example, the moment when Danny Treijo advises young Michael to ""live inside your head"", finally offers a tangible reason why the hulking killer archetype is silent and seemingly in his own world. Further, by reconceptualizing the shape as a 6-10 hulk, we as the audience can now accept his invincibility. Lastly, giving Michael a different motivation than the other films in the franchise makes him simultaneously sympathetic and more threatening. And if you pay close attention to the third act plot you'll notice that Michael is - essentially - restaging the events of his formative trauma, from the murder of the promiscuous teen in his sister's old bedroom, right down to watching the same movie he saw on the night of the original halloween murders. RZ's Halloween is quirky and deceptively smart for a slasher film.",Halloween
664,mediamafia,The BoogeyMan Is Back!,8,1 September 2007,"The main issue is that in the Original, Michael's Mother and Father did not appear trashy as they are made out to be in this version. In fact after Michael's first murder when the parents arrive home, his mother and father were dressed in very conservative 70's garb. And the father well dressed and the mother hardly a stripper as there would be no indication from looking at her that she had a single clue on how to climb a pole with her thighs... But then again she had 2 kids so she must have had some pole experience He He! This is a tribute to a favorite to give it a new breath of life for a new generation. Kind of like when you watch films like the creature from the black lagoon or the original war of the worlds, it's out of pace with things as they are now so you tend to laugh more than get scared.

665,ericsinclair3,Completely missed the mark,1,16 October 2013,"After watching this remake of the original 1978 horror classic it would appear that Rob Zombie never understood certain concepts about the original. In the 1978 version Micheal Myers is a normal six year old boy from an average Midwestern middle class family. The fact that the murderer is such a young and innocent child with a normal family and background adds to the horror factor. The fact that there is no reason for his actions makes him scarier. A seemingly innocent 6 year old boy who murders his sister in cold blood is scary because it can't be explained. He is simply evil.In Rob Zombies version we start off on a very different note. The whole focus of the story now shifts from Lori Strode to the childhood of Micheal Myers. (In the 1978 version there is only about 4 minutes of childhood footage.) Zombie uses this time to establish that Micheal Myers childhood was abusive and that is the reason why he becomes a killer. While this concept actually makes a lot of sense it doesn't fit in with the them and creepy lure of the original franchise which states that Micheal Myers is just evil and has no reason for his killings.I was disappointed in the change in dynamic however I felt that the movie could at least be decent depending on how they did the adult portion of the movie.So we get to Doctor Lumis. A very integral part of the original movie who brings passion and excitement to his quest to redetatin Micheal. This Dr. Lumis is as exciting as a wet blanket.He is completely flat and any passion he does show is completely overacted and unbelievable.Coming to the last part suspense or in this movie the lack there of. The original Halloween was not very gory (at least by today's standards). Instead John Carpenter used the music, camera angles, points of view and various other tricks to build up tension and scare the viewer with the knowledge that the killer was waiting just around the corner. The scare factor in the original comes from anticipating that a kill is going to happen not the kill itself. The remake completely misses this. Rob Zombie has ZERO ability to create suspense. Instead the monster just pops out and random and hacks people to death. It's really more shocking than scary and has minimal entertainment value. It has none of the suspense that one would expect from a movie in the Halloween franchise.Simply put the film sucked and bared almost Zero resemblance to the original except for stealing the killer. I saw the 1978 version on TV as a 12 year old boy and have loved it ever since. I am upset that future generations will see the remake and not know the brilliance of the original.",Halloween
666,Spencer-Pellegrino,A Decent Remake,6,8 August 2010,"I'll admit when I first saw Rob Zombie's Halloween I was very disappointed. I complained about how it was nothing like the original and how everything was completely changed. However, two months after I watched it I realized that I was treating it like it was the worst horror movie ever made, which I then realized was not true at all so I decided to give Rob Zombie's Halloween a second chance.I do not believe that this remake is better or is as good as the original Halloween, there were things I liked and disliked about this remake. At first, I complained how it was nothing like the original but I realize that they changed some things and gave more detail to things that weren't shown in the original Halloween. For instance I liked how it showed more detail with Michael Myers in the sanitarium with Dr. Loomis and gave more detail to what went on at home. I also thought that the mask they used for Michael Myers was very creative and I enjoyed Annie Brackett being played by Danielle Harris. The things I disliked about this remake were that Laurie Strode in the original Halloween played by Jaimie Lee Curtis, was a very mellow, nerdy, bookworm, kind of girl. In Rob Zombie's Halloween she isn't portrayed like that at all. I also didn't like how they portrayed Michael Myers father as an abusive person.Overall I would give this remake a 6 out of 10 in my opinion it is by far not the best horror movie ever made and certainly not better then the original but it had some good things in it that I liked and it was a creative piece of work by Rob Zombie. This movie is fun and creative and I would recommend to people who haven't seen it to get some popcorn and watch it.",Halloween
667,TheRothOfKhan,Not as bad as people are making out,8,29 March 2013,"What do you get when you ask Rob Zombie to remake a horror classic? You get a hybrid of the original source material and The Devil's Rejects. But is that really a bad thing? Zombie's take on Michael Myers is ultra- violent, gory, corny and bordering on the obscene. For the first time in the Halloween saga, we are given a detailed back story, chronicling Michael's evolution from a disturbed little boy to a full-blown unstoppable killing machine. Exposed to the dysfunctional antics of the Myers family; an abusive, perverted and alcoholic stepfather, a well- meaning stripper for a mother, a promiscuous older sister and an innocent baby girl who would later grow into the series' main protagonist, we watch and wait for the ""little push"" that Heath Ledger's Joker squawked about in The Dark Knight. That push comes when short, stunted, and slightly feminine-looking Michael is bullied for the last time. No longer content with maiming and killing the neighborhood cats (which his foul-mouthed stepfather labels him a ""faggot"" for,) he takes his frustrations out on the school bully by bludgeoning him to death with a piece of wood in perhaps the most disturbing scene of the film. Whilst this murder goes temporarily unsolved, young Michael then turns on his family, leaving only mum and baby Myers alive. From this point on, the plot follows roughly that of the original. McDowell's interpretation of Dr Sam Loomis is unique, and a world away from the great Donald Pleasance's reluctant hero. Only the revolver and the dirty mac are kept intact. Adult Michael, in true Rob Zombie style, is terrifying. Standing at well over six feet tall and heavily built, he is an imposing figure made all the more menacing once he acquires his iconic Shatner mask. Previous Halloween entries have been criticized by fans for getting the mask ""wrong,"" but quite remarkably Zombie manages to outdo the original by making the weather-beaten mask somewhat of a relic of Michael's dark past. Michael's kills are brutal, even though Zombie lifts each one from the original; they still look fresh and feel very unexpected even though you know what's coming. The ""ghost in the sheet"" scene is particularly barbaric, with nothing left to the imagination with the full frontal nudity of Myers' unfortunate victim. For the finale, we are subject to a claustrophobic ordeal through the rotting wooden halls of the old Myers house, with Michael pursuing Laurie in full force, quite literally letting nothing get in his way. By the film's end, I was left feeling breathless, sick and awe-inspired at the same time. Whatever people say about this interpretation of the classic story, what makes this entry good is the fact that it is so different whilst being so familiar at the same time. This is what the original should have been like. The only thing I struggled with was Michael's back story. Zombie clearly tried very hard to justify the motives of The Shape, but I was left thinking that this was two films tacked loosely together.",Halloween
668,bigtime7,Funniest movie of the year.,1,2 September 2007,"This was the funniest movie I have seen all year. Michael Myers had me laughing so hard I cried. And the dialogue was just just hysterical. Oh wait a minute. Was this movie not supposed to be fuuny? I thought it was a comical remake of a Classic Hooror movie. It wasn't? Seriuosly though. This is one of the worst movies I think I have ever seen. And definitely the worst remake that has ever been given a wide release. That's right, I said ""REMAKE"". And everyone is full of crap, if they try to say that this movie wasn't a remake, but a ""revisioning"" or a movie ""based on"" another story.Rob Zombie shouldn't be allowed to make another movie. Especially a remake. Donald Pleasance is spinning in his grave right now.Nothing but SPOILERS ahead.Serioously, Laurie Strode doesn't appear until half-way through the movie. And Laurie and her friends are a bunch of stupid, annoying, high school girls, that i didn't care about, and they deserved to die. It's a shame Daniel Harrison can't find better work.The killings were random. They didn't make sense. You couldn't tell how most people died and you couldn't really tell what happened at the end with Laurie and Michael. This is all thanks to Zombies, choppy & sloppy MTV-Style of editing.Oh and the fact that Micael Myers can just walk through doors and walls was so stupid. I don't know why he couldn't walk through the walls at the end of the movie, when he was doing it throughout.Just like I don't know why we were treated to a 5 minute scene that explained to us, how Michael found shoes to wear. Yeah you read that right. Or how and why he found time to hide the knife and mask after he killed his parents.And the music in this movie was horrible. The music made me laugh almost more than anything else. ""Love Hurts""? Come on!! I read one review where someone said the music in this remake was an improvement from the original. I don't know what crack that person was doing.The language was out of control. F-Bombs were dropped almost every other word in the movie. And if it wasn't the F-Bomb being dropped it was some other totally uneccessary, excessive use of another foul word.I could have made a better Halloween remake with my digital camera.And i am not bothering to spell check this review. I say this because i am sure there will be at least 1 person who disagrees with my review so much that they will have nothing else better to say about my review other than that i don't' know how to spel corectly. This review was only meant to vent my anger with Zombie and everyone involved in this train wreck of a classic movie, that should have just been left alone.Oh well, at least I was given a really good couple of laughs for the weekend.

The original was OK, the only creepy part of the film was the music.After watching Zombie's version of the film, I feel that his is superior. The tension, suspense, even the showing of some of the violence, it just improved the experience. I saw an early screening of the film (before he re-shot a portion of it) and I am glad there were re-shoots. The ending in the final cut is much better than that of the screening.If you were a fan of the original, and can stand watching something different, please watch this film.

Good actors they may be, but I found myself irritated by the appearances of Rob Zombie staples from Sherrie Moon to Sid Haig. Dialogue was absolutely awful, and Malcolm Mcdowell had the worst of it.

I regretted that decision within 5 minutes, and I only make it about an hour into the film before giving up.There were two main problems with this movie, in my opinion. 1. It wasn't scary. This movie was basically a series of gruesome murders spliced together with some attempt at dialogue in between. After about 3 murders I grew bored with them. You can only watch people being stabbed so many times before you stop reacting. As a result, it wasn't scary, just sickening. It left me with a feeling of disgust, but no fear because there was NO TENSION. No buildup to murders. Michael just immediately killed every person he ran into in the same manner. 2. Zero character development meant I did not feel bad for the victims. If anything, the teenage girls were annoying and I was relieved that they were killed so I didn't have to hear their mindless dribble about sex. On a side note, I also thought it was weird they chose to portray him as growing up in a white trash family. If white trash families are what create serial killers, the country would be overrun with them. So basically, this movie made me sick to my stomach with the gore, and yet didn't scare me at all, and had characters that had the depth of cardboard cutouts. I was hoping for a good scare on halloween night, I guess I will have to go look at my bank account for that.",Halloween

I can understand why die hard fans of the original wouldn't like this, but I love the vision behind this movie. It's not just about The Shape butchering babysitters in a small town on Halloween night. There's actually a backstory and character arcs. We get to see Michael's childhood, which of course is Zombie's imagining of that childhood, and it's fairly entertaining. You also see Dr. Loomis in his middle age when he starts working with Michael, and you get to see the effect it has on Loomis. Michael and Loomis almost had a bond, and it must have drove Loomis crazy to spend 20 years on a patient who wouldn't speak.
I like how the first half tells the story of young Michael and then we see him turn into the Shape.Locations:
Around the second act, the movie was filmed in the same area as the original, even including shots of the original house and streets used in the original. So I'm not sure why people complain about the fact that this movie was made in California. So was the original.Characters/acting
The second half of this movie does annoy me a little bit. Just little things like Scout's preformance... she was annoying and I never found myself rooting for her. Also, more and more graphic sex scenes around every corner. It's a little repetitive. Most of the characters honestly you just want to see get brutally murdered. But is that a bad thing? That's what I paid to see.The Shape:
Tyler Mane is awesome as the Shape. He is a big scary dude so it makes sense how Michael is so strong and powerful. Some of the kills are just brutal. But in this Adaption Michael is still sneaky and agile. There is also a few hints in this movie that Michael in fact does hold supernatural abilities, which is interesting considering the original movies fail to go into any detail about his inhuman abilities. (Being shot multiple times, set on fire, etc.) At least this reimagining makes room for interesting theories that could even apply to previous Halloween films.(Halloween 6 opens up the idea that's Michael is a part of a satanic cult)Overall, if you like Michael Myers, watch this movie. You'll be rooting for him. He's almost like an anti-hero. The movie is set in 2 time periods and I think both periods are captured well, all while capturing a similar mood throughout. The acting is a bit cheesy at some points but Malcolm McDowell, Brad Dourif, Tyler Mane, Danielle Harris and Skyler Gisando give off some really good performances in this one. Thanks Rob Zombie for making this movie, I watch it every October!",Halloween
673,GhostXXX,the night HE came home,5,24 November 2007,"Let me start by saying that I have seen both the work print and the theatrical version of this film, and I'm still undecided as to what I actually think of the film. By all means if you look at how crappy the Halloween series got by part 8 then this is an enjoyable watch. If you compare it to the original then I reckon you will be disappointed. There where scenes in the work print that I thought should have been in the theatrical version, mostly where Michael is in the asylum. The Theatrical version also felt a little rushed.One Thing that bothered me is that all the guys in the film had long hair and where assholes and all the girls where bitches. Also I don't understand what Rob Zombie's Fascination with making all the characters liking heavy metal is. I realize Rob likes metal and sings in a metal band (which I quite like) but I like hardcore and I wouldn't have people wearing gorilla biscuits T-shirts and such in my film. Over all It is not a bad film but it is no where as good as the original. I really wish this remake trend will end soon, because it kind of sucks when all of my fave movies have been remade.",Halloween
674,pianoman904,It could have worked...but it just didn't!,4,1 September 2007,"Before I begin this let me just say that the original Halloween is not only my favorite horror movie, but one of my favorite overall movies of all time. When I heard they were remaking this I wasn't a little disappointed but when I heard it was being made by Rob Zombie I started to look forward to it because I loved The Devil's Rejects and I know Zombie is a Halloween fan.Believe me, I wasn't trying to compare this to the original when I went to go see it. I knew it was a ""reimagining"" so I went into the theater with an open mind. But there were a few crucial ""Halloween"" trademarks I was looking for.Things I liked: I actually like the whole first half for the most part. I thought it was cool seeing how Michael turned out the way he did. Granted, I always liked the ""mystery of Michael Myers"" aspect of the original. Not knowing why he killed was always made him that more creepy....but I was into the whole backstory thing. I also was really impressed with Sheri Moon Zombie's acting. Malcolm McDowell was also an adequate Dr. Loomis...Lord knows he had SOME BIG SHOES TO FILL! The music was also great. Touching in on John Carpenter's classic score as well as some new creepy overtones. Things I didn't like: Pretty much the one BIG thing that killed the movie was how fast the second half went by. As soon as you were introduced to the characters the were killed. I really had no sympathy when people were killed. John Carpenter spent plenty of time letting you get to know the characters so that when something happened to them...you really felt bad. It added soooo much to the horror. Why do horror directors feel that movies need to fit into like a 90-120 minute time slot. This movie NEEDED to be longer. Sorry, but sometimes its just necessary!!! I also didn't like Michael Myers. Funny to say, but he ruined it for me too. He was way too big. He made Jason Voorhees look like a dwarf. I think an average, phantom-like, quiet, creeping Michael is much creepier than a huge hulking beast Michael. And Michael was pretty much always in your face. Soo more for the ""stalking aspect of Micahel"". The ending also wasn't that satisfying. I am not gonna give anything away...just that...not good what the movie needed. There's plenty more that bothered me. But nothing worth getting into.I guess there's something to be learned here. Some movies are just too perfect, too flawless to remake. Halloween was a groundbreaking movie that used suspense and tension to scare not blood and gore. A technique long lost by todays horror filmmakers.Bottom line here folks. Rob Zombie's Halloween started off with a bang. Great back story, actors, etc. But the second half needed at least another half hour added to it to slow down its terrible fast pace. Hopefully there will be a DVD release with a directors cut or something with some cut scenes. Hopefully scenes with dialogue and character development. Some things people look for in a movie.",Halloween

This was actually the first halloween that i was intrigued by, seen all the others and liked them but this one had the music and story. The new one in 2018 is getting way more credit and im laughing while watching it haha check this one out if you want to see why micheal does what he does",Halloween
676,jimmysmithx2,Like the real feel,9,12 March 2015,"I really like what Rob Zombie brought to this franchise. He took some of the cheese out of the original and made it more real and graphic. To me, this is more scary. He did show everything, which I would prefer some of it left to the imagination, but this also kept me on my toes wondering what would happy next. I think that he killed Ismael, the only one who really cared for him once he was institutionalized, to show that he has no compassion for anyone or anything. I would have rather seen him show a moment of compassion since Ismael had been good to him, but I guess that's not what Rob Zombie wanted. His choice. I think that if you can have a little empathy for a killer, it makes them more human and relatable, but that's just me.",Halloween
677,varunv-86913,A pretty bad reimagining of an iconic film,4,9 September 2019,"John Carpenter's Halloween happens to be one of my favorite horror films of all time.A seminal influence on the slasher genre and a film that still holds up very well to this day(minus the somewhat generic conversation scenes between the teen characters).I knew of the existence of a remake but I warded it off for the longest time simply because I did not want my memory of the original to be tainted by this new rendition.I finally decided to check it out and even after keeping extremely low expectations,I still found this movie lacking in almost every single department.While this remake differs from the original quite a bit,the changes incorporated and shoehorned into the story seemed out of place and pointless.What made the original scary was that we got zero background info on Michael Myers.He seemed more like a spectre or a supernatural entity,and the less we knew about him the scarier he felt.This one however devotes about 30 to 40 minutes on the backstory of Myers,which is filled with clichés straight out of the How to be a Serial Killer guidebook.White trash family-check
Bullies at school-Check
Killing animals-Check
Having an affinity for creepy masks-Double checkI get why they would have wanted to go down that route but it just felt stale and uninspired.But sticking to the template of the original would have earned them even more flak from fans.Which brings me back to a very pertinent question-Why does Hollywood remake so many classic iconic horror films when they know that it is going to be a double edged sword for them??The action scenes are so harebrained and hard to fathom,and along with the poor lighting during some of the nighttime sequences make the experience nauseating.This is not Bourne Ultimatum(where the action was conveyed in such a way to make the world feel more chaotic and urgent) but a friggin gory horror film and if you can't see the violence properly on screen,it defeats the whole purpose of the production.The acting is pretty bad,especially by Taylor Scout Compton.Her incessant screaming and crying invokes more laughter than sympathy and even the scenes with her friends seemed pretty fake and of a try hard nature.Rob Zombie in my opinion is probably the most overrated horror director along with Eli Roth.Both of their best considered movies,The Devil's Rejects and Hostel respectively are average movies at best with annoying characters and stupid plots(Hostel fared better in this regard though),and I don't get the hype around them.After checking out a few films of Zombie's especially his more recent work,I have come to the conclusion that he is a visually interesting director but his storytelling skills are not really up to the mark.If he works with a proper script and does not cast his wife all that often,he can make a pretty competent film.But since it does not look like he is going to do down that path all
that soon,the world would have to make do with more mediocre stuff from him(though I might be proven wrong and Zombie has a god film in him somewhere in the near future).The only saving grace is probably the score which is surprisingly effective and creepy and Michael McDowall as Sam Loomis.though I still prefer Donald Pleasance anyday.Also,props to them for using practical effects instead of using CG.All in all,this is a redundant remake that should not have been made in the first place.Watch the original over this anyway even if you don't like older films.Trust me that is a true masterpiece",Halloween
678,m-haan11,How to rape a classic.....,1,15 August 2008,"Normally I don't write any reviews on IMDb after seeing a movie, it would just take to much of my time, but this time I had to say something and warn people for this so-called Halloween movie. The first 40 minutes is deadly for the film, because we get an explanation why Michael Meyers is the way he is. That's just insane! Michael Meyers is pure evil and doesn't need a reason to kill. Now we get some lame story about how Michael was abused as a little boy and bullied in school. He also has to put up with an asshole stepfather and the fact that his mother is a stripper. Because of that he starts killing small animals en somehow decides one night to kill his step dad, sister and her boyfriend. Next scene we see him laughing and having a jolly good time with Loomis in the asylum and isn't he a nice and happy young boy. Then he starts to turn into a monster and doesn't speak for years. Why he does that isn't revealed and it's seems just plain stupid and ridiculous. After 15 years he breaks out and heads back to Haddonfield to kill his only remaining family, his little sister. How the hell does he know where she lives?!!? She was raised by another family under another name, so is Michael Myers turned into Sherlock Holmes? He heads straight for her without knowing anything about her. How much more can we take..... Also the reason for him wanting to kill her isn't addressed at all. Has he slipped into insanity completely, because he let her live while she was young. OK Mr Zombie, I am willing to go along with that and assume that he is now pure evil and wants to rid the world of his last remaining proof of humanity. Although I wonder if Mr Zombie came up with that explanation. For a horror movie Halloween is also pretty tame and we see a lot of blood but the killings are just boring. Other remakes do much better in this department and it seems Mr Zombie is going soft now. As a closing statement I would like to thank Mr Zombie for raping this classic a making such a bad movie. I will now never see a Rob Zombie again after also viewing the rather boring and messed up 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects. Stick to making music Mr Zombie, you're not even very good at that.",Halloween
679,Lievalle,A different Halloween is a bad Halloween?,8,21 May 2018,"Zombie does a great job remaking this classic of horror and of american cinema. The movie is a good slasher/horror movie: is well directed, is fun, it has a certain style and it avoids some of the traditional difects of horror flicks.The main trait-d'union beetween the modern version and the classic is, in my opinion, the constant presence ( after the start of his killing spere) of Michael in the shadow, lurking his victims. Such a presence imbue all the movie so much that you 'll find yourself looking for his withe mask in every shadow of the shot. This help to create a state of tension similar to the one majestically crafted in the '78.The movie is enjoyable to watch even if you know by memory the original, since it's totaly different, at least for the first hour of screentime.The main issue with this movie is: the zombie's Mickey is totally different from the Carpenter one. Michey here is the result of the rotten part of the society that strikes back against the middleclass, instead in the Carpenter's version was the incarnation of the pure evil, appeared in a normal family in a normal town as he could have appeared anywere else, and this was part of is magnetic creepyness.
So, does this difference make this movie bad? Absolutely no, Zombie updated the myth adding his own vision of it . it works great and makes this movie better than a simple copypaste of the original. Wich version of the myth to prefer has to be decided by the viewer or by the fan and i'm gratefull that Zombie gave us the possibility tochoose wich verzion we prefer.",Halloween
680,Joshbond,Rob Zombie pulls it off!,7,11 September 2007,"Okay, just to start off.. 4 words THIS FILM IS AMAZING I've never fallen in love with a film so fast until the day i walked into Halloween. I have been waiting what feels like forever for this film and i could never be more pleased with it. Only once in a while you come across a film that inspires you, and you fall in love with it, and this was the one. It made me have a whole new look on Micahel Myers. Mind you not the same one Carpenter created. This film is a thrill a minute, very bloody, very intense, and very good soundtrack! My personal favorite scene was when Micahel was a kid beating on that bully in the woods.. God, it was so amazing.. Thank you Rob Zombie!",Halloween
681,lunalelle,"A different movie from the original, but still respectful",7,31 August 2007,"The original -Halloween-, in spite of the general love for it in the slasher/horror community, didn't really pique my interest. I liked it better the second time I saw it, but it was still kind of meh for me. A lot of build up for a climax that ultimately fell short. It's partially my villain preferences. A faceless, characterless villain, a shell of a person, does not interest me. There's no fear when there is nothing there. Things are scarier when there's no discernible motivation sometimes, but when there's no character, where's even the interest in motivation? The real attraction to the original -Halloween- was the oddity that it didn't have all that much blood. It worked on suspense alone, and a bloodless follow-through. Well, Zombie's -Halloween- is a bloodbath, but in my opinion, it's a sensitive bloodbath. Rather a strange way to say it, I know.In Zombie's version, the creepiness of the mask is the same, but we're given a look behind the mask. Michael Myers is just as much of a monster, just as much of a psychopath, but there's a human there, too. It doesn't make him sympathetic, but it does give him a motivation. In my opinion, that makes him an even better villain. There's a whole back story for why he goes after Laurie - not because she reminds him of his sister that he killed, but because she's the sister he let live to make his perfect family. It shows a piece of him that might have saved him, maybe, but when Laurie shows that she's not beyond trying to defend herself by killing him, he does go into his psychopathic killing mode with her, too. Again, there's sympathy, but he's not sympathetic.There were a lot of tit and sex shots - no complaints here - but in my opinion, there was just a touch too much screaming. Even if it seems right for real life to have that much screaming, it can become grating and irritating when used in a film. That sounds kind of callous, but then again, I know the difference between fiction and reality. :) Oh, and there's Brad Dourif. That's all that really needs saying. Brad Dourif. I've never seen him in a character I didn't like.In my opinion, it was a better remake than I think anyone expected, especially since it seemed that Zombie held great respect for the original. It also seemed that maybe Zombie had the same issues with Michael as a villain in the original as I did, because he gave me exactly what I needed.",Halloween
682,OwenAllaway,New Horror's Masterpiece,9,4 October 2007,"I'm really baffled by the reception to Rob Zombie's Halloween and I feel the need to redress the balance somewhat. It's been sneaked out in the UK with no notice (a week and a half before it was eventually released it still didn't have a confirmed release date that I could find), minimal publicity and no reviews. It's got an exceptionally poor rating of 25% on rottentomatoes.com and as I type the IMDb score is a reasonably-okay-but-not-great 6.1.The reason I'm baffled is that it's clearly a nine out of ten movie. (And it's not that I can see any reason to mark it down from a ten, a nine just feels better.) The only way I can see people not liking the movie is if they were never going to like the movie.Okay, if you don't like boobies and/or blood, then you won't like the movie. But then your criticisms are of horror movies, not of this movie.If you don't think movies should ever be remade then, well, maybe this will change your mind. The remake of The Wicker Man wasn't a bad movie because it was a remake of a classic movie, it was because it was a quite incredibly awful remake of a classic movie.I'm sure I'll be pulled over by the movie thought police for saying this, but the original Halloween, though incredibly influential and important, isn't without its problems. The main one being that, despite it's reputation as a lean, taut masterpiece, it drags. Zombie's version never does. He's made the story from the original movie the second half of his version and filled the first half with more back story for lil' Michael and family. It's a decision that works well. Michael Myers was never a character whose mystique came from his history. We knew a lot about him in the original movie and now we know more. As well as being interesting in its own right, this allows the second half of the movie to move along at a cracking pace. It's not all super-fast quick cuts, though. Rob Zombie is a talented director, who's as adept at using stillness and easy listening as fast motion and loud rock.It's interesting, it's tense, it's scary and it walks the fine line between horror and comedy that Zombie seems to have chosen as his own particular path. A lot of people seem to have missed that in quite spectacular fashion. You may be able to get through without laughing out loud if you're particularly stone-faced, but I don't see how you'd get through without cracking a smile. It does, I'll admit, settle down on the horror side of the divide for the majority of the second half, but until then it's one funny film and isn't without amusing moments even near the end.In a sense, I feel that Zombie's movies are for healthy people. They may sound odd to some, filled as they are with guts, screaming and death, but my theory is that you need to have a well-balanced mind to be able to appreciate all the dark shades he uses. The comedy in his movies is often very, very black, but it should be easily discernible if you're open to it. Halloween is on another level to his earlier movies, though, I think. He seems to have toned down the scatter-shot approach of House of a Thousand Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. Enjoyable as they both were, they didn't hang together nearly as well as this movie.And to top everything off Halloween's sprinkled with appearances by Zombie regulars, Brad Dourif and the mighty Malcolm McDowell in a big, crunchy role.As I said earlier, if you don't like modern horror then, no, you probably won't like this, but Halloween is on another level other recent remakes, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes, and there's more story and life to it than the likes of Saw and other gorno features.It's the masterpiece of the current wave of post-post-modern, seventies-influenced horror movies, it's actually better than Carpenter's original and it sure as hell deserves far better than it's got.",Halloween
683,george_a_romero,A mess!!!!!!!!,1,22 June 2008,"Where's the Zero out of 10????? Rob Zombies Halloween 07' is a noisy headache of a film filled with insecure intellectual psychobabble that tries to explain Micheal Myers mental condition (those video inserts were cheesy).It totally strips away the magic of John Carpenters original, like using paint remover on a beautiful painting. Malcom McDowell is totally miscast as Loomis, Rob Zombie has no zest or flare nor delicacy as a director, keeps all the action on the surface, the script is awfully hammy, like it was written in a few days and zombie celebrates mindless violence.",Halloween
684,Dark_Knight_89,A disgrace... Stick with Jamie Lee and John Carpenter.,2,30 August 2007,"This might be my candidate for the worst remake ever made.The film is dead before it even gets going when it dedicates the first half of its running time to explaining Michael myers' back story. We get an over-the-top and downright ridiculous scene of Michael's family: a stripper-mom, her loudmouth and vulgar wheel-chair hubby, a bitchy sister who doesn't support help Michael, and then oh look! An innocent baby girl! the only source of happiness in young Mikey's life! it's a typical ""bad family"" cliché that makes you roll your eyes.we learn Michael has a couple bullies at school. He snaps one day and tracks one down and kills him in the woods. Later that night he kills his sister, her boyfriend (who sports the very mask Michael Myers is famous for wearing.... cue ""roll of the eyes"") and the jackass in the wheel chair.he then gets shipped off to the nut house headed by Sam Loomis (Malcolm Mcdowell) who genuinely tries to help him over the next 15 years. But 15 years pass, and he's unab;e to help him. Michael escapes, and he appears to be going after his baby sister, now all grown up.before I tear this movie a new one, I'll give props to McDowell's performance as loomis. he manages to stand out as the only well-oiled part in this contraption of a film.Now... first off it's damn near next to impossible to be scared of a psychopath when for 40 minutes you've been forced to sympathize with him. we have it shoved down our throats that he had a poor childhood and then we're expected to be scared when he starts killing all the people who have mistreated him/failed him. We try to enjoy certain characters being killed off, but then we feel awkward because we're being forced to root for the bad guy.Approximately 98% of all the dialog in this movie is so bad you wonder if the script writer really talks like that in real life. and then you wonder if said script writer has any kind of social life. anyway the point is, the dialog sucks.the characters are all mostly clichéd cut-outs of other characters you've seen in other movies, not necessarily of the horror genre. the difference here is that these characters cannot be sympathized with and do not endure any character development. I understand this is a horror movie and that character development is usually not a pre-requisite, but this movie needed a hell of a lot more than characters running around speaking nauseating sentences and waiting around until Michael kills them.and speaking of killing, most of the death sequences are drawn out to the point of being boring despite itself. there are at least 3 characters who die slow painful crawling deaths. you know they're going to die, but director Rob Zombie felt it was necessary to show the very last moments of their lives. it's useless. it adds nothing to the movie. instead of drawing out the demises they should have focused their energy on actually scaring us.in the end, this version of ""Halloween"" pales in comparison to the 1978 version. I'm sure glad I saw this for free because otherwise I would have demanded my money back before the first 10 minutes were through. Stick with Jamie Lee and John Carpenter.",Halloween
685,JankaJaakari,"Good, Bad and Worse",6,15 December 2007,Whitout doubt very professionally made movie that has merits and flaws in it. It quite well updates story visually and otherwise to nowadays and answered some of the questions left unanswered in original. As regarding this re-make I believe it would have worked better if the childhood bits of Michael were not shared with such grand portions ie Michael is bogeyman - lurking and stalking slasher killing machine in fictional horror story and it is no point to try raise sympathy for him or try to humanize him it only work against the whole character. Later parts of movie (from the truck stop and there on) got some quite impressive stuff in it and Malcolm McDowell were worthy heir to Donald Pleasance former part and Danielle Harris was added bonus. I think that this movie probably has most professi0nal cast of actors ever presented in Halloween line of movies.,Halloween

Great suspense, and gore,bloody killings,and excellent camera-work. The actors are not that great. The ""contact""between Myers, and Loomis is ridiculous, and not well written. The girls looks nice, but they are not gonna be the Meryl Streep of their generation. Tyler""sabretooth"" Mane looks scary in the Michael Myers outfit.

""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Alien,"" and ""Devil's Rejects"" are the only films I can mention as being capable of keeping me as terrified as this film did. Zombie made Myers more intimidating than Carpenter ever did, though Rob had a much higher budget to work with. I dare not give away anything but say that this movie works so well because it tells such an intriguing, full backstory before the truly suspenseful portion of the film begins. ""Halloween's"" only drawback is its series of vain attempts at recreating lines from the original, though on account of this, other referenced points have a powerful effect when they play out differently. You won't see these moments coming despite being forewarned, and if you haven't seen a Halloween movie before, this is the only one other than the first that wasn't awful, and also the only remake of an old horror film other than ""The Thing"" that wasn't terrible.

688,gbi09403,I just can't see what the fuss is about.,9,4 September 2007,"First- John Carpenter is my favorite director. Second- Halloween is one of the greatest films ever made. I knew that before I watched this movie. So my expectations were- well, different because Zombie is a fan of the genre. Just like me. With that being said, I really liked this movie. It seemed to be realistic, gritty and dirty. The death scenes were just brutal, relying less on new and inventive ways to kill and more on grabbing you with the absolute fight for life during a physical attack. The back story added some realism- which descended Myers from a supernatural creature to just a very disturbed, very violent, emotionless character; a nice new twist in my book. Myers is definitely is the new main character (not Laurie), but the other characters are given just enough depth to make them interesting and real- like the teen-age girls, which are terribly annoying, but man, they were as real as it gets. The suspense was lacking, but Zombie is not known to be the master of suspense as Carpenter was. Zombie's a master of gore and violence. Anyone who goes to see this film thinking otherwise should just avoid it and rent it later. Anyone who wants to see what a horror movie fan does when he gets to remake a classic should make the time to check it out.",Halloween
689,jonathancross69,"Not scary, of course after watching 8 of them.",7,5 September 2007,"I like the concept. Seeing the way Myers grew up, when he went crazy, and how he got his mask...that was cool. The movie gets kind of boring when he breaks out of the institute. It drags on a little bit. Some parts were predictable like when Lori looks out of the window and Myers is standing there, she looks away and looks back, and then he's gone. Think of something else to do, they even made fun of that typical type scene in ""Scary Movie.""(Anna Ferris is hot) And at the end, it's not really suspenseful because you know Lori's going to live. I've seen better death scenes by Myers. He should've severed a head or something. This movie would've stood out more if there was more gore.....even Jason's more violent.",Halloween
690,bruce428,Rob pulled it off,7,1 September 2007,"Well i go to say that if you are comparing the two films this on is better because well it was made in 2007 and the other one in the 70s. This movie was by no means perfect and neither was the original but i still enjoyed this movie quite much this comment is being made while ignoring the sequels such as Halloween 2 and such simply pretend that there was never any sequels made to the original.The likes: Myers story it was somewhat good and bad it took up too much time though and it makes the movie less frighting to know that he has a motive after all. I liked the effort as well Rob put into this, it is by no means easy to surpass a film like the original you can see Rob gave it his best shot and I respect him for that.The dislikes: Blood come on I know this was made in 2007 but why the use of so much blood. Zombie had to rely on blood to make this movie interesting for the most part while Carpenter hardly used blood at all and made the movie terrifying. Myers himself was another dislike about this movie my god he was unstoppable throughout the whole movie he just ran through and killed everyone in his path. ""The shape"" however took his time with his targets and eventually killed them in the most frighting way possible. there also was not enough time to get the characters developed too much time was spent on Myers childhood and escape. This myers seemed soft as well everyone who seen the original would know that ""the shape"" would not have hesitated to kill Laurie if had the chance this Myers had Laurie right there and still did not get the job done. Last but not least was the fact that too many characters were killed off the body count had to be above 12 at least I did not understand why he killed Laurie's parents or why if he is dead Dr. Loomis died? If Loomis is dead there will be no sequel to this because how can you make one when the person responsible for stopping Myers was killed off in the previous movie? I did enjoy this movie and I am glad i saw it Rob Zombie did not fail by no means he made a great remake that is way better then all of the sequels that have been spawned over the past years.If you want to be scared then you cannot by no means see the sequels to the original because they take all the fear away from the original by making up motives for Myers or as I call him by his real name ""the shape"" because i have been victimized by the sequels and they have reduced the original for me in fear level from a 10 to a 3.I give this movie a 7 out of 10 because of Robs efforts to remake this thank you Rob for giving us a great Remake.",Halloween

692,Firecracka_NFB,The King of all Horror Movies!!!,9,25 December 2007,"I'll never understand why anybody would think this is a bad film. Anybody i've ever talked to who has seen this thinks this film is awesome, and I agree. It is quite possibly the best horror movie i've ever seen. My number one favorite film without a doubt. I just bought it yesterday and already watched it three times. Rob Zombie is the best horror movie film maker today. All his movies push the limit and that what I like, and he makes everything so real. He is really creative. It is way better than the original. I hope Rob keeps making horror movies as fresh as this. It is a sadistic remake. Bottom line this movie f**king rocks!!!",Halloween
693,awjhall,Not a patch on the original,1,4 September 2008,"I had really been looking forward to watching this however I ended up sorely disappointed. The suspense that was such a big part of the original was almost non existent, and the film was so disjointed it was almost like watching three mini movies all crammed into one.Once again it pampered to the myth that all teens do is either talk about sex or have sex which is now really rather boring. There was an excessive bad language and sexual references which just put me off totally, and a revolting and totally unnecessary scene where two prison guards raped an inmate in Michaels cell . I'm not sure exactly what Rob Zombie was trying to portray with his version of the film but he would be well advised to NOT try to remake any other classic horrors before he ruins them as well!I'm not a prude and I love a good blood n guts horror but this was just plain awful!",Halloween
694,calderon1508,Disgusting and horrible movie,1,9 February 2008,When I first heard about the remake of the incredible 1978 Halloween I had mixed feelings but when I heard it was going to be directed by Rob Zombie it gave me more hope since he directed one of my favorite horror movies the devils rejects but when I saw Halloween I was more than disappointed I was disgusted.Rob tried to give Michael a heart by letting him talk witch ruined the whole movie because he didn't seem scary at all and the acting was terrible by everyone for the exception of Malcolm McDowell who did his part of Dr.Loomis flawlessly and so did Scout Taylor Compton who portrays Laurie very well and I thought she was very believable.Overall terrible take of the original classic.Save your money and go see 30 days of night.,Halloween
695,cltortorice1,hhhhhmmmm?,7,15 December 2007,"Well at first i wasn't even sure i wanted to actually waste 90 minutes of my life on a remake that was most likely bad. To my surprise it was an enjoyable horror movie that held on the clichés. It has its share of gore, but not as much as some recent movies. I watched the unrated version last night, and i strongly suggest to not buy the unrated version; the rape scene was completely unnecessary. However the children she babysits in the movie have more comedic lines that will make u giggle and hope for a good outcome. I also liked how there was a different portrayal of Michael Myers. He transformed from an innocent looking psychopath to an awkward, disturbed, trailer-trash psychopath.",Halloween
696,horrormovieman89,"Rob Zombie makes Halloween, his own. *GAG*",2,8 July 2008,"I personally love the original Halloween. To this day it is one of my favorite movies, and I can constantly watch it. When I heard there was going to be a Halloween remake, I got pretty excited(not that much, since I thought there was no need to do it). Then I found out Rob Zombie was directing and everything came crashing down. I did not like the fact that he was directing it for a simple reason: He was going to turn a masterpiece into one of his, trashy, gory, sex scene, vulgar filled trash heap. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy gore to the MAX, but gore never really worked with Michael Myers and the fact that Rob Zombie thinks Gore, White Trash, Cursing, and Breasts make a good horror movie. To be honest, he does not know WTF a horror movie is! The ""prequal"" type beginning was pretty good, hated the fact that his family was a psycho, white trash, vulgar JUST like in all his other movies.(I understand its his style, but it just did not work) What was creepy about the original, was...Michael came from a pretty well rounded, middle class home/family. Not something out of the Beverly Hill Billies Rated R addition, and he STILL goes insane and kills everyone. He is not a run of the mill serial killer that goes insane because of his family, hes just..Evil! Simple as that, Rob Zombie managed to turn Michael Myers...human. It was terrible. The acting...oh my god the acting. I enjoyed the actor who played ""young Michael""...but thats it. Laurie and her friends were annoying, disgusting perverted and I couldn't wait until they died and died they did, with of course the usual: ""Im gonna take my shirt off now""..*STAB BLOOD*...etc etc.(Thanks Rob Zombie!) The actor who played Dr. Loomis,wow, terrible much? Suspense? Rob Zombie does not know what suspense is, his movies rely on ONE thing, and ONE thing only, and that my friends is called Shock Value. He thinks nudity, gore, and cursing make up a horror movie, its terrible.(I know Im repeating myself, but it angers me). The 1st half was slow, but interesting, once Michael returned home, it was just a gored crapped up version of the original. Rob Zombie, stay away from GOOD horror movies and keep making your senseless movies, thanks! Id defiantly say JUST rent it, or go to a Pathmark or Shop Rite, and rent it in one of those Red Boxes for only a dollar(still too much in my opinion). *sigh*..Does Hollywood have anymore ideas????",Halloween
697,WillM02,A Bad Remake...,3,6 July 2008,"This remake of John Carpenter's horror classic is rubbish. I suppose that one must be a redneck to understand Zombie's ""intelligent"" film making and directing style. This film should have never been released.Why must ""The Shape"" (Micheal Myers) - One of scariest villains of all time be transformed into a long haired metal head?. The attempt to re-invent the character was poorly done and is one of the outlining reasons why this remake is so bad. Rob Zombie had the opportunity to create a masterpiece of horror but instead this movie just feels like a cheap 70's exploitation film even though having a budget of $25 million dollars.Now the cast, Tyler Mane, plodding around in a mask just isn't scary. When Nick Castle played ""The Shape"" it was scary, the way he moved was truly frightening. The rest of the cast performed well, though I wasn't a fan of the new Laurie Strode. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the original but this was disappointing even by low expectations. Stay clear if you're a fan of the original.3/10",Halloween

The story is great (maybe even greater than the original), great casting to tell it short the movie was enjoyable and it's was scary.Although most of the Halloween-fans hate this movie, it was a good choice that they let Zombie direct this, you don't have to see this as a remake of Carpenter's Halloween but just as a version of that.

700,The_Gemini_Killer,It just didn't get it..,2,3 September 2007,"I had heard nothing but positive reviews from friends and family when I decided to check Zombie's version of Halloween out for myself. So you could say I was looking forward a nonstop thrill-ride of some sort. To say it simply, I couldn't count the numerous times I yawned through-out this terrible movie. Rob Zombie had made it clear to his audience, to see this for a movie itself, don't try to compare it to the original. But what you don't understand is that when you're remaking the classic best horror movie of all time, it is impossible to just forget the original completely, especially when several scenes came STRAIGHT from the original.If anything, I'd call this a remake of The Blair Witch Project with better cameras, since half of the movie was done in the dark and with hand-held cameras, which made it impossible to really see anything and just create some massive migraines for the entire audience. It was hard to watch and what you did see, you wish you hadn't. Zombie said he approached this film from a serious angle, but all I heard in the crowd was laughter.It was either too fast, or too slow, or just down right annoying to watch.Something else that bugged me about this film was the people who said ""Finally! We get to see what made Michael the way he is!"" And no, you don't. You get to see Rob Zombie's version of what his own impression of why Michael does what it is he does. In which, it completely treads on the original, of an average built guy being able to do things that only someone much stronger would be capable of doing. Zombie's solution to this problem was to hire a giant actor who COULD break someone's face with his bare hands, rather than just someone full of such evil and having the power to take a bullet and still get up.It was more of a 'craptastic' prequel if anything at all, showing Michael's youth of being a redneck in a family of lazy and greasy people. The way Zombie set it up, apparently, is that Michael was full of such rage due to the fact that his mother was a prostitute ... Yeah. Something Rob Zombie has failed to do three times in a row now, was to make you sympathetic for the victims. Just doesn't show them long enough to make you miss them when they're gone. Most of the movie was done with little Myers in the hospital, so the last thirty or so minutes of him randomly killing people goes by so fast that you don't really care. He tries to cover this up by playing sad music like ""Love hurts"" when someone special is killed, but all it did was get more laughter for a reaction.The major character changes were all that but flawless, Don't get me wrong, the actors did their jobs well, it's just they were given the jobs that they never should have done. To show so little of key characters like Dr. Loomis and then to rid him away so quickly.. The entire cast, good actors I can say, just were all terribly wrong for their parts. Danielle Harris is the perfect example, reduced to play a teenage slut after her major involvement in the prior Halloween series? When you make a slasher flick, the object is to cast people you want to survive, not a cast of faces and whiny little voices that you wish would be killed off sooner. It just didn't get it. The film was nothing short of disappointing, which is as was expected as soon as I heard that Zombie had been set to direct. I honestly do think that if someone were to ever ask ""Would you do a prequel to House 1000 and show where Otis came from exactly?"" Zombie would reply with ""Halloween."" In the end, this movie was just like every other recent remake of something classic that shouldn't exist but does, and now we just have to deal with it. . In my opinion, which is all I can offer, is that this is the best example of what a true insult to the horror genre could ever be. I always said that one day a remake would pop up that might open up peoples eyes as to the real damage remakes are doing to horror, and now I just have to point at this. Honestly, Halloween was just not the film Rob Zombie should have remade, and the movie itself stands as if saying ""This is what you get for not letting me remake 'Texas Chainsaw Masscre' instead!""Simply and yet sadly said, it was for todays generation where true horror no longer exists. That's all. :(",Halloween
701,fortyleaves23,People are waaaaaaay too hard on this movie.,8,30 January 2010,"I admit, I'm far too young to have seen the original Halloween in 1978, and I tend to like most of the movies I see anyway, but I still feel that the backlash dealt out to Rob Zombie's remake quite undeserved. When I first saw it, I had never seen the original Halloween, although I was familiar with the story. When I saw this film though, I liked it enough to get interested in the franchise, which is now my favourite horror franchise. The realistic violence, coupled with the hollow, brutal manner in which Tyler Mane and Daeg Faerch dispatch Michael's victims was shocking, only amplified by watching the first, and most sadistic killings carried out by a young child made my insides go cold. Where John Carpenter wanted us to fear Michael Myers for his inhumanity, Zombie's goal is to instill a fear of Michael as a man, a human man who commits the most terrible crimes with no purpose or mercy. Malcolm McDowell portrays a very different Sam Loomis as a man haunted by his failure to turn Michael away from his murderous impulses, and tries to fix his mistakes before it's too late. Scout Taylor-Compton plays the innocent Laurie Strode as the victim of fate as much as of Michael, as she tries desperately to hold herself together in the face of the monster who stalks her. A masterpiece like the original? Not by a long shot, but a fine film by itself.",Halloween
702,hannahhill93,Possibly greater than the original.,9,27 September 2014,"I have always been a fan of the Halloween franchise and a huge fan of Rob Zombie so I had high expectations of this film and I was not disappointed.For me, what makes this film such a success is the fact, it isn't just another mystery masked killer running around slaughtering anyone who get in his way without any real reason to do so. Rob creates a monster out of abused little boy, you understand where his anger has come from and why he is going after the people he does. I love that this film has delved into the psychological side of things, it isn't just brutal killing (although there is a lot) it shows you how a ""monster"" is created. Sheri Moon Zombie is brilliant, which I have to admit shocked me slightly as although I love her acting it was hard to imagine her being able to pull of such a role. She plays the heart broken mother who refuses to give up on her son even in death amazingly. If I'm honest there is not one actor in this film I can criticise.",Halloween
703,Garymc,not as good as the original,7,30 September 2007,"When I heard this was being made and after watching the trailer I was really looking forward to it. But after going to see it last night I am a bit disappointed. I have give it a 7 as it has a few scares and enough gore to keep people amused but not enough story. The story is quite interesting when he is a child because it goes into a bit of depth and how he was treated which could have triggered him to become a psychopath. When he becomes and adult he just heads straight back to Haddonfield and starts offing his victims far too quickly. There is no stalking like in the original and no suspense leading to any of his murders, they go for gore when i think people are more afraid psychologically now and gore doesn't do that. I was also disappointed with the ending, I won't say what happens but it isn't the ending we know and love. If they made the second half of the film a bit longer and put more into scaring us without ""killing by numbers"" then I would have enjoyed it more.",Halloween
704,paleo7,A let-down follow-up to Devil's Rejects,5,4 September 2007,"After the intensity and addicting brutality of Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", many fans (myself included) were expecting more from Zombie with his ""vision"" of a Halloween remake. The original Halloween, though a bit dated and tame by today's standards, has suspense and true primal scares; there is no in-depth explanation for why Michael Myers kills...he's just pure evil. In Rob Zombie's attempt to give a back story, he recreates the iconic character with an overly long back story that simply makes us sympathize with him. This Columbine-esquire fear (if our kids are picked on then they'll become killers) is also what was wrong with the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (along with many other issues). Furthermore, by creating a giant-sized Michael Myers with Tyler Mane (who is a good character actor) another element of fear is removed; devotion to kill. The original Michael Myers wasn't that large of a man. When he was shot or stabbed and kept coming, that was evidence of a true, instinct-driven urge to kill. By making him so large in Zombie's remake, his brute size and strength makes him intimidating by size, but not necessarily having a similar killer urge. The same was done (once again) with the remake of Chainsaw's Leatherface. As for story and direction, the film possesses Zombie's signature flare, which does keep the audience watching for more gore (which he does not skip on), but the story runs out of steam well before it runs out of blood. While it is fun to see cameos from Zombie's previous outings, as well as homage scenes galore, its not enough to get this body to float. I hope Zombie can bounce back from this to his more original material. Pitfalls are there, though, for directors who create a great film and then fall into the depths of remaking a classic, only to fall short and find trouble getting back on their feet (are you reading this, Alexander Aja?)",Halloween
705,phil-g,The original wasn't that great so stop crying,8,4 September 2007,"By now there's dozens of comments & reviews available to read so I wont labour the point or repeat a plot synopsis. Please remember, the original movie was a cheaply made independent that caught the publics imagination & has been endlessly imitated ever since. It was fun, tense (when I was 15) & a great ride. But thats it - it wasn't Citizen Kane & I cant understand the almost zealous reverence some fans are attaching to it. Rob Zombie has made a movie - a pretty good movie - that should be judged on its own merits (just like any other film). OK so you loved the original - I loved the original Psycho & thought the remake was pointless. At least Zombie has tried to throw many new ideas into the remake & give it some individuality - brave moves from a brave director. Bottom line - try to forget the original (if your a Halloween obsessive) & watch it on its own merits. It ain't perfect but its a pretty entertaining ride - which reminds me of the original....",Halloween

Surely all the time & energy could have been devoted to a movie that would be worth going to see.Surely all the time & effort should have been spent on something that could be considered family entertainment. Something that makes a person feel better after see a movie is what I call entertainment.Remakes, spinoffs, sequels are all representative of a total lack of imagination on the part of writers, directors, producers, & actors. I can't possibly see how a role in this type of movie can advance any actors career. I seriously doubt anyone connected with this 'thing' can feel proud of their participation.",Halloween

Or am I just crazy?? Cause surprisingly, I loved it!Maybe it's just because I'm younger (16) but I like this version way better than the original.....which is weird, cause I do love most older horror movies. But, I don't know, this one was just more interesting to me....I love how Rob Zombie showed Micheal's past in this film.....it just explains why he is who he is today and how he became known as the ""boogeyman"". Although, one thing that did confused me in the movie was why he wanted to go after his sister (who I actually thought was a baby boy at the beginning of the film). But anyways, Rob sure knows how to add just the right amount of suspense and gore into his films. Is it the best horror movie out there? No. But it sure is good....and I believe the people who gave this movie negative reviews needs to give it a second chance. Overall, I give Rob Zombie's Halloween a solid 8",Halloween
708,strad-1,great take on classic film,8,3 September 2007,"Rob Zombie has accomplished the very difficult task of taking a beloved classic and making it his own while respecting all that is so loved in the original. Much like the 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the filmmakers took the idea of the original film and made it different in enough ways to make it stand on its own. Never boring, the film gives a different perspective on Michael Myers that is absent in the original. What it lacks in John Carpenter's suspenseful style and restraint, it makes up for in savage brutality. What is most interesting about the new Halloween is how it is able to evoke some real emotional moments. I am a real fan of the original film, but I really enjoyed the new one as well.",Halloween
709,ncallinicos,"Not Zombies best, but still good",7,8 December 2016,"First off Scout Taylor Compton was perfect for this role. She played the role of a sweet innocent teenage girl to perfection. The other acting was solid and the story line had more to offer than most slasher films. This film really tried to put a face behind the mask and they succeeded. Starting with Myers as a child where you can see right from the beginning a development of a serial murderer. In my opinion this is the best Halloween movie made so far. This is an ode to the classic with just a touch of Rob Zombie making it his own. It's not as demented as some of his other films, yet some of the actors were the same which I enjoyed. If you genuinely enjoy slasher films this is right up your alley.",Halloween

How any human being liked this movie is beyond me. Rob Zombie completely destroyed Halloween and his own fan base. After seeing house of 1000 corpses, (Which is better than this movie will ever be) I was interested to see how Rob Zombie would destroy Halloween. Once the film begins you realize that this is no where near as good as John Carpenters, as you realize that this movie makes a huge mistake with its source material trying to give the monster a soul. It does not work. Oh by the way Rob, dropping the F bomb every minute is not how you right a script. For the love of any thing that is sane never ever watch this movie. From beginning to end, this film sucked so much I would never, EVER, watch it again. I would rather have my arms chopped off them be tortured with this pathetic specimen of excuse of entertainment.

711,rick-f,Awesome Film,8,6 January 2018,"This is Rob Zombie's remake of the original Halloween. It is a little bit slow to get into, but it speeds up. This film focuses a bit more on Michael Myers' childhood and when he finally snapped. Basically the events before he was locked up and assigned to Dr. Loomis. 
The movie is pretty long and there will be a few moments that are cringeworthy toward the end, but keep in mind they are adaptations from the original so if you're a fan of the original then you have to cringe at both since he followed the manuscript of the original pretty much toward the end. 
If you're a true horror film fan and fan of the Halloween series you will absolutely love this film for giving you more depth into the character of Mikey Myers. This film is a masterpiece compared to most horror films that don't place much emphasis on developing a character and building up suspense to keep you on the edge.",Halloween

Of Course, it can never replace its predecessor, But the movie was enjoyable. The Only negative point is that they transformed Micheal Myers that feels a knife being stabbed in him, to a clone of Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees, with no feelings.

I sometimes use this Halloween in there just because. It definitely has good Halloween decorations in it and you really get the feeling that it's Halloween and October time. But it's really not a very good movie. It's ugly and sick and even though it's a horror movie, so that should be okay, it's just kind of disturbing and not fun. The original Halloween was much more fun and involving. It wasn't as serious but it was even scarier than this one. Rob Zombie is a very talented director but I really don't like his style. He just seems to hire all his friends and put them in all his movies. That would be fine if his movies were good, but they're really not, at least in my opinion. If you're looking for some good Halloween horror, skip this one and watch Halloween 3 instead.",Halloween
714,spookydude139,*SPOILERS* Rob Zombie fans will love it; Purists will puke,3,2 September 2007,"The full review I wrote of this film can be found in the boards. Some comments were cut from this due to length.Where shall I begin with this film? With the cuts back and forth between poor Mikey sitting on the steps not able to trick or treat while mommy flashes her behind at the strip club backed by ""Love Hurts?"" Or Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" as the backing music for a bunch of trucks pulling into a truck wash? Or the absolutely cardboard acting by Malcolm McDowell? I own just about every copy of the film there is, including the extended version they made when they added additional scenes after they had to cut a bunch of the original film to show it on network TV.I even like Rob Zombie's films. But this. This, I'm sad to say, was an abomination.John Carpenter's Halloween was scary because it had an undercurrent of lost innocence. The first killing is shocking not because we see a bloody knife, it's scary because out of the blue, in a seemingly normal family, a little child slaughters his older sister with a butcher knife.Rob Zombie's Halloween is nothing more than an explanation of how poor Michael became a killer because of his cruddy, dysfunctional family and lifestyle. Instead of going for the almost supernatural aspect of the original story, Rob Zombie decided to look at Michael as a traditional serial killer, complete with the animal killing, the alcoholic step father and the slutty completely useless older sister who may or may not be screwing the alcoholic step father. Following the initial shock of the family killing (which is just typical Rob Zombie shock and gore) he spends the majority of the film focusing on Michael and his time in the institution with Malcolm McDowell showing up as a half baked Dr. Loomis trying to help the poor child until finally he is forced to realize he's dealing with the unfixable. That doesn't happen until a particular killing which was one of many that were so easy to see coming there was absolutely no scare factor to them at all.One of the worst parts for me was seeing Jamie Lee's Laurie changed. To go from an innocent, frightened teen who was completely caught by surprise by the horror she faced, yet fought back every chance she got to Scout Taylor Compton was just sad. Compton's Laurie was clearly nothing more than a slut in waiting who rather than fighting back screamed and wailed and couldn't figure out how to get out of an empty swimming pool.Another aspect of this film that was disappointing was Michael's escape from Smith's Grove. There was very little scare factor in it. One of the scariest scenes I've ever seen was the escape scene in the original film. Dr. Loomis and the nurse pull up to the gate at the sanitarium and in flashes of lightning, the viewer can see patients in the white gowns, roaming aimlessly on the grounds in the rain with no lights and no one but the patients in sight. That scene had no gore, yet was absolutely terrifying. And the set up paid off even more when a barely seen gowned figure jumps heavily to the top of the station wagon and begins to terrorize the nurse inside. The set up and the action lead to one of the best lines in horror film ever: Dr. Loomis' almost maniacal ""He's gone. The evil is gone from here."" It worked because that's what Michael was in the first(and second) film. Pure, unadulterated, almost supernatural evil, motivated by an unstoppable ""something"" that made him obsessed with finding and killing his other sister.The much spoken of ""twist"" just irritated me until I realized that I didn't like Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis and I'd just as soon see him get what he got.Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis was the character that truly made the original films. While some of his great lines were kept in RZ's version Malcolm McDowell just didn't have the same manic, scared pooless appearance when he said them. Donald Pleasance had all the appearance of a man on the edge of terror, almost whizzing himself with fear in the first two films, someone who knew EXACTLY just what sort of evil Michael was yet unable to get anyone else to see the same thing. Folks, if you're a true Halloween fan, wait for the DVD. Send all those who think they ought to remake a classic just because they can the message that you're not going to spend bucks to see the butchering of a classic film. For those who aren't die hard fans, you might enjoy this film, especially if you're a big Rob Zombie fan. It has all his typical elements, from the boobs, the blood and the bouncing camera angles to the dim bulb heroes and heroines and manic, overkill death scenes. On that score, I can't knock this film down. It's EXACTLY what I've come to expect from RZ.I'm sure folks reading this will be hollering ""But it was supposed to be RZ's ""reimagining of the original."" Well, as a true fan, let me tell you, this film did not NEED to be ""reimagined."" It was great as it was. Let RZ go back to writing his OWN material. It's much better, more horrific and a much better use of his time.This is yet another stinker remake, a bad idea from the start. If I could get my money back I would, but I just have to chalk it up as a learning experience. I certainly can't chalk it up as anything else. I don't even want this film to put in my collection of ""worst films ever made."" I liked ""Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid"" better.",Halloween
715,tonymisfeldt,I Could Eat A Box Of Alphabits Cereal And Crap A Better Script Than This!,1,5 November 2014,"This was one of the WORST remakes I have ever seen, if not one of the worst movies PERIOD.I know a lot of the Rob Zombie fans are going to say ""It's not John Carpenter's Halloween, it's Rob Zombie's. You can't compare the two. You have to look at it as its own thing."" To these people I say, I did look at it as its own thing. I tried to keep from comparing the two different versions. I even watched it more than once to see if multiple viewing would change my mind. All those extra viewings did was cement my opinion that this movie is a horrid, unscary, unentertaining, piece of trash.And this opinion is not due to any preconceived prejudices against Rob Zombie. I happen to be a fan of his music. And while I didn't really care much for House Of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects was okay. So I was going in with an open mind and cautious optimism. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to begin. I suppose I should start at the beginning. Introducing us to young Michael and his family wasn't a bad decision, especially considering Rob was going to use the ""Laurie is Michael's sister"" storyline from the original franchise. However there was no reason to make the entire family a bunch of foul mouthed rednecks. Normally cursing doesn't bother me much (I've been known to curse like a sailor myself). But this was fairly excessive. Add to that the verbal abuse, mental abuse, threats of physical abuse. Michael's mom's a stripper, his sister's a slut, his stepdad is a loud, obnoxious, abusive drunk. Add to that him getting bullied at school, any one of those could make a kid homicidal and Rob decided to throw ALL of them at him. Some people liked it, I felt it was totally unnecessary. I saw a fan film on You Tube that did Michael's going from a regular kid to homicidal maniac far more effectively, and it was done by amateurs.Second problem is that first Halloween night, when Michael kills Judith. Granted, we're gonna get cheated out of any suspense in this scene because everyone already knows that Michael is a killer. But, because I don't think the stepdad should have been an abusive drunk, I don't think he should have been killed. Leave it at Judith, and maybe her boyfriend. Maybe rewrite it somehow to make it more suspenseful (or at least a good jump scare). Third, the sanitarium. They should have had Michael stop talking immediately, or at least a lot sooner than he did. Might have been a good idea to shorten the sanitarium part as well. Chaos Comics had a Halloween series just before they went out of business. Issue #1 was all about Michael's years at the sanitarium, and that comic was far more creepy and interesting than this part of this movie. Fourth everything from Michael's escape from Smith's Grove to the last kill of the movie was incredibly rushed. This movie is 109 minutes long, the escape takes place at almost the one hour mark, and Michael has 12 victims to kill yet. That means Michael is going to have to kill one person every 3 minutes between now and the end of the movie. Three minutes is not enough time to develop any kind of suspense. The movie needs more suspense, ESPECIALLY during the final act. Either an extra 30 minutes needs to be added on the running time, or the body count has to go down.Fifth, make the main characters (in this case Laurie, Annie, and Lynda) like-able. Spend some time developing their personalities. Make us CARE that not all of them are going to survive this Halloween night. Sixth, add jump scares that actually make people JUMP. Seriously, I've seen Care Bear cartoons that were more frightening than this movie.I'm sure that there are several smaller changes that could have been made to improve this film. But these are the most serious. I never wanted a frame by frame remake of Halloween (like Psycho) but I was hoping for one that would recreate the same eerie feeling I had when I first saw the original, like The Shape could jump out from around any corner and attack me. Unfortunately, this movie failed to do so, and failed miserably.I understand what Rob Zombie was TRYING to do with Halloween. Unfortunately, his style of horror and Halloween are incompatible. He would be much better suited to trying another Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. I think that would be right up his alley.",Halloween
716,breakfree89,Don't be fooled by the comments,9,21 September 2008,"The only thing I hate is mindless cynicism, and most comments here show just that. They discard this movie just because it's a remake of the original, which I agree was a billion times better than this one. But that does not make this movie bad at all. Trust me, if this movie were called something else, the comments would have been WAY better.Rob Zombies attempt at the 1978 classic isn't bad at all. In fact, he just poured some more realism and I'll use a word I've seen in a comment, some more ""soul"" into Michael Myer's character. He explains the character a little better in this movie, but I'll not go into the details as I believe in writing spoiler-free comments that don't ruin the movie for you.All I am saying is, give this movie a chance. And don't watch it with a prejudiced mind set to hate it, please don't compare it to the original. Watch it as a movie in itself, and believe me you will like it. As far as I am concerned, the movie is excellent. Sure, it could've been better, but by all means, well done, Rob!",Halloween
717,EvilSimen,Flawed but Enjoyable.,9,1 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is a flawed but extremely enjoyable film about the life and death of Michael Myers. From start to finish the film never lets up with engaging us with Michael's psychology and personality. Michael as a child is something that no director has ever explored before, and in my book, Zombie did it extremely well. I loved the chemistry between Michael, His Mom and Dr. Loomis. The first half of the movie which set place in Michael's Childhood was probably highlight of the film and the most engaging because it was where Zombie's heart lied, and you could tell.The reason Halloween is flawed mainly comes from the fact that movie attempts to combined two separate movie ideas into one. The first movie it attempts is the origin of Michael myers leading up to the psychology of why he does what he does. The Film concludes in this section that Michael is not simply a product of his environment as much as he is a product of a child with a horrible psyche fused with a bad environment.The second and (less engaging) film it tried to be was a semi-direct copy of the original movie, starting from Michael's escape and leading up to the finale of the film with Laurie Strode. Thankfully, while this second half is lesser than the first, it is saved by the fact that the performances from Laurie, her friends, Dr. Loomis and Michael himself are all top notch. Laurie is incredibly like-able and I was incredibly happy with how Zombie wrote her. I also like how his writing style changed between who he was writing, definitely showing the difference between Michael's home life and Laurie's.However, what Zombie managed to accomplish was still a enjoyable and fun Halloween film. Probably the best Halloween film since the original, on par with Part 2. In the end, I'd say I'm glad that this film was given to someone like Zombie with a true vision of a movie, it's just unfortunate that he was torn between his own vision and trying to completely remake the original.",Halloween
718,chloehorror,Blew me away :D,10,30 July 2015,"This film is my favourite movie, words can't describe how much I honestly loved it! Zombie made such an amazing effort giving Myers a back story (Which is quite hard to do). To me, Zombie has taken John's Halloween and developed it a lot more by making the movie a little more sadistic and more uniquely him. (Zombie). Reflecting back into Michael's childhood made the film more understandable to anyone who is new to the Halloween movies. It's never easy creating a back story for a murderer which isn't to cliché' and not to overly used. Halloween is a movie that has more then one storyline, it all really depends which one you choose to follow. You have the 1978 Halloween directed by John Carpenter which has a completely different storyline to Rob Zombies Halloween (2007 and 2009) I could go on and on about this movie, I really cannot pick a fault with it! :)",Halloween
719,sdeelite,Michael Goes Zombie,6,1 September 2007,"My thoughts in a word or two: disappointing, but not a complete loss. I am a HUGE fan of the original...I think it's still as eerie to watch today as it was back then (and that's pretty hard to do), but it does hold up as one of the scariest movies ever. Needless to say it's one of my favorites, so I was a bit weary going in even though I have also enjoyed Rob's other films, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""Devil's Rejects."" He's trashy, tasteless, gory and over the top....and these qualities work well in those films.Cut to HIS version of Halloween (and I can't stress enough how the original and this version could not be more different), and he's basically bloodied, added a huger body count, rednecked, and trashified the film (not to mention taken out some famous key scenes). This didn't need to be done to such a legend of a film, which I personally think was always a cut above the rest simply BECAUSE it played with your mind and didn't have to resort to gratuitous murders, sex and blood to keep your attention (in fact there was really no blood at all in the original). There's a lot to be said for that. Sometimes suggestion is a lot scarier than being literal and Rob doesn't understand this concept. The fact that he didn't use more of that approach and at least try and tone down what he normally does even a little bit didn't sit well with me. I didn't like the childhood he gave Michael; especially since the original never even hinted at the broken home/red neck vibe (it was actually quite the opposite), and to be honest, it doesn't coincide with the image of that suburban neighborhood at all. I guess this type of plot can easily explain some of Michael's behavior, and that's why he went with it. It's also well within Zombie's comfort zone just looking at his other films.And I know....even Rob said not to compare this one with the orig....but it's really hard not to if you are a fan. Granted after the first 5 minutes you realize you won't be able to as it's almost an entirely different entity...but I just wish he hadn't handled it that way. I will give kudos for some cool direction in parts (though there was also some not so cool what is going on direction too), and at least having a back-story...only some of which was interesting and creative and lends more to the nature/nurture theory rather than the pure evil and cult theory of past Halloween films. It humanizes Michael, and that can be a good or bad thing depending on who you are. Musical score was great...includes some of the original theme as well as some new instrumentation which really works, and some great classic 70's rock songs as well.There are a few good death scenes and all of it is bloody but there are also way too many gratuitous deaths in a seriously short period of time...people you didn't care about or who really didn't have to die did, and usually in horrific ways. More importantly, I hardly cared about Laurie Strode at all, which is just plain wrong, because I should have given who she is. I am used to really rooting for Laurie (a la Jamie Lee Curtis whose performance is world's above Scout-Taylor Compton's), but there was also severe laziness in the character development dept. here, a major problem that can't be ignored. The main focus in this film really is Michael (who is the most fleshed out character, almost to a fault). In fact the Laurie in this movie doesn't even know who Michael is or that they are actually related...which really takes away from it. And, it dragged a bit which is weird for a Zombie film as they are usually pretty fast paced.Acting in the movie was okay....props to Malcolm McDowell, who is great, and did well with the Dr. Loomis character. The kid who played Michael (Daeg Faerch) was also really good and played the role with great intensity...I imagine it was hard for him with some of the scenes they had him do in the beginning. It does get pretty disturbing at times.I wouldn't necessarily recommend not seeing this movie but you have to go in KNOWING that this is no where near the greatness of the original and that really, the two movies are basically two different perspectives on a similar story....but not the same story. This is Rob Zombie's take on Halloween and what he interprets it to be for today's audience....not Rob Zombie's version of John Carpenter's Halloween. For those that haven't seen the original or who can easily separate the two, you'll probably like this film. I personally would much rather sit down and watch the original.",Halloween
720,jimmyandjohnny,"Such a disappointment, especially from Rob Zombie",1,8 September 2007,"Let me preface by saying that the original Halloween was one of my favorite slasher flicks. It was the original slasher flick, IMO. There was something sublimely terrifying about Michael in his silence, a huge contrast to the likes of, say, Freddy Kruger, for example. So, as you may imagine, I was anxiously awaiting this remake, especially in light of the association with Rob Zombie. Mr. Zombie did an excellent job designing some of the walk-throughs for Halloween Horror Nights at Universal, and I'm told his other movies were scary and well done.When I left this movie, I was feeling like I'd lost a friend! The movie spends entirely too much time on young Michael, who isn't the least bit frightening in that mask. All of the tension of the original has been replaced by bland predictability, which is sad. There are a couple of spots where they use the cheap scare tactics (loud, sudden noises, faces appearing behind you, etc) and they'll startle you to be certain, but the fear is gone from this version. It's like a cross between a slasher/comedy flick and a PSA for mental health.To be sure, we were so thoroughly disappointed in this movie, we asked the theater manager for our money back.",Halloween
721,georgechavez-68339,Don't compare this version of Halloween to the original,8,13 August 2018,Don't compare Rob Zombie's Halloween to John Carpenter's Halloween. First off if you watched Rob's previous films you'll understand his take on violence is over the top. This rendition of Michael Myers is alot different from Carpenter's. This Halloween shows why Michael became the evil menacing monster he always was. Were as John carpenter's halloween gives you no explanation on why Michael is so evil the only explanation we do get is from Dr. Loomis. Now from a logical standpoint there is some parts of the film that make no since but its easy to look past them. But it's a very different take on the story Michael Myers so don't compare it to the original. Rob Zombie's Halloween it is own movie and its a great movie just not for some.,Halloween
722,christmascookiemonster,Terrible,1,26 January 2018,"Rob Zombie might be able to direct but he can not wrote dialog. All of his characters all sounded like White Trash.

As if The Omen, The Fog, Black Christmas, etc, weren't enough (I would also mention The Hitcher here, but The Hitcher had Sophia Bush, so it's automatically worth seeing). Much like the new pseudo-Bond movie Casino Royale, the idea here was a ""re-imagining"" of an established mythology that completely contradicts the previous chapters of the series. And again like Casino Royale, some people are praising it as ""the best of the series"" when in fact they mean it is simply ""better than the previous film"" (Die Another Day, Halloween: Resurrection). If you want suspense, atmosphere and interesting characters, watch Halloween 1, 2, 4 or 7. If you want increased but not over-the-top violence and insights into Michael Myers' past, watch Halloween 5 or 6. If you want tiresome melodrama, mindless gore, unlikable characters and a pro-wrestler-like Michael slowly knocking them off, have a ball with this movie.

Now he's getting older and irritable he's getting scarier and scarier and by the time you see the 15 year later card he horrifying he's gigantic 6'7 around hes obviously muscular and he looks like with one hit you would be down dead. So when he escapes from the Sanitarium he goes to his old house finds his mask and that when the story of Laurie,Lynda, and Annie starts. he starts to stalk them and kill them........ and then ya know he kills them that's all good and then Laurie goes all Kung Fu on his ass and she shoot's him and he dies... or so we thing...dun dun dun.

726,mp234003,"This movie was awful, and here's why",1,8 February 2008,"Forgive the pun, but Rob Zombie really ""butchered"" this one. Awful, awful movie. I was totally disappointed. I really should have expected it because I generally don't like Rob Zombie's work, but I'm a huge fan of the original and I was holding out hope that this would be decent. Heck, Carpenter and Hill already wrote the original story, which is awesome, so how could Zombie go wrong? The answer...in almost every way possible. First of all, the writing in this movie may be the worst I've ever seen/heard. I don't mind cursing in movies, in fact I think it adds a real world feel to the film. However, curse words follow the same rules as any other word when it comes to film. They have to be used in a way that makes sense, they shouldn't be over used, they should fit into the flow of the film, and fit the theme/feel of the film. Zombie accomplished none of these. Excluding the needless f-bombs, the writing was still terrible. Secondly, Zombie didn't fully think through the idea of showing Michael Myers development into a killer. In Carpenters film, Myers is presented as an almost demon type entity, not even human. What Zombie truly accomplishes by showing so much of Myers as a child, is to humanize him, severely hurting how Michael Myers is viewed when he is slaughtering the young people of Haddonfield 17 years later. Michael doesn't come across as a blank minded killer when he was young (until he kills the nurse). He actually asks at one point how every one at home is, claiming that he didn't kill them, and apparently not remembering any of it. I think Zombie was trying to show that some evil force was taking over Michael, which is a good idea in theory but it doesn't work in practice because, once again, it humanizes Michael too much. Because of this humanization, Michael strikes me as a tragic figure instead of the spawn of all that is evil. Loomis called him a ""perfect storm"", created by internal and external factors beyond his control. I don't know if Zombie intended to portray Myers in this way or not, but it definitely doesn't work for me. For this film to work, Michael needs to be the pure evil being that he is in Carpenters film. At one point in the film I actually yelled at my television because of the stupidity I was witnessing. Dr. Loomis is talking to someone about Michael (Sheriff Brackett?) and talks about how when he met Michael, he had no understanding of good or evil, blah blah blah, etc. This is actually taken from the original, and it works in the original but not in this film. The main reason is because IT'S NOT TRUE! Michael is portrayed as a child who doesn't remember the crimes he committed when he first meets Loomis. He asks his mom if everyone at home is doing okay. This doesn't fit with Loomis' description of Michael when he first met him. Finally and most importantly,this movie has basically no build-up at all. The original was so great because Carpenter is a master of suspense and anticipation. Anyone who has seen Halloween or The Thing know this is true. The build-up to the murders provided the audience with a feeling that you're about to burst. You want to yell ""get the hell out of there, He's behind the window!"". There are virtually no moments like this in Zombie's film. The build up also allowed the audience to get closer with the individual characters and create an emotional investment. This means that the audience feels something when that character is murdered. Zombie didn't even make an attempt to do this, obviously felling that quick cuts with hoke sound effects were a better option. The result is a second half of the film that is all over the place, featuring the quick deaths of characters that the audience has had virtually zero chance to become involved with. It is totally devoid of any type of suspense or anticipation. Quick cuts and loud sound effects can only hold an audiences attention for so long until they realize the lack of other storytelling elements that are extremely important to making a solid horror film, such as anticipation, and the character-audience relationship. This isn't to say that quick cutting and loud sound effects can't be used effectively, but, in my opinion, the other storytelling devices must be present as well. John Carpenter does with three shots what Zombie can't do with 1000. This is because he understands how important those devices are. All in all, a terrible film and a terrible effort.",Halloween
727,eveadinafranck,Good horror movie,9,14 December 2018,"Not sure how it doesn't have better ratings. The acting is good, it has a great story line and awesome character development. It's brutal, yes... But it is a horror movie after all.",Halloween
728,Horror-Lord,The dirty bunch of Philistines!,3,2 November 2007,"OK, where do I begin? I'll start by stating the obvious- why in the holy name of God did they have to go and remake a classic horror film- one of the few remaining classic horror films I might add- such as Halloween and, more importantly, place it in the hands of the egotistical maniac that is Rob Zombie? I'll tell you why- because the executives at Hollywood HQ have run out of ideas and, rather than try and save the failing franchise that Halloween has become thanks to the ever ridiculous Halloween: Resurrection and it's predecessor, Halloween H20, they decide to start (and, ultimately end) from scratch with one of the most diabolically, catastrophically awful films I have ever allowed my poor little eyes to witness. Now, of course, it would be harsh to criticise every little thing- for example, the music was good (oh wait, that was a John Carpenter creation so that doesn't really count) and even though the first section of the film, in which we delved a little more into Michael's childhood than the original did, was interesting, it all seemed so very rushed and disorganised. Then came the second section in which we met Laurie Strode and boy oh boy do we all miss Jamie Lee Curtis now? What were the Philistines thinking when they cast her? Laurie was turned from the innocent, pure and ultimately defenceless girl of Carpenter's classic into what could be described as an unpaid prostitute- the character was ruined! Then, don't even get me started on Loomis. As soon as this film was confirmed- sequel, remake or both- a Halloween film without Donald Pleasance as Loomis is not a Halloween film- he will never be surpassed- the character was made for him! And Malcolm McDowell, through no real fault of his own as it was all Zombie's idea, took the character to a level of incredulity and ridiculousness that even I couldn't comprehend, regardless of the fact that the rest of the film was utter garbage. So, in conclusion, if you haven't guessed it already, I am a little bit annoyed that they couldn't even be bothered to try and round the series off with a 9th film that tied all of the events of 1, 2, 7 + 8 with 4, 5 + 6 to finish it and let it rest in peace.

This rob zombie remake of the 1979 classic takes the original plot of an really messes it up; Michael was supposed to be pure evil with no emotions, in this remake, Michael is a child raised by a terrible family who gets picked on by everyone and kills people in a fit of rage. Even though I still think the original is better, I still think that the remake does a better job making Michael more intimidating explaining how he escaped. The characters in this movie are really forgettable and really mess up who Laurie is supposed to be; pure innocence. I also highly reccomend the theatrical cut more than the director's cut for this movie if you can find a copy of that. In conclusion: this movie is alot of fun to watch but if you want to critique this movie it's not great, just watch the movie and enjoy the action. That is why I love this movie and I believe it gets too much unnessary hate.",Halloween

732,primogen18,"Better Then Most Modern Slashers, Not As Good As The Original",7,1 September 2007,"Just got back from checking out Rob Zombie's vision of ""Halloween"", and I must say it was everything I pretty much expected. A ""new"" version with upgraded nudity, upgraded violence, and of course upgraded gore, along with a few changes here and there. Being a fan of the original, I must say this one isn't nearly as good as that ""classic"".It was interesting seeing more of Michael or well more of Michael as a child. I own the extended cut of the original which adds a glimpse more of Michael when he was young, but not much. Of course it seemed very cliché, and although I think it was interesting, it didn't really add much as I prefer the mystery that surrounds the original (and actually the ""cult"" explanation in the rarely seen Halloween 666/Origin of Michael Myers, which is the better version of the 6th Halloween film IMO) Of course in a remake, there's always buckets more of kyro, which I guess were necessary for today's horror slashers, but I again prefer the original where barely a drop is shown but you still get the point. It's not that it was overdone, I think it was very well done and there were some pretty gruesome moments, but as the original shows it doesn't make the movie. Among the added gore and scenes, a few changes were made here and there, yet some scenes seemed exactly as they were in the original. You see Laurie as a baby, when Michael first kills his sister (and other family shown in the newer version not seen in the original), Michael spares her and genuinely seems to care for her. During the ending chase when Michael catches up to Laurie, it is added that instead of trying to kill her, he takes out a photograph of him holding her when she was a baby (of course she does not understand after seeing her friends butchered and attacks him to protect herself), but we never find out what he really wants, I am actually curious and liked this inclusion that perhaps Michael really wasn't completely evil.Overall it's a decent flick on it's own, and a lot better then most of the ""newer"" slashers Hollywood chucks at us today, but IMO it doesn't top the original. Rob Zombies version doesn't change much in terms of the basic plot, and I enjoyed his inclusion of more peaks into Michaels past (and heart?)",Halloween
733,pawsha57,"A pointless, messy insult........",2,1 December 2007,"Rob Zombie should really be ashamed to have directed this sloppy, unfocused piece of trash. What a disgrace to John Carpenter's classic. Daeg Faerch as young Michael is, amazingly, much scarier than anything else here. Faerch's performance is one of the only things I enjoyed about the film and maybe he'll get a lot of deserved work because of it. He's a real talent. Everything else felt flat. The writing especially. Even Malcom Mcdowell was underwhelming as Dr. Loomis(though no one can replace Pleasence so that may not be his fault). And aside from Danielle Harris, where the hell did Zombo find these chicks? Since when does Lynda cuss every 2 seconds? Totally distracting and unnecessary. And Scout Taylor Hampton does not have the presence or acting chops to replace JLC for a second. To be honest, she was the film's most forgettable character. And I'm sorry, but did we need that many cameos? Come on, it's just one movie, that many familiar faces in little walk-on parts really took me out of the film. Oh, and did I mention how goofy Tyler Mane looked playing Michael? He's not supposed to be a giant folks. Part of what made the original so scary was that he looked like an average man. He could be anybody. Here he looks like the Guiness book of world records biggest serial killer. I didn't buy any of it and I can't believe this thing was made. The only thing I'm glad about is that this little footnote will be quickly forgotten and the original will continue to live on.",Halloween
734,mjcarney_00,"Not awful, but unnecessary and not awesome either",5,6 September 2007,"Overall, an OK movie, but far and away worse than the original. Still better than many of the other sequels in this series or in horror movie genres.....but the adds/changes in this movie do more to highlight the originals genius than to supplement/improve upon it.From the start, the movie seeks change: it spends time giving us a story to build Michael Myers' character, this intro is spliced up so much without really any memorable continuity, that ultimately all we know is that Michael's family is a bit messed up, we don't really know how long Michael's snapped, or what happened, we just know he's bad from the start, even if he seems to have an innocent smile......ultimately there seems to be no point in the beginning of the movie, other than to have it say ""I'm different from the original"". I walked away from this thinking, well I know Zombie wants us to think the Boogeyman was formed from nurture rather than nature (chance)....and I think right there, he missed the point. I know in Halloween II they informed us that Michael was after his sister Laurie Strode, but I always felt that that was more a means to carry the series on, rather than a nice thing to add to Halloween (which is something Zombie really focused on in this remake)--I mean how did he know from the start that Strode was his sister?. I liked in the original that Michael just inexplicably picks on Jamie Lee Curtis and her group of friends....it adds quite a bit more terror to the whole thing, rather than just have him show up in town and immediately know who was his sister...this was something that was flawed/forced in Halloween 2. I also like in the original that it seems (while this is totally my take on it since nothing is really explained) that Michael was ultimately a good little kid who was left home to be watched by his sister while he parents went out, and he killed his sister and then stopped talking entirely. I think the movie lost a bit of its horror factor when you think Michael was in a house with trashy folks who helped helm him into the monster....and while either scenario is impossible (an unkillable boogie man can never be real) it's a shame that it seems this can only happen to a kid who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks.....whereas the original made it seem like this just happened to a good kid and was shocking to his folks.I also don't like that Laurie Strode's character has gone from a virginal good girl to someone who is still relatively good (and without a boyfriend) but someone who is more experienced (and prettier) than Curtis' character. There isn't that development either of any of the 3 girl characters in this movie, and all 3 of them seem much less fictitious and much more real, which is a shame, because I enjoy the whole exaggerated personalities of all 3 of them in the original.Plus, the new Annie (Jamie from earlier Halloween's) has none of the charm of the old Annie (and they cut the entire washing room scene-terror), and PJ Sole's sexiness is sorely missed.Finally, to cut this short a bit for things I didn't like that much, I really like the closet scene and the scenes where the viewer thinks Michael is dead only to see him pop back in the wide screen background (especially the end where Carpenter's version shows Michaels body has disappeared and points to dark corners as if to say he could be anywhere, he's the bogeyman.....that's not as explored here (nor is the character development of the hero (Strode in the remake). Overall on the good side the movie has it's share of creepiness and a bit too much gore, Malcolm McDonell (I believe his name is right--the clockwork orange guy) does a very very good Pleasance clone in this movie, which is nice. I left the movie with a weird sense of terror, but it was different from the more cartoonish terror of the original (Something these modern horror movies are lacking).On the negatives--the early childhood/mental institution stuff doesn't really add much to the story other than to make the remake a bit interesting. Zombie is hardly the director that Carpenter is (no wide screen shots (VERY KEY to the success of the original), few shots of Michael suddenly appearing from nowhere), no build up of the characters besides maybe Michael (but even he was focused on but the viewer still knew very little about him), the cut of the entire washing room scene, and the fact that the new Laurie Strode while not a terrible actress has none of the heart that Jamie Lee Curtis added to the original.I've run into word limits with this comment which is why it's very haphazard/discombobulated. It would have been easier to just rewrite, but oh well I've spent far too much time already.......sorry about that but basically the quick summary:Good shock moments, decent acting (though not as good as the original, as Jamie Lee Curtis is sorely missed); the character development in this remake isn't really there (we know these characters mainly because of the original, not really because of what Zombie has shown). THe Michael Myers youth scenes make it interesting, but are ultimately useless and don't really answer anything or accurately let us understand a ""why"" or really even a ""how"" Myers became what he became. Finally Zombie's got a long way to hit the highs that Carpenter can hit in his best work (like the original) But for it's creepiness this movie's not awful, just not great. A 5/10, worth a watch for Halloween/horror fans, but hardly a masterpiece.",Halloween
735,Andrew_The_Narrator,"Good Remake, not great.",7,27 December 2007,"In a world full of horror movie remakes, only three of them were good enough for me to give above a 5 out of 10. Those three are Dawn of the Dead (2004), Halloween (2007), and john Carpenter's The Thing.The film begins with a young Micheal killing one of his pet rats, then finds him being suspended from school for fighting, then killing his bully. Then on Halloween night he proceeds to tape his mothers boyfriend to his recliner and slice his throat, then beat his sister's boyfriend to death with a bat. He then walks upstairs to his sister's room (while she's listening to B.O.C's Don't Fear the Reaper) and stabs her repeatedly. He leaves his baby sister (Laurie) to live and his mother finds him and what has happened inside her home. We see him being taken away to Smith's Grove and meeting Dr.Loomis (excellently played by Malcom Mcdowell). He seems to be responding to his therapy, but does not remember doing the killing. then things turn for the worst: he becomes violent and stops talking.We jump 15 years ahead. Two orderlies take one of the girls out of her room into Micheals and rape her. Micheal kills the two orderlies and escapes. Steals a truckers clothes and goes on a killing rampage to get to his sister.I don't want to say any more so i don't spoil anything, so i'll get down to the review: The first 45 mins are the best in the movie (shows the psychology of a killer), but after that it starts going down hill. the movie was saved by 2 factors: It's Director and Malcom McDowell.If you're a fan of Rob Zombie, I highly suggest you see this film. If you're a fan of the original I suggest you watch the first 45 mins then watch the original from when we pick up on Laurie Strode (I forget exactly where in the film, it's been awhile).I give this film a 7/10. The first 45 mins are great, but when we pick up 15 years later it starts going down hill (Except for Malcoms's performance:)). It falls into the slasher killer stereotypes that all too many movies nowadays fall into.",Halloween
736,milsurf,A Horror Classic ReVisited By a Disturbed Director...and it works!!,10,31 August 2007,"I first have to say that Carpenter's Halloween had me literally running home from the theater back in '79. It was one of those movies that just made me become the film buff, movie lover that I am today...and no I am not a horror only film nut. I love all genres.Rob Zombie's obviously has his own ""sick"" style. 1,000 Corpses & Rejects are movies that I actually love, but I feel sick about the fact that I like them. They are demented, and not in the ""fun"" way that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was but...really demented! In Rejects I still can't understand how an actress like Priscilla ""3's Company"" Barnes would be anywhere near that film? But her and the other actors do their best to bring out his deranged vision.Well Zombie's Halloween Remake I feel is an instant horror classic! The first half hour or so is so demented, dark, disturbing, and just shows an overall sick, scum-ridden family...that you can ""almost"" see why Myers is such a psycho. At one point I even felt sorry for him.After Zombie sets up this deranged childhood life he basically goes right into Haddonfield John Carpenter style. The atmosphere, the music of course, the dialog, the scares..and above all the pace. It just keeps going. And actually has a few great scares! I really hope Rob Zombie continues his horror run and keeps up the ""fun"". Having so many of ""his"" actors in his films make them funny and almost drags you away from how sick they are (which I feel I need sometimes when watching). Bill Moseley is a nut-case, Sid Haig and Ken Foree rock, and what the hell Mrs Zombie is HOT.Go see it!",Halloween
737,alucard617,Pure evil turns into anti-hero,3,21 October 2007,"First of all, as a movie in general I though was less than average. As a remake, it was *beep* horrible. People will always say, ""Oh this is a different movie, not the original, don't compare."" It's a remake, how could you not *beep* compare First, I always had a problem with a back-story, Michael was pure evil without one. Michael was so evil because he had no reason to kill, he just did. He was pure evil in human form, there was no rhyme or reason for what he did. Okay, a back-story doesn't have to be terrible, but it answers nothing.People say that this answers the question that had lurked in everyone's mind since the first 10 minutes of the original ""Why is Michael the way he is."" No it doesn't, at least not under the circumstances presented in the original. In that one, Michael has a nice and clean home with two well kept and fitting looking parents and a sister that seemed horny, but not a slut. In this one, the father is mysteriously dead and a filthy white trash piece of *beep* who has no respect for women, especially two very attractive ones, takes his place. The house is a decrepit place, the mother is a stripper, and it seems to be a white trash haven. Anyone can give a reason for Michael's rage in this way, just throw everything that was presented to the table in the original and put unoriginal stuff on it. The back-story itself is unoriginal and stupid.The first 5 minutes already answer the question to Michael's rage, it's not drawing us in. Imagine the back-story starts with two clean and nice parents who are loving and in a nice home. That would be better because the audience will be engrossed with all these questions; ""Whoa, what the hell, his life seems pretty nice. I wonder what will happen to make him evil."" That is original and gets the audience interested right away because Myer's life seems perfect, but then an event happens and so on. In the remake, it looks like someone watched a documentary on serial killers and threw it in the movie. It's not original or new; it's used and boring. I wanted something that really surprises the audience about Michael and answers the question on his rage under the same circumstances as in the original, but in an unsuspecting and surprising manner.All right, now for my biggest complaint in character development; Loomis. I remember in the original Loomis was a take charge type of guy who showed no mercy when he tried to find Michael. He never hesitated or gave up a chance to kill Michael because he knew he was pure evil. Loomis in this one calls Michael his best friend and is sympathetic to him. Then the next scene he is calling him pure evil and the anti-Christ. WTF. If Loomis thinks Michael is pure evil, why does he try to negotiate with him, hesitates to shoot him, and is remorseful towards him. The original had Loomis never resting till he found his evil patient. This one, he wastes time talking about his book and other crap. Especially in this one, Loomis should be more eager than ever since Michael kills 5 people as opposed to 1 as a child. People will say this Loomis is so much more caring and polite. Lets think for a second.; Loomis has spent 15 years of his life trying to get through Michael. He soon realizes Michael is pure evil and tries to get him transferred; People think he's an idiot and what happens? Myers escapes and they blame the whole thing on him. Would you be *beep* polite after all that and now you have a murderer on the loose and only you know how he works? I sure hell as wouldn't. Loomis in the original was more realistic, knew what he was dealing with, and took every chance he had to kill Myers before he kills anyone else.Now let's look at the slasher himself; Michael Myers. They took a true and pure evil villain who tortured and murdered his whole family and made him into a sympathetic anti-hero who only wants to be with his sister Laurie. Michael never tries to kill Laurie in this one, at least not in general circumstances. Instead, he tries to be with her. Michael used to be a villain who stabbed and tried to strangle his sister, but now he's just a loving, but murderous, brother. The only times where he appears to want to kill her are times when he's reacting in anger, not evil. Michael used to be the villain everyone was rooting for to be killed: I still love the scene where Loomis shoots the hell out of Michael in the original. This one, Michael is not evil at all, just some misguided fool. I can't watch this feeling sorry for the villain.The movie itself is used and boring; the stuff used from the original is rushed and a cheap knockoff in this one. The murders are rushed and someone gets killed every 2 seconds. My favorite kill in the first one was when Michael strangled to girl with the phone line because it looked so painful when she was gasping for air. This one, he just grabs and her and 2 seconds later she's dead. The murders and stabbing sounds are fake looking and sounding and the gore is way too exaggerated. One person gets stabbed one and then there are oceans of blood. This movie was not scary in any shape or form and it ruined the image of Myers. No longer is he pure evil, but a misguided and sympathetic fool who just wants love. By the end of the movie, I had to watch the original to chafe the bad taste in my stomach from this one.",Halloween
738,btl14,Excellent modernization of a classic tale.,8,31 August 2007,"Let me start off by saying I have been waiting for this movie since June of '06 when it was announced. Ever since I got into the Halloween series, I have been waiting anxiously to see Michael on the big screen again. And let me tell you, my first Halloween theater experience was a great one! All I have been hearing for the past week was negative after negative comments. But of course, I had been waiting for this and I wasn't going to let a little rain ruin my picnic. So I went in with little to no expectations and I was blown away! I honestly don't understand why this movie is getting trashed the way it is.We start off on Halloween, when Michael Myers is 10 years old. He gets bullied and teased by kids at school and by his trailer-trash step-father and his slutty sister. His stripper mom tries to make an effort but it does no good. Michael takes out his anger on a school bully, and then goes home to be tormented more, which takes him over the top and he decides to just end it. This part of the film was very entertaining and it was actually pretty funny, until he started killing people.Next Michael is brought into Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he shows no progress, and offs a snooty nurse while left alone with her. This was a unique and interesting twist added onto this movie that we never got to see in John Carpenters Halloween, which I will address later.We fast forward 15 years, and we learn that Michael hasn't spoken since the day he killed the nurse. While being transported for an unknown reason, Michael breaks free from his chains and escapes Smith's Grove, to return to his home town.Now we are treading on John Carpenter's Halloween, but it still gives a unique twist on things and really should not be compared to it, even though it is a remake.I give this 8/10 Stars. This movie was made for today's audiences, since John Carpenter's lacks in action and violence, which is what today's society calls for. Both Films are great in their own ways, and I feel it is wrong to try to compare the two, considering they differ enormously.",Halloween
739,jordanpiche,Great retelling of one the greatest slasher ever made.,8,30 October 2020,"In my opinion, all the hate comes from people who formed the opinion before they watched it. Their love for the original makes any predisposed opinion biased. Halloween(1978) is so beloved by so many because it's a great film, it i delivers better than any in its genre, ever. I truly believe that. Halloween(2007) is original though, I go back to my original statement, it's more of a retelling than a remake. I have always had a hate love relationship with Rob Zombie. I love his music, see him live and it sucks, SOME of his movies are awesome, some are Beyond bad. Halloween(2007) is refreshing take on the shape and it delivers with music, sets, Tarantino esc forgotten actors of yesteryear and great horror!

740,kohan_faramarz,when there is no motive it's a lot scarier,5,10 November 2007,"There is a certain rule in slasher genre which was pointed in Wes Craven's SCREAM too(when there is no motive it's a lot scarier)a rule which Rob Zombie has broken in his remake of John Carpenter's HOLLOWEEN.The monsters in horror movies are a lot more scarier when we don't know where do they have come from or why do they kill.Like Billy Loomis said in scream(They never found out why Hanibal Lector liked to eat people).But in this HOLLOWEEN,Zombie has given us some stupid motives. Michael Myers starts killing people because his mother is a stripper, his stepfather is a drunk and his sister is a slut.And worse than that,Zombie spends the first 45 minuets of the movie on the killer's childhood. Getting to know the main character and giving reasons for their actions is a good thing but not in a slasher movie like HALLOWEEN where the main character is the monster itself. If you want to see a good character study thriller you better see HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER or MR BROOKS.Zombie had a unique style for scaring the audience in his previous films DEVIL'S REJECTS and HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES,he used blood,violence,disturbing dialogs and some very disturbing images to make the audience uncomfortable,and the result was very good,and John Carpenter used suspense and music to make his HOLLOWEEN scary,but the 2007 HALLOWEEN is somewhere in between and the result is not good at all.Finally,remaking the best slasher movie of all time was a big opportunity,an opportunity which Rob Zombie missed.I wish this opportunity had been given to a director like Alexandre Aja.",Halloween
741,extrabasemm,Total garbage,1,12 October 2007,"Rob Zombie should stick to making bad music rather than bad movies. He was stupid enough to try and remake a classic and ends up with the worst movie of 2007. He shouldn't have even been allowed to call his movie ""Halloween"", it's such an embarrassment.The point of a horror movie is to scare the audience. This movie contains virtually no scares. The real horror in this movie is that it takes almost 2 hours to play out.Zombies ""new angle"" of creating a background for Michael Myers murderous behavior is so boring and unimaginative and get the movie off to such a slow start that you lose interest pretty quickly.

The movie starts out kind of interesting with the childhood of Michael Myers but the acting is just terrible. Can anybody act in this movie at all? The only real actor is Malcolm McDowell and he seemed kind of off. Which means that's there's no one else to blame except the director because Malcolm McDowell is a top notch actor. The movie is just littered with cut rate actors who's just a couple of steps above porn stars. They're all Ginger Lynns. They can be in a thousands films but still can't figure out how to act. Zombie even puts his daughter in the movie. Goodness, she stinks. What the hell is this? A high school play? And there's no explanation as to how Michael Myers all of the sudden gained supernatural strength almost. Unlike Jason who turns out to be supernatural, the story follows him through his early years inside a mental institution. The overall sloppiness is just annoying. Rob Zombie is such an idiot who will always be a B-Movie director. Maybe Zombie should just step up to grade A porn...you know, the kind with a story and a set that's not a hotel room.",Halloween

He had also murdered a bully at school, for making fun of him because his mother was a stripper. The only people Michael did not murder in his family, and truly cared for was his mother, and his baby sister, whom he called Boo.

745,BarkerProductions,A Pure Horror Film!!,8,1 October 2007,"I am a HUGE fan of Halloween, as the original is my all time favorite. i loved the First movie because of the stalking element made it chilling and the storyline was simple, no complications what-so-ever. when the sequels were churned out, i was never disappointed as i believe them to be pure horror fun, especially Halloween 4, which is totally underrated and also Halloween 3, which could easily shyed away from being some kind of sequel and be good on it's own. Anyway, i had HIGh expectations for this movie, ages before it came out, and i don't know whether a lot of people who are being negative towards it dint go into the film with a right mind, because it clearly stated the movie was a NEW VISION of Halloween, which is slightly different to a REMAKE.The film only took certain key elements from the original and turned them into something different, which was cool. The film was pretty much split into two! with Micheals Childhood and the breed of a monster, then moving onto Laurie and her friends getting killed! I thought the Movie was Brave and attempted to shock the audience with its brutality and sheer nastiness instead of popcorn shocks and scares.I enjoyed it, even if it did make me feel a little uncomfortable at times ( eg. Annie's death scene, was one shot away from becoming attempted rape! ) but Rob Zombie is clearly a talented director within his field, i couldn't see him making a comedy or a musical, even a drama really, but with horror, he is causing a stir, which isn't going unnoticed! The Plot was well spaced out, and the second half, with Laurie and the girls wasn't drawn out too much. Because the original was a slow burner, this was an instant explosion, and kept you entertained throughout Loomis was played brilliantly and differently by McDowell and you kind of began to believe that maybe this could happen, by the way his and Micheals relationship evolves.I give this movie an 8 out of 10, and it's purely for the horror fanatics who go in with an open mind and in some sense pretend it's a brand new original idea!",Halloween
746,PunkAtHeart,"Good, but not...",5,6 September 2009,"OK, I love Rob Zombie's idea of remaking Halloween, it is a good horror flick. All the necessities; teens, tits and blood. I'm glad he is not trying to remake a horror classic viewable for PG+ audiences and sticking with an R rating. The photography, color and lighting is great for a horror flick. I also love the fact that there is a little more background on Michael Meyers.The biggest disappointment I have with Zombie's remake of Halloween is pretty much the same complaint I have of all his movies. Most of America is NOT white trash. Michael Meyers is scary (in the original film) BECAUSE he comes from the everyday-middle-class family. The fact that he came from a family that is such white trash with the horrible language and a stripper mom just makes him much less terrifying. It's a little scarier to think that the boy-next-door could turn into the devil.My other complaint is how he portrays the rest of the town as complete morons. Does Mr. Zombie really think America is full of stupid people? I guess it does make it a little more realistic if a town full of idiots were being massacred, but wouldn't it be a little more frightening if it was everyday people being attacked? Where a madman is such a good monster that he can survive and massacre an entire town, with smart people in it? Like one of the small towns in Illinois where the story is supposed to take place?? I still look forward to seeing more of his stuff, but for crying out loud - stop making your killers AND victims such white trash. Make them a little more realistic. And if Mr. Zombie thinks America is full of white trash, maybe he should move to a new neighborhood ot at least travel to some more ""average"" America towns for some research.",Halloween
747,johnwallen1969,Zombie's Halloween remake gritty and satisfying,7,31 August 2007,"First let me say that I am huge fan of the original movie. When I first saw it way back when I was home alone, waiting for my folks to return from there outing, it was October, enough said. The original John Carpenter/Debra Hill Hallowe'en is a classic and always will be. I had my misgivings about a remake especially after the piece of garbage remake of the Fog. When a story is handed to you on a silver platter and you still manage to mess it up, well what can you say. Then I discovered that Rob Zombie was at the Helm of the Hallowe'en remake and slowly but surely fantastic images of his imagining were circulating. The casting seemed to be inspired and the visualizations looked gritty and dementedly inviting. I soon had high hopes. Now when the movie started my hopes started to deflate as I felt the portrayal of the Meyers family as white trash a-holes who deserved pretty much what they got was over the top and ridiculous. In the original the Meyers were a nice middle class family completely taken by surprise by their son's sudden murderous nature. We do not know why Michael chose to butcher his sister nor does it really matter adding to the mystery and suspense. The back story that Zombie spins is a little trite and doesn't really add much to the Michael Myer's lore. Still the gritty nature of the film is a visual feast of brutality. Young Michael is creepy to watch and the off kilter camera angles help to add to the horror. In terms of acting, the cast really does a good job with there perspective characters, sadly though Malcom Mcdowell as Dr. Loomis seems a bit watered down compared to Donald Pleasance from the original series, still McDowell does fit nicely with the re-imagining. Except for one piece of unfortunate dialogue, Scout Taylor Compton as Laurie would make Jamie Lee Curtis proud. I was glad to see that Zombie mixed the killings up a bit and made me feel some of the suspense that I felt when seeing the original for the first time. While He did not capture the Meyers family very well, Zombie got the rest of the character right. Tyler Mane is a great Shape, and what fun using Danielle Harris (from Hallowe'en 4&5) in a different role, in fact it might have been nice to see some other alumni playing other characters. Die hard Hallowe'en fans will be all over the map on this retelling and will either love it or hate it, I preferred the original escape to Zombies vision and lamented the fact that Loomis sort of just appears in Haddonfield rather than following Michael's bloody trail from Smith Groves. However with the great juxtaposing of music against scenes of violence Zombie did make a well crafted slasher flick with fun cameos from his other movies while keeping the original story basically in tact. I think that most of the criticism will be like comparing Coke to Pepsi, you may prefer one to the other but either way they are both darn fine drinks that nicely quench your thirst.",Halloween

I was impressed with the Texas Chainsaw remakes and the Hitcher remake, but this remake is mindless, boring and strips Michael Myers of any suspense, mystery and character. The beginning backstory is not bad, but the red-neck myers family is a bad portrayal. Myers mother is a stripper and his step-dad (?) is an abusive cripple who curses for the first twenty minutes of the flick. THe boy who plays myers does a good job and it's interesting how Zombie works in Michaels fascination/devotion to wearing a Halloween mask. Dr. Loomis comes into the picture and tries to counsel Michael through a long phase in the institution and it comes off fairly well. And Dr. Loomis is very well played by Malcolm McDowell, that old chap from A Clockwork Orange. After killing about twelve people, we move to the present where Michael is after his sister Laurie, whom he had a strong connection to as a child and thus spared her the slaughter. Now here's where the movie really starts to blow. You see Michael about every ten minutes and there's nothing suspenseful about him. He's just hanging around, stalking his sister. None of the bush scenes or laundry line scenes like the original. Nope, he's just standing there across the street in broad daylight watching these gals. It's extremely stupid, trust me. Then all of a sudden, it's night time and people are getting offed left and right with really boring builds up to the scenes. It's middle is anti-climactic in that you really don't care who gets killed and thus are stripped of any tension. The chase scenes are redundant and dry, too much of the same over and over again. There's no good scares that would make anyone 'jump' and those who may have rooted for Michael in the other films will be yawning by his lack of intelligence or depth. Imagine a pro-wrestler in the myers get-up and you've got the modern Michael, a mindless, almost Jason-like stupidity of a killer with little to no content and absolutely no style, unless of course you factor in the killing methods. I suppose movies these days are too controlled by producers who think the entire film-going community wants Saw-like shocking gore and not a decent script, meaningful characters and modern icons of horror. Save your cash if you can resist the temptation, but rent it when it comes out, because there are a few, and I truly mean few, good moments. Poor, poor Michael.

It's a pure horror movie with horror elements like gore(blood), graphic killings, zombie/monster on rampage,teenagers as victims, nudity, shooting a killer many times before he dies etc. Carpenter's movie is more of a quality movie. It relies on plot, script, and other ""movie"" elements with the right amount of ""horror"" elements. Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis had a better script.

752,darthwizard13,"Great movie, one remake that will be a classic one day.",10,3 January 2008,"I thought RZ's Halloween was a fantastic adaption to a classic horror film. This was definitely a remake that was well thought out instead of just re-shooting scenes with different actors. RZ directed this perfectly, I don't think John Carpenter would of let RZ do this if he didn't think he would do a good job. The prequel part was amazingly well thought out and explains everything you didn't know about Michael Myers' path to madness. RZ also went to the extreme with gore. Almost all the killings were filled with grizzly violence and gruesome shots of the victim. The remake part was a lot better in my opinion than that of the original. RZ really made Michael Myers look like what a psychopath looks like. In Carpenters version, Michael is to well groomed. In RZ he has tattered clothes and robes, wood tied to his dirty feet with rags, long greasy gray hair and the most terrifying paper mache mask I've every seen. Even when he gets his new threads he is scary. The coveralls are brown and dirty and covered in blood from it's previous owner(Joe Grizzly). The William Shatner Mask a.k.a ""The Shape Mask"" is a lot more detailed than just a plain old white mask. It's brownish-yellow, dirty and rotten. The kitchen knife is old, rusty, bent up and sharp.RZ also changed the fact that Myers can't drive. But in one scene we actually see him run abit. I think that you will definitely see a difference in the remake part. It is nothing like the original at all. The original is more suspenseful and gives you the ""cover your eyes cause you don't know whats gonna happen next even though you've seen it ten times"" feeling while RZ version is much more gruesome and explicit and gives you the ""cover your eyes cause this is the most goreyest movie I've ever seen"" feeling.All in all this was a great movie. The only problem I have with it is the extreme use of language and especially the ""F"" word used throughout the film. But other than that... I don't say this much but... this was the greatest horror movie I've seen in a long time. Watch it or not,The choice is yours.",Halloween
753,cr114,"Decent, but not what expected",6,12 January 2008,"I have been a fan of the Halloween series ever since I was twelve years old. A friend and I rented Halloween 1, all the way through H20 and watched them all in one sitting. I was looking forward to this release, but it's nothing that made me too excited once I saw it. I do like the spin that Rob Zombie put on the film and Michael's youth, but I think there was almost too much emphasis on it. Some of the acting was poor, and the gore was overdone in some parts. Let's be honest, Halloween was so scary for it's time, not because of any blood factor, but because of the presence of the shape, the music and the acting.Overall, I did enjoy it, and probably the most fun part about watching this film was being able to compare parts to the original.Enjoy",Halloween
754,masterch497,hmm... I think he missed the point...,1,8 February 2008,"Being an enthusiastic fan of the original Halloween, I was shocked to see the Rob Zombie Obliteration which he calls a re-make.The film started promisingly creepy. It begins with Michael Myers killing pet mice to the sounds of the monster mash, which i saw as a great substitute for the Mr sandman soundtrack of the original. Then we are introduced to his family, in the original film Myers seemingly had quite a normal family who we are not really introduced to, so the murder of his sister is all the more disorienting. In this Rob Zombie take on it he makes us want them all dead, ""go on Mikey kill 'em all, slice that b*tch up"", i think the aim is to show that if your dad's a cripple and your mum's a stripper then murder is good for the stress.Next widdle Mikey gets bullied at school because of his mum being a stripper, so when a teacher tries to help him he figures: i think i'll swear at this guy. It was at this point in the film i recognized where i knew the young Michael Myers from, and it just goes to show that Hanson haven't changed one bit. He then takes the bully out into the woods and kills him with a big stick, but that's OK, the guy was a bully, so good on you Michael.The film continues to out-kill it's original only 45 minutes in. My favourite part of the movie then came where Myers stopped talking forever with the words: ""Then i have nothing more to say.""15 Years later and guess what, people are still mean. But don't worry, just like Batman, Psychoaths are still out there to save us all. Some men try to rape a fellow inmate of his (because that's where all the rapists apply for their work) so the justice arrives. You might be thinking the same as me, that Michael is out numbered! So just how can he win?? Well since he stopped talking he apparently developed an addiction to steroids and pro wrestling training.So all of the awe and wonder and basic horror of the original film has been replaced with cheap, gore mongering thriller techniques designed to try and deny the existence of bad people, only show the consequences of bad circumstance and upbringing.Also despite a decent effort by Malcolm McDowell the script fails him, destroying infamous lines and replacing them with things like: ""These, are, the, eyes, of a psychopath"" and ""As a matter of fact, I DO BELIEVE, it was"" All together this film has no right ever having been made, as not only does it embarrass the original, but in pure Rob Zombie fashion it shows that murderers deserve our sympathy, because they're all doing the right thing really.",Halloween
755,mr-blue-skies,Disappointed !,3,16 May 2008,"The Beginning shows a very different take on Michael's life which is very interesting, but is disgusting and i'm not talking about the killings.It's eerie but while the beginning is interesting and good the final sequence seems rushed and provides few scares, and the scares that do happen can be spotted.I think that they should of spent less time on his school life than on the killings of Bob, Annie, Lynda and Paul like in the original.I Like the way they have shot it but it ruins the ideas the original film imprinted in my mind, which may be good but i don't know.This Film Seems too ahead of it's time.Don't bother watching watching this version, watch the original!",Halloween
756,oskar-jungell,He added the flesh on the bones!,10,17 June 2008,"In my experience, the Halloween series was always a little too shallow for my taste, it didn't quite have ""the stuff"". I always wanted to see more Michael and less teenagers. What I'm trying to say is that the halloween movies are ""thin"".I'm a big fan of Rob Zombie's other movies, he has a unique style. If anybody know's anything about horror films, it's Rob. So when I heard that he was making an installment in the series, I was thrilled! I was hoping for something in the style of ""the Devil's Rejects"", a genuine horror flick with plenty of story and character development, which otherwise doesn't seem to exist it horrormovies. And I really wanted to like the Halloween series.And when it finally came out, wow! It's dirty, bloody and pretty! The acting in the movie is just brilliant, all the characters are believable and just feel real. the lighting is interesting and really effective.The movie brings ""halloween"" to a whole new level. It's just... WOW! A great experience!",Halloween
757,marmalade-sunrise,Rob Zombie Accomplished Something Great in the Mire of Today's Mediocre Horror Flicks,8,21 October 2009,"I do not generally like remakes but I think this is the best horror remake I've ever seen, and it's precisely because it gives the movie a fresh spin instead of merely attempting to recreate the original. I appreciated the mix of gory horror with character development and a solid background story. Approached as something new, this film is a shining diamond among the mainstream Hollywood horror of the past decade. Most of my favorite horror films were made before 1990, so I was quite impressed with what I see as a mature effort from Rob Zombie.I would also like to point out that the Rob Zombie version of the film begins in the 1970's at the very earliest if you look at the clothes and the cars and listen to the music, and the second half of the film has a 1990's feel, so the supposed ""goof"" listed on this page is glaringly incorrect. Yes, Michael kills his sister's boyfriend with an aluminum baseball bat AFTER 1970, not in 1963. So no goof there. Just thought I'd point that out to all of the people here who are trying their best to shut this movie into their box of preconceived notions about the original John Carpenter film and what is obviously a fresh, new take on the series.",Halloween
758,darklandrecords,"Poor little Michael Myers has a horrid childhood with a stripper mum and drunken, abusive step father. The answer? Kill 'em all and let the audience snore it out.",1,16 February 2009,"This movie was awful. An awful remake. Rob Zombie has no idea about subtlety at all, in any of his movies. All the characters are gross clichés amped up to the 9s. The whole point about Michael Myers is that he is supposed to be a force for evil, mysterious and unexplainable. Not a hulking pro-wrestler who's mother was a stripper and who's step daddy beat him. It's a pathetic reduction of a classic character into a redneck lamo. At least Zombie's other films had some visual flair and style, this is a cruddy looking, ugly film. Zombie misses the point of the first film here and also fails to reinvent the story in any meaningful way. Disgraceful.",Halloween
759,dorit28,Should have been more loyal,5,8 March 2010,"You mix an original John Carpenter classic, Dimension Studio's, and Rob Zombie you get the most UN-loyal remake in history. First and for most if you watch this film as a film and not a remake it is pretty good. But if your looking for a remake of the 1978 classic you'll find a very disappointing film. Things that were good was the fact that Rob Zombie showed us what happened when Michael was a boy, that was clever. Also he made the characters more believable by making them for 2007 and not act like 1978, it would of been to forced and awkward. Also the actors were good at their parts. Then the fact that half the film is a prequel was crappy. I would of loved to have seen more of Laurie, Loomis, etc. Plus half of the events didn't even exist in the original. I understand changing a few things and maybe the ending but he got rid of classic scenes. Like the hedge scene. When Laurie and Annie are walking from school in the original and Michael hides behind that hedge, that was a classic sequence. But the biggest thing that made me angry as hell was the fact he took out the infamous closet sequence. That was a brilliant scene that deserved to be re-imagined. Now looking at it as just a horror film and not a remake it was pretty decent. Brutal, bloody, thrills, chills all the ingredients I love in a horror film. Also the acting was pretty decent. It wasn't awkward and it seemed real, like thats how teenagers and people really talk like. Rob made a good movie but not a good remake.",Halloween
760,haydeno-1,Halloween (2007) Review: I'm Impressed!,8,2 October 2011,"Wow! I was greatly amazed at this film. I loved the beginning where it focused on Michael Myer's childhood and his hard life and the ridicule he lived through by his Mother's boyfriend and the school bullies. Then, the portrayal of Laurie Strode by actress, Scout Taylor- Compton was just mind blowing. It almost beat Jamie Lee's Laurie Strode! Which surprised me. I also enjoyed Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Sam Loomis (in this film not Halloween II) The power of Michael Myers in this film was also astonishing. The only thing I didn't like about this film, was the main theme for the movie. I just didn't like that. I liked every other song in this movie but, the main title. 8.5",Halloween
761,greboca,Truly a piece of crap.,1,4 September 2007,"Ultimately, this remake fails on all levels for me.Here's a short-list of SPOILER-FREE points, items in this movie that just flat-out don't work whatsoever:* Michael Meyer's background - I personally felt this didn't work. The overdone home-situation (by-the-book psycho-making circumstances, it seems), the constant cursing, the laughable song-choice in one scene - you'll know it when you hear it! Zombie tries to make Michael more ""human"" (although he's invincible later-on?), but ends-up painting a caricature of white-trash dysfunctionality that does little but inspire laughter. * The language (cursing) - come on. Enough. Does every scene have to be crammed to the hilt with four-letter words? We get it, you like cussing! Well done! Try some original, realistic dialogue for a change. * The dialogue (non-cursing) - do teenage girls really talk like that? Maybe I'm out of the loop, but I know a fair number of ladies in their early-20's, and they don't all talk like prison-inmates. Did whoever wrote the dialogue actually check to see if kids TALK like that these-days? I'm pretty skeptical, personally. Most of the non-teen dialogue is pretty much dispersible and half-baked. No memorable lines in this movie. And one of the lines that was ported-over from Carpenter's original, ""Was that the boogeyman?"", got a HUGE LAUGH in the theatre I saw it in. Not a good sign when the audience is laughing at the dialogue. * The violence - OK, I knew it would be more violent than Carpenter's original, but the truth is this is an UGLY MOVIE. I'm not saying that I wanted a pretty, inoffensive picture, but the ugliness (and duration) of the killings -- and there's A LOT of them -- just doesn't fit this movie for me. I swear Zombie was just trying to take-up extra screen-time by letting the actresses overact every single death-scene. And this is related to my next point * The characters - why should I care if Michael kills them? We NEVER get to know a single one. There's barely a moment of character-development before the knife flashes. So we don't get to know the characters, therefore the killings don't resonate whatsoever with the audience, yet those killings drag on and on and on. It's pointless. In the original, we got to KNOW Laurie, we spent some time with her, and we related to her (feelings of not belonging, inadequacy, etc etc). In Zombie's Halloween, she's just a girl who runs and screams. Actually, they all are. They're notable only for the nudity. I have porn. I don't need this movie. Pointless. * The plot-holes - too many to list. A few include: Knowing how to drive? Knowing where Laurie is babysitting? Knowing where Laurie's parents live? Finding the right sized jumpsuit for a seven-foot-tall man? Being invincible (since the supernatural element is removed from Zombie's version)? And for the love of all that's scary, WHAT YEAR DOES THIS MOVIE EVEN TAKE-PLACE IN? Cell-phones share screen-time with 70's haircuts and 80's Koss-style headphones (in a scene outside of Laurie's school)....? The movie is riddled with errors and head-slapping ""WTF?!"" moments. * The music - it's nice that he incorporated a lot of Carpenter's music cues into this, but it's done pretty sloppily (esp. the opening theme). Moreover, the rest of the soundtrack is dismal. They mix in 70's songs with a bland, crappy ""score"" that fills EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN SPACE in the movie. When will modern horror directors learn to use SILENCE as a tension-builder? There are scenes in this movie that COULD have been effective, but instead of letting the audience slowly realize what's happening, the ""score"" pushes this generic ""BRAAAHHHHGGG!"" sound into our faces, as if we can't figure it out for ourselves. For f*ckssake, let the audience WORK for their terror. Don't just slap us in the face and think we'll enjoy it. * The look - this is an ugly, ugly film. Where Carpenter's original was clean, crisp and - at times - quite colourful, this remake seems to have been shot through a steel-wool pad. It's ugly. The colours (what few there are) are muted. The compositions are, well, barely noticeable. And - as is the norm these days - it seems Zombie couldn't afford a tripod. It's shaky-cam aplenty here. At times, it's impossible to tell what is going-on, the camera is shaking so badly. There's NO STYLE (to match the lack of substance). I ripped on the Texas Chainsaw remake too, but at least there they seemed to possess a tripod. Rob, if you can't afford to rent a tripod, just lean the camera against a 2x4. Seriously. It works.Overall - it's crap. It isn't scary, it isn't engaging, it isn't entertaining. It's a poor-man's version of a great film. It would never match the original (for me) anyways, but I was hoping to at least be entertained. I wasn't. I had my face pushed into a pile of ugliness that I didn't care about. Bravo, Rob Zombie. Now try making a real movie.",Halloween
762,RedThomas1,Halloween fans... will... cry?,2,31 August 2007,"For anyone who loves Carpenter's late 70's classic... You're in for a real treat!

Best yet... It's not told in a story telling manner! Do you still care? I hope not.From it's awful IMPACTED beginning this movie misses the mark on all possible levels. All relationships that are introduced in this movie serve as members of the body count and do not make up for lost time in later scenes.I do realize this is a ""reimagining"" of this franchise. It does have all of the fixings to make a new Halloween movie... But everything that ties all of these origin scenes together are jumbled into a 15 minute exposition that poorly plays out.The ending? don't get me started.Halloween 3 is still the worst only because Michael is not in the film",Halloween
763,mercedesismydog4545,How can you hate this?,9,18 January 2012,"For everyone out there that hates this movie, IT'S NOT A LITERAL REMAKE PEOPLE!!!! It was Rob Zombie's version!! This movie was REALLY good!! It has all the elements that you could want in a slasher film. Gore, violence, obviously Michael Meyers. This movie was way better than what i thought it was going to be. I loved every minute of it and I love how we learn a little about Michael's past, which is actually a cool thing Rob Zombie added since this was something that we never learned in the original. That, to me, made the movie. Everyone should stop being so closed-minded about this film. No, it's not the same as the original, but why would it be? I don't necessarily want to see the same film done twice. People need to give this movie a chance. Watch it with an open mind, completely ignore the original and think of this as a whole new movie if you must. nothing will ever be like the original but this movie definitely gave it a run for it's money. It kept the same backbone but with a a new look. It was made to fit our time, it's not the seventies anymore. Give this movie a break! It's very good if you just dig in and watch it instead of picking it apart before even attempting to try it. I think Rob Zombie did and excellent job in remaking this classic!",Halloween
764,tonyhurl,Halloween 2007 F-ng AWESOME MOVIE!!! (spoilers),10,31 August 2007,"I have to say that Rob Zombie's Halloween is the best horror film that I have seen in quite a while. I will also go so far as to say that I prefer this version to John Carpenter's original. Let the attack begin! lol The film is a roller-coaster of emotions showing Michael's early years in his dysfunctional trashy family through his years at the asylum as it slowly destroys the rest of his family. I will say this about Rob Zombie, the man does not know the meaning of the word subtle but despite this he can still make an engaging film. The music is excellent. The actors did a great job and the gore was used heavily but it did not distract from the story like many other so called horror films. For all the film buffs the movie is basically a who's who of 70's & 80's Horror films. Every main character from Zombie's previous 2 films show up in minor roles throughout. The only thing i did not like(spoiler) was that Michael shouldn't have killed Danny Trejo's character but now that I think about it I understand why Zombie killed him off. The young Michael Myers was a great actor and really embodied the character. Overall this was definitely a great movie and well worth the wait. When you think of the last few Halloween sequels starring washed up Rap Stars, this one could have been a lot worse. This was the franchise that needed a director like Rob ZOmbie to bring some new life to it. The original John Carpenter score is used as well as many classic rock hits from the 70's. This time around they tried to make Michael Myers more human and less like an unstoppable killing machine and they succeeded immensely.",Halloween
765,kateorgan,Best of the new ones,8,11 July 2020,I don't care I like this version yes ok it's rob zombie it's blood gore and boobs but hay what do you expect when Harvey W is also involved! And it's probably one of robs better movies!,Halloween
766,heavenseeker,"Flawed, but a worthy successor to the original.",8,1 September 2007,"Caution-Major Spoilers.Well Rob Zombie was in an unenviable position. Staying true to his vision, while also doing justice to one of the all time classic Horror films. I'm pleased to say he succeeded. Halloween 2007 is a very worthy successor to John Carpenter's original and miles ahead of most of it's sequels. Now that isn't to say it's perfect, because it's not. Yes, it has it's flaws. It's a step down in quality from The Devil's Rejects and nowhere as fun as House of 1,000 Corpses. But if you go into with an open mind, you will be rewarded.The first hour is a revisionist expansion on the first 15 or so minutes of the original. In this film we get the home life of Michael Myers, his back story, and it is not pleasant. His older sister is a slut, his stepfather (a sinisterly sleazy Bill Forsythe) is an abusive, foul mouthed drunk. His loving Mom (Sherri Moon Zombie) is nice enough, but can only find work as a stripper, and baby sister is living in a crib where a finger slashing pop top is one of her playthings. Here we have a collision between the white trash world of Zombie's earlier features and Carpenter's original. Young Michael (Daeg Faerch) likes to kill his pet rats and other animals, step dad lays on some nasty verbal abuse, and his academic life is troubled by a bully who viciously makes fun of his stripping Mom. The school calls in a shrink, Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and he will soon have his hands full. Michael takes his first steps towards human victims when he nearly beats the bully to death (and trust me, this punk was deserving). On Halloween night, his Mom has to work and Older Sister is to take him trick or treating. But Sis would rather have sex with her boyfriend, while Step Dad gets drunk and passes out. He never wakes up as Michael slits his throat (and again, this was someone who deserved what they got), but the next victims are undeserving. Boyfriend is brained by a baseball bat and Big Sis is slashed. Michael then cradles his baby sister, wishes her Happy Halloween and takes her to the porch away from the carnage. Mom comes home to the scene and in no short order, Micheal is off to the loony bin to be treated by Dr. Loomis.At first it seems like progress is being made. Michael and Loomis talk a lot, Mom comes to visit every week and a nice orderly (Danny Trejo) reaches out in friendship. But young Micheal refuses to admit to anything, still thinks things are fine back home and prefers to hide behind paper masks he has crafted. But coming home is out of the question. Then one day he snaps and kills a nurse. The day after wards he falls silent, never to speak again, Loomis fails to reach him in any way and Mom kills herself. 15 years later, Michael is now a silent hulk of a man who makes his escape from the asylum and heads back home to find baby sister, who was adopted by the Strode family. He is now no longer human, but the Boogeyman. The second half of the film is basically the actual remake part, with even a few nods to Halloween 2 tossed in for good measure (The Michael/Laurie family relationship and ""Mister Sandman"" playing on the soundtrack).It helps if you are familiar with the first film and how it unfolds. Because the original film's main events are squeezed into the second half of the new version, we don't have too much time for characterization. If you are intimately familiar with the first film and it's characters, then you will be okay. If not, you may feel a little cheated and the characters might come off as less then fully developed to you. But it's an exciting ride to be sure. Old fans will love seeing how Zombie reinterprets the main set pieces of the first film, old and new fans will love the action and Michael's rampage. Anyone worried about Tyler Mayne as the new Michael need not worry, he's the best since Nick Castle in the original. If you don't have a shiver going up and down your spine when he first puts on the iconic mask and the equally iconic Halloween theme tune plays, then you have no soul.Zombie does well in most of his re-staging of the original's big moments. Michael has come home to reunite with his Sister, not to kill her. But the happy family reunion is tossed out the window of course. The redux of the Lynda kill is good and the re-staging of the climactic balcony scene in inspired. Also nice is the glimpse into Laurie's family life, barely glimpsed in the first version. Unfortunately, the inevitable ""Was that the Boogeyman?-I'm afraid it was"" dialog does not have the same impact as in the first film and it might have been better to have left it out rather than give into the fans who were expecting this. Also the end is a big disappointment. It's far too abrupt and leaves you saying ""That's it?"" It's somewhat saved by a House of 1,000 Corpses style end credit sequence that flashes us back to Michael's childhood, but a better ending would have been nice.The new Halloween does stumble a bit at times, but Zombie pulled it off. I was entertained for two hours, and left feeling that something finally got remade with a modicum of respect, little warts and all. I feel Halloween 2007 is a film that will get better with repeated viewings and I for one can't wait to see it again.",Halloween
767,williamlund,"might be some spoilers ""Excellent movie""",9,28 August 2007,"If you compare this movie to the original then you will be disappointed this is more of a prequel that leads up to the original. Its through the eyes of Michael myers. The emotions of his character is great you follow him wherever he goes. Its almost as if Rob Zombie wants you to cheer for him yet not completely. You will see how he became who he is and why he does what he does with emotion. Which the original didn't do. For horror fans looking to get scared you might also be disappointed due to being through his eyes It takes more of the scare away. Its more of a thriller drama. I will watch this again, because to watch the emotions of Michael is amazing and the understanding of him. Its hard to pick them up the first time around. In the end you feel sorry for his death than you will cheer.",Halloween
768,Patron-89,"First half pretty good, second? Well the ending was great, but the middle was rushed",8,10 September 2007,"When I went to see Rob Zombie's Halloween I had been told mixed things about it ""like its was awesome/it suck."" So I wasn't sure about it from the get go.In the first half, we see how Michael's life is like and you learn that he's really good kid but has mental issues and his family/school life doesn't help. This was great, on showing us how a nice kid becomes corrupted by society in a sense; that one minute he's all calm then the next he's a manic, like Michael had a split personality or something. this is why I thought the first half was pretty good.When the second half came I was getting into the movie, then It's like everything just started rushing. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but it was like jumping from scene to scene for like the first half of the second half.Then it started to slow down in the chase scenes, with Laurie and Michael together in the end. The chase scene they had were pretty intense and damn if not brutal. Though I said I didn't want to spoil anything, so my going to say this: ""THE ENDING WAS BRUTALITY AT IT'S BEST!"" Yeah it was a excellent ending for this Halloween.So overall a pretty damn good remake but I hope when it come out on DVD they give us an extended version. I give this: 9 out of 10, A Intense and somewhat Polarizing, but pretty good Remake.",Halloween
769,perfect14u,"Not horrible, but not very good",4,31 August 2007,"Being a huge fan of the Halloween franchise, I was on the fence about this remake, but kept an open mind because I wanted to give it a fair chance. I went into the film with the mindset that I would not compare it to the original, but see it as a fresh film. Either way, I must say I was disappointed.I loved ""1,000 Corpses"" because it was different (although ""Rejects"" was horrible) and thought perhaps Rob might bring a fresh approach to the series. Unfortunately, it is filled with characters that are undeveloped and we care nothing about, along with the shaky camera angles and fast-paced editing that today's teenagers need for some reason. There's no real tension build-up, no development and horrible dialogue. I was glad that they used a lot of the original themes in the score, but often times the music was misplaced and made the scene very awkward.There were also scenes that were intended to be scary and serious, but were actually quite humorous. I also got very distracted by the continuity error of time....in the first part of the movie, it is the 1970's, but then ""15 years later"" becomes 2007. ??? On a positive note, the film wasn't a total disaster. There were a few funny lines, some shots with actual atmospheric mood, and the end chase sequence with Laurie Strode was pretty good. Nice mixture of horror movie natives, although many of them played characters that were irrelevant to the story.I think Rob missed the main point of the film: Michael Myers was scary because he was pure evil. No back story. It's scarier that he was from a normal family and just killed for no reason as opposed to being this disturbed child that came from a bad home life. And Dr. Loomis was an interesting character before because he was obsessed with Michael...now he's a sell-out who gives up and cashes in on it by writing a book. Totally different character.Overall, it's worth watching I guess, but I imagine most fans of the series will be disappointed. Young teenagers will probably have a blast with this, but for the rest of us who appreciate scary films with good characters, interesting story, atmosphere, and style: we won't.",Halloween
770,srg2787,This movie would be great had it been named something else,7,17 January 2017,"I personally loved this movie and watch it every year around Halloween including the second one. People hated these movies because they were so far from the original which with all do respect to Mr. Carpenter, hasn't held up for over 20 years now. I remember watching the original when I was a child captivated by the dark and mysterious Michael Myers and of course the music making the entire movie terrifying! When you watch this movie however, forget comparing it to the originals because if you do it'll ruin your experience. Sure there are scenes copied but the storyline is much deeper and more exposed and I loved the idea of Michael Myers being this giant strong almost unstoppable force. It's dark grim and scraggly just like his beard and hair in this film which made me realize Rob Zombie knew what he was doing. It was those little things like Michael being stuck in horrible mental institution where they didn't care to cut his hair, shave or even bath him.This movie covers all aspects of how Michael Myers became the man in the mask chasing his baby sister, and I think years from now when there is another remake they'll be saying this movie was the best out of the bunch.",Halloween
771,pluk69,Suffers from the same flaws as his first two outings,8,18 September 2007,"Such a shame. I really wanted to like this and although I like the way that the original story is expanded upon it's unfortunate that Zombie seems to have a complete inability to allow anyone to associate or feel for any of his characters.This is a horror film in it's most basic of terms - it's horrific. It contains little in the way of tension, suspense and shocks and just a lot of death to loud music.It's unfortunate really because for the first fifteen minutes or so I actually thought he was going to surprise me and come up with a fresh and interesting take on the franchise.Ultimately this film falls down in exactly the same way as 1000 Corpses and Devils Rejects did; they're all fantastic ideas that are flawed by containing not a single character you actually care about. You need to either like someone or hate someone to care either way about what happens to them and in his films everyone is just simply there.",Halloween
772,darkangel_7,A New Halloween,10,31 August 2007,"I just saw Rob Zombie's take on the classic horror Halloween and I have to say he did a fine job re-envisioning a film that has given birth to a new genre of horror. What makes this film so great is how it doesn't try to be the original, nothing ever could compare, that's why he made a new film with just the bare components of the original. He pretty much builds Michael from the ground up explaining why he is the way he is. Physical and emotional abuse, school bullying, etc... This concoction leads to the creation of a sadistic, maniacal, killer. Not only does this paint a clear picture of his psyche, but it also gives a human face to Michael, and makes him more than just a lumbering unstoppable killing machine. As for some of the reviews I've read that feel Rob Zombie's take on life is a bit far fetched considering how everyone swears like a sailor & is sex-driven if not incestuous, well I don't remember anyone complaining about Tim Burton's world of white picket fences, over exaggerated colours, and Stepford wives running about now did I? No offense to Tim Burton though, his movies rock too. Also the murder scenes, though graphic were appropriate. I may not have seen anyone actually murder in real life, but the simple fact is, people do not simply die from a single knife stab immediately or are frail enough to have their head sliced off in one swing like so many slasher flicks have portrayed. It is a brutal gut wrenching sight that Rob Zombie attempts to mimic for if nothing else, shear realism, not trying to sensationalize, but to horrify. Good work Mr. Zombie, keep it up.",Halloween
773,mcr03d,Zombie drives the franchise... down.,2,2 September 2007,"Nearly thirty years have followed since director John Carpenter unleashed his horror classic Halloween to audiences everywhere. In those three decades, the film has become a franchise spawning sequels, T-shirts, conventions, coffee mugs, action figures, and of course, a Rob Zombie remake. While Busta Rhymes and his pseudo-ninja antics is clearly not a highlight of the Halloween saga, it's not to say the 2007 remake is any more glorious.What new moviegoers will find this weekend is not a new vision of the film Halloween, but an adrenaline bastard child of it's former self, unsure of what it wants to be, and insistent on going for the jugular. Mind you, by the end of the film your neck will be swollen.The story is much the same as it's always been. Young boy murders his sister (in this case his immediate family and some loose change) and is sent to a mental institution, where he breaks out fifteen years later on Halloween. As simple of a premise, director/musician/Ed Wood prototype Rob Zombie makes an educated guess and delves deep into the mystique and macabre that is, Michael Myers.Unfortunately what pans out is a self professed Americana lifestyle, where the normal consist of crude variations of the former cast list of The Devils Rejects (another Zombie film). Zombie attempts at realism by darkening what was a typical nuclear family but falls flat. Instead, the Myers mythos becomes a staple cliché and spoon feeds the audience the answer to why Myers is a psychopath; whereas Carpenter and co-writer Debra Hill carved evil out of left field, leaving reasons unknown.Dialogue, especially amongst the teenagers in the second half of the film, is both crude and obnoxious, a monotonous drivel of promiscuous sexuality that should be insulting to teenage girls everywhere. While Hill shaped teenagers Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda van der Klok from past recollections of her former youth, Zombie seems to write the dialogue from five minutes of a reality television blooper reel. William Forsythe's colorful lines of dialogue come to mind as a prime example of the over the top writing Zombie employs, referring to sister Judith's rear as a ""fine dumper."" Even the presence of Malcolm McDowell, filling the footsteps for the late Donald Pleasance, can't bring the dead weight script to life. His lines fall flat and by the end of the film, the Dr. Sam Loomis he portrays is neither heroic nor memorable. The same must be said for heroine Laurie Strode, played by Scout Taylor-Compton, who nails the look but much like McDowell, has no source material to work with. Unsurprisingly, the only fair development in the cast is given to Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon, who portrays Michael's mother, Deborah Myers.Zombie's vision lacks atmosphere and depth, something prevalent in the original that gave its signature look. Gone is the mystery and the off the cuff imagery that followed the moviegoers home. Instead, the characters are slaughtered and butchered straight out of a Mortal Kombat game which after an hour becomes monotonous. If that element of a horror movie is nonexistent then there are problems that lie far deeper than a script.By the time the film concludes after its' seventeenth climax, after the credits have hit the screen, and after the score drones (which is brilliantly revitalized by Tyler Bates), one should be tired, bored, and desensitized. Clocking in at just under two hours, Halloween feels like a long, overblown magic show where the magician reveals all its secrets before the act is even played out.Why pay for that?",Halloween
774,cverduchi,The worst remake ever made,1,20 October 2019,Rob Zombie takes a great character like Michael Myers and ruins all of his mystique by making him a white trash kid who was beaten? Nothing could be more uninteresting or unoriginal. Not to mention the dialogue is painful to listen to which is the case with every Rob Zombie movie. He has also taken Laurie Strode and made her completely hateable. This is truly one of the worst remakes of a classic.,Halloween
775,mbsa,Surprised me a lot...,7,18 January 2008,"When I heard that Rob Zombie was going to make a sort of ""remake"" of the first Halloween movie I was pretty scared. John Carpenter was one of my favorites directors and made a film that was nearly impossible to match. I must say I saw the ""House of 1000 Corpses"", that I enjoyed a bit, but for my great sadness I had a big disappointment with ""Devils Rejects"". I think it was a very graphic movie with almost no way to justify the violence. It was for me a point of rupture with Rob Zombie. I've had a chance to watch Rob Zombie's Halloween after a great friend of mine recommended the film to me. My friend was just like me a hardcore fan of Michael Myers and said to me that the film unveiled a lot of Michael Myers sinister background and it was a great addiction to the series. Well, I must say after I've seen it that the film is a great addiction to the Halloween franchise. I can't understand most of the negative comments on IMDb saying it is a poor vision of the first movie. In my opinion Rob Zombie created a movie that is modern, adapted to our days, but with all of the magic that surrounded Michael Myers and the first Halloween. OK, I surrender, it's a bit over the edge sometimes and it's pretty different from the original particularly in the characters but for me all connects too well. Sometimes during the movie you can't just deny the fact that Rob Zombie himself is a fan of John Carpenter and of the first film. Some details are just perfect and really achieve a smile from your face. I think the film deserves understanding and pretty much gives a new fresh look to the franchise that was in the mud. It's thousand of years away from the sequels (from Halloween 3 forward) and it's really satisfying to see it was Rob Zombie that achieved this. I give it a 7/10 and the first ""Halloween"" for me it is a 8.5/10. Just evaluate for your own, don't listen to others.",Halloween
776,FatmanReviewing,Honest review from a longtime fan.,4,31 August 2007,"It was extremely fast paced so much so that it became boring because you could tell that it was rushed. So it was like a meat stew....with no meat. No build up in any of the scary sequences so there's an illusion of half-assed suspense but it's not there at all. Which makes the entire movie 100% predictable. Straight-forward gore, which is not what Halloween is supposed to be about. I mean yeah it's a re-make and he was supposed to make it ""his own"" but in the reality of it Rob Zombie's ""own"" is not part of this series' formula so it doesn't work and it's certainly not effective. Immense amounts of cussing so much that it got irritating. Usually I don't mind, I mean, I'm a Quentin Tarentino fan so swearing isn't even on my list of pet peeves. But in a movie like this? It doesn't belong because it doesn't contribute anything worthwhile.He added in scenes from the original and butchered them horribly. The execution of almost every death and ""suspenseful"" moment was rushed and half-assed. Directing was pretty bad along with the editing. I guess that comes with trying to fit so much into a hour and fifty minute movie but still, he should have thought over the final cut a little more before releasing it. He also decided to add in scenes from the original, something I was looking forward to seeing re-imagined. Probably is he rushed these scenes as well and didn't give them even a bit of justification. The acting throughout the entire movie was either not believable or extremely over the top. Dialogue was bad, you couldn't believe it. Like, you just thought to yourself; ""People don't talk like that, wtf?"". Scenes were all over the place and there were many 5 second tidbit scenes that had nothing to do with anything. Like he'd just randomly switch to something else that a character(s) was doing. It usually had nothing to do with the story and didn't further any story development so you just went ""Huh? Okay...."" Finally, the ending was a bit of a disappointment. It ended so abruptly and prematurely.Not sure what else I can add except that I've always loved the Halloween films, even when Busta Rhymes painstakingly graced our presence with Resurrection. It's sad because I've spent the last several months defending this film and trying to get people to just shut up with their ignorant opinions until they saw it. Now that I've seen it, I feel like kicking myself in the ass for all the comments I've made haha.",Halloween
777,alexhs_45,"Finally, a remake better than the original.",8,13 August 2015,"I was never a big fan of the original one but i respected it as a horror classic. It was more visual than dialogy and i appreciate that. However it got many things wrong.Rob's version's protagonist is Michael Myers as it should be. It shows parts of his childhood but not in terms of explaining why Michael became the serial killer we know and love. I've seen many complaining about that but i think it's more realistic that way. Michael was a psycho from birth, no tragic event made him that way. Instead it depicts the development of his behavior, the rate his rage increased and his scruple decreased.Visually it looked better too and Michael himself looked more menacing, being the size of a skyscraper. I also liked Dr. Loomis' methods and ethics being questioned.Overall i thought not only it was superior to the original one, but also a franchise saver.",Halloween
778,johnnyboy6204-117-186828,Reviews on this film are far to thought out,10,13 September 2017,I do not understand how people can slate this film honestly this is one of the better remakes and has a new dark ominous tone and true psychology of a serial killer. Give Rob Zombie a break he done his best with this disassembled mass produced horror slasher film. Are people who comment on this really looking at it as a film to stand on its own merit or a film to stand up against all the other sequels because in my mind it does both. Now people who just do not like Rob Zombie should not be commenting on this because you are bias. Im not saying he is the best director of horror ever a lot of his films get cut and boiled down to the point they are unwatchable and some films miss a point of story. This one he had the story covered he just filled in the rest. Don't think many other directors could of done a better job and happy he got to do part 2 so surely he didn't do that bad.,Halloween
779,lakini71,The Inevitable Remake,1,22 December 2007,"John Carpenter's 1978 slasher film ""Halloween"" is a classic, plain and simple. Not only do I feel that it is the best horror film ever made, but it is one of the best films of any genre. And now, 29 years later, we get the obligatory remake, written and directed by Rob Zombie. I will begin by saying that I have not seen ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" or ""The Devil's Rejects,"" nor do I want to.From the time it was announced that Zombie would be taking on this ""reimagining,"" I have followed countless forums, blogs, and internet news reports, only to discover my worst fear: fans detest the idea and, later upon its release, they loathe the film. So,upon it's DVD release this past Tuesday, I decided I would pop it in, and with as much of an open mind as possible, finally watch Zombie's vision. Now, I feel slightly disappointed. No, it isn't because I was expecting a great film...I'm disappointed because it's not the all-out cinematic toilet paper I was expecting. Granted, it is by no means a good film (and as a remake, it just plain sucks)...but I found it watchable enough, easily killing two hours.Zombie begins the tale by exploring the home life of 10-year-old Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch, who looks like a chubby, male Dakota Fanning, and is in no way imposing). His mom (Sherri Moon Zombie) has a good heart, but she makes her living as a stripper; her husband (William Forsythe) is a pathetic drunk who calls Mikey a faggot, and leers at his older sister, the slutty Judith (Hanna Hall). It seems the only normal family member is ""Boo,"" the infant girl, who Mikey adores. On Halloween day, it is discovered by his school principal that Mikey likes to kill animals and take pictures of his dastardly deeds. Psychiatrist Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is called in to consult, but Mom won't have it. And as soon as Mikey leaves school, he bludgeons to death a bully that's been picking on him. Night falls, Mom goes to work, and our killer-in-training manges to pick off his stepdad, sister, and sister's boyfriend in gruesome detail.None of these events are as truly unnerving as they were intended to be, and they just reinforce the idea that a ""reimagining"" is not necessary. In Carpenter's version, Michael comes from a stable suburban home and, without warning, snaps and stabs his sister to death. Now, I ask what is more frightening, nature or nurture? A picked-on kid from a white-trash family? Or the sudden emergence of evil with no explanation? If you picked ""A,"" then you should enjoy the rest of this film without a problem.Dr. Loomis becomes Michael's lone psychiatrist over the next 16 years at Smith's Grove sanitarium. Their relationship basically consists of Loomis asking a question, and Myers not speaking. When little Mikey is all grown-up (to a 7-foot behemoth, no less), he kills the security guards and escapes.This is where the remake portion of the film comes into play, as Loomis tracks Myers back home to Haddonfield, Illinois, where ""Boo"" is now the high-school senior Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), and she and her friends are in for a hellish night. Zombie begins to copy key scenes from Carpenter at this point, but nothing is effective. Everything in this third act is rushed; we do not get to know any of the teens he is stalking, so they come off as one-dimensional morons that we don't mind seeing butchered. And since Michael has become the central character of this film, unlike the ""Shape"" that lurked in the background in Carpenter's film, he is no longer terrifying. He is like any other warped killer in any other film, though the misogynistic Zombie does insist that the females he butchers are all either completely or partially nude.Now, here's what Zombie gets right: the final showdown. The confrontation between Laurie and Michael is actually well-choreographed and intense, and Zombie shows some skill here. No, it's not the edge-of-your-seat fear that the original's climax created, but no one could have topped that. Throughout the film, Zombie also makes effective use of Carpenter's original score, and not just it's classic main theme...so that's a small relief.Rob Zombie is a screen writing hack, to be sure. The story has lapses of logic throughout, and his dialogue (half of which consists of the word ""f**k"" by most of the cast members) is cringe-worthy. It's actually pretty amazing that the acting performances are all average to above-average, given the material they have been given. Another problem is that Zombie fills the film with genre acting veterans, and these prove to be merely a jokey distraction, especially since these characters are introduced for the sole purpose of a higher body count. ""Oh, look who it is!"" ""Uh-oh, they're dead now!"" But Zombie does show directing promise; if he would direct a film written by someone talented, he may finally have something.All in all, the movie is a mess. It lumbers on and on; it's profane, tacky, and exploitive; and the violence is way over-the-top. This may be fine for the current generation of ADD filmgoers, but for those who understand what made the original so truly remarkable (unlike Zombie), this remake...yes, remake...just won't cut it.",Halloween

781,yolkie,A Michael Myers for 2007,9,5 September 2007,"Having only seen the work print version (my darling of a girlfriend managed to get me a copy). When news of a new Halloween was released, like many I was hoping for a sequel, if only to eliminate the lasting memory of Busta Rhymes performing kung fu to Michael Myers! Nevertheless we were told Rob Zombie was directing, and not only that, it would be a ""re-imagining"". With that in mind I start the review.The term ""re-imagining"" is ambiguous as far as I can see. This is not a re-imagining of the first, but the first two films in the series.Importantly, there is very much a ""Halloween"" feel to it, and the opening act gives us an insight into Michael Myers reason, if any, for his anger. He is no longer raised by your average suburban family, but, a caring (stripper) mum, and a trailer trash step dad. There are a couple of early kills that certainly get you off your guard - this I found equally disturbing and compelling. The camera-work certainly has a ""Halloween meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" feel to it.We are introduced to Loomis incredibly early on. Unfortunately this is at the expense of what was his opening scene in John Carpenters version. Yes, it is unfair to compare the two when it is a re-imagining - however when Zombie himself is bending the rules by borrowing from sequels, he is leaving himself wide open to criticism from die hards such as myself. There's something not quite right about Loomis finding out by cell phone that Michael Myers has escaped (I'll never forget Pleasence's delivery ""he's gone.. the evil has gone!""), and although he tries hard, McDowell for me just 'isn't' Loomis. Having said that - before I saw the film, if anyone could be, it would be him. Let's just say it's a role that was made for DP. The best way I can put it is DP's Loomis raved around like a lunatic himself and that made you equally as scared of the Shape as the Shape himself. MM seems too laid back.The kills themselves are, I suppose, typical of a modern day slasher. Unfortunately it seems where Rob Zombie strayed from the original in the 're-imagining' he found himself in the 'Halloween 5' school of kills. However, it does compensate to some extent for this with pure shock value and that is not a bad thing.After the back story, we have an incredibly rushed present day Halloween, and an INSTANTLY dislikeable Laurie. Lynda too is a wretched character but I can't really say we get enough of Annie's to judge. There is not enough character development in the ""present day"" act of the movie. The ending to the film is very different to the original. Scout Taylor Compton plays the role of Laurie like she was a girl who won a competition to play it.. no offence to the girl, in fact in one of her interviews prior to the film I believe she said as much herself. The character faults are more down to the script, rather than the actors who play them.My one MAJOR gripe is the score. It has been commented on on this website, too. I actually enjoyed the timing and atmosphere of ""monster mash"" at the start, though I hear that has been replaced in the theatrical version. The classic themes that were lifted from the original, however, are all over the place. However, the first film was all about suspense and the build up and that is why the score worked so well. This Halloween works for a different kind of scare.It is incredibly hard for me to rate the film without comparing it to the original. Though I may have sounded critical, I did really enjoy it. As a stand alone it is an excellent film, as a remake it could have been worse, as far as the two reported sequels go I will be eager to watch whether they continue with RZ' 're-imagining' or, (improbable) they return and pick up from Resurrection. One thing I will say is Rob Zombie said before the film he ""hated"" the way Michael Myers was treated as some kind of ""hero"", and that he wanted to make him into a monster with no boundaries again. He has somewhat succeeded, the first act is so shocking (in the literal sense, not the panning sense) that you're almost expecting the unexpected, the last act is terrifying with unexpected kills. However by humanising him at the start of the film it is hard for the viewer to NOT feel sympathy and actually understand what he's doing. The GOOD points, for me, are as followed. It is good that the franchise is back and has opened so well in the US, hinting that it is probable the two reported sequels will actually happen. There are great moments in the movie, such as young Michael's scarily violent reactions and the story behind the mask. Sheri Zombie plays the role of the mom superbly. I would hope in a sequel Brad Dourif plays a fuller role.As a die-hard, I anticipated with dread the thought of watching this film, but if this new direction is the only way forward for the franchise, I can't wait to see more.Rob Zombie's Halloween is a classic modern day slasher. DO NOT go into this film expecting the suspense and build up that characterised the original and I don't think you'll be disappointed. Overall I would definitely recommend this film, however I'd stick with the original for your Halloween night viewing.",Halloween
782,jasonward-19758,The Expendables of Horror,4,11 December 2018,"The people who say this is the worst film ever, have either a) not seen a film with Marky Mark Walhberg in or B) any of zomies other films apart from the devils rejects. To be fair I never cared much for the originals apart from Donald Pleasence. Carpenter has made far superior films and Zombie shot his bolt with TDR but still thought this might rise above the usual horror fair. Unfortunatly it doesn't. Its to long, I have no problem with Zombie going into Michaels childhood, it just 15 mins to long, its not we need to talk about kevin , we get it. Plus the script is pretty clunky and the overall writing lazy. The Michael escape of 'let's rape a women in the cell of the 7 foot madman who wears a mask and doesn't speak' made me swear at the TV, (tho I believe theres another version where this doesn't happen, good, its terrible and granted could be one of the worst scenes ever) . There are good bits, Michael is supremely violent, the bits where he knocks the roof down and smashes Ken Foree through the toilet cubicles are cool, the music and look of the film are good also. Unfortunately the cameos become a distraction, its more like the expendables rather than a well thought out cast, do they make up for the lack of Pleasence or Curtis? No, McDowell does his best but lacks Donalds Pathos, he just comes across as arrogant, if Zombie did want to go for something different he should have given it to Dourif who is always brilliant and though underused here is still a welcome addition. So worth a look if you've not seen, but that's it.",Halloween
783,jpuga1,"Not the best one, but far better than any Halloween released since H4.",8,19 September 2007,"I found this movie pretty interesting. I agree with others that the beginning made it appear like you were going on a red-neck roller-coaster. The entire script during the opening scenes was ridiculous and unnecessary. There really is no need to use the amount of profanity and sex scenes that he used. Example, the first Halloween had little profanity and maybe 1 sex scene and it was a hit. I think he directed this film towards the young adult audience. Scary movies of the past are not what they are today. Those made in the 80's and 70's were much more scarier, IMO. This film was not scary at all, not even the slightest bit. It was however entertaining and gory. I personally think the best Halloweens' in order were: 1) Halloween 1 2)Halloween 2 3) Halloween 4 4) Halloween 9 5) Halloween 5 6) Halloween 6 7) Halloween 7 8) Halloween 8",Halloween

786,Art_tastic,Halloween: Good or Bad the option is yours...,8,2 September 2007,"I just came back from watching the Halloween Remake and while it had me jumping out of my seat saying 'holy ****' I must admit I have my own problems with it.First the good: We get to see a little more about his background and find out that he killed more than his sister at age 10 (granted it takes away the homage from when he suddenly snaps). I personally liked the suburban atmosphere of this version although realistically not as common in the 1970's. We actually get to see Laurie as a baby before Michael is committed but it threw me off when I heard them calling her 'bill' (it sounded like Bill). We also learn what happened to Michael's parents. (Mikey killed Stepdad; Mom shot her brains out) Another aspect is that we learn more about our dear friend Dr. Loomis. We get to see that although he's ready to stop Michael when people are in impending danger that he is also human and Greed is somewhat part of humanity... in fact it is.As I said in the summary, this version made me jump with shock/surprise more than the original. I don't remember what happened in the '78 version so I don't know if the Strodes were killed back then but it was nice to see what happened to them.More action, more gore. I love how the 21st century can add more realistic kills to a movie. I just wish that the people would just take a hint if they're outside of a locked door and are watching their co-workers being killed by this guy that they run away and if they do come back--Bring a flame thrower or something.We got to see Michael's fixation with masks. And the fact that he can make them.Now for the bad: The killed Sam Loomis! The Sam Loomis! Why did they do that he wasn't supposed to die until the 6th one! Are they not planning to remake the other 6 versions with Michael in them? He was supposed to beat Michael in the first and second.Too much sex. It reminded me more of Jason and I don't think he was in Halloween (;)).I was hoping that since this was a remake that they'd add more history to Laurie's friends and the children Tommy and Lindsey. That was disappointing to me.All in all it was a pretty good movie. I heard from a theater employee that if there's a sequel it'll be Michael vs Freddy. I hope that doesn't happen. They did that with Freddy vs Jason.jD",Halloween
787,k_rchfld,"It was OK, it just didn't rip my brains out",6,13 September 2007,"It seems like most reviews here either love it or hate it, but I'm sort of in the middle...first of all, this movie is OK, by all standards, but I was expecting much more from Rob Zombie, as his previous movies (especially DEVIL'S REJECTS) were definitely on the right track. Scary, shocking, and uncomfortable, as horror movies should be.Movie remakes are hit and miss. I personally think they shouldn't be done unless you can make them super spectacular and update them in a way that gives them a whole new dimension, either with new technology or a fantastically great new idea.In the original Halloween, we don't really know Michael, which makes him mysterious and scary. He was simply a dark, foreboding killing machine, almost robot-like in his movements and simply sought out his prey for one reason alone, to kill them in the most quick and efficient way possible. In 2007, we get to know Michael, an abused child that grows up to be a super big and unpleasant looking guy, who I think more than anything, likes to torture people and witness a lot of pain and suffering. Which is scarier? I guess that's different for different people. I'm voting for Michael 1978. Also, I just didn't really care about any of the characters in this movie, EXCEPT young Michael's hamster! The idea of that kind of thing is disturbing to me. And not in a good way I might add. In the original film, how could you not adore Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, the all American girl-next-door that lived in EVERYTOWN, USA? She was our babysitter, and the sweet girl everybody liked. She watched terrified as she ran limping, whimpering and squealing in her torn bloody shirt back in 1978 and we ALL wanted her to get away from Michael alive! Does the new Laurie Strode fit that bill? Well I can't speak for everyone, but she didn't for me.Did I care about Laurie's friends in this remake? Annie's character was OK, but the new Lynda was purely obnoxious. OK, so PJ Soles was a little annoying in John Carpenter's original movie with her constant giggling and overuse of the word ""totally"" but she was pretty true to form for a high school girl in 1978. Totally. I keep wondering why Rob didn't put PJ in a cameo role in this movie? He certainly could have, as she had a minuscule role in REJECTS. She certainly could use something good on her resume besides CARRIE, HALLOWEEN (1978), and ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL, which incidentally are three favorites of mine. Missed the boat on that one.Hey Rob, this movie is OK on most levels, and is certainly not the worst horror movie I've seen (not by a long shot), but in the future can you put more likable characters in them so we CARE if they get knocked off? I was uncomfortable seeing Three's Company's Terri (Priscilla Barnes) in a fleabag motel in REJECTS, and didn't want anything bad to happen to her. What makes it scary and uncomfortable is that we cared, or at least I did. We didn't get to know anybody in this movie enough to really care. You know how to make a great horror movie, that is clear, and I was expecting more from you than this. Your nod to John Carpenter's Halloween is not bad, but much less than I would have expected from a guy who really loves the horror genre. I just can't believe this is the best you could do. I know I speak for a lot of people when I say I think you have the talent to be the next new GREAT director in horror. We're counting on you. So thank you in advance.",Halloween
788,NathanielBacon,The Best Horror Film in Years.,9,8 September 2007,"My favorite film of all time is the original 1978 ""Halloween"". Since I was 11 years old, it has both delighted and scared the hell out of me. Needless to say, I was both dreading and anticipating this film for a long time. Now having seen it, I can breathe a sigh of relief.I feared what could happen with Rob Zombie at the helm. I loved ""The Devil's Rejects"". However, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Fear not, fans of true horror. Zombie brings a completely effective, frightening ""Halloween"" to life. On top of being a really, truly scary movie, ""Halloween"" is a film that dares us to ask questions about the darkness within ourselves. It is the quintessential slasher film, but with a dark self-awareness. It drags the audience through a horrifying, starkly presented reality of real-life horrors.Yes, the body count is higher and the murder scenes more vicious. However, despite the bloody brutality of the killings, there is little to no gore. Zombie really does focus on suspense and terror, and while he takes this film to a very different place than the original, it is well-acted, well-written, well-directed and scary as hell. Scout Taylor-Compton, while not Jamie Lee Curtis, is a great actress and plays a wonderful heroin. Sheri Moon Zombie takes another step as an actress and gives her best performance to date. Danielle Harris, Malcolm McDowell and Dee Wallace all turn in great performances, and are wonderfully cast. Tyler Mane is also, undeniably, the most layered, realistic, frightening Michael Myers ever to hit the screen.Recent horror remakes(i.e ""Black Christmas"") have sacrificed some of their intrigue and many of their scares by revealing too much about a killer who is more frightening as a mystery. ""Halloween"" avoids this trap by carefully shaping Michael Myers into a truly terrifying human being. Yes, it humanizes him. However, this makes him no less scary. In fact, it makes him more frightening. His murders, while terrifyingly random, are motivated in his eyes. Watching the film, you can feel his rage and understand where it comes from. This makes the terror all the more intense as you realize the story isn't too far off from the realm of real world possibilities.Rob Zombie does a great job balancing a respect for the original masterpiece with a wildly entertaining new take on the classic story. And most importantly, since I saw this movie, I haven't been able to walk through my house without the lights on. And isn't that what true horror is all about?",Halloween
789,roland1325,Well done!!!,8,18 December 2007,"Man, I gotta hand it to Rob Zombie. Before seeing the film, I thought, ""No way this can ever live up to the potential"", even after seeing his first couple films. Damn was I wrong. When I was watching this movie, I felt the same fear/horror/dread that I felt watching John Carpenter's original for the first time when I was five years old. The insanity of the psychopath that was Michael Myers scared the living sh** out of me then and I could totally sense that again watching the remake. And there wasn't any of the supernatural aspect that the sequels dealt with, which was great, not that I have anything against supernatural movies. Zombie really did a great job writing, directing, etc. I'm really glad that he didn't use the first ending that he shot. The casting and acting was incredible. I wasn't too thrilled with Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie but everyone else nailed it. Great to see Danielle Harris back in the franchise. All the other ""cameos"" brought a big smile to my face. It was one of those movies that you don't want to end, just keep going and being kick a**. But alas, all good things must come to an end, as do my comments.",Halloween
790,finlayeasson,Halloween (2007),1,22 October 2018,"Where is there even to begin in this film?What can you say about a film which completely mutilates a masterpiece of horror and suspense?1 - The film lacks any real type of suspense or pacing. What Zombie thinks is frightening is instead brutal violence, rather than a sense of ever-growing danger and terror. Literally, the pacing of this film is: murder, brief scene of character, murder, brief scene of character, and etc.2 - Completely unnecessary gore and sexual content. In relation to this, the film merely ups the violence level and does not add anything of contribution to what has came before. A rape scene halfway through the film is absolutely vile, brutal and repulsive in its sheer brutality. There is no reason at all for it to be included in the film.3 - Lack of interesting characters. In Carpenter's original, the characters were likeable and, while perhaps questionable in their characterisation, were not just dispensable. No character here has any notable character traits and is merely there to be killed.But most of all:4 - Zombie misses the entire point of the original in his attempt to reimagine it. By explaining Michael Myers' backstory and the reason as to why he began his murder spree, any sense of mystery has been taken away and therefore makes the character less frightening. In Carpenter's original, Michael is The Shape. A force of unstoppable evil who has no real motive for the crimes he commits. He doesn't have to because he is not really human. He is evil personified. Any attempts to make the audience sympathise with Michael are ridiculous, which makes one wonder why Zombie would attempt this to begin with. Couple this with the baffling decision to still make Michael invisible and unkillable despite it being established that he is just a man and you have merely a pointless film.Do NOT see this film",Halloween
791,bralphx,Interesting remake with some disappointing changes,6,28 October 2021,"This version of Halloween is much like the original: Michael Myers is a killer who offs his family, and he ends up busting out of the insane asylum only to return to his hometown, shedding blood along the way. We see the return of Laurie, the famous character from the original, which should have been a good time but wasn't.Rob Zombie was attempting to make more sense out of the Myers origin, so the viewer can see what led him down his deep, dark path. I appreciate what he was trying to do, but it missed the mark a bit.As for the character Laurie, I personally preferred her in the original. Zombie, himself, has been on record saying that her character is ""a bit boring""; however, the original movie gave her more grit. She was a much tougher character, whereas Zombie made her a screaming, hollering mess. He wanted her to be flawed, but really she came across as an annoying airhead that many viewers will have difficulty relating to.This version, because of the origin shots in the beginning, rushes the ending a bit.Overall, it's not a great movie. It's still worth watching, because Rob Zombie is a pretty good story-teller. It's better if you keep an open mind while watching and try not to constantly compare it to the original.",Halloween
792,thejerzeymick,Rob Zombie's Halloween bombs. A true failure.,3,20 November 2007,"I would like to admit when I heard Rob Zombie was remaking ""John Carpenter's Halloween"", I was intrigued. Normally I would be outraged on someone remaking such a brilliant classic, but I decided to put my faith in Rob, being a somewhat fan of ""The Devil's Rejects"". I am also aware that Rob is a fan of the horror genre, so I figured he wouldn't disappoint us, his fellow American horror fans. I figured he knew he was dealing with a very sensitive remake and would promise to deliver something good before releasing his version. So I decided to stop at the movie theater on my way home from work and watch this one. This is what I saw that day: A young boy kills his sister on a Halloween night and goes to an asylum. Dr. Loomis (the brilliant Malcolm McDowell, who's talent is completely wasted in this) is a child psychologist who treats Michael and is determined to figure out what would make a young child commit such a crime. Young Michael can't seem to remember his crimes that night. Dr. Loomis gives up 7 years later, to which he figures there is no help for Michael. Michael escapes 15 years later at the age of 21. He returns to his old town and stalks the sister he never knew and then kills her friends and blah blah blah blah.Sound familiar? Some might say ""that's the plot to John Carpenter's Halloween!"". They're right. However, Carpenter's has something horror movie fans seek: scares. This has none. This is a cheap, white-sploitation story that I cannot count as a remake. I won't even count it as a reimagining, I count is as a completely different tale about a human killer. The original story was ""The Shape"". This is like the angry 7-foot man who kills because he has nothing better to do. No, this isn't Halloween. This is ""Rob Zombie's 'The Seven-Foot Crazy Guy'"". What makes me angry the most about this is Rob should have known he was making a poor movie, however he probably didn't care because he knew of the profits he would generate. Rob Zombie's Halloween sucks.",Halloween
793,davesanae,This film was a Waste of Time,3,27 October 2007,"Dear oh Dear. The original was a classic and still makes me squirm a bit now when I watch it. What on earth was the point of this remake? Its just bad and really disappointed me but I guess I might have known it would. Far too much time is spent showing MM as a kid, although for me thats the best part of the film, as its different to the original and sets the scene a bit more, but when he escapes, thats when it goes downhill. The original was truly scary and edge of the seat stuff, all done by camera angles, music and building the tension. True to form, because they couldn't achieve that with a remake, they had to up the gore and it just didn't work, not for me. Verdict - nowhere near as good as the original and don't waste money at the cinema on this - see it on DVD if you must.",Halloween
794,javienu,Really good movie..,7,2 September 2007,"OK, I just finish watching these movie and I think It was very good indeed, we found everything that we want to find in a good horror movie, a iconic serial killer (and now they give us a inside about his past), a well know scenario and music, beautiful girls, sex, violence, and a lot of breasts.... I think this movie have two different parts, In the first part of the movie it gives us the story of Michael Mayers, and why he become what he is, this part it's interesting but sometimes kind of weak.. in the second part, it captures the essence of the original two movies, and give us a good old fashion slasher... the end it's kind of different of what we are used to see in horror movies, and maybe some will be disappointed....but i liked, so, no complains about that.. The only complain I have from these movie, It's the fact that we can read: Writed and directed by Rob Zombie, c'mon, we all know these was a John Carpenter idea and movie, at least give the man some credit for it. Resuming, a good movie, but watch it thinking that it's a totally different movie, if you start to compare it with the other 6 from the saga, perhaps you will be disappointed, with that in mind, go ahead, sit back and relax.",Halloween
795,justinand21,Rarely do remakes do any justice this may be an exception,9,31 August 2007,"First off Halloween was and is my first favorite horror film of all time. There are many reasons why however, that would require a lot of space. I am a 5th year film student about to graduate with 2 degrees. I don't think my opinion is worth anymore than the next persons but, I will tell you I am giving my review from the perspective of someone who: has an open mind, a critical eye for production, a huge fan of the Halloween series, and a person who absolutely hated Halloween Resurrection.This film isn't exactly a remake in the general sense of the term. Rob Zombie approached this project with John Carpenter trying to bring an updated version of the film offering more background info on the most notorious slasher staple of all time. Was a remake necessary? Of course not. Was one needed? Of course not. Did this movie stay true to the original? in my opinion, Yes. I think it was great. Halloween (1979) is the best horror film of all time. Rob Zombie brought along with him his all-star cast from Devil's Rejects. At first when I continued to see them appear, beginning with his wife SMZ, I was a little apprehensive. They worked fine though, I actually enjoyed seeing them in this and Rob did a great job of keeping the focus right where it belonged, on Michael. It looks like he shot it on Super 16mm and he definitely brought his unique style of film- making with him - Shaking free hand cam's during hectic violence - great angles - intense emotion in the actors/actresses and even slight bits of deranged humor. This movie did have great suspense and offered a few ""jump out your Fing seat"" moments. Overall the background info was great, it personified the soulless black eyes of myers and actually gave the audience a glimpse into his once-existent human self. The movie felt like Halloween. The presence of Michael was very empowering as played by Mane. The mask was my favorite version since H4. There are scenes with him as a child in it that are absolutely creepy and terrifying to see. This should help reel in a whole new generation of fans to see the whole series in it's entirety. Go see it.thanks Rob",Halloween
796,dsp14679,Not great.... but not BAD.... just NOT Halloween!,5,12 October 2007,"I'm really undecided on this movie overall. As a huge fan of the original (the first film to really scare me) I was really concerned when I heard about a remake. It's never going to live up to the classic original, so why bother other than to line the studio execs pockets with an easily marketable product to an existing fan-base?Fair play to Rob Zombie for at least trying to add to the original story by delving into the background of Michael and how he came to be the evil killer we all know. However, this is exactly where the problem with the film lies, the back-story humanises Michael and completely vanquishes the fear factor in the movie.Myers just isn't scary when you can see his motives. In fact, you find yourself rooting for him for most of the movie because every one of his victims seems to deserve it. His abusive, alcoholic step-father, his abusive, delinquent sister, the school bully... it feels as though Zombie is supportive of Michael and uses every stereotype in the book to back up his later actions. The performances and the script are all good , but it's kind of red-neck melodrama rather than horror movie material. Thinking back to 1978 and the mask being ripped off the face of young Michael, that was so creepy and iconic... because he was a kid with no motive - other than pure evil. While Daeg Faerch is excellent as young Michael in this, he's too likable. He's a sympathetic character who reaps vengeance on his tormentors.So, rather than the soulless monster from the original, he's something of an anti-hero. No mystery, no suspense - no FEAR.The thing is it's not a bad movie, but it's just not ""Halloween"". In fact the whole of the first movie is kind of vacuum-packed into the last 45-50 minutes of this, and even then it's just a rehash of the original with more sex.Visually, it's very faithful to the Carpenter version, but that's not enough. It just doesn't ring true as Michael Myers - and if anything's essential to the essence of Halloween, He is! That said, good enough for a viewing, but don't expect to see something that has the impact of the 1978 version.",Halloween
797,spectrumofunity,Really Really Bad,1,7 October 2007,"A horror classic totally bastardized by a subpar director. He really should stop trying to direct films and just be a rock musician. He's decent at music but he totally butchers everything that made John Carpenter's Halloween unique and original. The biggest question is why he calls it a ""re-imagining""? It is a remake that totally ruins the 1978 original straight up. This just fails on too many levels to try and explain in one review. It just does not work. The characters, the gore, and everything about are neither scary nor cutting edge. The cast of actors is especially odd. Some really established names are thrown in with D list and unknown actors. It's obvious he's putting in his friends",Halloween
798,ramirezdarkness,Not as good as the Original but pretty damn good,8,3 September 2007,"This Movie was awesome. I liked the dark Gothic atmosphere, the killings, the acting isn't half bad(believe me I seen a lot worse so i enjoyed it) and it didn't take itself too series. My complaints are though is Laurie's screaming at the end was annoying as hell, didn't like how Michael grew up in a white trash home(it would have better if his life style was normal).Donald Pleasence will always be Dr. Loomis to me but Malcolm McDowell did a OK job. Scout Taylor-Compton wasn't as bad as Laurie but wasn't as good either. I've seen worst actress's in horror movies and she was average some scenes you wanted to plug your ears and some where almost likable.If you take it series like the Original you won't like it but if you go in with a opened mind you'll like it. I don't mind people saying it sucks compared to the original which is fine. But I hate when it's called the worst of the Halloween series. That I fine is really insulting considering I take it no one actually saw H3 SOTW or H8 R. Those 2 killed nearly killed the series and this my friend is likely to make sequels.If you think this remake is bad, watch Black Christmas, When a Stranger Calls or any pg-13 remake which this would have been. So it would could have been worse the Halloween 3 or 8 if it was done by a different director, worser actors, and it could have been Pg-13.So if you think about it we're lucky it wasn't that bad. It could have toped the original in many ways but it didn't and it isn't the worse of the series H3 and H8 done that. Halloween remake is one of my favorites of the Series and if don't compare it to the original you'll enjoy it.",Halloween

Keep in mind that it's Rob Zombies re-invention...not re-make. He made Michael the way that HE pictured him as. I'm glad he showed his childhood, it was always a mystery of why he was a psychopath killer and why he whacked his sister. Watch the movie..you wont be disappointed. There is one scene that'll make you scream like a little girl...the empty pool scene..just keep that scene in mind. All the old music is still there and they even added a little comedy in with it which was a good addition. The death scenes are probably the most brutal that i've ever seen in any movie. You will like this movie, if you take it as it is.",Halloween
800,HenryIV,Scout Taylor-Compton Too Good For Halloween,4,3 September 2007,"There was so much talk about Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Straude and ""Was she..."" or ""Was she not..."" good enough for this movie.I've been a big fan of Scout's for a while and have followed her career since her humble days on ""The Gilmore Girls"".I watched Halloween with much anticipation after having seen her in ""Tomorrow is Today"" for which she won Best Actress in a feature film from Method Fest 2007 (One of the most prestigious acting award in the business - from actors for actors).Unfortunately, I have to be honest, I was disappointed but not with Scout's acting (although I think she's done better work in other films) but with Rob Zombie's writing and directing.First off, I have rarely seen a film that delivers when the director is also the writer. The writing in this film was horrendous. The dialogue was so cliché and pointless. I think it's actually a testimony to Scout that she was able to make it somewhat digestible. She shined when she was unleashed and showed raw emotions (when Michael Myers chased her) but the rest is... forgettable. The problem is all actors (even the best of them) have so so moments and it is the directors job to help them through it - Rob Zombie is obviously an incapable director and the editor is just as bad. He also does not know how to make her look good. The choices of shots and close ups in the kitchen having breakfast were terrible! As a horror film director I think RZ is also mediocre. It was very predictable and not very creative visually at all.Bottom line, Scout is one of the best actors of her age and if she works with A-LIST directors the world will see her talents. Zombie is just an opportunist who might be a good musician but only relies on clichés from films he's seen before. He offers nothing new to the genre other than his catchy last name.Finally, Weinstein should be ashamed of himself to let this film's production schedule be so short. 8 months from shooting to release is crazy and the product suffered big time. These guys are only interested in $ and granted they're making plenty of it (with this film as well it looks like).If you want to see Scout's talent watch her in TOMORROW is TODAY. Scout, if you read this - I beg you choose your projects from now on very wisely. You have so much talent, don't waste it on crappy Blockbusters. Look at what happened to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Matt chose wisely and is now one of the top movie stars and he is here to stay. Ben, well... he's Jennifer's husband.A fan of Scout's.Henry.",Halloween

It is a movie that pulls no punches. I will give you this though. Some of it did not connect. Some of the details about Laurie strode being adopted could have been explained better and the reasons for Michael Myers to kill her friends is kind of a little weak, but it does make sense. The violence was not that bad. I mean some of it was suggested but you did not see every detail. They hid most of the violence with lots of wavy cam. It was very original, but he kept it close to the original one. And they make you feel kind of sorry for Annie, who in the original was a complete bitch. Lynda was made to be a bitch in this one.

802,Lunar-Raven,Halloween: Not a remake; but a re-invention,8,2 September 2007,"Overall, I found this movie to be a great addition to the Halloween series. While it may or may not be better than the original, I set out to view this movie as a stand-a-lone, and that's what I did. I can say though, that it's light years above the sequels..and really had it's own, strange but unique charm. And while this movie did have the Halloween basics, such as Michael Myers, the Doctor, Laurie, etc...it consistently maintained a very distinct style, and was truly an original piece. There were tons of new scenes, new story additions, and so much more. Along with that, each actor/actress in this film played their parts so well. From Loomis's role (played by Malcolm McDowell), to Laurie, and to even Sheri Moon Zombie's part as the mother, everyone embraced their character and delivered their parts amazingly. Between the good acting, compelling story, and intense content and ending...this movie has all of the qualities to be a great and classic horror film. From beginning to end, this movie had at the edge of my seat. At times I was intrigued, and at times I was horrified -- but throughout the entire thing, I was entertained. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good horror flick, or to anyone who is a fan of the Halloween series. I do ask though, that you watch this with an open mind. Do not go in expecting to see an updated replica of the 1978 slasher Halloween. If you do, prepare to be disappointed. The 2007 release of Halloween is far more than a simple remake -- it's a reinvention; a reinvention that's delivered in a unique and terrifying way.So..go see it!for the full review: http://www.mindfuse.net",Halloween

804,SCanfield20,"What boring, cliché junk.",2,3 September 2007,"I, like many people before me, love Halloween, and even all of its sequels. This monstrosity, however, is a slap in the face to not only John Carpenter and his Halloween story, but to horror fans in general, telling us we're all the same dumb morons that want to watch the same dumb crap over and over. Honestly, this feels like an FBI profiler's docu-drama on the life of Michael Myers, not the movie that showed his prolific killing skills and explained the absence of humanity in his character. This is not much better than those Dahmer, Gacy, or Bundy movies that came Direct-To-Video. They aren't bad, but they're telling us a story we already know, but dumbed down and explained for those that are too stupid. The emptiness of the character that is Michael Myers, The Shape, is what made Halloween a classic fright film. This is an obvious Hollywood money-making scheme, and practice for Rob Zombie to see how many breasts and curse words he could fit into a movie, again. Still, it gets two points for the use of the music, and the sudden brutality of the Myers character. Otherwise, my advice for Rob Zombie is to make an original movie, this is essential his third remake/ripoff. His first was a rehashed, weirded-out Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the second film a Manson tribute, and this, the third, doesn't even deserve to share the title with it's predecessor.",Halloween

I got a baby sitter for my daughter, and spent $12 on a movie ticket. I just wasted time and money.This movie is just another pathetic excuse for a remake. Not only did it lack originality, it lacked Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, and John Carpenter's brilliance. The movie didn't even CREDIT Carpenter for creating the legendary Michael Meyers.The first half is so slow you feel like falling asleep before you through the first fifteen minutes. It focused too much on Michael's home life that it son became all too clear what was going to happen.Each kill was completely predictable. You could look at a character, and know whether or not they were going to die, which killed the suspense like Michael kills the legendary Dr. Loomis, whom he first meets at 10 instead of 6.If you want my honest opinion, use your money to go see another movie, preferably one that isn't a sad excuse for a remake",Halloween

808,cusi1528,Best horror remake i have ever seen,10,31 August 2007,"In my opinion Halloween was the best horror remake i have ever seen. Rob Zombie did an amazing job retelling the terrifying story of Michale Myers. Every aspect of this film was great. I went to see this with high expectations and it did not let me down one bit. The only reason why people are bashing this is because it was a remake. If this was the 1st Halloween, or if Zombie decided to make a whole new killer, this would be ranked among the top horror movies of all time. In some peoples views it didn't develop the stories of the people 15 years later enough for us to care if they died. But this is the story of MICHAEL MYERS. Not of Laurie Strode and her high school friends. They built Michael up perfectly and Zombie truly reinvented a monster. It was so great to see why he became this ruthless killer and how he came across his accessories that he wears/carries. This was the best horror film i have seen in a very long time. The bottom line is this: if you have seen House of 1000 corpses or Devils Rejects and liked them even a little bit, you will love this movie. I would give House of 1000 corpses a 4/10, Devild Rejects a 6/10, and Halloween 10/10. Zombie is just getting better and better with every film he makes. I salute you Rob Zombie...this film was Amazing",Halloween

I watched it once when it first came out, and once today (because I am doing a review for my website ScreamHR). I'm only 27, but I seriously doubt I will watch this movie a third time before I die.If you are a Rob Zombie fan that worships him then you will love this movie; if you are anyone else you will hate this dumpster fire of a film.I will keep this short considering this movie came out 14 years ago.Rob Zombie ruins one of the greatest horror films off all time by trying to change what makes the story great. He also fills it with extremely vulgar dialogue that shows how little he knows about writing. If you read the script without nameplates you won't be able to tell which character is talking, because all of them say the same stuff.The only scary part about this movie is the fact that they let Rob Zombie make a sequel.",Halloween
810,commiejoe81,Would be fine if wasn't dubbed a remake...,7,31 August 2007,"Everyone is already up in arms about this movie spoiling the original and ruining the franchise. Speaking of which, did anyone enjoy H20 or Resurrection? I already know that most remakes do not do the originals justice, it's just a fact already proved by Hollywood over and over again. So I went into this sneak peak without the expectation that it will bring the franchise to new heights. If anything, I liked this movie unto itself, not as a homage to Halloween. It showed a boy growing up in a dysfunctional family, bullied a bit at school, overall screwed up already. Yes, it humanizes ""Michael Myers"", but so what, it's just a gore film, not terrifying, no pop-up slasher ah! situations, just gruesome. The movie starts out showing his childhood, bad home, bullies at school, likes to torture small animals. Killed his white trash(stepdad?) then his WT sister and her WT boyfriend. Takes place in the 70's. Second part of the film is him in the asylum, making creepy masks, killing a few people who disrespect him. Then finally the third part when he's grown up a bit (25?) he escapes and goes back to his hometown to kill some more people. Overall it's just a violent movie about a killer, not a serial killer, cause he doesn't stick to a certain type of victim (ie: babysitters), just a regular old ""kill everything that makes me mad"" guy. It's not a complicated movie, it's just as bloody as any of the other robzombie flicks. I like it on its own merit, not as a remake to the old Halloween. - Yes we all know you are connoisseurs when it comes to franchise movies, so please defend the Halloween collection with all your typing skills.",Halloween
811,barbarylane,Why make this film,5,14 September 2007,"Being a big fan of the Halloween films I was not happy that they were going to remake the first and best one. But after seeing the trailers I thought I would give it ago. Spooler alert The film seem to be more focused on the fact that Michael Myers comes from a very dysfunctional family and this is why is started killing. OK I could buy that. But from the start of the killing I thought it went too far with killing all but his mum and younger sister off. Then we see a lot of the movie set in the metal hospital with DR Loomis. Again I thought this went on too long. It was only the last 30 minutes or so that we jump forward to the adult Myers and him escaping out of the hospital. Now don't get me wrong I thought it was a good film, but no way was it as good as the original. It did give some interesting insight to the life of Michael . I also loved the fact they still used the ""Halloween"" music in this film",Halloween
812,cant_hardly_wait,A Horror... Or Porn??,1,8 September 2008,"Being a massive fan of all horror films and of course the original Halloween I just had to see this one! I added it to my lovefilm and waited patiently for it to come. Was I in for a shock. I managed to watch the film because I was ill and therefore had a day off of work. I needen't have bothered. The beginning was alright. Explaining how Micheal Myers had become the way he was. At this point I thought I was in for a real treat. An actual scary new release horror film. Here is where we saw the first bit of sex. No problem.. we can handle it, it was in the original. He kills his step dad brutally and then does the same to his sisters boyfriend and his sister. Brilliant! Then it moves onto Micheal and his life in the mental institution. I love the way they explain his whole background. We never had this in the original Halloween. Then he grows up. (ut oh!) and this is where the film takes a pornographic turn. Two 'guards' at the institution rape a girl in Micheals room. Therefore making him into a killing rage and he kills everyone and escapes to find Laurie. First kill... the couple were having sex, graphic sex I may add. The second kill the couple were having sex, again graphic sex. Of course these girls then have to die topless or completely naked and of course there has to be close up breast or butt shot. After all the sluts are dead the film gets a bit better again but the sex scenes just make this film Laughable. Can we not have a horror film without sex?! Or do we have to watch these thin blonde sluts walk around and die naked while destroying our favourite film genre?! If you're wanting a horror then stay away, if you're wanting porn go straight ahead.",Halloween
813,backdoc,"Very disappointed, this movie is sleazy/trashy, a classic has been butchered.",1,17 September 2007,"I just saw this movie and I am very disappointed. I had high hopes for this movie but I found this remake to be nothing but trash, Rob Zombie butchered this movie. I realize this was not meant to be a carbon copy remake but this movie is a disgrace to John Carpenters original. The first half of the movie, which you could call a prequel is nothing but a sleazy/trashy movie with some very terrible acting. The only decent acting comes from Danny Trejo. The first half of the movie is boring and makes Michael Myers out to be a product of his environment, white trailer trash. In the original he was pure evil making him not human, indestructible. The second half of the movie which is now 17 years later is better but it feels rushed because too much time was spent on developing Michael Myers back ground. The acting is improved but the characters are shallow, Dr. Loomis, an important character, is pathetic and unbelievable. The second half is nothing more than body counts, the suspense, the scares, and the eeriness are all gone. I would rather watch Halloween III before I would watch this garbage again. I sure hope Rob Zombie is not the future of horror movie making because I have seen his other movies as well and they are nothing more more than very low grade B-movies with some very terrible acting. Rob Zombie needs to stick to music and leave movie making to somebody who knows what they are doing. This movie is a disgrace to John Carpenters work.",Halloween
814,drichird,Don't treat us like children,3,12 April 2008,"There's a scene (actually one of many like this) where the old guard/caretaker/janitor who has known Michael for years is goaded by a new guard for being nice to him. Says new guard ""so you're being all nice to him, why, just because you've known him all these years..."". The new guard is not that new, or he wouldn't be so familiar with the old one. So he wouldn't state the obvious. Both guards know already why the old one likes Michael. ****SPOILER**** Then the cemetery scene, they're walking from the car to the mother's headstone and the caretaker says ""she blew her brains out must have not been able to handle being called the devil's mother"" or some such. Obviously, the director is explaining things to us through dialog again. All this would have been discussed between the two men when the visit was first being scheduled. ***END OF SPOILER*** When a director thinks so little of his audience that he uses his characters' dialog to spell out every little nuance or feeling or plot sub-twist in the movie, I feel like I'm being treated like a 5 year old. This is not unique to the film genre. TV commercials, billboard adds, politicians, all are talking to the public anymore like we are morons and every little thing has to be carefully spelled out for us. There's no more sophistication, no more finesse, no more letting us discover the obvious rather than spelling out every little detail for us. I'm sick of that kind of crap, so I stopped the movie half way through and returned it. Thank God for Netflix and Blockbuster Online, I now no longer feel the need to get ""my money's worth"" since each return brings another movie. I cannot give this movie a 1 because I didn't watch all of it and though the dialog rang horrendously untrue the depiction of blue collar hell in the beginning, some of the camera shots of the insane asylum, etc... warrant something in the 3 range I suppose. I have a very busy schedule and so will no longer sit through entire movies in that score range.",Halloween
815,ottimosoftware,"Great Movie, but not what America was looking for.",6,22 June 2008,"My opinion is that this is actually a really good film - I loved it. However, it's not what it's viewers want from a movie that's titled ""Halloween"" and is classified as a slasher film. Let me explain why.Rob Zombie goes in-depth to expose the deviance of the Myers family, and succeeds beyond expectations. As utterly repulsive as it is to the viewers, it should have been. This is the truth, and I commend Zombie for exposing it. He did this so well and despite all the glam that is almost required in movies, he really shows us the dirty, unkept home and the repellent white-trash that inhabits it. This puts him already ahead of the game.Furthermore, he really generated a feeling of depression within me seeing the mother's life fall apart. One of the most powerful scenes where when Michael stabbed the nurse with a fork in the throat, and the mother broken down crying - amazing (the siren was a great motif too).What is even better about this back story is how they connected Michael Myers in his youth, to the Michael Myers as the stalker. Honestly, it made me see Myers in a whole new light - something only a good director could pull off. Sadly, this made Myers less spooky.The cast acted great! Especially Daieg. Scout-Taylor Compton had an excellent scream, and I like how she was portrayed as almost a naught schoolgirl. Hah.What was ridiculous was the rape scene in the Mental Ward. I thought the director had to be obsessed with rape to include this. It was repulsive and unworthy of inclusion. It just wasn't nessecary and untop of that it was repellent. It made me feel awful. What isn't ridiculous is the speech between youth in the movie. Curse after curse is exactly how the ""bullies"" do it in this generation - so it was completely NESSCESSARY. Thank you Rob for not leaving that out. Also, Laurie calling Annie 'sexy' as a joke is even more of the dialogue you'd expect from the youth - and it's no big deal, it's great to include - it shows me the movie is real and not corny. Unfortunately, Micheal Myers stalking Laurie didn't send chills down my spine like the original did, there were only these 'suprise' moments when he comes through a window. The music wasn't up to par - some were just 3 second loops that were very annoying and others we're the original themes from the old Halloween. C'mon - shake it up a lil.The ending should have been much bigger, and it was almost comical. It almost seemed like Zombie was trying to attempt that ""Wait! I don't know if he died or not!"" ending - but failed miserably. It should have ended with Laurie slicing his head of his face, sure he might still be alive since he is immortal - but at least he'll be blind (then again, a headless Michael is even more terrifying).OVERALL - 6 Part I - 9 (Great exposure of family deviance) Part II - 4 (Unnecessary scenes, not much sustenance) Part III - 5 (Antagonist not spooky, ending not fulfilling)Writing - 6 (Not rich enough) Acting - 8 (Great performances all around) Direction - 7 (Good; but too much improv allowed) Music - 4 (Unoriginal, not rich enough) Cinematography - 8 (Nice tint, creative transitioning ideas)",Halloween
816,a_cacace926,"please keep in mind, this is rob zombie... not john carpenter",8,2 September 2007,"I expected nothing less than with this movie: Rob Zombie delivered. It veers away from the current stereotype of horror films and adds a truly deep emotional side to it. People criticize this piece saying that Rob Zombie doesn't know halloween and he slaughtered the series. OK. First, he's rob freakin' zombie, how would he not know halloween. Second, so what? From the beginning he has been saying that this film was going to be his version, how he visioned michael meyers coming to be. Originally this piece was going to be Michael Meyers vs. Pinhead, which I would put any money on saying that would have been dumb but fun. But the studio dropped that idea and went with Rob Zombie's knowing this. It maybe different than the originals, but the difference is better if you ask me. It is a rare remake in that it add more gore AND more depth, and strong depth at that. Calling this movie a horrible remake is coming from the ignorance in expecting this movie to be nothing more than a sequel, which it isn't. Overall I enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.",Halloween
817,pallet-ed_v_pimp_91,Halloween Is Good,8,8 October 2007,"All i have heard people say about this film is how disappointed they was or how Rob Zombie has spoiler it. I do totally disagree with these thoughts, because A, it is fairly scary, B it is violence and C, its has a lot of action.The film may not be the most scariest film ever but it has a few decent jumps and this is maybe the only thing it loses out against the original.As most expected it is violent, as seen in Zombie's previous film he likes violence and this is something that is present a lot of the time. Where as the original only has four killings in the entire film this has plenty more.The action is frequent with people being killed left right and centre which is a hard thing to find in a many horror films.How zombie has focused on the upbringing and early life of Michael myers is good cause it helps us understand more about his character. This also makes him more of a main character because in the original he just comes out every 20 plus minutes to butcher someone in this he has a lot more screen time.So if you are a fan of Rob Zombie and horror films go see this brilliant film at the cinema",Halloween
818,krazzyasswhiteboi,This is a very bad remake i might not ever be able to forgive Rob Zombie for this piece of crap,1,17 December 2007,"just awful just straight up awful. I would like to personally beat the crap ought of Rob Zombie for this movie. It is a slap in the face to the original. Not only do i believe the original never needed a remake , but if there had to be one i wanted a decent one. This remake is awful. There are to many plot holes to name, characters are dull, bad acting, badly written, and not to mention the fact that it had all the wrong ideas. I liked Micheal Myers better being the way he was in the original being mysterious and invincible, being evil. Now Zombie tries to put a more human touch to him, this (in my humble opinion) is just not good. It almost completely destroys the original but i am going to try forgetting it ever happened so i can still respect and enjoy the original.",Halloween
819,bob_hisey-1,Ending (potential spoiler),7,31 August 2007,"The movie wasn't all bad. When you go to see a Rob Zombie film, you know what you're getting yourself into and this is no exception. The movie does delve a bit too far into Michael's psyche but that can be taken in stride. The most disappointing aspect was the ending in my opinion. I thought for sure Zombie would take the classic ending of the original 'Halloween' and work with it (when Jamie Lee Curtis' character stabs Myers in the eye with the hangar, then just when you think the horror may be over Micheal sits up and the last struggle scene ensues, ending with Myers getting shot and disappearing, setting up an inevitable sequel.) But no, Zombie created a whole different ending with Michael being killed. Granted, he's not exactly looking for any sequels, but that ending is just too much of an important (and frightening) part of the original to just leave out.",Halloween

It just makes me sick how Hollywood staff seem to be running out of originality during these days, and they keep trying to revive movies that just can't live again. Honestly, I think there have been so many horror films in the history of cinema that it will seriously take more effort and ideas each day to make a distinctive scary movie. Maybe I'm just getting old and have seen too many films already, so I think I'll just shut up and wait for the remake of SAW I by 2015.",Halloween

I loved both of Zombies first films and was delighted to see him directing this film. If offers some thing new and different giving us a real insight into what makes Michael tick and the film really captivated me throughout. The acting may be a bit patchy in places but what horror films arn't. This is a really in your face brutal film and the violence seems endless and never lets off but thats what you surely wanted to see. Overall this is a great film, well made and fantastically shot. If you liked Zombie you will probably love this.",Halloween
822,mycrookedhat,I'm impressed.,10,31 August 2007,"Let me just start off by writing that I hate Rob Zombie's films. They're okay for gore but no plot what so ever. I'm a HUGE Halloween fan and have kept up with every detail and story line hence the fact that John Carpenter only did the first 2. (excluding part 3 because it is a totally different story. I still don't understand why there is a HALLOWEEN 3)Moving on, when I first read about Rob re-making Halloween, I was furious! Because he can't ever make a plot and I was already stuck with a story of Michael Myers and how part 6 explains that a voice just told him to kill his family. Despite that John Carpenter didn't write that. We fans all know that he had a low budget, it was 1978 so go figure. Of course Rob has a higher budget to add in more story.When I read that he was giving the mask a story and all that I was thinking to myself ""What the f***? Its just a star trek mask he steals from a hardware store"" and how he was only looking for Laurie because he loved her? I understand why now though. Lets all take a min. and forget that parts 3 up to resurrection were never made. When I was watching the movie and learning about his past, it made so much more sense. Rob made plot and the ending for this re-make, in my opinion, was perfect. You'll see why. And if some of you viewers are like me and take in for good plot WITH GORE of course, then you'll agree that this was much better than having to carry on a serial killer who dies over and over again. It gets annoying.The past story of Myers was amazing, I was almost in tears because it is so sad. Thats all i'm going to say about that. Now, i've carefully read other comments and everyone is jumping to conclusions that ""oh its all white trash, its all Texas blah blah blah, this is Illinois"" okay well despite my feelings for Rob's other movies, yeah he seems to have this fetish for SOUTHERN characters but for the record, people speak SOUTHERN everywhere in the country. So get over it. And we're not TEXANS. Some of us in Texas are Hispanic. Jerks.Okay well i'm getting off track here, so the past story was great, I think Daeg Faerch was perfect for the younger part and he's a very intelligent young boy for the film industry. I thought it was really cool that Rob used Danielle Harris in the movie and a few other familiar faces like Brad Dourif (CHILDS PLAY, AKA CHUCKY MOVIES) and usually I hate horror movies that always have sexual content so much but the original had it as well.I tried not to compare it so much to the original, because I wanted to see what Rob had in store. There were a few things that he did exactly from the original but he sorta switched it around but it was better and made more sense. You'll understand what I mean if you've seen the original as much as I have.Overall I was VERY impressed with what Rob did with this. I also LOVED! that the original music score was used. There were a lot of things that I just shouted out ""YES!"" with joy because I was so happy with the little things Rob left in.And its supposed to be similar to the original, it is a re-make. Most re-makes suck, like I said before I hate re-makes (except for THE OMEN) and I really hated Rob's films. Again, I was very impressed with this. Kudos to Rob Zombie. Thats all I'm going to say. I strongly recommend this movie for all eyes to see!Oh and one more thing, I NEVER GET SCARED when watching horror flicks, but there were a lot of spooks and jumps that gave me the chills. I went to sleep with my television on when i got home. Ha.peace.-Libby Lynn",Halloween
823,ncfmike18,It was so bad i think it gave me cancer,1,2 September 2007,"I thought Rob Zombie was bad at making music, than i watched this abomination to cinema. I thought that Blair witch project and Halloween 3 were bad, but this is just i don't know if their is a word to describe how awful this for lack of a better word ""movie"" was, How about i make a new one herendisgusting. Halloween is my favorite movie of all time. I am referring to the 1978 version of course. Donald Pleasence is probably rolling over in his grave thanks to this so called movie. Malcolm McDowell was an OK replacement but, Donald Pleasence performance can't be topped. This entire movie was bad, it felt forced from the Killings to the dialog The ""F"" word is used gratuitously It felt like i wasn't even watching Halloween at all . It was so bad it has actually taken away from the original, I think it may have given me cancer. If i had paid to see this i'd be so Mad it's unreal. To finish Don't watch this movie Ever even for free cause it will be a waste of time. I would have rather done just about anything else than watched this ""movie"" it would have been a better use of the time i wasted on it. Rob Zombie deserves to be punched in the face hard and multiple times for butchering a classic movie that didn't need to be remade P.S the nude scenes even sucked, and i think Danielle Harris is really hot, but her boobs are smeared with blood the whole time o yeah thats a real turn on.

824,hotguy353,I Spent $6.50 on this?,5,5 September 2007,"Okay, I'm not saying that this was a bad movie, but Rob Zombie should stick to music. Yes, it stays with the storyline of the original, yes it had several new scenes, and it unfolded in a different way, but it wasn't scary, every Halloween I've watched scared me at one point or another, in the original Halloween it was Micheal busting through the closet, and getting up after being shot and falling off of a balcony. Nothing in this one scared me.Pros.1. He used John Carpenter's original infamous ""Halloween"" theme song2. Tyler Mane's performance in portraying Michael Myers3. Filmed close to the original Myers house, how about that one eh?4. Following semi closely to the original storyline5. Learning about Michael's past*see the end for more.After watching and rewatching this movie, I realize there are not really that many cons. I went into the movie expecting a Devil's Rejects, or House of a Thousand Corpses, but surprisingly I didn't get that. It is a contribution to the Halloween movies. The original will always be better, but aren't they always?There is my take on it, a lot of you are wondering why learning about Michael's past is a good, and bad thing. Knowing how he became the famous killer we all know about made me kinda feel sorry for him growing up in a messed up evironment like that, no wonder he turned out bad, and it makes him less scary, therefore killing half the movie. However hardcore fans will want to know what made the young boy go bad, and I'd have to say I'd flip if I grew up like that too.

I have to say that i am not a big fan of the original. Slowgoing and hardly any action. This is much better. Zombie isn't the best director in town, but he makes what he want's to make. kudos! He just needs to get over having to use his wife every f*****g time he makes a movie. She's not an actress, get over it. I have a feeling he uses her so that she won't figure out for herself that she can't act. Because who else would want to use her??? William Forsyth is not a good actor. Where that rumored has come from i have no idea. He's a character-actor, but even they have make good films. He overacts most of the time. British Mcdowell is also not a very good actor. He's got this respect from people and he's supposed to be such a great actor. I have never seen that in anything he's done. He' just okay.Bringing Danielle Harris in was very cool. I love her! My favorite films of the series are 4 & 5 and i always love to see Harris on screen. And i got to see a lot of her this time :)I like little Myers. He acts pretty okay and i believe him. It justifies him killing all these people.The killings: I'm a very big horror-fan and after reading some reviews of this film i thought it would be over-soaked in blood. That it was not! I was hoping for much more graphic violence. It starts of good but then it Dem's down to close-ups of everything and you don't see what's happening. If this would have been SAW or anything i would have been furious! But this is Halloweeb and it works out great! Brad Dourif also set a good character. Love him!All together the film works.

826,rockinhorrorpunk,Halloween,4,1 September 2007,"This film wasn't as good as it could have been, it really didn't have the same feel as the original or the others for that matter. One of the only reasons why I thought it was half decent was because its part of the franchise.I don't think the whole first half of the film was needed or needed to be that long, I didn't like how they humanized Michael and portrayed his family, the only thing I personally liked was the scenes with him and his mother(her story) and of course the awesome Malcolm McDowell.Once the movie really starts going and he's loose, it really gets old seeing people killed almost the same way over and over again, and I don't think its a matter of being numb to the gore or violence you just get bored with it.The same goes for the sexual content. I did however, like the almost exact remakes of some of the original scenes, I thought that was great.The Theme music was pretty good, they added in a lot of those bizarre kinda screeching sounds which wasn't necessary, but still okay none the less. The over all themes could have been more powerful.I was really disappointed with the opening, I was expecting something at least a little like the original, maybe a pumpkin, some orange text, but hey I guess not everyone cares about stuff like that as much as I do. Also the camera work in this film isn't the best, besides a few scenes The frame is all over the place, I didn't know what I was looking at most of the picture, maybe some steadier shots would have been better.Over all and in conclusion, this was an okay picture.

829,chad-417,Genius!,7,31 August 2007,"Part of the reason I love this film is Rob Zombie. If you already look at him as something of an ""evil genius,"" this film will only reinforce that view.But first, I have a bone to pick with some other reviewers who complain that it ""isn't true to the original."" Here's a rather obvious question- if you think that the original is so perfect, then why do you ever bother watching a re-make? I mean, if you truly believe that the original can't be helped at all by being updated for a new era, then why watch this? Now for a few complaints.WARNING- I'VE ALREADY GIVEN A SPOILER WARNING, SO HERE'S ONE MORE.This film gives some background info on Michael, an depicts some of his childhood. Mike's back story contains a few disappointments. Mike Myers is a kid with an abusive, alcoholic step father, a stripper mom, and a slutty sister. He is also picked on a lot by kids at school.In Zombie's version, it is suggested that Mike's homicidal streak is, in part, attributable to his turbulent home life and the general abuse that he suffers. This actually takes some of the creepiness away from the story.But still, this isn't as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be. While its clear that Michael has a bad home life, his homicidal reactions to it are clearly the product of a dormant evil. And the punishments he doles out are far in excess of the wrongs committed against him. For example, Mike is bullied at school, and responds by stalking the Bully, then beating him to death with a stick. He takes his time and takes delight in doing it. In the original, the viewer was left with the impression that Mike was a the son of two model parents in a cute little suburban house who suddenly murders his sister and her lover. That's much more disturbing than what Zombie presents.And Myers actually talks to people and cries to go home in his first days at the mental institution. Up to a certain point, one can sympathize with him, which isn't quite as disturbing as a child who turns into a callous murderer.Also, the film takes a while to wrap up- the conclusion seems to drag out a little longer than it should, and I wasn't sure if Laurie fired one last shot into his head or not.But this is definitely worth seeing!",Halloween
830,rightunite,The Worst Of The Recent Horror Remakes,2,27 August 2007,"The original Halloween film created an almost perfect stalk and slash film which used tension and atmosphere to set the tone for a chilling Halloween night.No explanation was given or needed why this 10 year old boy killed his sister or became the crazed but emotionless psycho that we all came to know.Halloween 2007 decides that we need an explanation and spends half of the film trying to show us why Michael became what he did.His mum is a stripper, his dad a foul mouthed alcoholic and his sister a bit of a tramp (oh and he kills animals yawn).Instead of just killing his sister when he was kid he now kills everyone who opens their mouths in a bloody and brutal way (something the original avoided).It's almost half way through the film when we are introduced to Laurie and her friends and they have to be some of the most vile characters in the Halloween series.From this point on after his ludicrous escape Michael kills everyone in sight (i was half expecting the extras to get killed) and the film manages to miss the point completely of what Halloween was all about.The Dialog, the acting, the cinematography even the costume is all horrible and the directing is like a high school lesson in how to make a cheap horror film.It's a mess and a big one at that, the critics are going to have a field day with this.Evreyone had fears about what Rob Zombie would do to this film and unfortunately they have come true.Tension has been replaced by blood, murder and cheap thrills (i think the body count is about 5000).Leave well alone and rent the original",Halloween
831,dman_16,Worst Re-Make To Date,2,23 December 2007,"I think the film started out fairly promising. The original lacked a proper story of Michael Myers' story as a youth. But as soon as the main story line hit, where he's an adult the story just went down hill. the best description of this film would be a cross between a normal slasher/horror movie and a soft-core porn movie. The film just seemed to be an excuse for young girls to show their tits, ass, and in one case vagina, Then to see them brutally murdered, either fully or half naked. The movie on whole just seem to wear thin. It must be the only re-make of any movie where i like the original, with its poor sound and picture quality, better than the up to date with better the effects. Truly Poor.",Halloween
832,zeroend,A much deeper interpretation of John Carpenters classic.,7,1 September 2007,"Let me first start out by stating that if your not a slasher horror fan, then don't go see a slasher film! I see to many morons writing reviews on this site that don't respect the genre in the first place. I just saw Rob Zombies Halloween last night, and i must say that this is the version of Halloween that i've always wanted from seeing the original way back when. The deep back story that Rob Zombie creates for Micheal Myers is not only interesting but almost touching in a way. You develop a sense of sympathy and compassion for a little boy that was systematically created into a monster by years of physical and mental abuse. How many horror slasher films even attempt to go this far into the mind of their main killer? This movie is about Micheal Myers and for any other people that trashed this film for not going deeper into the development of the other ""side"" characters obviously didn't understand or comprehend the vision that Rob Zombie is trying to create here. The casting for this film was as good as Devils Rejects (even though a lot of the actors from that film are present here), and the casting of such a monster of a man to play Micheal Myers was part of the reason why this film is so effective. Each character fits perfectly into the dark and gritty world that the films presents. The scenes in which Zombie retained from the original film are more or less a tribute to John Carpender and are much more effective this time around. There's a bigger brutality to Micheal Myers , and his force portrayed on screen is horrifying. So, all in all, go see this movie, and be prepared to witness a different side of Halloween, which is all the more personal.",Halloween
833,pubcat997-1,Dreadful!!!,3,4 September 2007,"Okay, I'm a fan of both Rob Zombie and Halloween, so I was really excited to see the remake. Unfortunately this seemed to be more about recasting most of the actors from The Devil's Reject and teen porn. And in Zombie's own words this was supposed to explain how Michael came to be the scary killer. It didn't. Okay, so Mikey got picked on and was white trash. How does that create an oh so scary monster? I loved Zombie's other two films, but this one is not up to his usual standard. There was nothing suspenseful or scary about this one. The elegance of the original was definitely missing from the remake. You really don't give a hoot about any of the characters, with the exception of Dee Wallace Stone. She was the only one with any depth. Bad! Bad! Bad!",Halloween
834,mholt-9,Rob Zombie Rocks Halloween,8,9 September 2007,"I loved this slasher film and I have to say, I don't normally watch these boring films because they are tired and played out. I was really quite surprised that this film was actually very well done. Rob Zombie is a great musician and I really like his music and I am very surprised at his film skills. In this film he explored the background of Michael Myers and what makes a killer and I thought it worked. There was a story here and I really liked this version. I was skeptical for sure because I can't stand that Hollywood remakes every film and there is no creativity like there is in Foreign films or countries when it comes to making movies. Rob Zombie pulled it off he actually did, and I like his style. I loved his first film and I will be adding this to my collection.",Halloween
835,frisko78-1,How Remakes Shoud Be Done - Good!,8,8 September 2007,"This is a very good movie. Zombie doesn't disappoint with a carbon-copy of the original Carpenter's masterpiece, but gets you hooked by narrating the story of Michael Myers by focusing on his origin.This movie is very close to a prequel, it reminds me a bit of the feeling I had after watching ""Hannibal Rising"", it just gives you a background of a character that you've become familiar with.I understand people who say ""I don't want to know these things, the scary part of this is that we don't know why they are monsters, or even worse, if there is a WHY at all"".Then again, I find it creepy to be put in the position of thinking, ""I understand how it is possible for people to go completely crazy"".Anyway, this is a good movie, don't discard it as the latest boring remake, at least give it a chance. I wasn't disappointed.",Halloween
836,TasteForTheTheatrical,Tut Tut Rob Zombie...,4,29 May 2008,"Disappointment. Pure disappointment. When I heard Rob Zombie was 're-imagining' the classic Halloween, I was very sceptical to say the least. Look at Zombie's other movies, then look at Carpenter's original horror masterpiece. See any similarities? Me neither. Anyway, I waited until it came out and saw it as soon as I could... Oh my god, was a poor, poor movie. It has none of the feel of the original Halloween (or any of the sequels for that matter) and just feels like one of Zombie's exploitation style movies. This is definitely not what Halloween is about. Halloween (1978) was a suspenseful, tense, atmospheric slasher movie. This version, is a trailer trash filled so called shocker with no suspense or atmosphere, that is filled with foul language, white trash characters, and Zombie's 'trade mark' rape scene (though the one in this is just pure stupid and not disturbing at all). It starts off on the wrong foot by trying to give Michael Myers (the mysterious, silent stalker) a back story as a bullied little kid that kills small animals. A pathetic attempt at a back story for a start, but Myers should definitely not have one, that is part of his character. The rest of the movie (I won't spoil it for the people who actually wanna watch it) drags along slowly up until about half way through when it skips a few years and then the pace picks up. It picks up that much that none of the characters are likable at all, so you don't care what happens. The original had great characters. So this movie is basically a Rob Zombie special movie, with all the trailer trash actors he normally uses (including his wife who cannot act) and all the blood and guts and violence that is meant to be scary (but isn't at all) and when it comes down to it this film is just silly. Check the 'Love Hurts' montage and shudder. Do not watch this film unless you want a million reasons why Rob Zombie should never remake classics, stick with the excellent original.",Halloween

This movie feels like it takes forever, but it is definitely worth every second. I cant believe how satisfied I am after watching this. I was having flashbacks to the shining and many other older horror movies. The kid who plays michael puts the Damien Kid in the movie THE OMEN to Shame lol. I wonder what acting like a psycho killer in a movie does to a little kid like that. I guess only time will tell, but till then I will continue to think this kid needs to receive some type of reward for his excellent Acting O yea and God Bless you Rob Zombie Keep up the good work.",Halloween
838,thecrosseyedbear,An Outstanding Accomplishment,10,23 September 2007,"***May contain Spoilers*** I know i will be crucified by all of you John Carpenter fans out there, but i think that Rob Zombie's: Halloween is the most prolific and significant film of this franchise. As a horror film, this film delivered in every way possible. It had gruesome death sequences, gratuitous nudity and sex involving teens. I think it was a great prequel in the sense that it gave the viewer more insight as to what kind of home-life Michael Myers had. Now this portrayal is slightly different from the Carpenter version. Did the Myers' family live in suburbia? Yes. Was it a peachy keen lifestyle, No. Michael Myers is a supernatural being, but he was a boy on the verge of snapping. His step-father abused him, his mother was a stripper with more important things to do than pay attention to her animal mutilating son. Bottom line, the prequel followed the serial killer model.Now, as far as the latter portion of the film, it was superior to the Carpenter film, because the pacing was better. Not as much stalking, but that was always the most boring part of these films to me. Get with the killing already! This film had no problem being fresh, brutal, gory, psychological and thrilling. It was like no other re-hash i had ever seen. This franchise has produced some of the worst schlock in the history of motion pictures. This film has it all! Zombie even cast Danielle Harris (Michael's niece from Halloween 4 & 5, something the director of 6 failed to do) to be one of Laurie's slutty friends. We get to see her naked and get slashed, its great.Overall, story is great, pacing is great, casting is great (even Malcolm McDowell as Loomis), the dialog is realistic (as far as the garbage mouthed teenagers), high gore and death factor, all around a masterpiece. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this film to anybody's grandmother, it would cause a coronary.",Halloween
839,roozillah,Not as Good as I Had Hoped For,6,23 September 2007,"To preface: I like Rob Zombie. I really liked The Devil's Rejects and portions of House of 1000 Corpses were great. I'm also a big fan of early Carpenter work (though his entry into the Masters of Horror series is also pretty good), including the original Halloween. I'm not generally a nay-sayer on horror remakes and have been reasonably pleased with some of the recent ones such as Dawn, TCM, & Amityville.Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween suffers from two major flaws. First, the back story provided for Michael's home life reduces the tension and fear one acquires through the totally random nature of Michael's evil in Carpenter's original film. Second, the actress playing the role of Laurie Strode is completely unsympathetic because her dialogue is lame, her acting does not hold up to Jamie Lee Curtis's, and one doesn't get a real sense of her being anything other than a ""good girl"" who is somehow best friends with two amazingly slutty girls (if anything about their character ""development"" at all is to be taken as evidence of typical behavior).Aside from these very problematic issues, the movie is not wholly unenjoyable. Despite what many people have written in regard to the gore, I do think that it is effective in this film, and I think it is more reflective of what a purely evil character such as Michael Myers (a la the original) would be capable of. Let me just say that I think that the added gore is not horrifying, but it can exacerbate the amount of tension and alienation that the audience feels in relation to the person committing that violence. (Unfortunately in this film that alienation is reduced by the back story, or at least the back story works against configuring Michael as a purely evil figure, an avatar of hate.) I also believe that some of the elements and dirtiness of the film create a nostalgic sense of the 1970s, especially in the earlier parts of the film. This unfortunately dies away later, and is especially undercut by the relatively crappy wardrobe of the ambiguous time of Laurie Strode's adolescence. I say this because Rob Zombie seemed to straddle an odd desire to make the film more contemporary (a la Laurie's friend's cell phone) but also somewhat dated. Additionally, the wardrobe for Laurie in Carpenter's film felt classic, mature in some ways, and reflected Laurie's more reserved nature without having to have her engage in stupid dialogue with her two girlfriends.Another peeve: Sheri Moon. She plays white trash well, but I disagree with the whole idea of giving Michael that sort of a background, and it would be nice if Zombie could direct something that did not need to star his wife. I get that he likes her. I don't need to see her on the screen. I will say, however, that once the interaction with William Forsythe's character is at a conclusion, Moon seems to do a better job with the role, or at least she isn't written as ridiculously, and her suicide scene approaches being poignant and believable. I'd still rather have seen someone else in the role, and I would have definitely enjoyed a much better opening dialogue that did not have to rely on cheap shock, white trash stereotypes, and other such ploys as some sort of debauched humor gone wrong. In House of 1000 Corpses, it was funny, but Michael Myers and his family should not be turned into the Fireflys.My final comment is slightly positive. There are a wonderful number of excellent actors in this film. Unfortunately, their screen time in comparison to Scout-Taylor Compton's is minimal, which is a travesty. Some of the highlights of the cast include: Malcolm McDowell (his role is not as well-written or sympathetic as in the original), Brad Dourif (See The Exorcist III for a film that allows his talents to be much more effectively showcased), William Forsythe, Udo Kier (tragically underused!), Clint Howard, Danny Trejo (one of the few small roles that is given some legitimate time), Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, and Ken Foree (whose talent is also tragically wasted in this film). If Zombie or his casting agent had spent half the time casting Laurie's part as they did rounding up all these actors for bit parts, the overall effect on the film could have been to produce much more legitimately terrifying story, even if Zombie turned Michael into a screwed up white trash kid who turned into a psychopath because his ""dad"" was a verbally abusive crippled pervert.",Halloween
840,famezo12,Next: Rob Zombie tries to re-write history-outcome-FAILS,1,25 September 2007,"I don't know what Rob Zombie was thinking, you cant just rewrite the whole story line, especially for a movie that has been around for so long. Rob Zombie ruined the image that scared us all, Michael Meyers being born with his insanity, and having no reason behind it, thats what scared me, but Rob Zombie decided there HAD to be a reason for his insanity. He changed so many things, it just makes NO SENSE, in the first Halloween two people, a man and a woman(I'm assuming his parents) come home in business suits to their nice home, but in Rob Zombie's version his mom and dad are lowlife hippies. I can go on and on, even the fact that Laurie is a slutty ditz in this one, yet she is a nerdy geek in the original...What have you done Rob Zombie? Oh yea, now I remember house of 1000 corpses...STAY AWAY from Hollywood you terrible excuse for a Director and Writer!",Halloween
841,stevo711,Relax! It's a remake but fun to watch if you let it be fun.,9,26 October 2007,"Yesterday I was finally able to watch Halloween when it opened in German cinemas. If you want to watch Halloween in Germany look out for a cinema that shows the original with subtitles. The dubbing appeared to be better than it seems to be from the trailer but still some things stupidly translated.Anyway, now to the movie itself. I have read lots of the comments here before I watched the movie. I am a big fan of the original but I have to admit it is not a holy cow for me. I had mixed emotions about Rob Zombie's version, especially after reading the comments.This premake first takes you into the childhood of Michael Myers. I really liked that part of the the movie. Actually the first movie never told if Michael comes from a white-trash family or if he just snapped although he was living a normal childhood. This was completely up to Rob Zombie and I think it was a great idea for part 9. BIG PLUS: The acting performance of Fearch, Moon-Zombie and Forsythe was brilliant. Interesting part. LITTLE MINUS: ""Love hurts"" was a gooey and I didn't like (turning) shots into the trees during the wood scene.The sanitarium part was quite cool and disturbing and lead over to the second part. In my opinion it was very interesting to the watch the remade part. Rob Zombie gave it his own handwriting. All in all this was a lot faster than in the original. The characters weren't as lovely as in the original Halloween but haven't Annie and Lynda been bitches ever before? They were just not as vulgar as we got to know them in the Zombie version. BIG PLUS: Very up-to-date characters and looks LITTLE MINUS: The stalking scenes were not scary enough.Yes, the movie is gory and violent. For me as a classic horror/splatter fan it was nice to watch because in my opinion it didn't push violence like other current horror productions (to mention a few: saw, broken, hostel...). It was disturbing without making you sick.Rob Zombie's version of Halloween is fun to watch if you take it easy. I think that fan of classic horror have seen way more disgusting and violent movies. It is what it is - a remake (at least part of it). And it matches with a huge classic. For me that is not a reason to rip it apart. I liked it!",Halloween
842,PF4Eva,"Great for what it is, but the 2009 sequel tainted it",6,4 July 2008,"**UPDATED: 2013**I am re-evaluating Rob Zombie's Halloween nearly six years later. Today, it is difficult for me to review this film without reviewing its inferior sequel, 2009's Halloween II.I first saw Rob Zombie's Halloween in September 2007 during its theatrical run. By then, everybody else had already seen it. The film received many mixed and negative reviews upon its release, but grossed $80 million worldwide and roughly $60 million domestically.When I saw it, I was absolutely sucked into the film, the story, and the characters. The film opens with a prose quote from Dr. Sam Loomis (Played in the film by Malcolm McDowell); this quote is very Loomiseque, and in the spirit of Donald Pleasence's portrayal of the character in the previous films.Daeg Faerch is absolutely brilliant in his first major movie as young Michael Myers. He disappears into the character and expresses every possible emotion convincingly. I felt that he had a long career ahead of him, the potential of which he still has yet to fulfill in 2013. It was a huge mistake for Rob Zombie to replace him with Chase Wright Vanek in Halloween II.Sheri Moon Zombie was very good as Michael Myers' mother, Deborah, a woman who has lost almost everything. The Halloween II ghost/hallucination version of the character doesn't hold a candle to the more down-to-earth portrayal in the 2007 film.Malcolm McDowell is a good enough successor to the late Donald Pleasence as Dr. Samuel Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist, who is assigned after the massacre on Halloween Night. Loomis learns during the 17 years of knowing Michael that he is dealing with evil, yet he shows sympathy for Michael, and the two form an unlikely bond at Smith's Grove Warren County Sanitarium. McDowell doesn't surpass Pleasence in this film, and especially not in the 2009 sequel. Loomis was one of the more ""likeable"" characters in Halloween II, and he was a complete jerk from start to finish.Danny Trejo deserves praise for playing the sympathetic janitor at the Sanitarium, a kind of caretaker for Michael.The entire cast was impressive in this first go-round: Faerch, McDowell, Moon Zombie, Trejo, the late Richard Lynch, Ken Foree, Danielle Harris, Skyler Gisondo, Jenny Gregg Stewart, Darryl Sabara, etc. Scout Taylor Compton stars as Laurie Strode in her breakout role, taking over the iconic Jamie Lee Curtis role. Tyler Mane is terrifying as adult Michael Myers, and brings back everything that was once terrifying about the character in John Carpenter's 1978 original. However, the same can't be said for Mane's Myers in Halloween II, which was nothing more than Zakk Wilde as a hobo wearing a hood and Myers mask. Also, Myers SPOKE (!!!) in the latter film's director's cut, telling Loomis to ""Die!""Kristina Klebe plays P.J. Soles' Lynda as a cute but tough (and foul-mouthed) cheerleader and friend of Laurie and Annie (Danielle Harris). I liked her a lot, actually.Rob Zombie's writing and directing are surprisingly impressive (considering the massive drop in quality in the 2009 followup), re-envisioning John Carpenter's horror masterpiece classic, and adding his own unique twist on the story. Zombie also adds a prequel element to the film, where we get to know young Michael, Deborah, stepfather Ronnie White (William Forsythe), Judith (Hanna Hall), and baby ""Boo."" Luckily, Zombie doesn't give a firm reason (per se) for Michael's nature. Unfortunately, this does not carry over to Halloween II, where Michael and Laurie share visions of their mother and Young Michael (Chase Wright Vanek)... and a white horse. Really?!Tyler Bates' musical score is outstanding, whether he's reinterpreting Carpenter's original themes or adding his own original music. The soundtrack is full of great classic rock and the songs were chosen wisely. I must admit, though, that great songs and music did creep into the otherwise dreadful sequel.When I first watched the Unrated Director's Cut of RZH1, there were longer scenes, and switched scenes. The film is still effective, whether it be the Theatrical Cut or the Director's Cut. The most notable of these changes is how Michael escapes.Halloween II ruined the remake somewhat. I cannot watch the 2007 film without sneering contempt for Rob Zombie and Chase Wright Vanek. Ditto the special features on the DVD.All in all, while not surpassing the Carpenter original, Rob Zombie's Halloween is a solid remake, unfortunately squandered by a sequel that should be avoided like the plague.",Halloween

Rob Zombie did a great job. The performances are great. And it is greatly re-imagined. What I loved was that it was its own film and not an imitation of the original like the PSYCHO remake. The story is the same but it is very different. We see Michael's homelife. We see what he goes through in Smith's Grove. We see his escape.And much more.The actors were great.Malcolm McDowell is wonderful as Dr. Loomis. Michael is perfectly played by Daeg Faerch and Tyler Mane. Sheri Moon is great as Michael's Mother Deborah. The Beautiful Scout Taylor-Compton is Terrific as Laurie.

But this is not so much a re-make as it is a re-invention. I am happy that Rob was chosen to do this because not only am I a fan of his (We both have a love for horrible b-movies) but he is a fan of the genre and knows what the fans want to see while keeping in touch with his own vision. I was glad that they chose to shed some light on the past of Mike Myers and clued us in on his screwed up family life. Now we know why he was so crazy! This movie will never replace the original and I don't think that was ever the intention. But its been a long time since the original was released and there is a whole new audience of horror fans out there who will never get to experience what it was like to see the original in theaters and this is probably as close as it will get. I thought the acting was good and it was cool to see some familiar faces from other Zombie films. The horror and brutality was relentless and they actually made Mike Myers creepy and scary once again. There are many people who make horror films and are afraid to go that extra mile for fear that it might make someone upset but that is what horror is all about, getting scared and having fun doing it. I mean look at the sequels that came out after the first two original films, they were horrible! They tried to make Mike Myers into another Jason or Freddy, when he is really the one who started it all. I mean what the hell, they had friggin' Busta Ryhmes fighting Mike Myers karate style in one movie and in another one his mask was CGI for god sakes! At least Rob is keeping it real in his version. Anyways, if its not what you expected then thats fine but I think Rob did an awesome job of adapting his vision of what he thought a modern version of Halloween should be and he should get more credit than some people give him. I think in the years to come, when he produces more films, people will see that he is a capable director and they will look back on things like The Devils Rejects and Halloween and House of 1000 Corpses and see where it all started. If you don't like this movie, that doesn't make you any less of a horror fan but I think people should at least give it a chance. Besides, I don't think everyone is into his style and it seems like right now, only some of us can really appreciate the fact that he is trying to keep classic horror alive and well but with a modern mask...",Halloween

Scout in the role of Laurie was not real.. horrible. Zombie didn't do anything new with Carpenter/Hill characters. He brought much more violence( and his wife ) in the film but violence is not = horror .

846,nathan12,Zombie got it right! It's a MYERS film all the way.,8,2 September 2007,"I am a huge fan of the original Halloween. It is easily in my top 10 films of all time. When I heard there was going to be a ""re-imagining"" I was like...""what!?"" When I heard it was being directed by Rob Zombie I was like...""hmm."" I have never seen any of his previous films but I heard he was a fan. That's a good sign. If you are a fan then you probably want to get things right. (although the Psyco remake...anyway) You would certainly want to get the mask right, the music placement, the physical size and movement of Michael Myers and include those moments where Michael seems to blend in with the shadows. Rob Zombie delivers and then some!The ""then some"" I'm talking about is the entire opening of the film (approx. 1hr) which is dedicated to Michael's dark upbringing all the way to his years in the Haddonfield Psychiatric hospital where he is basically raised by Dr. Samuel Loomis played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell, especially in his long-hair years. You see what Sam Loomis was like before all the mayhem. Maybe he was grooming Michael for a ""best seller""? Zombie does a thorough job of explaining The Mask but more importantly The Man that Myers will become. It is in this first hour where we see the true talents of Zombie's directing skills. His coverage of scenes and framings kept my friend Derek and I looking at each other saying ""this is awesome."" And it was awesome. There is a specific moment where the guards are entering Michael's cell. Michael stands up, beyond the frame, and he looks massive. Oh my god. This guy (Zombie) got it right!The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the casting of the ""3"" girls. Maybe if I end up watching it as much as the original, they'll grow on me. It's not that they weren't good, it's just that Jamie Lee Curtis ""was"" Laurie Strode. The original 3 very much had their own personalities where these girls seem to be very similar. But the focus is NOT the girls in this movie, it is a MYERS film all the way.",Halloween

I have seen a few I didn't like but this easily takes the cake. Mindless killing for no reason, not much of a plot, terribly stupid characters not to mention incredibly messed up ones in some parts, and bad acting. Not to mention the boy who played Michael in the beginning was incredibly obnoxious along with his horrible family. Seriously what type of mom puts up with that type of father. I know there are drunks but he just totally killed it. I have to say this movie didn't seem to be the least bit scary either and was extremely predictable. Shots from the front of characters in some parts would just suggest a brutal stabbing coming from behind moments later. Also, how on earth did Michael grow into a massive 7 foot tall monster... where they letting him work out while he took breaks from making masks??? In the end as well why did Michael seem to give a moment of mercy towards his sister, when earlier he killed the Mexican jail guard who had been nice to him his whole life... All I can say is that Rob Zombie should take a permanent break from movie making.",Halloween
848,mayorofshembo,Not so freaking bad.,7,3 April 2008,"I'm giving Halloween a 7. Spoilers below.Before I'm up to my eyeballs in the comments, I'd like to mention the original may very well be my favorite movie ever. This is not the same movie, sure. Is it as good as the original? Hell no. Are the girls annoying? Yes. Is Michael really the same? No. One of my favorite parts of the original is making the connection, as a viewer, that Michael is Laurie's brother. THAT was frightening. But really, this movie was not all that bad. The beginning was good, if eventually a bit slow, but it provides some nice character development on the killer. While we may not agree with that characterization, it was clearly the intent to give ol' Mike a more serial killer aspect than we may have seen in the past. The soundtrack is solid, but the other characters are forgettable. Most of them die anyway. The script is alright, but just alright. This review may seem a bit negative, but you'd mislead yourself to expect this to be the very same Halloween John Carpenter had made years ago. It contained a bit more sex than I would like, but sex is important to a good slasher. It should watch like an urban legend (Not the movie Urban Legend though, please). Otherwise, there's style here. If you saw Rob Zombie's other films you may know what to expect. Otherwise, its a solid slasher. Tyler Mane's a bit tall, but his body language is perfect. I nearly roared when he tackled Laurie. In the end, it was not perfect, and less than I expected maybe, but its a solid effort in the wake of today's terrible horror films. I didn't feel like I wasted my ten bucks. My point is, I guess, it'll be good if you expect the changes. If you want it to be the original, just watch the original instead.",Halloween

Then When the movie was finally released and I was seeing decent grading for it, I said that I would give it a try. PLEASE DO NOT FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE. All I can say is thank god that I was able to find a version of it for free online. I felt bad watching this movie on my computer because i felt that i was making my computer suffer through it too. It was not worth the electricity that it took to control my computer. Everything about this move is wrong. OK Laurie was not a stupid typical blonde girl, she was a nerdy little school nerd. She was one of those hot nerdy girls and that is why people liked her. The Laurie in this film was one of those hot girls you want to look at but never hear words come out of their mouth. The movie was far to gory which Hitchcock would call an atrocity. The jump at you scenes made me laugh, and Michael made me want to jump off a cliff. In short the movie was terrible and worth nothing. I would rather sit through Ishtar for three weeks straight then ever watch this movie again.",Halloween
850,cyanidesyn,"Not A Review, Just My Opinion",8,12 February 2008,"i thought this movie was great, wasn't perfect, but i enjoyed it a lot. from the other reviews i have read of this film it's people saying it was a terrible remake, so i'm assuming they are fans of the original. As far as i can tell this isn't exactly a remake, It's director Rob Zombie's version of the film. It's how the story of Mike Myers plays out in his head. If you're yet to see this film and you've seen the original i suggest you try not to compare the two and just watch it to be entertained. It's not like this was ever intended to be a master piece of film making, It's Rob Zombie for Christ's sake. He makes movies the way he wants to make them. He's a big fan of the old B-Grade horror and the exploitation films of old that were based purely on gore and surreal situations and characters. Look at House Of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects, It's so over the top. That's why i love him. It's not meant to be perfect, It's not meant to be suspenseful. It's meant to be a film for people that are like minded to him. Unless you love films like that i think it's a bit hard to appreciate anything Mr Zombie does. I liked the movie, I'm sure quite a few of you will too. All i suggest is go into it remembering it's made by Rob Zombie so it's obviously going to be over the top and it's not meant to be a direct remake of the original so don't expect that. Honestly does anyone want to see anything directly re-made? unless they use the same basic story and change it to their views its going to be a load of something rather unpleasant.

I actually i'd love to be able to do that to you myself. You bloody wasted two hours of my life. You have no GD idea how to make a film...Completely Sh#$ of a movie. The cast, especially the little prostitute who incessantly screams at the end of the movie, should never have been born. This is one good reason why we should be grateful for sites like thepiratebay.com. I can see that the movie must have used a budget no more than $10.000 US, $1.000 of that must have been used to hire USD $50 prostitutes, and i'm not talking $50 per hour that's for the entire film. You can get some idea on how cheap these whores slash actors are.",Halloween

I have no clue how to write a movie. If I ever participated in a Project Greenlight or any other movie making competition, I'd be voted off the island, booed off the stage, I would not be your American Idol, I would stop dancing with the stars, I just plain wouldn't win, and hopefully I would be duct taped up forever, and the U.S. government would pass a law forbidding me to ever make a movie again."" There was a time when horror movies were in some way a morality tale-good versus evil. But this movie was evil vs evil. There were perhaps 2 people that you might feel any amount of sympathy towards when they are killed. That is a huge problem for a horror movie. Also the issue that common sense does not exist for many of the characters, that too is a problem. The movie itself was more so Halloween: The Michael Meyers story. Michael's sister, Laura, was hardly even developed, and what part her character was developed, it was done so poorly. I can't feel sympathy for a character I don't even know or feel an attachment for, and thus, you fail in what you're trying to do, which one would assume is get you to feel a connection to these people.The main person you feel a connection to is Michael, and that's not a good connection. Partly you feel sorry for him, the other part, you despise. In short, just o rent the original, it's not so great either, (for it's time it was)but it's way better than this.",Halloween
854,graeme-steele,Worse than most of the Halloweens,4,1 September 2008,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***when i first saw that a Halloween remake was coming out i thought this may be a gd movie 2 watch but i was sadly disappointed. After just watching the brilliant original Halloween movie i decided 2 watch the remake and compare them which i did. This remake of the classic horror film is terrible the kid Michael Myers was 1 a terrible actor and 2 very badly shown 2 be Michael Myers u would never even guess that the wee boy is Michael, another point in this movie about Myers in this film that his scaryness is distroyed,is slow walking (which he does in all the other halloweens) is gone scary tension was gone coz they decided 2 make myers a bloody speed walker and this Myers is basically a baby compared 2 the original Myers. Moving on from the terrible Myers 2 the OK Loomis, i have 2 say Malcolm McDowell did a gd job playing loomis but i have 2 say Donald Pleasance is Loomis. Now on to Laurie Strode which was basically killed in this film coz Jamie Lee Curtis is a far better actress than Scout Taylor-Compton(whoever the hell she is) jamie lee curtis created a character that was perfect but Scout Taylor-Compton destroyed what Jamie Lee Curtis had created for Halloween fans. This sex say faggot more times than i say ""is"" in a year which is unbelievable and the swearing does not suite this film come on it may be a horror film but it doesn't need 2 have every1 swearing there heads off at nothing. y the hell does a guard rape a person in the hospital y his m8 is just calling Myers a faggot thank god Myers killed them. and if John Carpenter saw this he would be hugely disappointed 2 see his classic horror be destroyed by this remake if i were a horror fan i would recommend that u don't watch this Halloween, Halloween 3 or Halloween resurrection coz they all have 1 thing in comman there's no point in them.",Halloween
855,bigstorm79,I thought the movie was awesome,9,10 July 2008,"I think the reason why (in my opinion of course) is that everyone was expecting a carbon copy of the original. That film is one of my favorite horror movies of all time, I am getting that out of the way. I went into this movie removing that from my mind, as from Rob Zombie's previous movies, I knew what to expect from him. His movies have that raw feel to it, so I knew thats what it was going to be. He basically remade the movie, only from the point of view of Michael Myers, not from the Laurie Strode point of view from the original. From that, I thought it was a good homage to the series. The reason for the ending, is that Rob Zombie did not want a sequel. If I am not mistaken, and correct me anyone if I am wrong, but I heard or read somewhere that John Carpenter did not want a sequel but was pressured to do so. Anyway, thats my opinion of the movie, and the fact that people call it a travesty, I think is unfair, no remake is better than the original, but I thought it was a good movie.",Halloween
856,jgaugh,"Bad Ending, great movie!",9,3 August 2008,I've always been a fan of the Halloween movies and after the last one they made this is a huge improvement. The film is a lot easier to understand than the other ones. (I love the other ones!) One of the things thats very interesting in this movie is Micheal's past. The film goes back to when he's a kid living in a bad environment. One of the best performances in the film is Sherri Moon Zombie's role as Michael's mother who is trying to support her family and drunk boyfriend. What I wasn't happy about was that I didn't get scared but it's not because of the movie it's because I've seen the other Halloween movies over 15 times. The Real thing I was upset about is that they make Michael in a way look like a good guy. In an alternate ending which after Dr.Loomis convinces Michael to surrender he lets Laurie go and since Michael left Sheriff Bracket's daughter for dead the sheriff orders the entire Haddonfield police department to open fire on Michael killing him (yes killing him) in the processes. Then Loomis and Laurie are upset that Michaels dead. They cut that from the movie though. Everything else is great!,Halloween
857,fur_fighter,An actually scary horror movie.,10,16 November 2009,"This is my first review here, there seems to be a lot of negative comments here about this great remake. Rob Zombie has expanded and added some psychological thriller to the predictably boring horror genre.First of all this is the only horror movie since, The Cell that I've found even slightly scary. People around here act like they wanted another boring rehash like the awful Friday the Thirteenth remake. (It probably got more positive reviews here...) Anyway. I really enjoyed this film and it's getting a reputation at my video store for being an actual good horror movie :Gasp: Aside from the degrading slightly into old predictable territory at the end this is an above average horror flick. I give it an 9/10. Great job Rob and crew.",Halloween

But when I heard they were coming out with a remake, I was skeptical. Most remakes that I've seen over the years are a disaster..especially horror films. But while flipping through the channels one day, I saw the previews for the movie and decided to watch it. And I was impressed. I loved how Zombie went back to Michael's childhood. Zombie really did make this film his own. Yes there is a lot of profanity in the movie, but if that doesn't bother you, then you should definitely check this film out. Now, this movie all great though..there were some parts where I was just like..really?? I still love the original Halloween of course..but if you want more action and a better view on Michael's early life. I give this film an 8 out of 10.",Halloween
859,nwallis1991,Give the man the credit he deserves...,8,15 October 2008,"A lot of people go off about how they ruined the classic and this wasn't scary and it was just disgusting and that there wasn't any personality to Michael in this.Are you kidding me? Was the old one scary? No, not at all, it was just like this one but this just gets into more depth. I do hate the theatrical version compared to the Director's Cut. Such as the part where Linda randomly grabs the girls drink and pours it on her head. There were scenes I liked in the theatrical version that they took out in the Director's Cut but still made it work.Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is the same in my opinion with a lot more depth into the character of Michael Myers. Although I didn't like the change of Laurie and how she acted, especially with the bagel part. No one acts like that around their parents and it just seemed immature. Even though, they summed up how kids act today, either mysterious, or immature and very sexual.I love both versions but I would have to say this brought back the ""scary"" in ""Halloween"" although I didn't actually get scared in any of them. I thought it had a more darker setting and mood, which I really thought made this great. The old ""Halloween"" was just like most slasher movies where there's no reason why he killed, he just did it and then gets out and goes after Laurie. This one gave more emotion to the movie with the way his family treated him, and after not being with Bo after the incident he wanted to find her and be with her because he loved her. It was the only family left and he didn't want to be alone.I was very pleased with the costume addition in this movie. I liked the way the mask was, it wasn't so plain, and sitting under boards it would obviously get a bit worn out. I liked that they showed him get his clothes and mask, I wasn't pleased with the old one with the ""Oh no! Someone broke into this hardware store and stole a mask and some clothes.""I like Rob Zombie and I think he's very underrated. Great movie, 8/10 from me.",Halloween
860,ice-tkolsby,Started Off Nicely,7,19 February 2009,"I think most effective part of this movie by far, was the first 45 minutes exploring the childhood of the young Michael Myers. Once the movie goes into present day the story line falls apart and the movie does not work. Many people believe that Michael Myers should be left a faceless killer. A boogeyman with no reasoning, but that was John Carpenters vision. That's how he decided he wanted the movie to be. This is Rob Zombie's vision. This is the way he wants to tell the tale of Michael Myers and this is how he does it. A shot for shot, scene for scene sequel is boring. you might as well watch the original. That is why this works. This is so different and original that it just is not the same movie. Once the movie begins to go into the present day, and become John Carpenter's Halloween, it spirals into a downward fall and crashes. It is cut down too far and goes too quickly. Scout Taylor- Compton plays a good Laurie Strode and works for the part. The acting is overall good except for the star of the film Malcolm McDowell. McDowell's Loomis in this movie is completely inferior to Donald Pleasance in the original Halloween, which is completely unexpected seeing McDowell in other films. He did not play Loomis how he should have been played. So on a scale of 1 to 10, I give Halloween 7 stars.",Halloween
861,The-Remar,What a shame,1,14 December 2008,"Only 17 to this day i watched the original Halloween when i was very very young perhaps too young and it terrified me. When i first heard about the Rob zombie remake i was so excited that my favourite killer Michael Myers was going to be reborn. Unfortunately to put it simply this film was a disgrace , Rob Zombie attempts to give reasons of why Michael is the demented killer he is. So he throws him in a red neck family which i just found a seriously weak story line. Seeing so many scene of Michael as a child just makes it less and less scary as we almost get to know the killer and begin to sympathise with him . Rob Zombies portrayal of Mike as a child was completely inaccurate and he made this worse by trying to input his own interests into the character of mike as Mike is some reject rocker with long hair who wears ""KISS2"" t-shirts personally this did not scare me and i just saw the young mike as a fat loser reject. The rest of the film was equally made as bad by Zombies fetish for gore and if anyone has actually seen the original and reading this should know that it does not create fear by gore and neither does this film. A laughable remake if you are seeking the same thrills that the original gave you do not watch this film it will destroy the memory you once had of the classic. One of the worst remakes iv ever seen with cheap thrills, what a shame",Halloween
862,IxTrixle187,One of few remakes to surpass the original,10,16 July 2010,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is by far better than the original. That's not to say that John Carpenter's Halloween wasn't a good movie it wouldn't be a horror classic if it wasn't, but it's kind of boring after you've seen a few times. Being John Carpenter's most prolific film doesn't make it his best. Horror remakes tend to get a bad rap but this one has been by far the most harshly criticized. Mostly for not being enough like the original Michael Myers in the original is a vague and unexplained it worked well in the first film, but after four sequels we were all left with same questions why is trying kill Laurie Strode and Jamie Lloyd? Why doesn't he die? it's not until the sixth installment 'The Curse of Michael Myers' that we are finally given a something of an explanation for the past four films. Rob Zombie's Michael Myers is more human and grounded in reality. He has depth,emotion,and a past. Rob Zombie's Michael Myers is more memorable as his child self in the first act of the film as we follow him on his journey into the abyss. Showing us all the external influences like Mom's abusive boyfriend, The bully, and animal mutilation. Presenting Michael Myers from a more clinical perspective rather than just a mysterious killer in the shadows.Scout Compton's Laurie Strode is also a dramatic improvement over Jamie Lee Curtis. She's more attractive, More energetic, and just over all more likable and less boring. Malcolm McDowell's Dr.Loomis is equally as good as Donald Pleasance despite being completely contrast from one another. Original Loomis was frightened and dedicated to stopping the madman. McDowell's Loomis is an arrogate press hound.The storytelling is also much better and the body count is satisfying large. With nothing but great performances from the supporting cast including horror greats such as Brad Dourif, Dee Wallace,Ken Foree,and series veteran Danielle Harris, along with spectacular performances by William Forsythe, Sherri Moon, Lew Temple and Danny Trejo. This is a brilliant Reinvention in league with the other great remakes like John Carpenter's 'The Thing, and Scorsese's Cape Fear",Halloween
863,jonomanley,Good to a point...,4,10 September 2007,"When I walked out of this movie, I couldn't think of a way to describe it. I was racking my brain for the words that would suit how I felt about it. Then my girlfriend said...""Yunno, the original had a lot more class..."" Then it hit me. Unclassy. That's it. This movie started out very well, with the back story of Michael Myers life before he started killing people. Then, as soon as it switched to 15 years later, it all went downhill. I really tried as a fan of the originals to give this a chance, but it was just a big mess of T&A and cameos. I say if you can make a movie and not focus half the movie on someone's boobs, you're a great director. The original had class and went for atmosphere rather than cheap scares and cheap thrills. Horror is in a decline, and it's the fault of people like Eli Roth, Rob Zombie and other people who loved old horror movies and are trying to redo them with their own style. If you love old horror movies, leave them alone. Let them be old and admire them for the campy, low production values. Stop remaking movies, and make something new and wonderful. You have the talent...use it.",Halloween
864,creepinthecellar,Why Is Rob Zombie Putting Otis Driftwood in a Michael Myers Costume? A Letdown to Say the Least...,4,7 September 2009,"I went into the film with high expectations seeing as though Rob Zombie was very smart and direct with his ideas. He always said ""people go to sequels (and these days remakes) knowing it'll be a piece of crap."" House of 1,000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects were tributes to the fanatical aspects of grind-house flicks and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movies were very different which gave me hope for Zombie's abilities. But waltzing out of the theater was the most angry I've been towards a film in forever, though the wave of remakes and ""reinventions"" were tuning me out as it was. Hopefully it will die by decade's end.Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, I contemplated walking out of the film. I took a bone with the fact that Rob gave you no clear point in time that these events take place, but culturally in the film, you can tell the first half is moved past the events of the original Carpenter flick, which I found puzzling and irritating. And of course, the fact that Michael was turned into a white trash nerd-child who snaps on his alcoholic hick stepfather and prissy sister while his mother struts her stuff in a striptease was appalling to no end throughout the first half of the film. The cameos in the film are mostly worthless and non effective to the story, and the first half of the film which is prequel based and the second half which was the remake pretty much, it was a severely rushed mess that gave no leeway to any scares. The kills were very rushed and not suspenseful in any way shape or form. It seemed to me Rob Zombie hadn't heard of the term ""character development"". But in a sense I can understand the constraints and pressures he was under. He is correct when he says it should been two films. And its not like the Weinstein Company know how to spell ""creativity"". Yes, Harvey, after you learn how to spell it, then learn whats required in these franchises. Me and my brother stared at each other disillusioned, being Halloween fans that have been wanting to see the perfect Halloween film that's been a miss for the past two decades.I did like Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, I couldn't argue that his take was too different seeing as though I probably would have disrespected him for miming Donald Pleasence. As well I like Scout Compton for her portrayal of Laurie for the same reasons. Having Danielle Harris in the film was a real treat seeing as though she was probably in the best of the sequels from the formal franchise (part 4), though the film was too rushed for any characters to standout. Seeing my favorite character actors was awesome but it was too bad they weren't relevant to the story. Especially Courtney Gains (who I love in Children of the Corn and the Burbs) performing in the worst and unnecessary rape scene known to man (in the unrated cut). So if you haven't noticed already, its hard for me to say much good about this film. It was in my eyes Michael meets Devil's Rejects and gave nothing to satisfy. If I didn't love the franchise so much, Id probably go a lower rating. But there's always the inevitable sequel, right?",Halloween
865,nightmare-walshy,Better then the old ones by miles,10,30 August 2009,The new movie ween shows his history about his dark past and why he started killing. The old ones don't show nothing. For example the first one only shows him killing his sister but the new one shows his school life and why he became evil. The worst one is number 3 because it does not even have any of the characters from the other films and Micheal is not even in it its just about witches and killing people with a TV showNumber 4 and 5 are only about Michael's trying to find and kill his cousin but the worst thing is he does not even kill her until number 6 when she if a grown woman and had given birth.H2o is about Michael tracking down his sister which he is successful but fails to kill her and her family.Resserection is about Michael killing her sister at the beginning and the fire at his house at the end that burns it down.But the difference is between all the killers is that Michael diden't die at the end,Halloween
866,rockyrambofan,awful in every way possible.,1,1 May 2010,I did not think you could take a masterpiece like Halloween 78 and turn it into pure garbage. But Rob Zombie did it. I don't know where to start. Nothing is remotely good or memorable. Acting was some of the worst I've ever seen. And don't get me started on the ending because it is one of if not worst endings in movie history!!! So if you liked that's fine but I'm glad I got the DVD as a gift because I would never pay money to see this piece of garbage. So just stick with the first 4 Halloween movies and stay as far away from this as you can. You have been warned.1/10 if a zero was allowed if would have gotten that.,Halloween

868,xukz_elitezzz,Hear me out!,7,8 November 2010,"I enjoyed this even though it altered the roots it wasn't extremely similar to the original like the A Nightmare On Elm Street remake, yes it edited Halloweens notorious reputation for suspense and changed it to brutal bloody violence but its a great opposite view to the Halloween saga and its great. I thoroughly liked how it showed more of the young Michael and showed the origin of the infamous mask unlike the original, in the original if i do not recall correctly he wears a clown mask for the murder's and not his infamous mask. Even though young Michael was bullied and ran like a girl it still showed the beginning of pure evil. He had a split personality from young sweet innocent Michael to masked murderer Michael. He started with a collection of a dead animal 'fetish' and pure enjoyment to murder and attacks. But he completely adored his mum(Sheri Moon Zombie) even though she was a stripper! He also adored his baby sister but later on attempts to kill her? I know its to end the family but...I think young Michael was very well suited for this part unlike the ridiculously annoying boy from the second film! Both being incredibly ugly (my opinion) even though mummy loves you! I like that Brad Dourif plays the Sheriff in this he's not all bad like Chucky lol. And he is well suited in this part as well hope he stays on even after H2. One thing it kept particularly high no surprise is the sex and there's no complaints oj! I agree completely that Daeg should be on the listGreat watch unfortunately you do have to watch H2 after this only for story its compulsory but has some good death scenes in it anyway",Halloween
869,Zman1310,Not great but not terrible,7,31 August 2007,"Starting out...No remake ever really fully lives up to the original unless the original was utter trash... After stating that though Rob Zombie does a pretty good job with this movie, really only key difference is the buildup process he took of developing Michael Myers. Really horror wise I'm not so sure it was intended to really scare the viewer...I don't like the fact that they tried to get cheap thrills with an escalation in music because thats usually a sign of a cheesy horror like the grudge. Overall though the movie lives up to the hype and aside from being released two months before Halloween??? Its not terrible, its actually a good intensity of blood and guts and if thats your type of movie go see it. If you even remotely liked the original i would recommend this movie to you to because it is a pretty good revamping of the old version.",Halloween

The film is very good at the beginning and OK all the way to it's ending, where it can be really disappointing to some fans. The writing and directing is close to excellent, but the acting lacks pretty bad. Except for young Myers and McDowell as Loomis, the rest of the cast is far from class acting. Sure it's a slasher horror, but sometimes remakes are saved by acting, and here I'm afraid it isn't. I don't want to give you any spoilers, so I'll end my post saying that this one is enjoyable and you'll probably be satisfied you payed for seeing it in Theaters, at the end of a weak summer in good movies.",Halloween
871,MrShelton,do not let all us film geeks ruin it..go see this movie!!!!,8,13 September 2007,"This is the first time a slasher flick has scared me since I was about eight years old. To just remake..scene for scene the original would have been no good. The problem with re-doing and horror movie pre 1994 is the film quality. It was poor..and that added so much to the atmosphere. Then, most of u who love these movies saw them young and revere them through adulthood. Then...none of these movies are fine cinema at all..but we talk about them like they are art. That being said..I love them all....and I'd like the people behind their remakes to jump off of something. This movie is a reinterpretation. It gives you a reason. The originals never really do give explanations. This one, unlike the new Black Christmas...gives you a reason that is set firmly in the world of possibility. The first half is jarring because you see the rage in a child manifest itself. You see why it happens. And then you see that with all the available information...it can't be stopped. If you are new to the movies...don't let someone like me confuse you with tales of 'the shape'...you see Michael Myers as much back then as you do now...that stuff is largely just revisionist history..you see him the whole time and it's just for us film geeks...go see this movie...best slasher film since the first one.",Halloween
872,gamefire10,It's a Metalhead Thing,7,10 September 2014,"I first saw Halloween (1978) when I was about 8 years old and it creeped me out something awful. When a trailer came on for the remake back in 2007, the music brought me right back. Now here I am, a grown man and well neither movies quite scare me anymore. Having seen the original I was intrigued at the prospect of a remake so I went out and rented it upon DVD release. Now bear in mind, me being a metal-head and a huge fan of Rob Zombie's music, I loved the film, however, This is not John Carpenter's Halloween. In my opinion a film should be judged largely on whether or not it accomplishes what it sets out to do. John Carpenter himself even told Rob Zombie to ""make it his own"". Rob does exactly that, this film presents us with a version of Michael Myers who suffers horrific abuse and neglect as a child, very stereotypical of a serial killer. Rob Zombie's Michael Myers is a serial killer. In this version, after Michael does what he does best about his family situation in the beginning, we are presented with some scenes of him inside Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Scenes of the sort were only presented in the original Halloween through the extended TV cut. Rob Zombie creates a gritty and realistic setting for an insane asylum. We watch Michael shift from mentally disturbed child to mentally disturbed man in these scenes. In the adult scenes at Smith's Grove, Michael is a nearly seven foot tall man with long hair covering his face, if one of his many constructed masks isn't already. The rest of the film plays out much like the original, however I will say without giving too much away, Michael definitely shows more of a human side in Zombie's interpretation, giving him the feel of a serial killer rather than just pure evil. All in all like I said it's a metal-head thing, we tend to enjoy serial killers and enormous dudes with long hair,also I'm always pleased to hear this film open up to KISS's God of Thunder, a song that works quite well for Michael, Zombie's version of Michael, the serial killer, the mentally disturbed serial killer.",Halloween
873,Sterlingtull,HALLOWEEN review from a 13 year old,7,10 March 2012,"So, I'm a huge, so called, ""horror junkie"" ask me a question about a horror film, I'll know it. I've seen about every horror movie... ever, or at least know about it. Halloween was something special. (THE ORIGINAL) I loved every intense moment of that movie when I was younger. I've only grown to enjoy it more. Now when the remake came out, I WANTED TO SEE IT, but lack of being 18 kept me at home with the original. Finally three years later I see it. >:( I've heard pretty awful things about this movie, so I went in cautious, expecting to see a gore fest instead of my beloved movie remade, KNOWING ROB ZOMBIE AND ALL. I'm sorry to say to all the ""nay"" Sayers out there, but this is not a bad movie... really. Remakes are never going to be as good as the original. Get over it and enjoy that one of your favorite horror series is being continued with a different vision! Yes, I like the fact that Michael Meyers is shown with character, and you know... DIFFERENT VISION I mean you can't expect anything more from Rob Zombie. It's over glorified gory fun. It's a different kind of tension and scary from the original. The only problem I had with this movie was the total lack of care I had for Laurie Strode. The original from Jamie Lee Curtis was played so well, she was innocent and that's why you felt bad for her. The Laurie in this one is foul mouthed and tends to make some dirty jokes here and there. She seemed like the person that would end up dying in a horror movie, not the one ending up living. UH Anyway, She just shrieked a lot and it got annoying... but luckily the gore helped out, and trust me I'm not one of those horror fans that think blood and gore are what make a horror movie. But when your watching a movie like this, I expect it, and it delivered. So fun entertaining horror film for people who haven't seen the original. Stop bitching about it and just enjoy and say that its a gory slasher movie. HAVE FUN",Halloween
874,adevlin-1,"Hack-o-ween, a terrifying experience",1,31 August 2007,"I have always been a big fan of the Halloween series. I've seen every one, and even though some of the sequels are cheesy, I thought it was still a good watch. When I found out that Rob Zombie, supposedly one of the best new horror directors was making the next film, I was actually pretty psyched because I thought it may revive the series. But let me tell you. This is the not only the worst Halloween movie, this is in my top ten bottom movies. Rob Zombie completely misses the point of Michael Myers. Not knowing what makes him tick IS WHAT MAKES HIM SCARY! The original Halloween is frightening because the child Michael myers has NO REASON to kill his sister, he just does and never speaks another word. He's evil by nature, not by nurture. This plot line makes it seem more horrifying because its not personal, and the audience feels like it could happen to THEM! When I watch a horror movie, I don't want to see how the killer had a hard life, and really could of been a good guy. Why would a director make an audience sympathize with a serial killer? I can only see that succeeding in a dark comedy, but in a horror movie it just does not work. Another problem with this movie is the gore. Gore can work in certain scenarios, but when you uses it excessively in a movie there are few cases when it makes the movie scary. In this ""reimagining"" not only are there unnecessary character deaths that destroy any sort of realism, but there is no creativity in the death scenes. Every time a girl got killed she was in the process of having sex or just finished having sex. By the third time you see a couple get murdered, I was like ""Alright we get it, they're crazzzy teenagers having sex and they're gonna get killed!"" I mean I know it's never been done before but it got to be old the third time. At some points I wondered if it was actually a snuff film.The dialogue was some of the weakest I've ever heard, even for cheesy slasher films. And the sad part was, this film was trying so hard to be serious that it was hard to ignore. I know the dialogue in other Halloween's is rough but for a film that had so much hype, and was supposed to ""reinvent"" a legend, I'd expect a little more than immature lines about sex that are awkwardly delivered. I am a teenager and I know teenagers talk about sex, but nothing like that. This film had some of the weakest writing I have ever seen.There are some good performances, particularly by Malcolm McDowell, who plays Dr. Loomis, but his part is profoundly damaged by the script, so even he looks foolish in the film. Brad Dourif also was good, but didn't have a lot of screen time. Other than that there were some good cameos(Danny Trejo, Ken Foree) but they're barely in it. Unfortunately, Rob Zombie confuses Michael myers with Jason and makes an 11 year old normally sized boy into a 26 year old 7 foot monster. Conveniently he gains amazing physical prowess staying in a mental hospital.Avoid this movie at all costs. I actually paid my friend a couple dollars to stay to the end, because it was that bad. I was hoping it would get better it but it did not. I mean I tried to like this movie, but it was just so terrible. The movie wastes so much time trying to develop Michael myers, that it barely develops the victims that he stalks. You just don't care about the teenagers he kills because you barely know them when he catches up with them. It's basically a movie about a killer killing random people. Seriously, just rent the original and watch it again, it's cheaper and even if you've seen it a thousand times its better than this. Rob Zombie is a terrible writer, and a terrible director who likes to show off his wife. (Who's a stripper in this movie of course). He is a hack and is only acclaimed because some people think excessive violence is cool. I doubt there's many people scared by his techniques. I'm just trying to forget this movie ever existed, and no matter what anybody says, I plan to never see another rob zombie film again. I think the fact that Saw IV is premiering in October, and Halloween is coming out in August really should tell you how bad it is alone. Trust me though, even die hard Halloween fans, this is not worth a watch.",Halloween
875,strangeluv69,My review of Halloween....BOO!,6,24 May 2008,"It was a time waster but not a money spender, but of course it depends on the audience. I recommend that most people who choose to watch it, shouldn't take it serious, the plot is weak. I felt Rob Zombie was trying to symbolize the mania inside Michale's mind more than having a well scripted movie. There was unique cinematography but no crazy killing. Movie got boring in parts, too much lame acting and not enough nakedness and sex, Hah. I found the captions hard to read and lately its been in a few movies I've seen. They should make them a color so they don't blend into the background. Besides that, I did have a nightmare last night about the movie, I forget what but it wasn't good, so I guess it was alright after all.",Halloween
876,egk14,Girlie Boy,1,3 September 2007,"This movie should have been titled ""Redneck Halloween"" with a girlie boy staring as Michael Myers. Let's give this theme a break for the next 100 years. The movie itself was comically boring and should have been rated X for the beyond the pale filthy language and gratuitous nudity. There is no question that Rob Zombie is a director out of the Ed Wood mold except Zombie was probably loaded up on dope when he was working. I'm really surprised though that Malcolm McDowell would be part of this ridiculous piece of celluloid. If the young people today like this kind of garbage, there ain't no hope for posterity.

I really hate when directors use actors from all previous or most past movies and use them just because either it's their spouse or because they are friends. Just makes it more boring. Skip this and watch the original or the newer soft reboots 2018 and 2021. Way better then this and part 2 reboots.

I have read many reviews saying how terrible this movie was and was very afraid to watch it as Halloween is my favorite series of movies. However, after seeing this movie I must say that it takes all the movies in the series except for John Carpenter and Debra Hill's masterpiece and throws them in the trash. This movie is amazing start to finish. You see the destruction of a young boy's soul as a malevolent force takes over. I have never been so moved. Furthermore to all the people who say it isn't scary....maybe so...but there are parts that will make you jump...trust me. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie....It is fantastic.

You can always tell when a director or writer feels that their movie is going to fail because they resort to just placing random scenes with breasts into every other scene. This was the case in this rendition of the classic film Halloween. Adding to the over breasting issue is the complete lack of characterization of Michael Myers in his ""later years"" and you get one of the (if not the) worst movie of the year. Poor writing, poor directing, and poor acting make this movie truly lame.",Halloween
881,nelle_wijn,Worth the time,7,7 November 2013,"At first, sorry for my bad English, I'm from Holland.I just don't understand all the bad reviews about this movie. I watched it an hour ago and I thought it was pretty good. A few years ago I watched the original of Halloween with a friend. It was good but it didn't touched me that much. This movie did. I really liked the beginning of the movie when they showed how Micheal was treated as little kid and how he ''became'' a serial killer. That was very sensitive, but.. I don't think you always become a serial killer when that happens to you. The director made the beginning of the movie to let us see how he became a killer but I think his a psychopath, even though he was treated nice by his family he would still kill people. So I think it's unrealistic. I enjoyed watching the beginning but if you think, it's otiose. I think the part when Michael gives his sister the photo with they two together is really good. It shows that he still has feelings deep in his heart.I agree with some reviews about the acting of the girls. They only thing they cared about was sex, and the director pictured it like every girl acts that way, I think that was really disappointing. Because I didn't liked the characters I did not mind when they get killed. If I'd liked them, I didn't want them to die and that would make the movie even better, I would say it's worth the time when you like to see an entertaining movie and you're to tired to think much.",Halloween

It's about time we get to see Michael Myers for what he really is and that is ""THE"" legend of horror movies of all time! I never thought that this classic could ever be remade but I was wrong and Rob Zombie proved it! He took Michael Myers to a whole other level and made us as fans truly understand what he was all about! It's just a shame that we couldn't have had Zombie pick up after Halloween II because all of the other Halloween movies just did not do Michael Myers any justice for being the Horror Icon that he truly is!

Halloween is beyond that, however.There is a hyper-reality here that reminded me very much of the end of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which took place not at night, but during the day. It was a perfect juxtaposition of hysteria and normality.Rob Zombie has a good eye. That's part of it. I could tell he's familiar with the language of cinema. Not that I can lay out (or even remember) examples. But stylistically, this is way beyond the original.The final shot is the best of the film.

A completely different, down to earth look at what we have know as pure evil, Michael Myers, the psychopath who by now has an identity crisis by now from so many bad sequel. Critics have ripped this movie in the wrong way. People have got to realize this is not John Carpenter's film. Many critics say the film is disjointed and the character development isn't there. I will give them that the film does feel a little disjointed, but as far as the character development goes, this film is about Michael Myers. The first film was about Laurie Strode and her friends, we know her friends and about her from the original film. There is a lot of depth, in the film you really have to look for it. The film is emotionally hardcore, if other didn't find it that way then, you are the ones who need to check into Smiths Grove for awhile. The film is not scary, as it emotional. However, cut it some slack. The film is what a true defintion of what a horror film should be. This not coming from a die hard Halloween fan. In this film, this a lot of emotional discomfort. Which is what makes it truly horrifying.",Halloween

I don't know why everyone is dissing this movie the acting and characters were weak at times, but the fast pace towards the end and a surprising ending of you don't know what happened left me in aw. All my friends like it, but the people who have followed the Halloween hated it, i tell them look at it as if they never happened be opened minded about it. The chase scenes were great i thought, and Rob Zombie brought an icon back to the present without ruining him in a sequel that would have sucked like resurrection, and clearly Michael didn't die at the box office.

886,Biodorah_X,"Not the original, and that's a good thing",9,31 August 2007,"First off, let me say that I'm a die-hard fan of the original film. I've watched it more than any other film of it's kind, and at first, I wasn't sure why someone would remake this, but I remained neutral.Now, having just gotten home not too long ago from the theater, I must say, I enjoyed the film a great deal. It wasn't the original film, no, but that's one of the films strengths. The less that is borrowed, the less room there is for ""error"" in the film. That said, everything that was borrowed worked quite well, and it was nice to see a more modern spin on classic sequences.One of the big complaints I'm hearing is that Rob humanized Michael, and added a sympathetic value to his character, explaining away what went wrong to drive him insane. Well, the film I saw didn't explain it at all. Right from the start, we can see that there is a little something wrong in his head. As the film progresses, that little something starts to take over his humanity, and by the end of the film, he's pure evil on two legs.Overall, the film worked, but my one and only little teeny tiny complaint, was that it didn't feel long enough. But, that's just my opinion, and no one has to agree with it.People have called this film a rape of the franchise, many of them not even having seen the film, and basing their opinions on pure bias that there isn't a numeral after the title. They are dead wrong. This film actually felt like a Halloween film, much moreso than any of the past seven sequels. In other words, I'd rather have this than Busta Rhymes vs. Michael Myers 2. In my opinion (mine, not yours), it's a darn good 9/10.Take my advice. If you're going to see this, see it with an open, unbiased mind (which many fans don't seem to have), and you're likely to enjoy it.",Halloween

To turn Michael Myers from a soulless supernatural killer to a vigilante child is the lamest thing I've ever seen. There is no suspense, the jump scenes were predictable, and by the end everyone needed to die. forty five minutes of the movie is spent watching a child in therapy...exciting? No! Yawn? Yes! IF Rob Zombie spent a little more time making music, instead of crap movies, maybe his last album wouldn't have sucked. Please don't waste your money on this movie.

888,Tomay01,"Michael Myers, how it all began....",6,27 August 2007,"I've been fortunate enough to see a studio screening of this movie & I was both excited & nervous about what was to follow. I'm a massive fan of the Halloween movie franchise, so I was expecting this to be no more than just another way for the studios to make money off of an already great series of films & not do a very good job of it.I was wrong, partly....What this version did that the original didn't was to spend the first 50 minutes with Michael Myers as a boy, played very well by Daeg Faerch. We got to see how things happened in his past; the abusive step-father, the bullying at school & his fascination with making masks. We also got to see his youth, which was spent in an mental institution under the watchful eye of Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), where his fascination with masks continued & also, the bullying & abuse from orderlies.All of this was done pretty well & it was nice to see these bits that had never been done in the original, although for a long time, I was thinking maybe they should call it Halloween: The Beginning, as it spent so much time on this. Then we get to the parts of the movie that we all remember where Michael returns 'home' to Haddonfield in search of his younger sister, Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) & the bloodbath begins.When in Haddonfield, the story unrolls pretty much the same as the original did, so I don't need to go into too much detail about that here. Those that have seen the original will know what happens & those that never have can enjoy it for the first time & not have me spoiling it for them :)& so, there we are. The remake of a classic horror actually done pretty well. Did it need doing at all? Not really, but at least now, a lot will get to see for the 1st time. I know many younger generation people that never have seen the original because they class it as being rubbish because it's too old. Very lame excuse, I know, but its the truth!",Halloween

I was very skeptical going into it, but came out rather pleased. Zombie did a decent job in sticking with much of the story line from the original, and giving Michael a humanistic form put a very interesting twist on the story. Although the original Michael began his life in a quaint suburban type setting, the persona of a killer without a humanistic tone distorted reality. Don't get me wrong, Halloween is one of my favourite movies, but I personally appreciated the new Michael and the steps leading to his transformation to a psychopath! My advice, don't engage this movie from a Carpenter perspective, appreciate the different tone Zombie took!",Halloween

It explains a lot of how Michael Myers came to be a brutal serial killer and it stayed true to the character. Being half prequel and half remake, die-hard fans of the original film should keep an open mind about the new Halloween rendition. There was a lot cinematography that was reminiscent of the original Halloween which I appreciated. My only disappointments were that the original Halloween opening was not present and it didn't really seem like hallowwen. There was little or no decorations or trick or treaters. It could have happened any night. In other words, yes he was played off as a very brutal serial killer but it didn't feel like Halloween.",Halloween
892,medmom54,There's no adjective in the English dictionary that can describe how bad this movie is,1,2 September 2007,"Its been about 18 hours since I've seen the 2007 remake of Halloween and I'm still crying in the corner about how I will never get those two hours of my life back. This is honestly the most absolutely ridiculously pointless gigantic piece of utter garbage that I have ever seen in my life. Lets first review the plot... As a small boy, Michael Myers grows up in a white trash family so he decides to murder everyone. 25 years later (after being in prison) he manages to break out of his chain reinforced straight jacket (and handcuffs) and kills everyone. Then he goes outside and kills everyone. Then he finds some horny teenagers and kills everyone. Then he gets stabbed and shot but no.... he still kills everyone. In conclusion the plot of this movie is that Michael Myers kills everyone. Now lets move on to the director... Rob Zombie apparently thinks that watching people die extremely gruesome and brutal deaths is fun! Like for instance watching a teenager be continuously beaten by a stick for about 3 minutes is obviously entertaining... and then watching him beg for his life and cry is obviously cool! (before being hit another 12 times until his death)Then we get to watch people's throats getting slit, girls being stabbed to death, necks being broken and random people being beaten to death. Now this may not seem that unusual for a horror movie but its how brutal the deaths are that make this movie so bad. There's no suspense... and there's never one point where you think ""hey this person might live"" because you know that everyone will just die. I'm at a loss of words.... dear god I'd rather watch paint dry than watch this movie. If I just dropped my $8.25 on the ground and walked away than THAT would have been a better use of my money. In all seriousness... this movie is not only pointless but its sick. If you can honestly say that you enjoy watching people die than I would highly recommend seeking therapy immediately.",Halloween
893,beforethedawnhealsus,Better than I thought!,10,4 September 2007,"First off I just want to say that I am a faithful fan of John Carpenter's Halloween. It's minimalist style and suspenseful scenes really captured a mood that most films never seem able to attain. It had one goal and it set out to complete that goal and succeeded. It will always be a classic for me and I'll love it for years to come.With that said, I went into Rob Zombie's Halloween with an open mind. For me there were many thrills of going to see Halloween '07 in theater. I sat with my boyfriend, who does not like horror films in the least, and I told him before the movie starts that I hoped that the audience would react a lot to add to the experience of watching a Halloween movie in theater. And sure enough, they did react quite well to the scares of this film (as did my boyfriend).The first ten minutes or so were hard to stomach in my opinion. It was nothing but profanity after profanity laced with TOO much sexuality. But I understand the point that was trying to be illustrated here - defining Michael's childhood. Oddly, Michael is one of the only caring individuals in the household and seems sensitive and impressionable. But over time, his experience growing up in that household takes its toll and he snaps. And this is where the film really becomes interesting (and gruesome).From the time he commits his first murder, the sense of what Michael Myers is was found. And the next couple of kills were definitely brutal and eerie. Especially when it comes time for him to kill his sister Judith. The rest of the prequel set of the film was enjoyable to watch from here on, and when we get to the re-imagining set of the story, I began to feel at home. The story moved at a reasonable pace and the acting was pretty solid. I actually must commend Scout, she did a fantastic job of updating her character of Laurie Strode. She emoted her experience well.There were a lot of deaths and occurrences that were different from the original which made it feel fresh. But the classic elements of the timeless story were here, which was exciting to see on screen once again. The last 15 minutes or so were definitely where the suspense came in, which had been lacking for most of the film. And it was this part that truly had me glued to the screen. There were some nice surprises and Laurie really came off as an independent person who became her own heroine.The added element of the brother-sister relationship between Michael and Laurie that was thrown into this version of the film really created more of a sense of continuity of the original story that was lacking in the first (for obvious reasons). And Michael's intentions were a lot more abstract, which made it far more interesting to know what drives one of cinema's greatest killers.However, the movie definitely had it's shortcomings, and may not be the classic that John Carpenter's Halloween is, but it definitely reinvigorating a dying series and I hope that future installments definitely have a set story in mind so we can get one cohesive story. This movie definitely is a great companion to the original and is no doubt the best movie in the series since the original. Well worth the view.",Halloween
894,worldcup2010,Nowhere near what the classic established!,2,13 June 2008,"The new Halloween was one truly a disgrace to the classic Halloween. From there being no suspense or build up at all, to the terrible acting, and ending with the awful script! The Halloween remake was to re-imagine the classic which it came nowhere close to. The plot lacked, was drawn out, and boring for the most part, the acting wasn't very good and there was absolutely no character development. The classic was able to establish a smart and scary plot, effective scares, incredible build up and tension and was very atmospheric. The new Halloween accomplished none of that. All it went for was the typical gore and sex. I was greatly disappointed in the outcome of the movie which was 2hrs. of a dull and truly bland movie. In act 1 we are given Michael's back-story. The whole point of the original was to give the killer no motive or reason for being a psychopath! That was the first mistake, following this was act 2 the psychiatric ward. This was about 40mins of absolutely nothing except for brutal killings in the last 10mins. Finally, we move on to the final 40mins of the movie which was the remake! It was a complete and utter disgrace to horror films. The ending contained no suspense, tension, or even a single scare.

895,AlexoFett,Stop remaking cinema gold!,2,9 September 2007,"I have to admit, being a huge fan of the original, before even watching this I was already highly sceptical about the outcome. So in some ways I wasn't very surprised to feel disgusted at the fact that this film shares the name and original characters of John Carpenter's classic. What did surprise me though, even with Rob Zombie at the helm, is how constantly violent and gory it actually is. Full view shots of neck's being sliced and drained slowly of blood, as well as cranium's being smashed to bits by a baseball bat are a severe regularity. Maybe excusable, as it is of course a horror film, but the original didn't generate shock through volume and excess. For example, in the original, Michael Myers kills a grand total of three teenagers and a dog, as well as his sister of course. This number is achieved by the younger Michael Myers within twenty minutes, before he is even locked away in the mental institute.And it's not only the violence that disturbs, the abusive and sexual language is vulgar and non-stop. It's uncomfortable viewing to say the least, most noticeably when the (Step?)father comments on how sexy his (Step?)daughter's body is, in so many words. It almost seems as though Zombie feels he is relating to this generation's teenage audience by featuring such dirty, sexual imitations and innuendo's. But what he is in fact actually doing is conforming to the stereotype of what we would expect from him as a musician-turned-director. Don't get me wrong, I, like him am a 'metalhead', but the fact the majority of the characters are rude, foul-mouthed and have long, greasy hair (Including Michael Myers!) makes it seem like a party at Marilyn Manson's place. All the violence, the language, the rape scenes and sexual imitations are here just for the sake of shocking it's viewers, used a (poor) distraction of how bad the story and dialogue of this film actually is.In some ways this brings me on to the original's greatest asset, as well as the remake's worst; the characters of Dr. Loomis, Laurie and most notably Michael Myers.What actually makes this film so bad is that is in no way scary... at all. This is mainly attributed to the new Michael Myers; he simply has too much screen time in the film; there's no mystery about him at all, which is his strongest, and scariest characteristic in the original. You see how he grows up as a child, going to school, being a victim of bullying etc. He seems more of a product of an abusive childhood (we're not supposed to be sympathetic to Michael freakin' Myers!) rather than being 'pure evil', despite the new Loomis's best attempts to tell us so. Sigh, so much screen time... Zombie obviously has a special affection for Michael's character. But this results in no jumpy bits whatsoever, as you literally see Michael creeping into the shadows from which he is about to spring and attack, or the windows that his pale, white mask is seen staring through (such an effective tool of the original).It was always going to be hard stepping into the shoes of Donald Pleasance when playing Dr. Loomis, and Donald MacDowell lived up to the expectations. Himself a talented actor, the script does him absolutely no favours, and his story as a man who has lost his wife and friends through his obsession to council a child he knows to be 'pure evil' and incurable is... well, i guess Zombie did write it himself. But still his performance in this film is poor and lacklustre.The character and performance of Laurie is probably worse. In the original, Jamie-Lee Curtis' Laurie was a shy, conservative and considerate babysitter with no real sexual assets. In this film though, she swings between this and a up-front, rude and sex-craved little hoe reluctant to have to babysit on Halloween night.Maybe the only good and mentionable thing about this film is that the score of the original is used well and in good places, but possibly in excess to the point of it being in every scene, watering down its undeniable effect.There was no real expectation from Rob Zombie, but he did surpass expectation by making this film both a bad remake and a bad horror film. Fair enough a remake should have it's own unique qualities, but not through bad language and excessive violence. It's not scary, not jumpy, and it butchers the concept and the characters of the original to the point of unrecognisable proportions.",Halloween
896,RogerMalcolm,I don't understand,8,6 September 2007,"Now I love the original but I still enjoyed this film. I just can not understand how a person is able to rate this a 1 when there are films like Dark Harvest and House of the Dead out there. Maybe I don't go just to bash a film. I completely understand if you don't enjoy it and even if you can't get the fact that the original was so perfect out of your mind to watch this and enjoy it but to rate it a 1! Come on you are insulting your own intelligence. Now I know I'm fighting a losing battle against the ones with no logic but I just finally got sick of seeing it and felt I needed to write something. For the film itself, I felt Rob made it really intense and didn't build enough suspense but I also didn't feel that the character of Michael Myers could surprise me anymore than it had when I was a child. Overall Rob did a fine job on making it in his signature style and thats the whole point. Most people thought John Carpenter was a terrible director also. Shows you what people know.",Halloween

Definitely a very disturbing and creepy feel to it.Overall, this movie is most definitely the best horror movie of 2007 by far and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good scare. This movie will most definitely top off any of the horror movies coming out near Halloween time. Trust me, you will be impressed!Please see this movie! You'll enjoy it!",Halloween
898,AxeMarc,Bad and brilliant,6,24 March 2010,"In some ways, Rob Zombies adaption of John Carpenter 1978 classic is brilliant. In other ways, it falls flat. Let's start with the pros;First of all, Halloween 2007 is probably the movie with the most thorough back story ever for a slasher. And more importantly, it is realistic. So realistic it is literally creepy.Sure, for the untrained eye this might look like another one of those Jason-esquire plots. But let me tell you, this is the real deal. I know, since I've been in Michaels shoes.As a kid I was much like Michael, except for his urge to kill and torture living things. I was however a lover of gore and guts on the silver screen. So like Michael made his sick masks, I made sick drawings, causing a concerned teacher to constantly set up meetings with my mother. Like Michael I too was bullied, and like him I always stood my ground, even though I knew the odds and the outcome. And just like Michael, I even yelled at the teacher when he interrupted a beating I took, causing him to project his rage on to me rather than on the bullies.A few years ago I was incarcerated in a facility like the one in Halloween: Sterile interior without any furniture. Nothing to do. No visits. No friends. No word on when I could get out. Nurses taunting me. Long story short; I got out just in time. But every day in there without company and activities took me a little closer to insanity, as it would have done to anyone. So Michaels Journey as depicted in Halloween is 100% authentic, and it happens all the time, all over the world. Danny Trejo's line, when he tells Michael to live in his imagination to endure his imprisonment, was especially great, since this is the EXACT same thinking that every inmate eventually has to cater to. Danny Trejo should know, having been in San Quentin at the wrong side of the bars for a number of years.But when Michael Myers childhood ends, so does the thrill of the movie. What follow is exaggerated situations and exaggerated characters along with bad FX that cries out for KNB Group to come to the rescue. It goes from a psychological masterpiece to a bad bad clone of Friday the 13th. Don't get me wrong, I love a good slasher-flick without substance as much as the next guy. But this just wasn't it.Rob Zombie is no doubt an interesting filmmaker that'll have something to bring to the table in the future. But he's not there yet.Daeg Faerch deserves a special mentioning. His acting alone makes the movie worth a watch.",Halloween
899,angieky,"Blood, Breasts, and Sluts.. Oh My!",1,15 September 2007,"Oh wow, here was 2 hours of my life I will never get back. I went in with no preconceptions of the movie because I had never seen the originals (*gasp* I know!). My best friend, however, was a big fan of the originals and had told me all the basic details so I thought it might be an okay movie. I'm all for a suspenseful movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, this movie will make you want to get off your seat and run as far away as you possibly can. I constantly checked the second hand on my wrist watch during the last hour of this ridiculous movie.Basically all this movie was about was senseless gore, breasts, sex, white trash, and teenage girl's who love using the f-bomb and making ridiculous sexual comments. At one point they pretended to hump each other and make squealing noises and I seriously thought I may just burst out into tears. I was a teenager not too long ago, and though some girls are immature and ridiculous, I've never seen anyone talk or act that way. It was so forced and fake that you wanted to throw up in your mouth a little. I know I did.Basically, Zombie tries to give the mass murderer a soul and a background and it just doesn't work. Watching a 10 year old mercilessly kill everyone in his path is just disturbing. They say he has no conscience, and doesn't understand right from wrong. So basically, Rob's trying to give a soul to a person that is soulless? What??!?! Does that even make a lick of sense? No, I didn't think so!He wants us to sympathize with the character but how can anyone actually give any sort of sympathy to a kid who tortures animals and slays his whole family just because they didn't take him trick or treating.The movie is not at all creepy. He basically just walks up to his victim, whacks them over the head, stabs them, or beats them to a pulp. There is no fighting back, for of course, he's a 7 foot monstrosity that cannot be stopped. So he basically just runs around slitting throats and creating a blood bath. Wow.. inventive..And please, don't even get me started on all the sex scenes. Basically, every woman in the movie is a slut. If you are a teenage boy, you will absolutely love this movie because you will see breasts at every corner. Some breasts are even covered in blood, for the sadistic horny teen as well. For everyone else, we're just wondering.. and the point of that was....??? I walked out of that movie feeling as though my IQ had lowered. I also felt like I needed to repent or something because that movie had seriously compromised my moral character! My best friend just looked at me and said, ""I really just don't know what to say."" You'll walk out of this movie speechless too, but not because it was a fantastic edge of your seat horror, but because it was so incredibly bad you just have no idea where to start. Skip it, your wallet will thank you.",Halloween
900,Hatchetman86,Great remake of a classic horror film but a little confusing,9,31 August 2007,So I just saw Rob Zombies Halloween on opening night I enjoyed it to be honest it scared me. I am a huge fan of Rob Zombie and John Carpenter my favorite horror movie of all time is Halloween. The movie a lot more different than the 1978 version but still sticks to the story. I loved whole back story on how Micheal Myers became a killer and his childhood. Torturing and killing animals is not something I like but it shows Zombies style of movie horror when he puts a seriousness into his movies. The time line though is screwed up through out the movie it supposedly starts in the 60's or 70's but fast forward 17 years later and we are in the present now thats one thing that bugged me. But Zombie did a great job to create the new Micheal Myers aka The Shape. I was actually terrified when the masked killers face touched the big screen. what I liked about it most is when young Micheal is locked up as a boy in smiths grove you see how he becomes the killer to me the evil was just built up inside he was possessed by it. 17 years later he escapes the asylum to hunt down his baby sister returning to his home town brutally killing anyone he comes across and racking up a bigger body count. Anyway so that I don't tell the whole story let me finish by saying that I enjoyed the film and still a fan of both directors and the franchise I do believe that a bit more work could have been done on it so to finish Trick or Treat boys and girls the Bogeyman is.......BACK!,Halloween
901,dacb80,I really want to kick rob zombies ass,1,31 August 2007,"Never before have I wanted to kick a directors ass so much. Rob Zombie and co. raped the Halloween saga. As if Busta Rhymes karate kickin M.M. wasn't bad enough this ""remake"" insults the audience and the legacy of M.M. No emotion, no suspense, an ending that wont quit, and an unnecessary reference to Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the final scene... I can't go on. This film is the reason why people generally think remakes suck. Its a director to play film school with a fine lay out. Seriously the only good think about the film are the two actors who portrayed M.M. the young michael seemed twisted, the older was just plain scary and intimidating. And poor Danielle Harris, who is ultimately wasted here.",Halloween
902,volleyer,I respect it but it doesn't mean I like it.,4,30 October 2021,"Let me start off by saying the original Halloween is my all time favorite horror movie of all time. I appreciated all the sequels aside from the third which is just a waste of time but non the less I am always open to new ideas/appreciation. I've seen the new remake about 10-12 times now. And while at first I appreciated the new idea/concept Rob was going for, it reminded me of why I was so frightened by the original as little kid. The 1978 version didn't rely on gimmicks, back story, and motivation. Michael was a killer. No stopping him. No reason. Enter ""Jaws."" The remakes delve deeper into the reason behind the madness if you will. While I appreciate the story, it takes away why as a youth, we were so scared of Michael in the first place: he stopped at nothing to get his way, he kills whatever and whoever he pleases. That's what makes him so scary. In Robs version he brings Michaels back story to life. In my opinion he gives him a out to why Michael is the way he is. And that's makes him human. Granted there are a lot of psychopaths in our world, and most of them, if not all of them had a reason/notice to do what they did. The reason we were so scared of Michael Myers from the original movie was we didn't know what drove him to madness. He was a non stoppable force of evil. Robs version of Michael gives him life/an out to why he became who he his. While I appreciate the story, I find myself becoming least likely to be afraid of the killer of Michael. Rob makes him out to be a victim of a broken home. That's not scary. We've seen that before multiple times. As like Jaws, Michael kills at will. With no reason behind the mask if you will. Giving the character a reason, makes him feel human. When John C made the original, he made Michael non human, non anything we've ever seen. That was scary. Robs version makes Michael out to be human. We've all seen that story before. That's not scary or even remotely obscure in our world today. Sorry Rob. While I appreciate the effort, come up with an original idea.",Halloween
903,sponz2381,Michael Myers the man,7,20 June 2009,"Unlike many of the other comments posted, I enjoyed this remake. I'm a fan of the original but did like the new ideas.I enjoyed seeing Michael Myers as a person who had most of the cards against him opposed to just this pure evil supernatural entity. I liked seeing his background. A loving, stripping mother with an ahole drunk boyfriend(stepfather?) and a promiscuous sister. Take those elements and a disturbed child (torturing and killing animals) can go unnoticed for way too long then add a bully who pours fuel on the fire by making fun of that situation and that's the perfect match to get it all started.I even enjoyed the development of his early years in the mental hospital. At first, shielding himself from the horrors that he has done to hiding himself with his masks, the little humanity he has left slowly slipping away til he's nothing without the mask and his final break where he kills the nurse.From there the movie has typical horror movie traits. Characters running up the stairs to escape from a guy at the front door instead of running out the back, an inability to convince any authorities that a man who's murdered a dozen people is a serious threat, police hesitant to shoot that man with everything they've got, etc. but I thought it was an enjoyable slasher flick. Not knowing much of Rob Zombie movies I expected sex and gore and those are certainly not lacking but I didn't think that took away from the suspense in the movie and overall it was enjoyable and disturbing (the ultimate compliment to a horror film).Now, if you're looking to compare this to the original Halloween, don't. I thought the original was great and built that supernatural, unstoppable idea of Michael Myers into the franchise it is but it was nice to see a decent remake with Michael Myers as just a purely psychotic killing machine but still a man.",Halloween
904,RICKHUNTER27,Pointless,1,5 September 2007,"The whole reason Michael Myers has been a classic icon of horror is because of the enigma of why he is the way he is. To spend a majority of the movie trying to explain ""why"" ruins the mystery. He has always been an unstoppable monster, the epitome of evil. Thanks to Rob Zombie's film, he's just a product of white trash America. The dialog was bad. The acting was bad. The time period made no sense and was not clever at all. So much of the movie is about his laughable childhood that when you finally get to the good part, it's rushed. There's no time to get to know the characters of Laurie, Annie and Linda, so when Michael Myers appears...who cares? Extra blood and gore don't equal a more terrifying movie. The original was and is successful because it was more about character and mystery. There was certainly violence, but not overly explicit and gimmicky. It was minimal and you never really saw any blood. This movie had nothing to add and really ruined one of the best horror movie characters ever.",Halloween

MUCH better than the theatrical cut,7,19 January 2018,"The reason why I made this account because I want to review the director's cut of both of the Rob Zombie films. I gave the theatrical cut a 5/10 and I got the unrated director's cut of the movie on Christmas. I gave this movie a 7.5/10 because of better story telling, and the script flows well. I still hate the white trash theme of the movie. Yeah I know their is one scene that's uncountable but I ignore that scene. Is it worth buying? It depends if you hate or love the theatrical cut of Halloween (2007). A better version of the film.",Halloween
907,evilkittymusic,Not what I expected,9,12 September 2007,"Let me 1st state that I was not a big fan of Rob Zombie's 1st 2 films -""night of 1000 corpses"" and ""Devil's Rejects"" - which focused too much on graphic gore and were weak on plot. To me a great film is defined by it's plot. Remakes also scare me as you are always judging them based on the original and can rarely live up to that expectation and leave you disappointed. When I firs heard of this project I rolled my eyes - thinking of the ""Psycho"" remake which was un-viewable. I had made up my mind not to waste my time - but then I saw the coming attraction and it peeked my interest.Rob Zombie's goal was to make Michael Myers less of the Chariciture of a horror figure that he had become and make him relevant and scary again. I feel he succeeded on both ends - and at the same time used the slasher formula of the 70's and 80's (especially bringing back T&A in horror films) and payed a wonderful tribute to the original film. Many negative reviews comment on how the original film left much of Michael Myers a mystery and that mystery made him scary - Rob Zombie's ""prequel"" took away that mystery and made Micahel less scary. I disagree - he showed you a realistic view of a text book psych path - his up bringing had nothing to do with his ""evil"" nature - he was born that way. I think some people are looking at the back story and equating it to him killing for ""vengence"" which is not the case. He killed loved ones as a child - and his facial expressions are of interest - not rage. He is basically indifferent to life and death. This is really brought out in the scene killing the guard at the Sanitarium who was the equivalent to being his only friend of 15 years - he simply did not care.The point in the movie where Rob plays ""Mr. Sandman"" was a great transition - bringing it right to the opening credits of the original film - the rest is his tribute with a few new twists which I enjoyed - it kept the viewer from simply relying on memory of the original film and becoming predictable and dull. The soundtrack for the film was brilliant - the music set moods and triggers memories of the time he was setting the film it.This film to me is a must see for fans of slasher films and of the original film. While the casting was great and the acting great for the most part - the one part that will be missed from the original is Jamie Lee Curtis who was the best and only actress who will ever live up to the roll. Malcom MacDowell is a good Dr. Loomis - but again falls short of Donald Plesance. I would have a hard time saying this film blows away the original which is an all time classic - but it does bring back a great horror icon without being cheesy - it does add an originality in the prequel (1st half) and pays a fitting tribute in the 2nd half.",Halloween
908,CanadianRose14,Took a classic and turned it into complete filth,1,19 December 2007,"The original Halloween, made in 1978, was the real beginning to slasher films. It was a great horror movie about the legendary Michael Meyes, coming out on Halloween and stalking babysitters. It is the 'alpha and omega of Boogeyman films'. After seeing it I was left wanting more. After watching this remake I wanted to ram a chair threw my TV. The acting was only mediocre, many of the added scenes were completely ridiculous, and the beloved character of Laurie Strode who was supposed to be sweet and innocent, was not either of those things.The problem with new age slasher films are that Hollywoods' writers lack creativity. So they take classics, like Halloween, and add as much gore and nudity as they can to make a quick buck. If you are a loyal fan of the original movie that changed the face of fear, then do not waste your time or money on this garbage.",Halloween

911,mcrfan3,Misses the point of the original,4,3 September 2007,"It seems that nowadays, every other movie released is a remake of an older film. The most recent addition to this list of movies is Halloween. Although, ''remake'' may be the wrong word to describe this film, as Rob Zombie added and elaborated on the original with his own imagination. Unfortunately, Rob Zombie has a horrid imagination.The reason the original Halloween was so effective, was John Carpenter's ability to create suspense. The majority of his movie was anticipation. Anticipating the first murder. Anticipating the meeting between Michael and Laurie. Anticipating Dr. Loomis coming to save the day...sort of. Rob Zombie completely missed the point, replacing suspense with senseless killings of almost every character in the movie.Another important aspect of directing that Rob Zombie doesn't seem to grasp is character development. In the original, we had more than an hour of getting to know each character, so that we actually knew who they were. Mr. Zombie decided that watching a half hour of sexual referencing and actual sex was just enough to make us care. It wasn't.The main problem I had with this film, was Michael Myers. As a 10 year old, he wasn't exactly the tallest one in his class. Yet 15 years later, not only is he the tallest person in the film, he's also got the strength to rip a house apart. How does one come across such strength after 15 years of making masks out of paper machè? Second problem. Like I said, he was 10 years old when he entered the hospital. So, how is he able to drive a frickin oil tanker? He shouldn't even know how to drive a damn golf cart! Last problem. How does one survive stab wounds, numerous gun shots, and a fall off a balcony? Trick question, because you can't! Yet Michael survived all of these things and didn't even skip a beat. Now, I know that this is exactly the way he was in the original. But you know what? This happened to be the only problem that I did have with original, and it still doesn't make sense almost 30 years later.In short, skip this film.",Halloween
912,filippidesjensyn,Not bad,6,10 September 2018,I struggle to think why people think it's a bad movie . Yes it dosent follows exactly what happened in 78 version but this movie goes more in depth through why Michael became psychotic and his home life . It is foul mouthed and not as good as it could of been but it it's still something to watch either way. A remake isn't supposed to copy everything and rob zombie took his own take . I personally like it,Halloween
913,berthyy,The Inner Psyche of Michael Myers,8,27 August 2007,"Beware Sinners: Michael Myers will cleanse the world of you.I am fully aware of the fact that almost everyone who will go to see this will no doubt have the original version in mind and will be comparing the two the entire time(for whatever reason). However, this reviewer shall not.The original version showed what Michael had done very briefly as a child, but it was understood what his heinous acts entailed. The remake - if you want to call it that - went a bit further. Michael as a child was presented for at least the first twenty minutes of the movie, as well as his relationships with family and schoolmates. From that, and how everyone around him treated him and the world in general, you can understand that - despite what Dr. Loomis kept exclaiming - Michael was not a vicious mass murderer with no conscious.Michael, throughout the movie, only killed those who had done wrong deeds (whether to him, to others, or just sinned in general, it was understood, for the most part), and spared who had done no harm. Dr. Loomis's soul purpose in the movie was to show the world that there was nothing but 'pure evil' behind the eyes of Michael Myers: that Michael was incapable of showing mercy, which he could be not be more wrong about. There were several he had shown mercy for, and did not harm at all; but, of course, when he killed, they were vicious and brutal (well, what else could be expected from a movie directed by Rob Zombie, after all?), and at those times it could be understood why Loomis saw the 'pure evil'.Michael Myers did not kill without conscious. The fact that he was able to show mercy actually made him an interesting character (and arguably the only interesting character in the movie), rather than the stereotypical two-dimensional mass murderer you'd usually find in movies like these. You're not to feel empathy or even sympathize with Michael, but at least understand why he chose and was chosen to have the path life had given him.The only thing that really grated my nerves was the teenagers in the movie (both past and present), but then, when aren't teenagers in a horror flick a terrible nuisance, right? Probably why most of the audience hopes the bad guy kills them in the end. I recommend it for anyone looking for a gore-fest, at least.",Halloween
914,jepha,"Lame,bad actors,and Boring",5,1 September 2007,"I'm 15,and the movie was not scary,but boring as anythingI think the movie AFTER the parts of his childhood was lame...like really lame.I loved when he was a kid (when he was washing off the knife with the rat blood..OMG!)But then when he was an adult...wtf?!It was uninteresting at that point.No clever killing...just bloody borefest.I agree was the user who said that Micheal looked like a lost Slipknot member..made me laugh out loud. Micheal was a kid in I guess the 70's.Why was his little sister a senior in high school now?(I know it was set to now because her friend used the word ""Krunk"") And I thought all the sex was stupid also.I don't know anyone who acts like those girls did,and why was it necessary for the descriptive words during the ""sex"" scenes? The actors were HORRIBLE!Where did they find these ""Talents""? I gave the movie a 5/10..a 5 based solely on the beginning theme,if that hadn't have been so incredible,I would have given it a 3,easy.",Halloween
915,RickRMortiz,I think a lot of prescreen viewers missed the point,10,31 August 2007,"Halloween ( the original )was a ""quick lets make a buck picture"". It had no depth or explanation other than the ""Boogieman"" is out killing people with no background to it. It had no depth at all. That doesn't mean I don't love it as it is one of my top 10 slasher pics, but thats all it was. Any one of the films past Halloween 2 were worthless hack tripe.What Rob has done is added that depth, and some reality to a cardboard story and cookie cutter character. He got into the mind of a psychotic serial killer.It really dove into how they are made by their environment and even the symptoms on the path to human killing. It has been noted that both Dahmer and Bundy tortured animals and worked their way up to bigger things. Micheal becomes a real person, a true psychotic, and even scarier because any kid down the block including your own could snap like that over time. Look at Columbine.. did parents see it coming? Nope. Did Ted Bundy's mom know he'd murder 32 + Women or Gary Ridgeway's wife know he was ""The green river killer"". This film is psychologically more fulfilling and frightening.I see this mainly as a case of people having a preconceived expectation that this is a remake of a beloved film, when it has never been labeled remake , it was a re-visioning of a story. AS for no credits to Carpenter and Hill for writing, Carpenter told Zombie to make it his own and run with it, so he did. NEW CONCEPT, NEW FILM PEOPLE!I loved this film. I love Carpenter/Hill's Original( though 2 was a much better film). What did you want people another shot for shot rip off like the crappy remake of Psycho? I forgot where the Quote came from I'm thinking it was Lewis Black who said ""People complain that the new Star Wars films aren't as good as the old Star Wars films. Thats because the old star wars films you saw when you were 10 years old"". Same goes for the original Halloween.Zombies take is at least 10 times more grisly, realistic and terrifying in its realism.",Halloween
916,megionprize,One of the Best Slasher Movies I've Ever Seen,8,7 September 2007,"Slashers are notoriously bad - they usually contain the same tired elements: a large white male with a sharp object stalking a particular area, horny and drunken/drugged up teenagers who are invariably murdered, and the hero and or virginal ""sweetie-pie"" who escapes the monster. The acting is usually sh$t, as is the script, and there is little or no character development, which means that the audience couldn't give a crap who gets killed, and probably ends up rooting for the killer (at least I do). The filmmakers seem to be insulting public intelligence, figuring adolescent boys are going to be the biggest audience, and pander to them with lots of gore and tits.Rob Zombie did all of this (meaning use the elements of the hacker, the horny, and the virgin, although I won't say he's insulting or pandering to anyone), but still managed to do a damn good job. Doing a Carpenter classic remake is ultra-brave in itself, as there are tons of die-hard fans who will never say any remake is half as good as the original, and are offended at anyone even making it. The press can't stand horror movies anyway - and rarely give any of them (except the classics - simply because they don't want to look too stupid) good reviews, although there have been some excellent ones coming out (Saw Series, The Hills Have Eyes I/II). So, Zombie had some big balls to tackle remaking ""Halloween."" Also, he developed his characters effectively, especially young Michael, well-played by a sweet-faced child actor and Laurie, who did an excellent job portraying sheer terror on screen. Maybe Zombie is nepotistic, and maybe he continues to cast Sherri Moon in his movies because she inspires him. Either way, I couldn't care less - I've like her in all of his movies and she really fits into the skin of Michael's mom as a vulnerable, scared and confused mother. She radiates such emotional exhaustion and pain as a character - I was very impressed and doubt anyone can a do better job. The bottom line: the movie was fun, stylish, and thoroughly entertaining.What could have been better: the humanized Michael wasn't creepy like the demon Michael. It was his coldness and the absence of a motive or any feeling at all which made the original Michael so effective, and this Michael loses that with his show of emotion. Also, the horny/drunken teenager bit is overplayed. I think it would have been more effective to make Laurie's friends more like Laurie, with Michael carving out the innocent, which would have made him more utterly repulsive as a monster.However, all in all, I was engrossed in the movie from the beginning. Zombie has a dark, gritty, oily and in-your-face way of storytelling that is all his. I loved his other two movies (espescially Rejects) and am hoping to see much more of him in the future.",Halloween

Malcolm McDowell is not even bothered to try to do anything with his role, and like it's not bad enough that he mimics his lines from ""Time After Time"", he managed to ruin one of the best one-liners from the original - the Boogeyman one.One of the reasons the original movie was so good, was that it offered no explanations and no reasons, beside laconic Pure Evil. This one not only tries to give reasons and explanations, but it uses the most mundane ones. And even then, that part of the movie is its strongest one.

920,bobbo-30,Zombie Is Beginning to Cook.,7,12 January 2008,"There are Pros and Cons to consider with a remake as ambitious as Zombie's undertaking of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN; you have really only two characters to portray in depth, while the ""teens"" in this Teen Slasher are still only an entrée. With his portrayal of the ""original mad slasher,"" Michael Myers and his lifelong mentor/analyst/father figure, Doctor Loomis, this director has gone above and beyond the call of duty. However, the suspense and terror that were present in Carpenter's original are unsatisfyingly missing--but perhaps that's meant to be, as they could clearly only be copied, and never matched by another film maker.What we have, though, in young Rob Zombie's approach and final production, is so very much more--we get THE WHOLE MICHAEL MYERS STORY, and to a great extent, for the very first time. There are early scenes in which the Myers family is shown bare-bones, flaws-and-abuse-and-a-stripper-for-a-Mom-and-all, and they are difficult to watch; but of course, we never thought Mike came from a typical home, did we? And the great Ronny McDowell does a great turn as Doctor Sam Loomis. Two elements that were always missing from Donald Pleasance's now-legendary performance are back-story and lack of understanding, but McDowell shows a true confusion and personal realization of what Evil (with a capital E) might really mean...a bravura performance, and probably the best of the film.There are very passable portrayals from the rest of the cast, and the female actresses have very nice bodies for baring (this is VERY important for a big-budget Horror film, any fan can tell ya), and Zombie does the duty of bringing many good characters and actors to his version of this hard little tale.Overall, you've got to hand it to this boy: the ""new"" HALLOWEEN is a very, very good Horror film, hands down. And though he loses some of the real scares, there are images and ideas in this new picture that will remain with the viewer for a while. One only wishes that those first really frightening images and ideas from long-ago 1977 could still be newly-realized, again.",Halloween

Rob if your listening, Your movies are a feeble, plagiaristic dis-justic to the horror legends, further polluted by every second your wife is present on stage. die.",Halloween
922,Dumbcasualty,Michael Myers is back......,10,4 September 2007,"Now, i know that some of you are such purists that you cannot appreciate any remake. Especially a remake of such a classic as the original Halloween. I am usually the same way, but not this time around. That being said, Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween is a masterpiece. The depth given to the character of Michael Myers is amazing. Yeah i know some of you don't want Michael to have a back story or want him to talk or feel and the whole senseless killer thing works for you, but its so much (dare i say) better this way. Yet, at the same time, this Michael Myers is much more of a monster, huge and merciless, this Michael would DESTROY the original. Daeg Faerch is phenomenal in his portrayal as the young killer and his range of portrayed emotions goes from innocent to menacing in a matter of seconds. Sheri Moon Zombie also does great in her role as Michael's troubled mother. I think that Rob Zombie took the original and changed the story around to make it seem like something that could actually happen. As Dr Loomis says in the film ""the perfect mixture of nature and nurture, the perfect storm"" Michael is given the family and childhood that gives birth to most actual serial killers, giving his character a 'real' feel that was missing from the original. Michael is no longer a superhuman senseless killer and thats a good thing. I don't see why it wouldn't be but some people are getting mighty upset over it. Now would i say that its better then the original, i'm not too sure. I've seen the original for decades now and seeing this new version was so good because it was a new version. It was a new take on the same old story that i've been watching for years, much better then ANY sequel of the film and yet totally different then the original. A whole new film, but one that i enjoyed profusely. I saw it twice this past weekend and the second time around i noticed so much more, and it really is just a 'perfect' re-imagining of a classic.",Halloween
923,dalejrtony,Made the way it was intended,10,2 September 2007,As a fan of horror I went in with low expectations considering that most horror movies that come out now a days are just garbage. I was pleasantly shocked by the time the end credits rolled. I was pleased that the movie kept just the right enough amount of what the classic had that made it special while updating it for todays standards. I liked the whole Michael Myers back story and the fact that it wasn't to dragged out and it didn't take away much time from the plot that we have all come to love since we saw the original. The only real bad thing that comes to mind that really wasn't all that bad was the demise of Dr. Loomis. It worked for this edition of the story though. The main reason I give this movie a ten is the fact that it was made the way John Carpenter and Debra Hill had intended. They say they never planned on making a sequel. Everybody felt the way the original classic ended was meant to leave it open for a sequel which it wasn't. I can appreciate what Rob Zombie did tying up the loose ends and having it conclude as a stand alone film.,Halloween
924,tmspice1,Where's the scares??...A true Abomination to a Classic Film,1,6 September 2007,"Halloween 2007 is one of THE most depressing experiences of my entire life. Vulgar, crass, boring, and utterly witless, this entry in the ""torture porn"" genre is a true bastardization of John Carpenter's enduring classic...what an insult! There is absolutely no sense of mood or atmosphere that made the original so wonderful; no suspense, no surprises, no likable characters (the worst being Laurie, Linda and Annie...these 3 belong in a biker chick film, not a Halloween film), no clever use of foreshadowing or music, just an overlong waste of everyone's precious time. This is yet another horror film of late that confused vulgarity and torture with scares. The first half was OK...if it was in another movie; it did NOT belong in the Halloween mythology. The second half was the most inept and mind-numbingly awful ""reimagining"" of Carpenter's classic that was ever committed to celluloid. It's hard to imagine anything worse than ""Halloween: Resurrection"" with a karate kicking Michael Myers; but this one joins it inch by painful inch. HALLOWEEN 2007 is a slap in the face to any true fan of the series, or horror films in general, and Rob Zombie should feel complete and utter shame.",Halloween
925,mhughett71,Easily the worst installment of the series,1,7 September 2007,"I was looking forward to this movie for a long time, as I am a fan of the original and several of the other Halloween titles. I went in with an open mind and made a point not to compare this movie to the original.It didn't matter.Who keeps giving Rob Zombie money to make movies? He has no talent. This movie is nothing but a typical 21st century teen slasher film, thin on plot and terribly weak in character.Part of the charm of the original was the fact that the characters were so well written. Not this time. I couldn't wait for the annoying, cliché'd characters to die. Horrible acting all around, especially from Zombie's wife, who couldn't get a job outside of one of his movies.There is way too much needless language and gratuitous nudity in this movie. If Zombie had an ounce of talent he could define his characters without resorting to such garbage.Since Zombie has no talent, he has to put Michael Myers in every other scene, instead of reserving him for the truly good spots. Absolutely no suspense whatsoever in this film.Currently I am watching the working print of this film, which is marginally better. Why this wasn't released instead of the turd that hit the theaters is beyond me.I have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life. Save your money and watch the abysmal parts 5 or 6 instead. Even they are better than this hideous tripe.",Halloween
926,ndpitch,"An interesting first half, a rushed ending",5,9 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween took an interesting approach to the portrayal of Michael Myers' early years. Being able to see some reasons why Myers became a ferocious killer (and why he always wears the mask) certainly made the Halloween story a bit more fulfilling. However, Zombie's creativity quickly plummeted in the last half of the movie. The overly fast-paced rendition of John Carpenter's original was crammed into 60 minutes of confusing changes of the original plot.The eerie atmosphere of Carpenter's masterpiece is completely lost in the remake. Zombie transforms Myers from a stalker who slowly kills off his victims deceptively into an omnipresent modern day slasher who kills excessively.The bottom line? What made the original so great was the constant buildup to Halloween night. A large portion of the movie deals with Myers stalking Laurie. And even when night finally falls, you still only see Myers in the background lurking in the shadows. Aside from the interesting take on the early years of Myers, Zombie's remake lacks most characteristics that made the original a classic. For the most part, the remake is a typical modern day slasher movie with an interesting 45 minute opening.5/10",Halloween
927,joe_sweet_1,Loved it!!,9,30 September 2007,"I don't understand what all of the fuss is about. I thought it was very well done, and well, it's going to be pretty hard to make the same people dying that you've seen in a previous version of the film, suspenseful. I personally found the pre theater version to be a bit better. Danny Trejo didn't die, and it all seemed a tad more realistic, even if the scene was offensive. And people really need to get over themselves. Things like the rape scene happen in real life. It doesn't make Zombie a bad person for showing it. I also personally liked the original ending better, and I sincerely hope that when they release the DVD, there are two full versions of the movie. One, the original, and the other the theatrical release. I thought the movie flowed a bit better, and made more sense. The final theatrical version of the film, was still very god, though in my opinion. I didn't like that trejo's character died, and the transfer scene was kind of unnecessary. But overall, a very good remake. If it were still in the cinema here, I'd go back and watch it a couple more times.",Halloween

929,fatfredyfreak,Did he even watch the REAL Halloween?,1,15 September 2007,"Why must Hollywood continue to churn out these worthless remakes? I'll be honest and say I wanted to like this movie, but I went in with low expectations. But, really, has Rob Zombie ever actually seen Halloween? Michael Myers was a normal 6 year old boy from a normal family who, suddenly, for no reason at all, put on a halloween mask, grabbed a knife, and murdered his sister. Zombie's Michael is supposed to be 11, his mother is a stripper, his dad is AWOL, and everybody, EVERYBODY, cusses worse than a sailor. As a fan of Mr Zombies music, these plot elements don't seem very new or fresh. After 10 minutes or so, I knew this was going to be just like his first 2 movies, bloody, violent, and boring. The only thing he didn't ruin was the music, and I was surprised he didn't find some way slip a hooker and a f-bomb in there. And then there was the cast. The girl paying Lourie was too short,too young, and lets be honest, too annoying. By the end, I just wanted her to shut up and go away. When I heard who was playing Dr Loomis, I was relieved. But he totally phoned it in on this one. All in all, this is Mr Zombies worst effort yet.",Halloween
930,CitizenLame08,Starts off okay but then turns into a below average film,6,4 October 2007,"I'm analysing this movie not living in the past, as to come up with an objective view. I know it's a remake but the Carpenter version and Zombie version have two very different plots. Not going too much into detail, just basic thoughts.Firstly I thought the killings were done quite well, there was a believable and horror factor brought by them which you would expect of one as sick as Rob Zombie.I enjoyed the first half of the film more than the second, seeing that ugly screwed up kid go around torturing people was refreshing. I do not like Sheri Moon's acting, I know she's your wife Rob but she sucks! Great body though! and great Pole Dancer! And Rob, hey here's a tip! TRY USING DIFFERENT ACTORS FOR THE NEXT FILM YOU DIRECT! GIVE IT A SHOTAnyway, After the 15 year continuation(in the film) it was almost as if Rob Zombie forgot he was making a horror movie and thought he was directing American Pie 5(or is it 6). The slutty hot teenage girls(whilst pleasing on the eye) weren't really offering much for the story. This led into a seemingly never ending finale, though the suspense continued.So overall, it was okay, not as good as The Devils's Rejects, I didn't think much of the original Halloween to be honest so I won't compare them. It's a decent horror flick which starts off well but fails to keep up the good work, also makes a decent soft porn with lots of swearing and hot teenage(legal) nipples. I would recommend a cable watch in a few years not one for the DVD collection though. Unless you somehow buy the first 45 minutes.",Halloween
931,aebabe1522-1,Not worth the $8,3,1 September 2007,"Now, I have never commented on IMDb before so this shows how strongly I felt after watching this movie.I have to say, when I heard that there was going to be a Halloween remake, I was ecstatic. Halloween has to be one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I am so sick of the ""scary"" movies that they're making today which include nothing more than boobs and gore. Horror movies are about hiding your eyes because you don't know where the killer is going to pop out from next..not hiding your eyes because someone is getting their fingers cut off for the pleasure of some creep. Anyway. Like many people, I have been waiting for this movie to come out for months. I kind of wish that it never came out.First of all, where is the suspense? There was not one point in Zombie's remake where my heart started to race or my stomach dropped in anticipation. You know exactly when Michael is going to kill someone...and it happens WAY too often for that matter. What was the death count in this movie? Like, 30? It sure seemed that way. It got really old after a very short while. The original did a fantastic job of building suspense. While I have to admit that the mask in this movie was great, we're supposed to believe that the knife that he killed these people with and the mask Judith's boyfriend borough to bed were not only still in his house, but had somehow made it underneath the floorboards somewhere? We don't even know how Michael GOT BACK to his house, or anywhere else for that matter. He does seem to move around quickly though. I could live with the first half of the movie, though it didn't come off as a horror movie to me. It was like a biography with a little blood. The part that really made me wonder why the hell I was watching this was the second half of the movie when he gets back to Haddonfield. I think I read a comment on here or a bulletin yesterday that I thought of while I was watching the movie. The user's post asked the question: If you had never seen the original Halloween before, how the hell would you know who Laurie and her friends were or why we were even watching them to begin with? The first Halloween worked because we were introduced to Laurie within the first half hour and her character was actually developed! Taking this as an independent movie, we have NO IDEA who Laurie and her friends are. We know they talk about sex a lot and swear a lot and Laurie is going to babysit for Annie so she can get it on with her boyfriend, but that's about it. We don't even know why Michael is going after Laurie until Loomis explains that she is his sister. Even then, why really? It's really upsetting me again just to recount the absurdity that was this movie.Since I don't feel like getting worked up again, I'll leave it at this: If you like seeing a lot of tits, ass, and blood with very little scare....you will love this movie. It won't even satisfy you really if you like the gore aspect because all you see is a knife going into some people. I hate gore and there was not a point where I really cringed at the sight of one of Michael's kills.",Halloween
932,classyjazzyb,"Overacted, Oversexed, Over-stupidified",2,31 August 2007,"Those are the 3 main words I would use to describe this movie What really killed it was just the horrible acting on almost cast member's behalf. Every character with the exception of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis came off as very annoying and dumb. From the redneck father to the stripper mother, to the selfish sister to the guy in the bathroom, all the way to Lindsay, Laura and Annie, it just seem like one big competition to see who can be the most dim-witted person in the entire movie. The trashy dialog that came out every characters mouth was an embarrassment to watch, especially on the part of the 3 school girls, whether it be a cuss word or something about sex, I guess it was Zombie's attempt to cater to the average dumb American teenager out there. The 2007 version of Lindsay Strode was also sad to watch as she severely lacks the depth that Jamie Lee Curtis brought to her character in the 1979. The only acting performance worth mentioning was by Malcolm McDowell who in my opinion actually did a better job playing Dr. Loomis than Donald Pleasence did back in the original.I think Zombie took the right approach when it came to remaking the movie in that he decided to focus more on Myers' childhood before he became an infamous serial killer which is something the original Halloween movie barely touched on. However his efforts on telling a good story about Michael's childhood fell short. Instead of thinking of something a little more creative or intelligent, he took the easy way out and blamed his condition on a combination of being bullied at school, and being raised in a broken home, shitty parents, bla bla bla.Although I'm not a big fan of remakes, I believe if done right this remake could have worked, unfortunately for me, it didn't. And for all of you on the message boards who actually think that this version is better than the original, if you really believe that, then your IQ is lower than a lobotomized sloth.",Halloween

Rob Zombie's version is really a new Halloween movie altogether. Although the same characters exist and some scenes are reminiscent of the original, its not. I'm a big fan of the original so I went into this movie with no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. I was a little taken back by th violence and gore because the original had none. I think this Michael Myers is very violent but you still feel for him. Especially with certain scenes with Laurie. If you are wanting a good scare and a new take on a classic, check this out, you won't be disappointed.

934,chickychicky69,Awful and made me not scared of Michael Myers anymore!,1,7 September 2007,"I like Rob Zombie songs and movies but when I heard that he was doing a Halloween remake I knew it would be a disaster. First of all Rob Zombie doesn't leave any mystery to Michael Myers like in the first one, but instead shows a stupid story for half of the movie how Michael started to kill. And the whole reason I found him scary was because he didn't talk, but in this one he talks a lot, which totally ruins it for me. And the long blond hair didn't do much either, Michael has brownish black hair not blond. And another thing, at the end when he's about to kill Laurie, his sister,(who in the movie isn't even told that Michael was her brother), Dr. Loomis tries to stall Michael from killing Laurie telling him that she didn't do anything, and Michael holds her as a hostage. Michael Myers does not negotiate he doesn't keep someone hostage and doesn't listen to reason he just kills on instinct. Then he lets Laurie go and gets shot several; times by police and dies. what the? gosh. He can't die he is like practically invincible. This may seem stupid to people who haven't seen the originals, but it's the truth, for anyone who disagrees watch the original movie first then we'll talk.

I know its tough for all you generation add'ers out there. But seriously if the first film wasn't a mindless, politically incorrect and gory romp you really should go rent some more John Carpenter movies to see what the man is notorious for... these movies are fun and sometimes mindless. I just guess in this day and age that as soon as a remake comes out the net fan gheyboys all feel the need to flame, and granted some of it is justifiable as in the case of Dawn or The first TCM remake w/ Biel. But throwing it out there, and i have only seen the workprint thus far, but the opening reel gave me chills on my spine...literally. To me its Zombies opus and thats not bad for having two decent films under your belt already. But those are just like my opinions dude. I mean maybe when you go make a movie that does well or a movie period then you have a little more right to just outright flame it and not sound completely stupid, but until then its a matter of taste and my opinion is that you have really bad taste and not the so bad its good or funny but the so bad that you suck at life. cheers ;)",Halloween
936,mwgfghost,Remake? NO,10,3 September 2007,You can not even call this a remake. It's half prequel and half new movie. Sure it's the same character names and everything but I'm pretty sure that it's modern times when he's an adult cause one of the girls has a cell phone(that was the spoiler) It's the same storyline but Rob Zombie did Michael Myers a hell of a lot more justice. He showed what he was like when he was a kid and also showed him in the insane asylum. So please stop calling this a remake and stop comparing it to the original. And why would Donald Pleasence be rolling over in his grave? Malcom McDowell played Loomis just as good as Donald Pleasence. I really don't see how you can compare this to the original because it's so much more twisted and not like the original at all other than the plot. I saw this movie last night with my two cousins and a friend and I loved it. I think Halloween was the best horror movie in 1978 and I think Rob Zombie's Halloween is the best horror movie of today. And please nobody bring up the SAW films cause that's not horror. That's snuff.

Personally, I hated the Halloween series. All the previous Halloween movies had no depth, very thin plots, terrible directing, and poor acting. Rob Zombie has single handedly redeemed the Halloween series. Sherri Moon Zombie is one of the most underrated actresses in the business, and she again proves herself in this film. Rob Zombie gives the villains and the victims personality and depth to every character. The action is dark and extremely disturbing. Micheal Meyers is scarier than ever, and the more you understand his psychotic dementia, the more frightening he becomes. Rob Zombie pulls you into the world of the Meyers family and brings the story and characters to life.

Basically he turned it into one his movies, for example ""The devil's rejects"" with people acting stupid and half the movie showing bare breast. The only good and scary thing, not ridiculous thing, about this movie was the person who played Michael was huge and the sight of him as an adult basically made you feel bad for the guards that had to watch over him.

I'd hoped it wasn't just another excuse for Hollywood to re-make a classic just to milk the money bull dry. I was totally surprised though as it brings a fresh new approach to the classic Halloween we all know, and love. As with other Rob Zombie films such as House of a 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects focusing mostly on the killers, rather than the victims. This version of Halloween is the same, we see almost over half the movie through the eyes of the young Michael Myers, this makes the movie a whole lot eerier, as you get the feeling that you know the killer in this movie. Don't let this being a re-make put you off going to see it as it is one of the best re-makes I've seen in recent years.Good movie to take your bird to, shell be gripping you with fear all night.

940,zerofied,worst excuse for a remake ever,1,4 September 2007,"If you have even the slightest appreciation for the original - save yourself the trouble, this is as bad as you're thinking it will be... probably worse and to top it all off - IT WASN'T SCARY - JUST DISGUSTING Rob Zombie (who according to credits ""wrote"" this...eh hem)should have just made the Devils Rejects part 50 or whatever & left this classic alone. He did not treat the remake with style, respect or any artistic integrity. At one point he must have thought to himself ""gee, I'd like to shoot a pointless yet unnecessarily graphic rape scene"".If you want to go about making or enjoying the new style ""in your face whether you like it or not"" movies - why not just create your own genre, call it torture porn and lets move on. But please stop pretending that this is what horror is... Now to specifics: Michael Myers was never the product of a dysfunctional family - that's way to simple, this was a boy in a picket fence suburban happy family who was pure evil - that's what made him so damn creepy - there was no bullshit explanation, it's just something that happened, it also goes a little further towards explaining why axes, gunshots and anything else they've tried didn't kill him. Your basic run of the mill psycho is not usually that resilient. Also, why does every ignorant person in Haddonfield, IL sound like they're from Kentucky? Maybe you're not so good with maps, but Illinois is no where near the south, champ. Making the general statement that only inbred, lazy, rape-happy drunks sound like that is a less than charming assumption.You didn't even keep the closet scene... what the hell is the matter with you?Lori Strode & her gaggle of whore-bitch friends... pathetic & horribly written. These girls were horrible & incredibly one dimensional. Someone has some SERIOUS mommy issues to work through - might I recommend a more private therapy? I wish you wouldn't subject the world to this bullshit, but if you must, at least stop trying to disguise it. I could have warmed up to the idea of modernizing a classic.

941,jedispacemunky13,Zombie fails long time Halloween fan...,1,3 September 2007,"I have been watching the Halloween films for as long as they have been on video. I have been watching horror films all my life. I have collected them most of my life. So I have seen a lot, and I still have a lot more to see. I watched the Halloween series grow a lot worse from the 3rd film on down. When it came time for Halloween H20, it could not have ended the series better. The they made another and when Busta Rhymes used karate on Michael, it was the final nail in the coffin. The series to me was dead. When Rob Zombie was announced as the next director to do a Halloween film, I didn't really care, they were already ruined. When I heard it was a remake, I got a little bit of hope in me. I hated House of 1000 corpses, and Devil's Rejects. They weren't horror to me. It was like he sat down and wrote the films as if the world had no morals, no one cared about anyone, and everyone was raised in a dirty truck-stop by crack addicts and hookers.For some reason I thought he might actually care about doing Halloween very well since it would be the best thing to do. I went in the theater ready to love this film. If you plan on seeing this movie(which I advise against) stop reading this right about here if you want nothing ruined for you. If you don't care then keep on reading and I'll tell you what made this movie a sad waste of film, time, money, and everything else this film could effect..... .. .. The film started off bad right from the get go. The story was moving in a great direction, but the actors and dialog were killing the movie slowly. The crippled step-dad checking out his step-daughter, calling Michael ""Queer"" and ""Psycho"" destroying the breakfast table with an infant just feet behind him. Screaming obscene lines at everyone who came on screen with him really made the first few scenes annoying. It was the Devil's Rejects all over again. Michael gets his heart broken by his sister when she doesn't take him out for trick-or-treating. So he kills all but his mother and infant sister wearing the trademark white mask. When his mom comes home from work the cops are arriving to take him away already. He claims, while in smiths grove, that he doesn't remember killing anyone. He even asks his mom if everyone at home is OK. The movie seems like it's going to redeem itself for a moment. The night janitor tells Michael to buck up and not let these walls get him down. When Micheal finds out he can't go home he kills a nurse and doesn't speak anymore. His mother goes home and commits suicide leaving Laurie crying in her crib.Years later when he is to be transfered, Michael kills the guards and gets free. The janitor that befriended him is shown no mercy where it would have made a huge difference if he HAD. At this point it has become impossible to care about any character except Laurie. Michael goes back to his old home where he breaks floorboards up to get back his old knife and mask. Now if anyone knows anything about latex it doesn't keep very well even indoors. It rots in moisture, this mask as you see in the trailer is in great shape. Just a little dirty.We meet Laurie who is grown and in high school and as soon as she gets on screen, she is just as vulgar and demoralized as every other person in the film. Now even in class every girl she talks to is given lines to make hookers blush. Even Dr. Loomis is a waste in this film. It's like horrible bar band with no talent covering great songs. Only they turn it up just enough to bother your ears, and get lyrics wrong just to upset you. It was at this point I walked out of the movie. If anyone write back to tell me that the movie got better after that, I doubt it, plus what good is a movie that is half good? I am not interested at all in seeing the rest of the film. To avoid going, I actually wish they woulda just found another lame way to make a sequel rather than remake it. As long as Rob Zombie doesn't direct it.",Halloween

943,nickaleck,The aging makes NO SENSE!,3,2 September 2007,"The film begins in 1963 and then flashes forward 15 years to the night Michael escapes and returns to Haddonfield. Why, then, do the characters have cell phones and are there 1993 Ford Mustangs along the streets of Haddonfield? To me, this just makes the film seem sloppy and badly imagined. If you are going to take the time to ""re-imagine"" a film that is as iconic and famous as Halloween, these should be obvious things to deal with! The opening of the film is clever and deals with the events leading up to Michael's first murder. Minor details that were simply Rob Zombie's way of putting his mark on the film include a white trash family that Michael allegedly comes from (even though in the original his mother and father seem to be pretty straight-laced, almost nerdy, people) and the fact that his mother is a stripper. Dr. Loomis is introduced early on, in the film, at Michael's school after some questionable things Michael brought to school appear (A dead cat and some pictures of animals Michael killed). I just feel that there was enough of a set up in the original John Carpenter film for Zombie to build off of, without going and adding the trashy nature of Michael's family and sympathy we are supposed to feel for him. My biggest complaint, however, is with the sloppiness of the time difference in events.",Halloween
944,mdurke,Am i the only one,9,10 October 2007,I thought this movie was gonna be just another copy of a great film but how wrong i was. OK some of the stories the same but the added insight into Mikes earlier life was interesting. I enjoyed the original and thought this was just as good perhaps better. I like the way the director didn't just do a remake but also giving a new look This could have been one of those remakes where everything was like the original but thank goodness they didn't. Wish other directors who make remakes take notice don't just copy original film add something new to it as well take the story in a new direction. Well worth the ticket price at cinema and one to look forward to on DVD,Halloween
945,tim-1699,Cards stacked against Zombie on this one.,6,31 August 2007,"I think any director going in to remake a classic or retell an old story, has to put their own spin on things. Unfortunately for writer/director Rob Zombie, the cards were stacked against him on this one before he even got out of the gate. I am not going to tell you how horrible the acting was in the movie(bad casting) but i guess when you have no dialog and a poor screenplay you had better pack a lunch, cause it is going to be a long day. If you are a RZ fan, by all means, go see this movie and appreciate it for what its worth, there are some genuine scare moments, but the character development is missing in action, and that is the department where the movie lacks. I am not one to give advice to anyone, i loved RZ's two original movies, but please, go back to doing your own thing, and for any other writers/directors looking at remaking a classic...refrain.",Halloween

And how much screen time for Lynda herself? Point is, I loved seeing them...they were cool, very realistic, but I think they were jipped and the pace of the last 3rd of the movie was WAY too rushed, even though it was awesomely done. Should have been slowed down a tad. There should have been more character development of at least Annie and Lynda, if not their boyfriends as well. Laurie should have been, although sassy, a bit less snobby. And hearing Annie's boyfriend (or F-friend...we never get to know) tell us she's ""so warm"" was pretty unnecessary as well. That was little Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4 and 5. SOME respect is warranted I think, I mean we got to see her breasts for gods sake...can't that be enough? Despite those complaints I thought it was a well-made film and much creative respect goes to Zombie for his extremely rushed effort. (grin) 8 out of 10 (for me)",Halloween
947,dckdck-1,My early (crappy) review,7,28 August 2007,"NO Spoiler - This is going to be pretty short and simple, just my opinion of the movie. I downloaded this, yes, illegally, contact my mother if you think I should be punished. Anyway, this movie overall was excellent, the first half-hour, in Michael's childhood, I don't think it could've been filmed any better. The soundtrack is perfect, and I'm not just talking about the perfect ""Halloween"" theme either. The only thing that disappointed me in the slightest was the ending, which I will not reveal.One last thing to add is that seeing as though I saw a review copy, there is a chance that it begins and ends differently than the actual theatrical version. (I heard somewhere they were re-shooting a lot).Sorry for the sloppy typing, but I'm busy elsewhere. Just wanted to be the first to submit a review, and I'm pretty sure I am.SOMEWHAT SPOILER - (To prove I did see this, here's something that you'll only know when you see it.

948,TheTrivialS,Good but bad.,6,1 September 2007,"Well the movie itself isn't very much like the original. Thats good and bad. In the original they barely showed any of his childhood, mainly just when he killed his sister. What you don't get from the first movie is why he snapped, just that he did and after there was nothing there, no morals, no consciousness, just demonic behaivour (sorry for the Canadian spelling) in a human being. This movie shows why he snaps (to be honest I probably would have too) and his early path of destruction. Now this movie makes up for that, and seemingly for too long. I personally found the childhood part took up too much of the movie. The years later Halloween night felt rushed. Whereas the childhood one was dragging along until he finally snaps. Another thing about the second movie is that they seemed to make him have a split personality, unlike the first where he simply snapped and never said another word, it was just hate. In this movie its like it takes time from him being away from his sister to make him snap. I did like the movie because of what they explained, but not what they changed.",Halloween

950,bryan-hall,number 1 is still number 1,7,16 January 2008,"When I was first told that Rob Zombie had plans to remake Halloween, I was overcome with joy. One of the greatest horror movies of all time as seen through the warped, twisted, and playful mind of Rob Zombie. How could this be any more right? However, I can't say after seeing it that Rob has lived up to his end of the bargain. Throughout the entire movie I couldn't help but go back to the original in my head and compare the two, pointing out the flaws from Rob's version. It couldn't grab my attention and keep it. Now if the John Carpenter had never made his movie, and this was Rob's original creation, I believe it would have seemed a whole lot more interesting. But knowing that it had already been done, and was done better took away from this movie. It was almost one of those situations where if it isn't broken why are you trying to fix it? But since it is Halloween, and it is Rob Zombie, I recommend watching the movie; just wait till a friend rents it though.",Halloween

As a big fan of the original Halloween, I am left dumbfounded after watching the remake by Rob Zombie. I try to imagine what compelled Rob Zombie to remake this film - and the only thing I can come up with is arrogance. Some classics are better left untouched (Bad News Bears comes to mind) and he has the gall to make an attempt at it and produce complete crap. I can't believe he got the green light to do the sequel, which I won't see, unless someone puts a gun to my head. I just hope he didn't make a lot of money on this film (or the sequel), because that was obviously his only goal.",Halloween

The movie had everything you would expect from a Rob Zombie movie, blood, gore, LOTS of language, and nudity. They made Michael look as real as they could which they did a pretty good job on him. The movie was fairly good but disappointing in many ways. If you are a hard core fan of Rob Zombie films than i recommend you see it.WARNING: (SPOILERS) You do see a longer prequel than in the original which i found quite amusing. Different from the original series also is that Michael isn't exactly superhuman in this movie although he takes a lot of hits (shot by a 357' magnum six times, stabbed in the shoulder, and fell off a balcony etc...). This time he doesn't exactly want to hurt Laurie but just find her so he can show her that he's her deranged brother but in the end he does because she's downright retarded. The ending is exactly like a Rob Zombie film. Laurie screaming constantly at nothing well except for the fact she just shot her brother. overall i give the move 5/10",Halloween

I have to say that I was very pleased with almost every aspect of this film. I was surprised to see they negate output of this film, especially on IMDb itself. People seemed to praise Devil's Rejects, but a remake scared people into thinking that they couldn't like it because the original is a classic. Well the unique story flourished. A simple cast of almost all no names really put Halloween to the test. Some really good cameos as well, so look closely. One downfall, a little too much unnecessary sex scenes. Halloween starts of slow, and finishes with a bang. No cheesy remake here, Zombie nailed it!",Halloween

The gore, swearing and 70's music in the background make the film more realistic. I like the fact that everything in this movie could actually happen, sci-fi blows, There is nothing supernatural about myers in this one. The soundtrack is awesome as well, fits the movie perfectly. The middle scene in the sanitarium gets a little slow paced and the end drags out a little bit, but the outstanding action scenes make up for that.

Rob Zombie Should Have Stuck With The Music!,1,4 September 2007,"I wish I could give 0 stars!!!I don't think I've ever saw a movie that bad in my life...and the sad part is...it's the #1 Movie in America! I know teens today are mistaking 10 lbs. of blood per scene for good horror film making but R Zombie just took it about 200 steps too far! It's the exact same thing with breasts, in the 1978 Halloween John Carpenter made it so in both nude scenes you can barely see any skin...do I even have to tell you what Zombie did? Even I think it's wrong to flaunt teenage skin on screen for a movie that everyone knows will echo through the ages. If he didn't cast his wife (witch he literally always does) as Mrs.Myers I'll bet anything that her bikini top would have came off on the poll (witch she pointlessly was on)also. But after all those and much much more the part that made me most mad was that the first five minutes took an hour to show probably because that idiot changed ? death(s) to what seems like hundreds.

If you were true Halloween fans, you would have watched all the movies rather than base everything off of the first one. All of the stuff in this movie is true, as the Halloween series goes on, you see why Michael did all of this. He was chained up as a child, his mother was a psychopath, all the stuff is there and you're just so offended because you don't want Michael to have a reason, you just miss the good old days when cold blooded psycho killers were the way they were for no reason. Don't blame Rob for coming out with an awesome movie just because it didn't meet your standards, maybe you should all go back and watch the series and see for yourself who's in the wrong. The idea that Rob Zombie was insulted by a bunch of mediocre Halloween fans is offensive in every way. Maybe you should all focus your anger on something more reasonable instead of getting angry at someone who is obviously more famous and higher up on the ladder in life than you are. For all I know, you're just jealous.",Halloween
958,LightningCountX,What a complete waste of time,1,2 September 2007,"*WARNING Contains Spoilers!* I thought this movie was going to be horrible when I first heard about the rumors, then I saw the trailer and it changed my view on the movie. Judging from the trailer this movie looked like it was going to be the real deal, and it would redeem the series. Boy was I wrong.The first 50 minutes of this movie is a prequel that makes you want to sympathize or empathize with young Michael. It basically completely changes the scary complex of the original into a more realistic version of what drives people to madness. In the original Michael is just pure evil. No reason to what made him evil, he just is which is scary. With the reality aspect added, the movie is completely stripped of its ominous atmosphere. It basically makes an excuse of why people kill. It basically makes anyone who was beaten or picked on by family or classmates look like a serial killer.The last 40-50 minutes is a complete regurgitated, cut up mess of the original movie. There is no character development here, and you basically just want the characters to die because they have no personality, and all they want to do is have sex orgies all night. Another thing that also annoyed me was how Michael was made into a 6 foot 250 lbs killer. What is up with all the horror movies today? Is everybody with a body building complex a serial killer? Another weird thing with Michael is when he is an adult he tends to spare a few of his victims for unknown reasons. The female police officer wasn't killed, she was still alive in the scene. Now she could have died seeing that he ripped something out of her throat, but they never showed it so I'm taking that she didn't die. Also Annie survives her bloody chest scene. After that scene Michael kidnaps Laurie and she wakes up only to see Michael kneeling in front of her and he takes his mask off. He shows her a picture of him as a kid holding her as a baby and she says ""I don't understand"" which is logical, you were a baby and have no clue about your past. But what I honestly don't get is why did Michael kill her friends, her family, and everyone that he could to get to her? All he wanted was to see her again because he loves her. Not to kill her in the normal storyline. What the hell is that? I almost wanted to walk out at that scene. Another thing about this movie is that it has no suspense at all. In the original Halloween Michael is stalking Laurie and her friends throughout the movie. In this version its 5 minutes of him stalking them. There was no suspense. I just wanted it to end. Once again Rob Zombie proves to be as much of a failure as a director as he is a musician. And the part about all this that angers me the most is that this movie will spawn sequels following this horrible storyline. If you thought Halloween Resurrection was horrible, your in for a real surprise...",Halloween
959,roadkillentertainment,A True Fan of 70's Horror and Zombie will not be Disappointed,8,10 September 2007,"I usually don't post on message boards but felt I had something to say. I have read a lot of the posts here and I can honestly say that I really enjoyed RZ's remake/prequel.I am a huge fan of the original and I enjoy Halloween 2,3,4,5,6: The Producer's Cut, H20 was OK (kind of feels like a Scream rip-off)and Resurrection had flaws but I did have fun with it.At this point it should be done with but I had to keep the faith that RZ would do the franchise justice and I feel that he has done a very admirable job of re-inventing something that us true horror fans know like the back of our hands.Let's face it there have been some terrible remakes like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Black Christmas but I won't even go there. But we seem to forget that some horror classics are remakes of films that people hold dear. Carpenter himself remade The Thing by adding gore and effects and it worked, it's a classic in it's own right. The Fly by Cronenberg is another example of a gross out fest but most of us horror fanatics love that film as well. So if you look at it like that Halloween 2007 is a welcome addition to the genre by one of the best new horror filmmakers out there.Like I said the original is great but let's face facts here most modern audiences would rip Carpenter's vision apart. They would find the acting sub-par at best and would laugh at all the dialogue supplied by PJ Soles and friends. Much like the Carpenter fanatics are trashing Zombie's acting and directing choices.I will admit that I was lucky enough to see the unfinished work-print and I think some of the new changes feel like they were done solely to impress modern audiences. Then again maybe Rob really wanted those changes made, this is something that no one but Rob himself really knows.Overall, I loved it. I really don't feel that explaining Michael ruins his creepiness, I think it actually makes him scarier. Well I think I've rambled enough. Just be happy that Michael Bay didn't remake Halloween.",Halloween

It answered the questions about what happened to Michael when he was young. In the original all you were told was that Michael had killed his entire family. Yes that made for great suspense and drama but I always wanted to know why and how. You are finally able to see that now and understand a bit of his psyche. Now you know why he went back and tried to find his sister. SPOILER....besides his mother she is the only family member that he didn't kill. She is all he has left. His mother killed herself and now Loomis is telling him that he is leaving. The only living person who Michael still cares about is his sister and he will not let anyone or anything get in his way.Bringing Michael in to a real character is what he always needed. Now you know part of what happened at home and what happened in the institution to help shape him in to the killer that he is. Is it scary? You bet your life, Gory? Absolutely, Realistic? Watch the news for a week and then tell me that you don't think there are freaks like that in this world. No one has taken it to the level that Carpenter or Zombie did but they are there. Look at how many mothers kill their children or husbands kill their wives. The world is full of monsters but most people just turn there heads and look the other way. As a former state prison guard and now working security for the largest hospital in my town I can tell you most people look away from the truth until it sneaks up and bites them.Back to the movie...it had the 4 things every scary movie must have: A demented/unstable/psycho that is doing the killings, plenty of blood/guts/and gore, a dark abandoned house to hide and kill your victims in, and a beautiful co-star for you to torment.Bravo Rob for taking on such a muther of a masterful movie and remaking it but keeping it true to the original!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Halloween

963,pennacchia,It's not John Carpenter it is Rob Zombie. Keep that in your head when you go into this.,7,31 August 2007,"This movies takes a different approach to what makes Michael Myers terrifying. In the past his inhuman mas murders were shocking because of the absolute lack of emotion and more machine like manner in which things occur. Zombie offers audiences a background on myers. Where before the terror came in the lack of explanation, Zombie creates terror by showing how empty and how reasonless he was at 10 years old.An interesting note about the movie is after Michael at 10 you never see his face. This part may not be different from standard Halloween movies, but unlike those, in this film you have already seen Michael's face as a boy. This then leaves the audience placing the boys face beneath the mask of the 30 year old monster making the idea of these overly brutal killings more difficult to chalk up to another death in a slasher flick. The movie gives less focus to Lori Strode and much more focus on Michael and his progressions from 10 to 30.Zombie makes the smart call of not completely taking his own new plot line, but also not creating an exact carbon copy, leaving in specific scenes and details but still skipping over some of the more memorable ones. No, it is not John Carpenter's movie remastered, but then if you want that just run it through some filters to make his movie look new. Instead, this movie feels like a Zombie movie but in all the right ways. Best Halloween in a very long time.",Halloween

Rob Zombie I am disgusted by what you have done to a classic series of films. I will say it was interesting to get a sense of what could have possibly been the early stages of Michael's childhood etc, however, the remaking of the scenes from the original movie with the three girls was absolutely disgraceful. I was hoping for some new additional plot from where we last saw Michael.... all burned up in the examiner's office. And I want to personally thank you for ruining the legacy of my favorite character in all of the Halloween movies....Dr. Loomis. This portrayal was no where near the excellence of the late Donald Pleasance. Donald Pleasance made you feel a part of the film. When you heard him talk about Michael, you felt chills running down your spine because you were able to feel the fear and the evil behind the mask. Oh and on a lighter note, the young Michael walking around in the mask only looks like a damn bobblehead doll. We all know in the original that he had the clown mask ONLY!!! You could have easily shown Michael getting the mask at a costume shop after he escaped much like we saw in a previous film when he was after Jamie Lloyd. I only hope that Rob Zombie is no longer allowed to remake any more previously made classics. Thank you for ruining my legacy of what Michael Meyers was, is, and should have been.",Halloween
965,jflg63,"Rob Zombie should just quit the business, or any business for that fact",1,1 September 2007,"People would like to believe that this version can be separated from the original, which is impossible. It's a remake and will always be compared to the original. He made Micheal Myers into a product of a broken and abusive home. He was meant to be the bogyman, our greatest fears come to life. There is no reason as to why he does what he does. That's why Myers is such an interesting character. Carpenter wanted to instill unbridled fear, caused be seemingly nothing. A man who would seemingly die if he can't kill. Zombie made him into something you're supposed to understand and almost feel bad for given his circumstances. He went from being an enigma to being the product of harmful environment. That is what may have been the most disturbing thing about the original Myers, he almost seemed to have spawned from a quiet, safe neighborhood. It makes anyone in a suburb almost think ""this can happen to me."" It went from, it's the animals in the jungle, not the jungle it's self, to some abused kid growing up to the size of the left tackle for Michigan state killing every one in sight and finding his sister. Micheal is essentially what happens when we let our guard down not, psychopath with the occasional splash of humanity. Myers is meant to be abstract, not human. He took every important moment and facet of Halloween and the concept of Micheal Myers, spread his pasty white cheeks open wide and took a huge dump on them. i was left scratching my head at many things in the movie. How does he know where his sister is. His mother killing herself contributes nothing to the movie. Why does he have to be so big, he looks like a white Orlando Pace. Why did Loomis(protagonist) have to die? Why kill the Strodes(not in the original)? Why did he decide Annie had to live? The two things that got really had me searching my mind were, why does he keep using the same shitty actors in all of his movies and why did Malcolm Mcdowell and Brad Dourif(2 great actors) go any where near this script? As a movie it just plain ole' sucked nuts. You feel absolutely nothing for the characters(even though he tries very hard to absolutely no avail). The acting was so bad i actually did laugh a few times. The cinematography is on the America's Funniest Home Videos level, it's like if you took Paul Greengrass and Tobe Hooper and created a retarded clone, kind of like in Alien Resurrection when Ripley meets that retarded clone of herself and sets it on fire.

I believe that the new slant on Halloween is more visceral. Camera angles and film quality are great. It is loyal to the original, yet offers some of its own quirks. It is a very good homage to John Carpenter. Let's be honest, Carpenter is a master, but not all of his projects are classics, Escape from LA anyone? I think Rob Zombie has true talent for film-making, and I believe that if he were to try other project (ie non horror) he would do well. He has a good understanding of 'feel'. House of 1000 corpses was his first movie, experimental in a way. Much the same with Devils Rejects, but with that it was slightly more refined and more story driven. Halloween is the next step and a great adaptation with attention to story (or back-story). I look forward to his next project.",Halloween

968,kane_vs_theundertaker,"An Amazing Reimagining, Best Movie of 2007... of the Decade, Even",10,7 January 2008,"Halloween has got to be one of my favorite movies of '07 in more ways than one. This is the first Rob Zombie film I've seen so I couldn't compare it with his others, but to me, this movie was extremely well-done.Adding a back story to Michael Myers was a plus in my book because the original was just too vaige for me. It will always be a classic, but there could always be something more. The fact that Michael actually talks in this remake made it more interesting for me. Another up for me is that Rob Zombie somewhat ""humanized"" Michael Myers, instead of keeping the old storyline of a mass-murdering, deranged, psychotic, masked Halloween killer trying to kill his whole bloodline - this plot line had more to it, hence making it a ""reimagining"", not just a plain old, somewhat-unretrofied copycat.I don't know how so many people can bash on this movie and call it nothing but a ""gorefest"". C'mon. Exaggeration, much? I suppose most people believe Rob Zombie should have just made an exact remake of John Carpenter's original other than giving the film some spice with his own taste and envisionment. This is modern times, things are more violent and different than how they were 30 years ago. This movie should truly have a higher rating in my opinion.The feeling of actually somewhat sympathizing with Michael Myers was different for me. I could never do that with him before. You could say this is part of his ""de-immortalization"" from being a complete an utter killing machine. The fact of the matter is, the thing most people do not understand about this movie is - realism. This could really happen. Not every child needs to come from a perfect family and suddenly snap for no apparent reason and become the Antichrist. So, the storyline could be somewhat cliché in some peoples' eyes. It's a small sacrifice for a ""real"" effect. How many people do you know that spontaneously snap, from an obedient, civilized household? Yes, it may have added more suspense or whatever to the film in critic's eyes, but it's terribly unlikely. The only unrealistic aspects of my point of Rob Zombie's attempt at realism is the fact of Michael taking a stab in the neck with a butcher knife and a few shotgun rounds to the abdomen, but hey, that's one thing some critic's can't complain about if they want to see ol' unstoppable Satan Michael.Anyways, everything in this movie was well-done: the acting, the scenery and atmosphere, etc. Even the enhanced score done by Tyler Bates, who I must say is a fantastic music producer. In my book, this film is well near perfection in my own eyes.I give it a 10/10. Mostly because I'm not a terrible movie critic, I loved Daeg Faerch, Tyler Mane and Malcolm McDowell, I thought Scout Taylor-Compton was sexy, and because I absolutely love Rob Zombie and Halloween movies.",Halloween
969,halstone-37990,Hard to see the good,6,14 October 2021,It's really hard for me to see the good in this remake since the first half give Myers a pretty generic backstory and the second half of almost a carbon copy of the original.,Halloween
970,MaxRockatansky4073,"Mr. Zombie gets an ""A"" for effort, but a ""D"" for execution.",4,3 September 2007,"Being a huge fan of the original Halloween, I cringed at the idea that someone would remake this classic. Like ""Psycho"" and ""Taxi Driver"", there are some landmark films which should be left well enough alone. When I heard that Rob Zombie was the party interested in doing the remake, my hopes were lifted (but just slightly). Anyone who knows anything about Mr. Zombie, knows that he is a huge fan of old school horror. He treats the genre with respect, and often casts forgotten B and C level performers in his films. This time out, I think that he bit off more that he can chew.The first portion of the new remake deals with a ten year old Michael Myers, and we learn about the shopping list of negative experiences and persons in his young life which cause him to become a homicidal killer .The rest of the film seams to be an attempt to condense as much of the original film in in the last forty-five minutes as possible. Mr. Zombie could have used some of the the cinematography magic he employed in his ""Devil's Rejects"" which made that film such a visual treat. Instead we have to suffer through jerky camera shots and that cursed blue lighting they use to simulate night. At least John Carpenter's classic score is present to give us something to enjoy.History will probably place this version of Halloween next to the remake of Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", and the more recent remake of Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In other words, a so-so choice for a video rental when all the good horror flicks have already been taken.",Halloween
971,samidoll-51858,Watching all the Halloween movies in a row...,9,20 October 2021,"Rob Zombie breathes life back into the franchise. And brings an interesting aesthetic and tone. I very much needed the humanization of Michael and at the same time, Zombie managed to make MM more intimidating (and more believable which is scarier). It's a different kind of horror movie than the suspenseful slashers initiated by Carpenter's masterpiece. This movie isn't perfect by any means, but I see what Zombie original vision was and I also see producers muddying it with their input. (Zombie wanted this to be an origin story in its entirety, then make a remake.) Had the studio laid off, the remake he'd envisioned could have stewed nicely in suspense without giving up time for the backstory that Zombie was passionate about.I loved it!",Halloween
972,LykeOMG123,A Big Let Down,3,25 April 2008,"Why is it now a days that whenever someone remakes a wonderful horror movie classic they feel the need to add over the top violence, disturbing images, and nude teenage girls getting whacked in the sickest ways? But then they completely forget the story line.I myself am a huge fan of the Halloween series so when i found out there was going to be a remake i clung to the tiny hope that maybe just maybe Rob Zombie wouldn't mess it up, but he did.This was nothing more then a blur of gory images and screaming full on nude girls. I mean seriously, he completely ruined what could have been a great remake.Save yourself the disgust, just stick to the old stuff.",Halloween
973,brandi775,Can I have a refund?,2,2 September 2007,"I'm so disappointed in this film that I don't even know where to begin in writing this review. First of all, when I heard that Rob Zombie was remaking this classic I was excited and anxious to see his portrayal of a classic. I knew that it would be gory since Rob Zombie is the director and honestly I'm okay with gore to some degree but that was all that was going on in this film. I was bored out of my wits! Big no-no #1 - Micheal is horrifyingly creepy because he lurks in the shadows. You never know when or if he will strike and just when you think you have his next move figured out...you don't! Part of what makes Micheal so scary is not understanding his mind. He is the true bogeyman. Rob Zombie's interpretation of Micheal Myers is pale in comparison. In Halloween (2007) Micheal is predictable and unfortunately forgettable.Big no-no #2 - Micheal kills Dr. Loomis! What? Are you kidding me? Dr. Loomis is such an intricate part of the original Halloween films that I can't believe the gall of Rob Zombie to eliminate him in this remake. Enough said! Big no-no #3 - The biggest deal breaker for me was the fact that this film was set in modern times instead of the 70's. I wasn't expecting this remake to be exactly the same as the original classic but I could hardly spot the similarities since they were few and far between. Not to mention the horrendous acting abilities of most of the cast. They left me cringing in my seat.Sadly the younger generation will love this film because they are ignorant to the original. So for them go see it and have fun. For the rest of us save your money. The time line, the plot and the acting are devoid of any and everything that make a film worth watching",Halloween
974,trever101,UMM GOOD I GUESS(spoilers!!!),7,2 September 2007,"Yes I gave it a 7. For all you haters,It was not half bad!!! I enjoyed it. Many people Liked It. For me I HATE remakes! I hated the Omen,Black Christmas,The hills have eyes,ALL OF THEM.this one to me was really good because it was the origin. Sure it was not really scary or ""off the edge of your seat"" but I like it so much!!!!ALL MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED! everything I ever wanted to know about the films have been answered.YES I LOVED THE FIRST ONE SO MUCH BETTER!

975,oldboyblue,Finally Michael is scary again!!!,7,3 September 2007,"Ever since hearing about Rob Zombie directing a new Halloween film I became excited. I'm a huge fan of the original and lets face it non of its sequels did it any justice, they were just a popcorn Friday night in bit of fun! None of them matched the suspense and chilling feeling you got from the first, even Michael's mask became something a seven year old kid would want in his Christmas stocking, hell by the time it got to the one we would all like to forget (Ressurection, f**k me Busta stick to rapping) his mask reminded me of Keanu Reeves face painted white even the hair looked like it had been waxed in to a ""just got out of bed"" look. So i knew something was gonna be done right this time, even if it didn't match the original it would still make Michael scary again. For me the shock rocker as become a great horror director and The Devil's Rejects is one of the best horror films to come out of Hollywood since Scream, another one would be Saw but the rest have gone downhill plus why make so many sequels? The Descent is also a great horror flick very original and it taps in to a fear different that just bloody gore! And talking about bloody gore, Eli Roth you started so well with Cabin Fever what happened? Anyway this film starts off as a good psychological chiller with a convincing performance by Daeg Faerch as the young Michael Myers. We see an insight into a very disturbed mind and Rob gives us some very chilling footage with his camera work. This does take away the chilling mysteries surrounding Michael that we all love from the original but hey this is Rob Zombie's version and not John Carpenters, so give him credit for a good opening chapter. Some of the acting in the opening can be a bit wooden, Sheri Moon is a bit of a culprit for this, but having said that she does give a convincing performance most of the time. The opening credits disappointed me but i guess i just love the black background with the pumpkin a little too much. When we meet Dr. Loomis (played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell) we start to get the feel of a true Halloween film. I won't say much more about the prequel part of the film but i believe it was filmed the way I hoped it would be but like anything as its ups and its downs.Now we have the bit we've been waiting for the adult Michael Myers going back home to kill anyone who stands in his way! It does feel a little rushed with not much suspense but again John Carpenter directs suspense, Rob to me likes his terror! The mask is extremely chilling and this for me is what makes Michael scary again, the way Tyler Mane moves is far better than any of the sequels but this could be down to the directing and not Tyler's acting skills although he does do a great job of making you think he's disturbed when we see him in the sanitarium. I don't feel that some of the killings were justified and we didn't really get to see much character development especially with Annie Brackett (the gorgeous Danielle Harris). The character of Lynda you kind of didn't feel anything for because she was just a spoilt bullying b**ch. We see a different side to Laurie in this film because we get to know her adoptive parents, I prefer the way Jamie Lee Curtis played it but thats a different view on the character. I don't think the film is too gory which is good (Jesus could you imagine Eli directing this? Thank f**k!) and I feel the dark gloomy haunting atmosphere of a Halloween film along with using the original score is captured very well. I am not going to say anymore but if you are a Halloween fan and not someone who as just convinced themselves that if it ain't John Carpenters's its sh*t, then you will enjoy this film and feel like me that Rob has done what he set out to do, make Michael Myers scary again!!!",Halloween
976,Shenmuey,just bad,5,3 September 2007,This is not a good horror/slasher film. I mean I get what he is trying to do and don't get me wrong its a good idea to see the other view from mikes eyes. This movie was just blood and boobs. It really was just a bad porno. The movie does start out good you think that its going to be a good film to watch for your 7 bucks but then it just goes for the worst. The middle of the movie you are just like wow this is bad there is no point after 15 years later because its just crap. They try to move him out and then he escapes from the cops kills people while trying to find his little sister. I am not going to kill the ending for anyone but please don't go see this movie and save your money for a better movie.,Halloween
977,fryet,SOOO Disappointing,1,20 September 2007,"Let me start by saying that the original ""Halloween"" is by far my favorite horror flick ever. I have the original movie poster from 1978 framed and hanging in my basement. I'll also admit, I have the Michael Myers doll that plays the music. Huge fan. So, when I heard RZ was remaking this, I was a little peeved. Then I started to see some of the previews, and actually became excited about it. So, I DID go in with an open mind. The best way to sum this up, is that RZ COMPLETELY missed the point of what made Michael so scary in the first place. The fact that there WAS no reason, no conscience, no sense of ANYTHING. He was, and I quote, ""purely and simply evil."" He IS, in essence, the ""boogyman"". Trying to shove down my throat the fact that he became like that because his family was white trash is NOT scary. If I wanted to watch Jerry Springer, I would have stayed home. RZ if you read this, you need to realize that gore does not mean scary. It was not necessary in the 1978 original, yet that remains some 30 YEARS LATER the GREATEST horror movie of all time. What does that tell you????",Halloween
978,drhowell73,This is MUCH better than the small minds have made it out to be!,7,31 December 2007,"First, I must say that John Carpenter's Halloween is one of the finest films ever made, for many reasons.That said, I appreciate Rob Zombie's Halloween for entirely different reasons. (I should add that I've only seen the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" on DVD, not the theatrical version, if that makes a difference.) No, Rob Zombie's version is not as brilliant as the original. No, the second half (i.e. the part that essentially mimics the original, and unsuccessfully at that) is nowhere near as effective a suspenseful horror film. And like many people, I thought I was in for gratuitous gore and stupidity when I began watching the film.However, once I realized what Rob Zombie was doing (i.e. bringing humanism to the Michael Myers character), I made a conscious decision that many people seem not to have made (which, by the way, is fine....their choice, their loss)---I decided to read this film as an entirely different entity than the original. In doing so, I began to appreciate what Rob was doing with the story, and how he accomplished it through his maturing style of film-making. In short, I think that once I disengaged the autopilot, so to speak, I stopped complaining about what this movie wasn't, and started looking at what it was.No, it's not brilliant, but it's good. No, it's not as suspenseful as the original, but it's probably more moving in an entirely different way. And it's not nearly as ""gratuitously gory"" as most people make it out to be. In fact, there's not much more blatant slashing in this than there was in the original. To the contrary, Rob displays a knack for making you think you saw more gore than you did, which is the sign of good horror direction.Most importantly, once I stopped thinking of the Michael Myers mythos that I knew, I began to appreciate the entirely different character that Rob created for this remake. In doing so, I saw Michael Myers' actions in this film in an entirely different light, culminating in an entirely different view of his motivations and how they related to his sister.Yes, I could complain about the inappropriate use of the original John Carpenter music. Yes, I could also complain about the blatant mimicry of John Carpenter's camera shots and angles in the second half of the film. But in the end, I found myself wanting to watch the first hour of the film again and again because it's fresh, and it's a new story that's told in an effective way. In fact, I think that it stands alone apart from the Halloween movies altogether.It's evident to me that Rob Zombie showed his true skill with the new material...material for which he had nothing to copy from and was therefore able to create with his own voice. In my opinion, he never should have made a remake of Halloween. Instead, he should have realized what he'd created in his new back story and made that into an original film in its own right. That film would have flown, and wouldn't have been subject to the kind of criticism that it's become burdened with.But, since that wasn't the case, I must appreciate what he did within the context of the remake. But even so, not to appreciate what he HAS done is short-sighted and small minded.",Halloween
979,tkaliforniaa,Disappointed fan,2,21 March 2010,"I've been a fan of the Halloween movies since I saw the first one with Jamie Lee Curtis. I was disappointed when I saw the third one because it had no relevance to the previous movie(s). I was disappointed with Halloween: Resurrection as well. I was excited when this Halloween came on TV because I hadn't seen it yet. Within the first 5 minutes though I was pretty disappointed. To start off, in the previous movies, Michael Myers had been characterized as a quiet little boy who snapped (almost as if he had some form of autism). Having him just getting angry and killing everyone doesn't really fit. It just makes him ordinary if he kills everyone out of anger, plus, how would the THORN fit into the way Rob Zombie made this movie In the old movies, Judith's room was girly, compared to in this movie it was dark, just like everything else. The mask that he wore was wrong as well. In the original movie he had been wearing a pantomime mask (which his niece will eventually wear in the 4th movie) when he killed his sister. Michael Myers did not get the Captain Kirk mask until he had escaped from Smith's Grove. He found that mask in a hardware store I think The way Michael Myers escapes doesn't hold true to the original movies. He had escaped during transport. Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance) had discussed how one of the nurses had been teaching Michael Myers how to drive. Also, I wish someone else had been chosen to play Michael Myers (both as a kid and an adult), because he isn't supposed to be soo big. He seems like a behemoth as an adult. It was fun to see Danielle Harris back in the movies, if only she had been in The Curse of Michael Myers, where it is revealed that Jamie Lloyd had a child. Then it could've brought everything full circle, Danielle Harris playing Jamie Lloyd (Michael Myers niece), Tommy finding the baby, then Danielle Harris meeting a younger version of Tommy Nuff said",Halloween
980,d-awdreygore,Where do I start with the bad...,1,28 December 2007,"I can't really bring myself to relive this film by writing about it. But if you liked the original Halloween, stay far far away from this stinker. In essence, Zombie used every cheap trick in the book and it plays as one boring cliché after another. I can see that there was some attempt to make a character driven film, but the focus was on the wrong characters and felt forced and clumsy. One of the really positive elements of the original was a strong female character and this film felt like an exploitation flick. On the positive side, there was a pretty nifty cast, but they could just as well have cast random people for the amount of acting they got to do. And they ""totally"" kept in the horrible fake dialog that was the lowest point of the first film. I wish I could wash my brain.",Halloween
981,kristin-loveland,Simply Entertaining Midnight Movie,7,1 September 2007,"What expectations can you have? Honestly, this is a remake and a horror film, plus it's Rob Zombie whose foul and downright ridiculous dialogue is, though excessive and distasteful, highly entertaining. I'm not sure if it's as entertaining as his previous two films, in terms of overall content. The cinematography never disappoints, and I loved the obvious bad score. Not to mention the casting is genius, Danny Trejo, Brad Dourif, Dee Wallace, Sid Haig, Clint Howard, etc, some better than others, but once again this isn't an art film and hardly serious. The murder scenes were ridiculous and unrealistic, but once again entertaining.",Halloween
982,nrzeppa,"Worth seeing without a doubt, but It's far from a Masterpiece.",6,31 August 2007,"When I first found out that Rob Zombie was directing this I had goosebumps. I was so blown away by The Devils Rejects when i saw it that I may have expected too much from Halloween. I think the biggest problem people are going to have with this remake/re-imaging is that they will say that showing Michael Myers as a little boy will take away from his ""terror"". For some people this may be true, but I really did enjoy the back-story which shed insight as to why Michael became such a monster. The strange thing about this movie is that if I had gone into it without knowing Rob Zombie directed it, I'm not 100% confident that I would have thought it was a Zombie film. I guess I just expected complete and total disgusting scenes that made you look away from the screen for at least a few seconds. The ""Shock"" value wasn't there like I anticipated. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, I would see it again but The Devil's Rejects remains Zombies best work... It was a little but painful watching some of the acting in this movie... some parts actually really made me mad it was so poor. But all in all...very cool way of portraying a young Michael and there were a few scenes that were quite unique and creepy as hell. I don't want to say what they were but def. check this film out. I expect very mixed reviews from people! I give it a 6/10",Halloween
983,sandellabrick63,Enjoy,7,2 September 2007,"i enjoyed this movie! I am a DIE HARD Halloween fan, saw the original opening night and have watched it about it at least once a month since (twisted huh?). I thought this movie was pretty good for what it was meant to be. I am not sure how much i liked the back story of him being poor and from a crappy home, i also wondered how he ever knew about Lori....I think him being from a normal middle class family made the first one scarier because there was no reason for him to be a killer but it makes sense. I liked the cast for the most part ( Dannielle Harris was in 3 or 4 as a little kid). I loved Michael that boy was great, he looked so sweet but scary at the same time. I think people tend to over analyze movies too much and this is no different. Zombie put his mark on the greatest scary movie of all time and did a decent job. I am looking forward to alternate ending and deleted scenes. Yes it could have been better, but as far as re-makes go it was really good",Halloween
984,blueskelton,Rob Zombie Resurrects Michael Myers,7,5 September 2007,"Rob Zombie has delivered Michael Myers from the depths of mediocre film-making. Michael hasn't looked this good since John Carpenter set him loose in theaters back in 1978. But despite its acclaim at the box office Rob Zombie's remake has received criticism from Halloween ""purists."" ""Purist"" Complaints 1. Rob Zombie shouldn't remake horror films ""If Rob Zombie is such a big horror movie buff, you'd think he'd want to avoid helming a remake right now."" Jeff Pizek of The Daily Herald Why? Jeff Pizek never really explains this point. He seems to think that just because other people have made crappy remakes of horror films that Rob Zombie shouldn't even try. This is absurd. Just because other people suck, don't take it out on Rob Zombie. Let him do what inspires him.For me Rob Zombie infused life to a series that was dead. The previous two Halloween films were absolutely worthless. I wish I could get those four hours of my life back.me. This film might not be perfect, but it is still the best Halloween film since the original.I can understand -daily heralds- frustration with remakes. I can't say I am true thrilled about the upcoming remake of the A-Team. Hollywood already took a giant loogie on my childhood when they made a crappy TV remake of Battlestar Galactica. It's only a matter of time before they remake Buck Rodgers Letting frustration ruin a perfectly good film is just silly. Just because other remakes were bad does not mean that Halloween is bad by default. Well I can proudly tell you that it is not guilty by association. Rob Zombie's Halloween kicked ass.Michael Myers was never a child The other main complaint centers around Zombie's depiction of Michael Myers troubled childhood. They would prefer him to remain a born-bad supernatural creature that killed for unknown reasons.I suppose that this is a valid complaint, but I thought that Rob Zombie's interpretation added a level of believability to the film. Kids do fall through the cracks and become sociopathic killers, however, I have never seen an anti-Christ. I hope I never meet either one truthfully.I admit that I struggled with the childhood portion of the film. It was disturbing on a level that was exemplified by Zombies first two films House of a Thousand Corpses and Devil's Rejects. It was very graphic and very real.I prefer my violence to be cartoony like Tarantino's Kill Bill, Antoine Fuqua's The Replacement Killers or John Carpenter's other classic film, ""Escape from New York."" Dealing with graphic violence like that which is depicted in Michael's Childhood or Zombies previous two films is difficult for me.Michael's childhood might have bored Jeff Pizek, but I thought it added a lot of depth to Michael's character. It was the part of the movie that was uniquely Rob Zombie's. The rest of film has the same feel as the original. Michael Myers returns in his patented Will Shatner mask, killing all who inadvertently cross his path. Having seen the original film gave me the comfort of knowing where the new film was leading.Speaking of Depth of Character Mexican Goon #1 My friends and I refer to him as Mexican Goon #1. That's how he was listed in credits for the majority of his early film career. Now Danny Trejo is a cinematic legend. He has been an integral part of so many films. He is an icon of the action-film industry. He's acted in action greats like Heat, Desperado, The Replacement Killers and countless other films. He is an asset to any to any film. I hope that someday I can get him for one of my films.Halloween showed us what Danny Trejo is really capable of. Out of all of the actors in this film, Danny Trejo was the most convincing. He was the only one who seemed ""real."" He is really beginning to show his range and that he is capable of breaking out of the gangster/goon typecast. He delivered his lines flawlessly. The woodenness was completely gone. In my opinion, he was the best actor in this film and it was good to see him show the range he has an actor.Watch this Movie If you can't let go of Michael Myers as the personification of evil then this might not be the movie for you. But if you are looking for a good horror film and can judge the film by its own merits, then I think that you will enjoy it. I am a fan of both films. I just hope that Zombie doesn't try to remake that Pumpkin-head Halloween.",Halloween
985,chigglesman,Most Disturbing Hour and A Half I Have Ever Seen,7,29 September 2007,"Rob Zombie, the man who brought us House of 1000 Corpses and the sequel, The Devils Rejects. One thing the two films do have in common, they are extremely disturbing, containing black humor and a fun two hours. The one thing that Halloween does is sets up the first 45 minutes for the back story of Micheal. Micheal as a kid. This is the films highlight section. It gives us some extremely graphic on screen kills and we finally find out the truth behind the psychopath.The next hour though, reminds me of every other horror movie I have ever seen. It has your regular teenage girls which love to take off their tops and get high and drunk at anytime they wish to. Of course Micheal follows them until he can finally mutilate them in the most sickest way possible. Of course, every girl but one takes off their tops. The movie is really gory and disgusting. It doesn't focus on blood spray and splatter, but more on the way of death. Which is one of the highlights of the movie. The music was revamped up from the original, of course remastered from Rob Zombie. It sounds great and creepy.The bottom line is that this is an OK remake. It wasn't as good as I proposed it to be, but it filled a lot of my expectations.",Halloween
986,patriotsk,Well Worth Seeing,7,1 September 2007,"If you go into this movie comparing it to the original, then you may be disappointed. The original is one of the (in my mind THE) best horror movie ever, so even though it is a ""remake"", you should not compare it to the original.That being said it was a very good movie. The beginning of the movie shows his life as a kid, his family life, and how he was in school. Some people seem to think that Zombie is trying to make him sympathetic because his family life was bad, but I disagree. I think he was just showing how a psychopath starts, with the harming of animals, and it develops into his killing of his family. The middle was his life in the asylum, how he was talkative at first but over time he got less and less talkative. It shows him getting crazier and crazier, making different masks, etc...I personally enjoyed the back-story. Zombie didn't want to make a direct remake of the original, so he added a bit of a prequel, and I think it works.Once Myers escapes from the asylum (which was a good scene) he goes back to Haddonfield to look for his sister. Zombie did a good job of keeping a lot of the things fans love from the original, while not completely copying them. I won't mention them all, but fans will recognize certain parts. Myers was acted well, complete with the slow head turns etc...The action was good, there were plenty of parts that made people jump, and it had more ""scary"" parts than almost any horror movie I've seen in a while. There was not too much blood or nudity, Zombie didn't go overboard, which was good.If you go into this movie not expecting it to be better than the original, you should love it. Fans will like the little things Zombie did to keep it true to form, and casual fans should enjoy the fact that it keeps you in suspense. Much of the original soundtrack was used, from the well known theme musics to ""Mr. Sandman"" when the town is first shown. The songs added like ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" worked well to complete the soundtrack. I gave this movie a 9/10 myself, though it could easily be 10/10. Even as a remake, this is one of the best horror movies I think I have seen. Zombie is creative, and original (even in a remake) and tries to be more creepy and scary than most movies. I like it myself, and would say it is well worth the price of admission.",Halloween
987,karissab_55,Perfect 'remake',10,2 September 2007,"I've read several comments bashing this film for destroying the mystery that is Michael Myers. For one thing, that is a stupid argument because none of us want an exact replica of the original. I didn't want to see the same characters die all over again and it's sad that people don't realize that exploring Myers' past did not hinder the film at all. His childhood is both detailed but vague at the same time because we can't completely understand all the factors that lead to Michael's state. Whoever said that we 'sympathize' with Michael must have been watching a different movie, because I didn't sympathize at all, it was more of a fascination because of the emphasis on Loomis' view and his own opinion of Michael. No one can sympathize with a senseless psychopath. Even if I had sympathized with Michael, it wouldn't take away the suspense or 'jumping' moments in the movie. What I enjoyed was, how in many Halloween movies, the fixation is on Laurie Strode and Michael's imminent return. In this film we understand his initial return and the film concentrates more on their relationship.",Halloween

We meet his mom's boyfriend who is in a wheelchair he is really really mean to Michael then we meet his mom his mom is really the only person in the house that really cares for him.

At no point during this movie is there anything even approaching a scary moment. There is no character development whatsoever. As a result, you don't care about any of the characters and you don't care when they get killed. The acting is beyond bad. My fellow patrons were also bored and at time there was outright laughter at what was supposed to be the scariest moments of the film. I'm amazed at some of the reviews I have read on this site about what a great movie this is.

990,rupp30,A great take on Halloween,8,2 September 2007,"There has been so many different opinions on this film because of how many people had loved the original. To be honest I despised the thought of a remake because of how many had sucked in this torture porn/remake/pg13 horror era. The only exception was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Then I heard it was Rob Zombie doing this project and it spiked an interest. As time progressed this movie became more and more interesting to me because of how Zombie had this movie thought out; A Prequel/Re-imagining, a very interesting idea.And was it ever. Zombie's approach was very unique and interesting, especially the Asylum sequence up until the escape. The escape was gory and all but it was pointless to me. Other than that one scene though this film delivered a lot or at least to me it did. It wasn't the classic the original was but this was still one of the best horror films that i have scene in the last decade._DR_",Halloween
991,pimppantherpink,"Not the Original, Not Bad",9,4 November 2007,"While I didn't expect it to be the same, they still could have connected it a bit better to soothe the nay sayers. Rob Zombie as well as the actors did a pretty good job, especially in the killing scenes.I especially liked young Myers, with his piercing stare and blank, uncaring eyes.To the down-voters, take another look, like all remakes, they are not, and can not be the original, so it's not a fair comparison. Watch it as if you're not looking to call out every discretion and oddly dissimilar detail.No remake is looked upon with initially favoring eyes, but for a remake they did a killer job(pun not intended).",Halloween
992,jacquensteve,Not worth seeing...,1,31 August 2007,"This has to be the worst remake of a film that has ever been made....though it was exactly what I expected out of Rob Zombie. He took a classic and flushed it down the toilet. Not only can't he sing, again he has proved his film making skills are even worse. The beginning of the movie drags out to no point and follows nothing of John Carpenters original cult classic. There is not one part that will put you on the edge of your seat chewing your finger nails. Again his (Rob Zombie) wife shows she lacks the talent to act as he can direct. If you are a huge fan of the original Halloween movie, DO NOT see this movie. Not only will it disappoint, but will infuriate you that anyone could kill such a classic.",Halloween
993,xxxchio,"Great Movie,",10,9 December 2007,"I don't see why people keep complaining about Rob Zombie. Most celebrities who move on over to different things (ie: Hillary Duff from actress to singer, Jennifer Lopez from singer to actress) are completely horrid! But Rob Zombie is not. He made great music and is now making great movies. Get over it.This movie was definitely not the worst remake ever. Go watch The Grudge and all those other Japanese remakes. Broaden your horizons. Your mind will change.Rob Zombie is trying new things that others haven't. He makes things far more dark and far more disturbing. People either don't like it because they're not used to it or they don't like it because they don't understand it.This movie was not been than the original (most remakes aren't), but it certainly was worth it! I can't wait for it to be out on DVD.",Halloween
994,derrek_anderson,Absolutely Horrible,1,30 August 2007,"I saw the movie but I wasn't disappointed. I had very low expectations going into the movie.The movie makes it seem like Michael Myers is just a crazed killer and that there was nothing special about him. There was no mention of the Druids that protected him or Thorn of Evil that was placed in him when he was just a child. I recall seeing the first ones where Loomis warns everyone that he could not be killed with guns or regular weapons. The dialog was horrible and this movie just takes away from the Myers story.I just wish that someone would finish the original story where he is now in search of his son. Michael Myers was never just a crazed serial killer. Blood and gore alone doesn't make a good movie. The storyline makes a good movie. The Halloween series (the original 6) had a great storyline. The 3rd was completely different but it kinda went with the others. The 3rd dealt exclusively with the Driud Society.I believe for that loved the original Michael Myers Saga will be very disappointed in this. Some will even leave the theater.This is truly a Rob Zombie flick and I know that he has an audience for his type of movies. In my opinion the Halloween series doesn't fall into his style of movies. For those that love his movies, they will love this one. I'm much too big of a fan of the Halloween Saga to even say this film was OK.Rob Zombie, continue to do what you do but please try not to turn a supernatural legend into just a psycho killer.",Halloween

The stylized violence and cinematography were excellent.That being said, if i wanted to see a killer who had blood lust and was a victim of an unnurturing white trash environment, I would've watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movie insulted my intelligence. I don't need a whole hour to figure our Michael Myers had a rough childhood, a bit of a mental problem, and some sort of deep seeded evil. Okay, I admit it was cool to see his killer rampages in a more elaborate fashion, but it seems to me it took half the movie to tell the audience that Michael Myers was just the weird kid who liked to torture animals and snapped one day.The movie wasn't an opus to the John Carpenter classic I love, it was a slap in the face.",Halloween
996,axelacosta,Excellent Re-visit to the original!,7,28 December 2007,"Rob Zombie does an excellent job remaking a great movie that was made into trash with all the succeeding sequels. What makes this movie so good is that it makes Michael more realistic. In my opinion, people are more scared of movies were the character is believable and realistic. (Not some cheesy undying being) This version of Michael can be any kid in your town that grows up in a broken home or is tormented in school....hence the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings and people like Jeffrey Dahmer.The reason the remake of Batman was good was because they kept it dark, realistic and not campy or cartoonish like Burton and the following directors did. Hopefully the new Incredible Hulk and all other remakes follow suit.Everyone likes different horror movies for different reasons. If you are a fan of the cheesy 70s and 80s movies you may not like this one because of the realism of the character's development into the psychopath that he is today. I say give it a chance...you may like it. I sure did.",Halloween
997,artagoth,well it was a bloody mess,10,3 September 2007,I m not going to comment this one as a Halloween fan neither as a rob zombie fan so lets face it this movie deliver and is way too good than i expected. the acting was good with a solid script well written excellent dialogs we still have that funny aspect from the devil rejects some good action a reasonable amount of gory staff and more i didn't like the cutting between the scenes though it might be done by purpose i way to look back to the seventies horror genre maybe. well people can complain about the bloody mess about the amount of the f word and nudity but who cares the truth is that this movie is more than enjoyable it's a continuity of a real new vision of directing so thanks mister rob zombie and respect.

998,mrcoolmanager,The Best Halloween I Have Ever Seen!,10,1 September 2007,"People who loved John Carpenter's original are going to love this. Rob Zombie fills in masterfully the plot holes that John just didn't have the time or the money to tell in his movie. It has a bigger body count and makes a hell of a lot more sense than the original. In this remake, the audience sees what Michael went through as a child to make him this unstoppable force. This is by far the best Rob Zombie and the best Halloween movie to date. I love how in this Halloween the movie follows Michael than Laurie because it makes it a lot darker and a lot scarier. I also love how Michael doesn't walk all over the place he runs and speed walks after his victims so most of them don't get away. If you get time away from work and have nothing else to do. I recommend that you go and see the movie for yourself because who knows you might just like it.",Halloween
999,flyerpimp,Halloween Should Have Been Cancelled in 07,2,14 October 2007,"This reimagining of yet another classic of the genre is similar enough to the original to have constantly reminded me of how great that one was after all. Occasionally, this reviewer sees a film that makes me embarrassed to be a part of the same species as those responsible for making it. This is one such film.For example, in the original there is a scene where we see the Laurie Strode character in class orally acing an question from the teacher, showing us she's one smart cookie. But in this version there is no time for such a scene, so the filmmakers just decide to put a pair of big, black framed glasses on our heroine because people who wear eyeglasses are brainy as you know. Even the viewers who would buy that shortcut in characterization would still find little to enjoy in this steaming heap of celluloid.Just about every girl in this movie gets topless. Of course, this happens just before she gets sliced up. The camera lingers just long enough on this carnage to suggest that maybe be the director has been repressed in some way. Seeing how the director in question is Rob Zombie it is hard to believe that he has any juvenile tendencies left to relinquish. After all, he is the one who brought us the deliriously campy House Of 1000 Corpses and its much grittier and superior sequel The Devil's Rejects. Both films featuring sequences of bloody on screen violence by the truckload.Like his previous two films, this one displays some bad editing. Kind of like watching an someone learning the Avid editing software on the big screen.Though, there are a few exceptions to the filmic crimes committed here. One of them being the cinematography. High contrast lighting, yet often colourful. The hand-held work creates a certain energy that even the action being captured lacks. This makes Halloween comparable to a beautifully photographed pile of manure.Also, Zombie makes an effort to explain the motivations behind the Michael Myers character by spending a considerable amount of time showing us his childhood. Yet they are all sickeningly cliché: he comes from a broke home; he was bullied at school; he tortured animals. So we are not left to wonder why he became a mass murderer. But wouldn't it be more engrossing if the opposite was applied? Like Ted Bundy claimed he had a very normal, Christian upbringing, which makes what he had done all the more fascinating.It has been (and will continue to be) debated whether movies can actually influence people to commit crimes. Well, I for one felt like doing violence to myself by stabbing my own eyes out during the course of Halloween.Tearing apart this movie has been rather cathartic for me. Maybe like the catharsis that Zombie felt shooting Halloween's graphic death scenes. One just hopes that he has now got it out of his system, so he can spare us any more atrocities like this one.",Halloween
1000,dfletc2-1,Trick or treat? Definitely not the latter..,3,1 September 2007,"Watching Rob Zombie's take on John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween"" is like opening up one of those individualized goody-bags with the ghosts on them that inevitably find their way into every child's trick-or-treat bag on Halloween. Appealing on the outside (what could possibly be bad about an entire bag of treats WITHIN a bag of treats?), the payoff is never as good as one would hope.In trick-or-treating terminology, Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" is about as exciting as opening one of these mystery bags to find a granola bar and six pennies. Plus it costs 10 bucks to peek inside.The remake is a clear upgrade over the original in terms of film quality and special effects, but this is overshadowed quite noticeably by the lack of truly frightening moments, and the cinematography is primarily at fault. Whereas Carpenter's film, despite grainy picture quality and cheap effects, had (and still has to this day) viewers on the edges of their seats, Zombie's elicited more laughs than screams from the movie audience. It is painfully predictable and misses out on the key component that made Carpenter's ""Halloween"" a timeless classic - HORROR.When I say that the cinematography is to blame for this lack of thrills, it falls squarely on the fact that Zombie lets the camera catch glimpses of killer Michael Myers in nearly every shot - especially towards the ""climactic"" end of the film - which makes his attacks no surprise to viewers.The numerous jump-out-of-your-seat moments that defined the original ""Halloween"" have been replaced by Zombie's trademark: foul-mouthed rednecks and loads of unnecessary nudity.It's a true shame to see such a cinematic masterpiece butchered by an up-and-coming director who, quite honestly, seemed like the perfect candidate to improve on Carpenter's film and take it to a new level.Bottom line: don't get tricked into wasting money on this mess, it's surely no treat.",Halloween
1001,Duffman40,"Terrible. No offense, Rob.",3,30 August 2007,"First off, maybe I shouldn't even be reviewing. I stopped with about 1 half-hour left to go in the movie because it was getting late, and still haven't gone back to watch the rest. It doesn't seem worth it. And from what I hear about the ending I'm probably better off.This is a ""Halloween"" for blind-followers of Rob Zombie who think The Devil's Rejects is the greatest single thing ever. Everyone else . . STAY AWAY.This movie turns one of the most feared characters in all of cinema into a little crybaby we're asked to feel bad for. He was BULLIED. His family is stereotypically white-trash. bla bla bla . .Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie or even worst horror remake I've seen . . but it stinks. There isn't really any tension. There is ""shock"" put places just to be ""shocking"" and to hell with the story. Characters that are introduced for no reason whatsoever. Michael acts like a big goof in his adult years. I could go on, but the single biggest problem with this movie, as lots of other reviewers have said, is FOCUS.It feels like he abandoned his Devil's Reject-ish beginning in favor of a clear-cut remake. It doesn't blend well. But unlike other reviews who seem to have WANTED Rob to stick with his Devil's Reject-ish beginning, I did not. Maybe I should be grateful he abandoned that terrible idea . . but the ""remake"" part of it is boring, badly acted, badly written, and badly directed unless Rob decided to try something knew and shoot this thing on a tilt-a-whirl. So, I did not really like any of this.Well, scratch that. The asylum scenes were pretty cool. Other than that . . nothing unless you count a handful of scenes that made me feel nostalgic for the original. Bravo! I can replicate that feeling by turning off the lights and playing the theme song.Stick to exploitation movie homages, Rob. Halloween is not for you.Obviously, thumbs way down. Here's hoping his next movie is NOT Rob Zombie's Halloween 2, and something he's good at.",Halloween
1002,brrivas07,"Not a disgrace, an improvement!",10,31 August 2007,"I thought the movie was wonderful, Rob Zombie's best yet. In the original there was a lot of confusion on how Michael Myers had a sister and where was she and blah blah blah blah. In every horror movie it always begins with killing and goes on and it never shows how the person grows into the person they are and so on and so forth. Rob Zombie took all of this and actually showed us and explained and made it a story. I can't really ever remember knowing at the end of the original that Lori was his sister...maybe I was asleep, who knows! In the original it went straight to murder within the first 5 minutes...yeah that's pretty typical. I liked this because it showed you that he actually was at some point a real little boy with a completely f-ed up life and he was a very dark and demented person and it grew and grew everyday. I found myself throughout the movie sympathizing, laughing and being scared. How anyone can say it was a disgrace must be out of their mind...oh wait, they are Canadian! Anyway, the point is, Rob Zombie took a very old story and made it into soooo much more. He did so much to it, more than anyone else could have done and he did it very well. No, I wasn't on the edge of my seat but show me a good scary movie now a days that will do that, but it was well worth every penny and well worth the time. I would go back and watch it tomorrow and I will definitely buy it the day it comes out!",Halloween
1003,willwright91,Not a remake. A completely different movie.,9,1 September 2007,"I went into the the theater with an open mind. I knew it was going to be different, but I had no idea.My main problem with the first act of this film was that it was simply too long. It should have cut young Michael down to about 10 minutes. But, I do understand what Rob Zombie was trying to do. You really see this kid as any other kid. It makes you wonder about your own children. As you watch the 1st act you literally see him becoming a monster. But, I still think that it was just too damn long.The second act was the sanitarium. This part I think Rob Zombie got right. It shows how simply evil he has became. You no longer see him as a person. You see him as evil. And its really scary how that changes.The third act was by far the best. As I watched these three teenage girls I found myself caring about them. I didn't want anything bad to happen to them. Rob Zombie knows how to write REAL characters, because these girl act just like the girls I went to school with.The truly terrifying last twenty minutes was just that. Truly terrifying. And that Scout Taylor Compton can act, and scream, and cry, just like anyone else really would in that type of situation. Michael is unstoppable. He is scary, he is evil. This last part was more terrifying than the original. I didn't say the movie was better than the original but it is, by far, scarier.The ending of this film was phenomenal. ONE of the best endings to any horror movie I've ever seen. Rob Zombie tried his best to make sure that there would be no sequel, and I'm right there with him.So in the end. Go see this movie. Leave the kids at home though, because it is gory and sexual as hell. And do me a favor, go with an open mind. Don't sit there comparing this movie to the original, forget the original. Because this really is a different movie.",Halloween

This new take on a horror classic shows the dysfunctional development that led to Michael Meyers becoming a psychopath mass murderer not to be confused with a serial killer, the background information was nice, except it lasted about half the movie and jumps 15 years into the future, I think personally I would have preferred a more gradual time line. This film is more of an affirmation that this new style of ""Horror""/ ""Thriller"" which has tastelessly become more or less ""Gore""/""Porn"" is on its way out and this should be one of the final nails in the coffin. Number one rule about making a movie like this, if you are going to rewrite a classic in a genre go ahead and make it a spoof.",Halloween

He is a kid for most of the movie which is actually the better half of the movie in my opinion. Anyways its not as good as the original but at least you get some sense of why he is killing people. I thought I would really like it cause i love the devil rejects movies. Anyways don't waste your money on this one wait to rent it at Halloweens cause it will come to video fast. It will probably make a lot of money this first weekend but after that i think it will fade fast. So people don't go see this movie cause it isn't worth your time or money.,Halloween

1007,stepp-matthew,A Great Addition to Horror,9,31 August 2007,"An open mind is needed to truly get this great addition to horror. The open mind is needed so to not expect this to be the 1978 version - where anxiety and fear were driven by the unknown and mystery of Michael Myers. Lets face it - we know roughly what is going to happen, who the killer is, and the basic gist of the storyline. Rob Zombie went out to expand on what actually made Michael the person (or psycho) he became. All the while Zombie did not want to make this a scene by scene remake.I believe he did all of this in a beautiful manner. In the age of the gore filled slasher movies that pass themselves as ""horror"", this fills those viewers needs for a higher body count as well as more blood. More importantly to me was horror aspect, because as this was not a carbon copy remake, the opportunity for a true horror movie was there. Zombie flirted down a median between the two viewer needs, creating a movie much better than the previous sequels.Because of the new interest on Michaels upbringing, the focus of the movie shifted from the original (Laurie) to Loomis, his psychologist. Many critics have harped on this, but again, this movie is a stand alone and not meant to be compared to the original.In the end, compared to current ""horror"" submissions, this was excellent. The focus on excess gore and blood has taken away from the mystique of jumping in your seat or feeling that anxiety of what could be waiting behind that door. The death scenes were graphic and realistic, while moving the story along. By the credits a true chill (again if you take it as a stand alone movie) will run down your back with the realization that a child was driven to become emotionally blank and the consequences of this just unfolded.",Halloween

I ordered the tickets the previous day to be on the safe side in case the show was packed. And I've never been in a movie theater with more people they really loved it. Im not giving anything away but ill review the movie by parts. The begninnig is probably one of the best parts. Rob definitely has a good way of showing how the mask came into the picture and so on. Malcom Mcdowel portrays loomis to a tee. The movie does have some weak points. But it definitely speeds up when michael breaks out of the sanitarium. The scenes with laurie and michael are a classic and definitely beat carpenters version. Although Scouts scream is amazing. Curtis might have played the role better. It was very cool to see the cast of previous zombie movies in this. I jumped out of my seat. And the ending is amazing. Go and see this movie ! Now i wanna see a Halloween 9 !!!,Halloween

Rob zombies previous movies make no sense and have no point, only good cinematography, but this film is completely different. this remake of the original is very unique due to the fact it focuses on the story that was not told in the original. but it does correspond very well with the original (though some things are done a little different). and another thing there is NO rape whatsoever in this film, there are several sex scenes but no rape scenes. the death scenes in this remake are also much more brutal than the original, but then again it wouldn't be interesting if it was a carbon copy of the original. there are some scenes that do not have any relevance to the plot, but other than that this film is great. last but not least the comment left by cloe or whatever is very asinine, considering he has not even seen the movie. that just doesn't make sense to me. why would you review a movie that you have not even seen. i cannot put into words how much that frustrates me, yes this movie is not viewer friendly and will not win awards but it is still good.",Halloween

Watching 10 year old Michael, wearing a clown costume and a Shatner mask that's way too big for his head, kill people isn't menacing, it's cheesy and so absurd that it's a bit funny. Perhaps the worst part of the film is the soundtrack (for example, they play ""Love Hurts"" after Michael's slaughtered his family) which is surprising coming from such a supposed musical mastermind. But that, in effect, is the problem with this film. Zombie thinks he's much more clever than he really is, and in an effort to be cutting edge he removed all of the elements that make Halloween such an interesting franchise and replaced them with clichés.",Halloween
1013,eschumacher6182,More than pleased!!,10,31 August 2007,"I am a horror film purist and have therefore been heartbroken by almost every horror film to come out in the past decade or so. However, I have always been intrigued by Rob Zombie's films, whether I like them or not. Like so few directors today, his films are completely his vision. He is in control of the direction, production, music, script..... he has a hand in everything. Halloween (the original) is in a different category from all other ""slasher"" films and sequels to follow. It invented a character that would inspire many more villains, but none would come close to matching the threat of Michael Myers. Since Im a purist, I usually feel that classics should be left alone. Rob Zombie does NOT do a remake. He did NOT make a sequel. Therefore, he does NOT follow any of the rules of what my generation considers a true horror film. His film is closer to that of Silence of the Lambs. He does more than make Michael Myers an ""urban legend"". He gives him background so you understand the character. He does not have you ""rooting for the bad guy"" but rather understanding him, thus making him more terrifying. Whenever you ground a villain or a horror story in reality, it makes it that much more frightening. This movie is not the same ""bad guy stalking babysitters"" movie we grew up loving. What Zombie did was take the same story to a who new level. This movie seems like it should be the original and Carpenter's excellent hit feels like the remake. Bravo Rob Zombie! Thanks for restoring my faith in the horror genre. I appreciate your dedication to the truth of the character and not pandering to make it a ""teen slasher film""! Well Done!!!",Halloween
1014,jordan715,One thumb up for Halloween,6,31 August 2007,"Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween struggles to surpass the original 1978 version but does give the viewer a different side of the classic story. In this version, Michael Meyers is portrayed as a troubled child in a broken down home therefore providing him with reasonable motives (in his mind) for killing. In the original movie, the viewer does not get in depth look into Michael's home and school life like they do in the 2007 version. The scene did drag on a little too much but then again, I paid to see a remake of the older version so different scenes are key. I definitely favor the older version but mostly because it's familiar to me. Although some parts of this movie were cliché, Rob Zombie does a good job displaying a psychopath's true nature.

1015,ladies_man_77,What your failing to realize,10,31 August 2007,"What so many of the viewers of this film fail to realize this is a take on the Halloween film. Rob Zombie said it himself that to remake this movie would be insane and wrong all he tried to do was tell a part of it, a part that the original writer's couldn't think of.It is hard now-a-days for directors to make a film because people will find the slightest problems with the film and blamed it all over the internet. This movie like all the others that get told that the director or the writers missed the point entirely, we as a public should be so lucky that people are willing to make these films for our amusement and if you don't believe that the film will be good don't see it. To come on here and to say that he missed the point entirely you people forget to look into the facts.I loved this film and all the Halloween films and the other slasher films Rob Zombie did justice to this film by showing that there could of been a side of Micheal that no one knew or cared to know. To show that his up bringing was Horrible at best that the only two people that cared for him, was his mother and baby sister ""Bo"". the man Rodney was not his father in this film, the teen aged daughter even said so saying ""that drunken bastard isn't my father, my father is in heaven."" One last thing to show Micheal as a human before hand shows that things could of changed if the nature of which he was raised was different. I believe Rob Zombie did an outstanding job bringing back a Classic Serial Killer to the screen I would say to you all to go see this movie but just keep and open mind about it.",Halloween

For you, let me tell you 2 facts...1) I am an avid horror fan who once sat through an ENTIRE movie called ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"", yet I turned off ""House of 1000 Corpses"" about 25 minutes in due to stupid-overload....and 2) The first red flag I had about Rob Zombie was that fact that he was in a band called ""White Zombie"" yet he chose the stage name ""Rob Zombie""...this implies what?

It was just a movie...god I love my damn i-Phone!"", but ""Halloween"" to me is one of the greatest horror movies EVER...I've been watching it since I was in 4th grade and it still scares me into the fetal position every time. What I'm trying to say is I need to VENT. SO. With that....here are my issues: All that damn back story crap: This went on WAY too long. In the original M-Myers kills his sister within the first 5 minute of the film...In this I had finished my whole LARGE popcorn (with extra butter) BEFORE the sister mutilation actually happened. I was not buying young Michael Myers AT ALL...and it was only partially due to the fact that the kid playing him looked like a cross between Dakota Fanning at Rocky Dennis from the movie ""Mask"". There was absolutely nothing in this kids eyes or demeanor that told me he was having any inner mania...and then BOOM in an instant...he'd just kill. In one sequence he'd playing with some candy corn, and looks somewhat happy. You could almost imagine him Whistling the theme song from The Peanuts.........then duck tapes his step dad to the chair and slashes his throat. (?????) THEN we have to watch him hang out in the mental hospital for 20 MORE minutes....and see how a grows to be 7 FOOT 12!! Where in horror lore does it state that your killer must grow super long hair that always hangs in front of his face and wear tattered rags that look like costume leftovers from the matrix? In the original for the split second you see Michael Myers face...and when you do he looks more like Seth Cohen then leather face. WAY more terrifying...Is this a remake, or re-imagining? Make up your mind: This movie took 2 directions with the source material: 1) TOTALLY change it 100% or 2) Copy scenes identically...only not as good. It's almost as if R-Zomb used up all his creativity writing what was basically a whole other movie on all the back story that by the time the rest of the movie came he was just like ""ahhh...I can't think of anything else...lets just re-shoot some of the scenes from the original. Wait..my i-Phone is ringing"" Examples: In this...Michael Myers as a youth is apparently a KISS fan who tortures and mutilates animals. Totally different then the original right? YET...Scenes like the Michael Myers showing up wearing a sheet like a ghost is totally lifted straight up...and rather sloppily I might add. One minute the boyfriend is looking though the cooler in the van for beers...ONE CUT later...he's running up the stares with a ghost sheet on him? WHY? Again...so much time spent on the back story that all everything else suffered. Characters show up...we know nothing about them...and SPLAT they are dead. If I wanted that i'd go rent ""House of Wax"" with Paris Hilton. At least we get to see Paris get a freaking pole shoved through her head.THE POINT BEING: If you're gonna re-imagine the movie...don't half ass...do it all the way! Go for it! Give him a different mask! Use different music...change character names...why not? When you lift material flagrantly like that you leave it open to douche bags like me to rip you a new one for it.Now..I don't want to should like your classic older person who just says things like ""You young kids these days! You don't appreciate the classics...all you do is jack around with your i-Phones! In my day we had movies like PLATOON! GET OFF MY LAWN!"" but at the same time I must say this: The original ""Halloween"" put fear directly into your balls by creating tension, and dread with what you Don't know, and Don't see. The fact that we don't know why Michael Myers becomes a killer is part of what makes him so eerie...because it could be in any of us. It is a play on the purity of evil.The new movie DOES scare...It just does it a little more cheaply. It's in your face...and for that..I gotta admit I didn't hate it. At the same time...I just can't bring myself to say I liked it. Do yourselves a favor kids...put down that damn i-Phone, get to blockbuster and rent the original. You won't sleep soundly for days.",Halloween
1017,kajasinis1,"""f%&#ing amazing""",10,1 September 2007,"...to quote Kevin Smith regarding his feelings on Star Wars 3...the only challenge with this remake is that it's a remake of a classic stamp in movie history. that aside, rob zombie accomplished a necessary goal with this film...Michael myers is scary as s&%t this time around. we are an extremely tough generation to scare anymore, if we want to be scared, we can just turn on the news, but horror movies have lost their ability to have us terrified. if little kids want to dress up as you and audiences cheer for you, they're not afraid of you anymore. ""freddy vs Jason"" was cool but it wasn't scary, we were cheering for 2 icons on the same screen. however, we need to be scared in a different way in 2007. the original ""saw"" was pretty scary because it was very real. sure, this time around, certain details in the original ""halloween"" changed, but that doesn't take away from the fact that, this quiet 10 year old child from any-town, USA who had an abusive-drunk-father figure, a stripper for a mother (i have nothing against stripping, i totally support that profession), got bullied at school...that and probably a huge chemical imbalance...finally snapped and killed everyone in his path. this is a story about a psychopath, forget what you know about Michael myers. he's not cursed by that cult with the symbol on their wrists in that waste of 2 hours ""the curse of Michael myers""...yes the one with Paul Rudd. this is a straight up scary...a**...movie. excellent job rob zombie. the audience had no clue what they were in for, people were covering their eyes left and right, i must've heard 5 people around me say, ""i didn't think it would be like this...oh my god i can't watch!"" people were jumping out of their seats, you could hear gasps of air left and right. i also heard a few parents, who brought little kids with them to see this detailed display of a massacre, ""we shouldn't have brought the kids""...yea they were right, leave the kids at home for this one. forget all the reviews you've read that say it sucks, this movie will scare the sh*t out of you. definitely worth seeing. rob zombie is far from trying to out do john carpenter with this film, john carpenter made an incredible film. so give up on ""a remake is supposed to out do the original"" that's crap, how can you say you'd do better than what john carpenter did? however, rob zombie puts that rob zombie spin on it, and if you've seen ""house of 1000 corpses"" and/or ""the devil's rejects,"" you know what that spin is about. he makes the story and the events in the movie very plausible, and what he does is brilliant. Michael myers' knife, and all his other choices of weaponry, (a thick ass branch, a Louisville slugger, his hands) see a ton of traffic, he racks up big points on the body count. from the moment you see him make his first slaughter, you freeze in your seat. the 2 most frightening aspects of this film are Michael myers' style of killing...how he just rips through whatever stands in his way and just dominates his victims, and the fact that this is very real...especially when less than 5 months ago, our nation witnessed the most horrible killing spree in history in Virginia. Michael is a twisted kid, but to see what creates a psychopath, and to see on camera how brutal they are (rob zombie likes to show details...you could hear his victims choking on their own blood), just leaves you freaked out. respond in any which way you choose to my review, but this movie is flat out sick, and is not for the weak stomached.",Halloween
1018,savagesteelwarrior,Rob Zombies Halloween is Fu--ing Awesome!!!!!!!,10,1 September 2007,"To the critics who argue that this wasn't exactly like the original Halloween, I have this to ask. Was this an exact remake or was it Rob Zombie's interpretation of Halloween? I love the fact that ""Zombie"" focused on the young Myers which eventually led to psychopath he would eventually become. To be honest, I went into this movie with an open mind and didn't try to relate anything of the original to this movie and have to say I came away very pleased. Here are a few complaints I have about this Halloween. Michael gets shot repeatedly and it has little to no affect upon him, which is a reflection of the cheesy Halloween 4 and on movies. One question that was never answered in the film was, how did Michael Myers know that the girl who put the envelope in the mail slot of his house was his little sister? The last time Micheal seen his sister was when he was 10 and she was a few months to a year old. Zombie should have done better than that. I also did not like the fact that Zombie failed to include the trademark signature Michael Myers sit up and turn of the head. The ending was different and left no thought to the imagination that there will be another Halloween movie. Overall, the movie was GREAT!!!! Tyler Mane and the Mask is Fu--ing Awesome!!! I am going to see it again and suggests that if you are a fan of Micheal Myers and Halloween, this version will explain the who, why, and what about Michael Myers life and lead you into a new vision of the massacres that happened on Halloween night in Hadonfield Illinois.

1019,crules17,A Prequel and Remake all in one,8,1 September 2007,Most people are gonna go into this movie thinking its exactly a remake of the original.If you do get your money back because its not...Well the first half isn't thats for sure.Rob Zombies Halloween is an hour and 50 minutes-Long.Thats Longer then any other Halloween movie.For the first 50 Min's of the movie its simply not a remake but a prequel of what we didn't know or get to see from the original.The first 50 minutes start off wit him as a 10 year old boy and you really get to see how Micheal lived and how he was treated.After that it goes into him in the mental house and Dr.Loomis trying to treat him but Micheal doesn't say nothing because he after all stops talking.In between this long prequel of talking and getting to know some things we never knew before..Micheal does lots of killings.Grueseome ones.Thats one thing you can give this movie its killings were brutal.I was actually covering my face in some scenes because it was that hard to look at.Im a big fan of the Halloween Franchise and never have i try ed to cover my face...That says a lot here.I would have gave this movie a 10 out of 10 but just because i felt like rob zombie spent too much time on the prequel it didn't give him time to show Micheal really stalking His sister and give us that tension we were all use to from Micheal Myers.He kind of took the toll on the newer horror flicks and just instead of suspense went straight for the bloody killing.The remake part of the movie which is the last hour was my favorite.The actress Scout Taylor did an amazing job playing Laurie Strode.I seen her acting 3 yrs ago in the movie Sleepover and i never thought she could act until this movie.Her screams and the display of fear was great.The acting in this movie was well and another thing i loved was they played the original Micheal Myers music through out the entire movie. Something i was surprised to hear because Rob Zombie said in an interview that he wasn't sure if they were gonna use the music because he didn't know if it went well wit what they shot I think Scout Taylor did a much better job then Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie strode because i thought Jamie was horrible her screaming was annoying.My favorite scene had to be when he takes Laurie and he shows her a baby picture of when they were younger together and it gives us the sense he actually doesn't wanna kill her at that point because he just wants love.But of course out of fear she goes nuts and at that point I think he wants her dead.This remake leaves us at the end with more then John Carpenters Halloween left us with.It leaves us with a little more closure.I liked this movie it didn't let down my expectations at all.This is definitely by far the best work Rob Zombie has done and I'm sure he will make lots of money with this movie because lots of true fans will wanna go see it to see how a remake of the original turned out.I recommend this movie if u wanna hide in Ur seat and get a couple laugh's too because its humorous,Halloween
1020,nbrisky-1,Good Old Fashioned Blood and Gore,9,1 September 2007,"This newest version of the Halloween series was great with everything you would expect. Blood, gore, funny one liners, and horny teenagers getting what they deserve. It breaks down like this....If you like films that Rob Zombie has directed in the past (House of 1000 Corpses, Devils Rejects) then you will love this movie. OLD TIMERS, WE KNOW THE ORIGINAL WAS A CLASSIC, GET OVER IT. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EXCEPT THE FACT THAT OLD MOVIES WERE JUST THAT.....OLD! If you are a fan of the slasher ""grindhouse films"" of the 70's and 80's you will love it. Unlike many other horror movies that lack plot, or a reason for what is happening, in this movie Rob Zombie attempts to answer basic questions. THIS IS NOT A REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL, IT'S ZOMBIE'S VISION OF THE MYERS CHARACTER! The characters were all developed well, especially Michael's Mom played by Sherrie Moon Zombie. Zombie has definitely been maturing as a film maker in all 3 of his films and I hope that he continues his craft. On a side note, fans of Zombie's first two films will have fun finding all the actors that he has used in the past. Look closely through out the movie for some fun little cameos also.",Halloween
1021,roberthuf,great movie,10,2 September 2007,"rob zombie is a genius and he was the only person who could ever make a successful remake he gave depth to the characters and gave a great back story to the character Michael myers he explained what made him finally snap and become a killer great movie and for people that are bad mouthing it think about it you cant surpass a classic but rob zombie came damn near close and if you would of read any of the interviews that rob did you would of heard about him asking carpenter for permission and his exact words to rob where ""make it your own"" because even he knew that you couldn't make a direct remake and have it be successfulalso for people bad mouthing it who made the first Halloween john carpenter yes thats right who made the new Halloween rob zombie 2 different people everybody has different ideas of how to make something i will admit though robs first draft of the script was longer and wasn't as gory but still pretty goryish compared to the first Halloween but you cant compare a remake to an original kinda like willy wonka and the chocolate factory vs. Charlie and the chocolate factory you cant compare them to each other or your gonna think they suck so when you think about this movie think about it as its own so people who are bad mouthing it watch it again and re think your outlook at it",Halloween
1022,zeek-11,very intense,9,1 September 2007,"Well it is very hard to grade something like this. This is my first actual written review on a movie, but I have read others and I'm just awestruck at the negativity written about this flick. If you go INTO this movie EXPECTING it to be JC's film remade and somehow it is supposed to be better you ALREADY have disappointed yourself. You CANNOT remake a movie like Halloween that was in my eyes possibly the best slasher flick of all times. Rob Zombie openly admits Halloween is his favorite horror of all times (Fall of Slashers, Starz), so I do not believe he would do anything to try and make the movie look bad.First of all I just need to say that after reading some comments, I BEG you all to READ the credits as Rob Zombie DOES in fact give full credit to John Carpenter; He is writer and director of THIS movie that has nothing to do with what its based upon and who made the first one. He DOES give credit to John Carpenter so please do not say he doesn't.Now on with a size up of the film. Please everyone if you have not seen the movie do not read ANY further as this does contain minor spoilers. I HIGHLY recommend anyone go and watch this film. I am a manager at a theater and I am a VERY tough critic, but I believe that what Rob Zombie has done with this movie is just insanely brilliant in its own right. You watch it at first and your like WTF is this a bunch of s***. After about 15 minutes and you see Michael you start to... feel. I don't mean you have feelings for him but I mean you start to picture this young boy in your head and you realize that when he puts his mask on... something changes. He is completely lost in his will, mentality, and all differentiation of right and wrong. He SNAPS! Rob Zombie does a completely crazy thing by showing you what is possibly going on in this kids head and screwing up your senses as to possible reason murderous things are going on around America with teens.Another thing is that this movie focuses on the child's transition from a boy... to a PHYSIIIIIICOPATH! It gives you that same feeling like Saw did when you first watched it and you almost believe the people being killed deserve it ""almost"" is key word, as no one actually deserves such acts.Rob Zombie FINALLY brought back the factor of watching something and literally makes you JUMP UP scared like a you know what. When was the last time you watched something and honestly consistently was frightened out of your wits. I have to say for myself I can't really remember the last time. Most movies that come out as of recent just disgust you, but to make you jump. This has not been accomplished in a long time, and I believe Rob Zombie does a great job at this.Halloween doesn't introduce the items Myers uses, but in this movie Zombie brings IN the jumpsuit, kitchen knife, and mask. They are almost like characters with their importance to Myers himself excluding the jumpsuit.Zombie puts blood and gore in the movie and people question ""why"" well... ITS ZOMBIE! WHAT do you honestly expect to happen don't watch the movie if you expect it to be just like John Carpenter's classic, because if you think it has to be exactly the same your wrong. In my opinion Zombie made it with many things the same such as the Halloween music, breathing, and certain scenes exactly the same. The execution of the sounds are magnificent working your suspense up to a peak or at other times just giving you the understanding of just how insane Myers is.I could go on and on about the movie because I've already watched it three times, but I'll stop and say first that if you have watched it and judged it negatively, please I implore you to watch it again and THINK ""This is a Rob Zombie take on the movie, NOT a John Carpenter remake."" Don't go in ready to be disappointed, go in with an open mind to get blown away by something in my opinion is far more different and sinister.One last note is that at the theater the past two days its been out, parents bringing their ""little"" kids to go watch this movie. Please do NOT do this. This is not a movie for four or five years old, but that is just my opinion of course.I give nothing a 10, because nothing is perfect, so 9 is my score.",Halloween

1024,scottandjulie29,what a horrible movie,1,1 September 2007,"I went on opening night and it was a sell out. I expected great things from this movie since it was a remake of the best horror film ever made in my opinion. From the very beginning of the movie the F word was used to the extreme. The family discussion around the breakfast table was filled with threats of killing each other, incest and the extreme use of the f word. Throughout the movie this was a constant mainstay. the teens in this movie used this word in every breath. All of the cussing added nothing to the movie and in my opinion made the movie worse. There was a family in front of me with tweens and if the dad wasn't embarrassed then he has no shame. I hope this helps anyone reading this to decide not to see this movie. it isn't even worth a free rental. Too bad.",Halloween
1025,sc-haulk,Bravo to Rob Zombie!,8,2 September 2007,"This movie is a remake of the original but it is told from the character of Michael Myers rather than his sister Lorie. Rob took us on an in-depth ride into the mind of a psychopath. I actually felt myself feeling sorry for Michael Myers in this movie.A true fan will notice how there is no longer a specific time line. Like Octber 31st, 1978. It just said October 31st instead. Plus Michael Myers actually looks now like he is ten foot tall and bullet proof. With his size he looks powerful enough to man handle people like he does in the original which gives him more of a human element. But you can still see how evil can become someone give the right circumstances and drive them to do supernatural things like lifting a grown man with one arm.Now the story line will be much easier to mold for future releases. The movie has a modern feel to it with the dress and hair styles of the characters. Although it was kind of odd that no one had a cell phone in the entire movie. At least not that I noticed.I gave this movie an eight because it made me jump at least three or four times during some raging scenes. I haven't jumped at a Halloween movie since I was a kid when the original first two came out. My wife was dually impress. She had to call her cousin to tell on me. But I have no shame because Michael Myers has always scared the crap out of me. I was just used to the old story lines and the music leading up to a surprise attack. Thanks Rob I owe you one.",Halloween

Michael is the lead character in this film, it's his story... what made this remake scary and good is because you understand Michael, you feel Michael, and you know what he thinks and is going to do. the scenes that follows only made complete sense that in the original didn't (such as the ""judith myers tombstone and the dead body"") though short, i like the way rob zombie gave Danielle Harris a tribute, i understand that rob zombie knew, that after Jamie lee Curtis, Danielle Harris is one Halloween movie legend.i also liked the way that somehow Michael cannot hurt Laurie, you'll understand it as you watch the film. the touch of humanity is definitely what made this Michael myers the best and the scariest after the original.",Halloween
1027,rubixcube27,totally worth seeing,9,2 September 2007,"This movie i personally think was better then the original... some people have said that the Michael myers character was originally terrifying because he was just pure evil... um yea... and he is in this movie, just not at first.. you just see how he is made to be the monster of a child that he becomes... and that to me is much more terrifying. and sure like the other Rob Zombie movies there is a little extra gore.. but its a horror movie... don't go see a horror movie and then leave saying there was just to much violence... its not anywhere near the recent gorefests that have been released...i loved the sound in the movie, i think that played a great part... the original soundtrack hit perfect every time, and even the sound effects of glass or wood breaking just hit so loud that i couldn't help but jump... it was everything that i expect when i go see a horror movie... and i the only thing that i didn't like about it was that having seen the original Halloween i roughly knew what was going to happen... but even then, it was awesome and i hope to see more horror movies like it",Halloween

Not only does it have the feeling of the classic movies, but Rob Zombie did an amazing job at retelling an already amazing story.Halloween stays true to the original as far as the mask and theme song go and it shouldn't have been done any other way.Near the end of the original series of Halloween movies started to take a horrible turn with poor story lines, but Rob Zombie single handedly put everything about Halloween right back on track.Great movie, everyone should give it a chance.",Halloween

Without even watching the movie, or reading up on it, I knew it was going to start off with a ""white trash"" type of theme. I almost walked out. But I have to say, within 10 minutes, I was content with staying and watching.I really upset my friend because I had so many negative things to say about the movie, and like I said, she just wanted me to like something she did for once, and not argue. But I found myself thinking, why didn't this happen? or, that isn't logical, in real life, this would have happened! For instance, Meyer's is strong. How? He doesn't eat, he doesn't work out, he makes masks. I'm sorry, but this part really annoyed me. It always has, even in the past movies. I would really like so see someone actually over power him with force, even if at the end of the fight, Meyer's ends up winning.What I did like, was when he killed, he would stop and look at the body, as if looking over his work. I thought that was a good touch.Well, I am going to lock myself in a room, and make masks for the next 15 years. Maybe I will come out stronger. Who knows, maybe I'm missing something.",Halloween

Nudity, the word f*ck used in every other sentence,and gore up to your knees. However with the idea to give his reincarnation of one the most iconic horror legends a back story to show people that Michael Myers was a born bad seed, and evolves into a murderous psychopath. I enjoyed this film , and I have watched all the Halloween films( except for the third film) the ending however can leave some people skeptical of there being a sequel.

1031,supertechsupport,I am seriously not feeling OK after seeing this film....,1,2 September 2007,"First off I just realized that I am out $9. I could have gave that to some needy kids. I am a huge fan of the original, and when i saw the trailer and noticed that Rob Zombie was going to direct it, I was excited. Little did I know that Rob, was going to butcher this film. There is way too much about the young michael meyers, and when the film finally gets to the actual halloween night, they pull a fast forward on us. Then there's the timeline factor. This movie eventually ends up taking place in the 90's because one of the characters has a cell phone. Funny thing is, she is the only person in the movie with a cell phone. Another thing i didn't like (and this is a bit nitpicking) is the poster. Tell me this, doesn't the poster look like the poster to Friday the 13th: Jason Goes to Hell? Then we have all of Rob Zombie's usual cast in this movie. Yep all the peeps from his other movies get to pick up a check in this one! There is no suspense no real scare. Only loomis and meyers gets character development. I am seriously disgusted at this film. I feel as if there needs to be a lawsuit or some fine/punishment system in place for movie remakes. There has to be some form of justice. Thanks for listening to my rant. Oh, just wait for it on DVD.",Halloween

It's a whole NEW vision on the Myers myth. Best myth, makes freakin sense how could a boy just be plain evil?,he has an evil up bringing. Rob I just want to say THANK YOU keep up the GREAT work and you should really consider doing the werewolf movie that you teased us all with during grindhouse. Eli has already gotten a message from me about doing Thanksgiving movie. Would be cool if there was a grindhouse 2 with your movie and his. Talk about THROWBACK to oldschool horror drive-in's.

1033,horrorfan1234,Halloween Zero,1,3 September 2007,"This movie has been referred to as Halloween 9. Maybe a better title would be Halloween Zero. My prediction is that this movie will be completely forgotten about as soon as it disappears from theatres. In the near future, if someone mentions ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"" (which probably won't happen to begin with), they will most likely be met with blank stares, furrowed brows, and/or looks of confusion. There was nothing at all enjoyable about this film (except for maybe a song or two.) Every character in the movie was extremely trashy, with no sense of decency whatsoever. For me, this alone, made the movie very disappointing and unrealistic (even in the horror movie sense of the word.) The unnecessary explicit foul language, overtly sexual content, and overall neanderthal-like behavior on the part of all of the characters in the film was the inspiration for much eye-rolling and scoffing. The opening scene shows Mike Myers' step father going on one of the most perverted psychotic rants in the history of civilization. The next scene in the movie involves a pre-teen bully commenting to an even younger Mike Myers that his sister is ""so slutty, it took them two hours to pump the c*m out of her stomach."" It makes you wonder what kind of a mind a person must have, to write a line like that for a child. Also... what kind of a ""desperate to be in the limelight"" parent allows their child to say a line like that. Does that parent then go to all the neighbors and proudly shout ""Timmy got a part in a movie! He doesn't have many lines, but one has something to do with someone's stomach being pumped free of semen! I'm so proud!""As has been said numerous times, the acting was horrific. I assume that bad directing was mainly to blame. I say this because Danielle Harris did a great job as Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4 & 5. Yet, she was horrible in this film. I know that bad acting is often stereotypical of horror films. Usually it works. In this film, it does not.Halloween Zero seemed more like a porno-spoof of the original than a serious horror movie. When I saw it, the audience was predominantly 14-16 year olds, who reacted with bouts of laughter throughout. (To be honest, this disturbed me, considering the content that these kids were laughing at.) I've seen plenty of movies, many of which I didn't care for much. But, this is the very first movie that I can say I actually hated. I'm convinced that any positive comments about this movie are being made by Rob Zombie himself and/or the cast and crew. I can't imagine that anyone would've actually gotten any kind of enjoyment out of this film. As far as recommending that you go see this movie... I almost want to tell you to go see it just so you know how bad it is. But, I won't do that. One thing's for sure, Scary Movie 5 will have plenty of material to work with.",Halloween
1034,lindyfralin,More white trash from Zombie,1,4 September 2007,"Okay, I really like Rob Zombie. But enough is enough already. The white trash angle he does in all of his movies is beat now, & the basic core of actors he works with in all of his films is getting old.I love Sheri, Bill, Sid, etc. The trash and cast worked great with House Of a Thousand Corpses. (I really liked that movie) Devils rejects fine. But it didn't work for me in Halloween & the cast took me out of the movie repeatedly.Hey, there's Captain Spaulding, oh look it's Sheriff Wydell!! Anyhoo, You can break this movie up into two parts.The first half tries to explain why Michael Myers kills. The young, abused Myers if you will. The crazy family doesn't love me spin we've seen countless times before.The second half is basically the original Halloween revamped for guys who like hip mtv style visuals, blood, boobs & wrestling. With characters so unlikeable and annoying you really can't wait till they die.As far as scares go, this movie has none. Gone are the stealthy, creative kills we got from the original. That boogeyman could be anywhere vibe which made Michael so scary doesn't show up here.Instead, we get a gigantic member of Slipknot slashing his way through people we could care less about because all we really know about them is that they like to have sex.Terrible Halloween movie aside, I would love to see Rob do a movie minus the trash and usual cast.You could say it's his style, but it's getting old & predictable in my book. Halloween would have been the perfect opportunity to break away from this.",Halloween

I must say this film is rubbish! The story is slow, the acting is bad and i feel that the original Halloween is much better.I really did think Zombie would make this movie AMAZING. Rob Zombies last two movies were sick and disturbing and i was kinda hoping that he would of added that essence to this film...nope!Its also a shame that Sheri moon didn't get her kit off!Lets hope the next movie is better.m m#m m m m m#m m#m",Halloween
1036,boxoffice32,"If you must see this movie, wait for it to come on TV",1,3 September 2007,"I saw Halloween the other night. I was horrified... at how terrible it was.I've noticed that some people are saying that the ""die-hard"" Halloween fans went in to the movie biased, accounting for so many negative comments. Well, I can tell you that's not the case (with me anyway.) I did enjoy the original Halloween film. But, I was truly hoping that the new version would be good also. Actually, I was kind of expecting it to be. I went in just as I'd go in to watch any other film, hoping to have an enjoyable viewing experience. What I got, instead, was a big disappointment.One thing I've concluded from watching the film is that Rob Zombie must have even more serious psychological problems than the Michael Myers character he created. It takes a pretty disturbed mind to come up with some of the ridiculous smut displayed in this flick. I have no problem with bad language or sexuality, when it's relevant to the story line. In this case, however, it was way overdone and pointless. Before he even started writing a script for this movie, Zombie must have made an inventory... ""there'll be 968 F-bombs; 3 or 4 skanky high school girls; 4, no wait, 5 pre-teen kids whose language would make the stereotypical foul-mouth sailor cringe; and a whole plethora of trashy, lack luster characters who have the IQ of a bucket of rocks. Now, time to get started on the script. Where did I put that crayon and roll of toilet paper"".Regarding the professionalism of the movie : As I watched, I wondered if this was the work of a group of junior-high school students. I found it very amateurish, to say the least.As my summary says, if you absolutely insist on seeing this film, I must strongly suggest that you wait for it to come on TV. That way you'll only be wasting your time, not your money.I'll put it this way... The original Halloween is still considered one of the all time classic horror movies, almost 30 years after it's release. Prediction : 30 years from now, it'll still be a classic; and Rob Zombie's version will be shown repeatedly to POWs as a form of psychological torture.To sum up... This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. (And I've seen The Cable Guy!)",Halloween
1037,bobbyb55,Just Not The Same,2,3 September 2007,The first Halloween was a classic. This on was not even close. Cinematically..it was too dark..hard to read the innuendos and subtle hints of Michaels antisocial quirks when you can't see it.I realize that horror flicks are not meant to be fodder for the very young but the cursing was quite excessive and didn't lend any extra credence to the story line at all.I expected better from Rob Zombie. The sequel..I just can't see it originating from this mess. The original ballooned from a under budgeted b flick to a soon to be extolled masterpiece. Michael Myers deserves better than this.,Halloween
1038,zobkiw,A disgrace to a classic!,1,3 September 2007,"How unfortunate that we are not given the choice of zero! I won't say much about this film, many of the other comments cover everything. Obviously whether you like learning of MM's past is based on your own personal preference, what I can say is that all I could think of were two much cheesier horror series of old ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" These flicks all too often used ""sex"" in their slaying scenes. Well, an unoriginal Zombie has basically remade one of the more serious horror flicks by simply inserting too many sex scenes - oh and of course those partaking in the sex either die in the act or immediately afterward. Nor do I think it was appropriate to change the storyline that has already been said. It's one thing to create a backstory that was never told, but to take a classic and change the story - why not just come up with some other masked man killing naked women??? What a waste.",Halloween
1039,orthman1,Not bad but not that great either,6,4 September 2007,The first half hour of the movie was tough to get through but after that the movie was decent. I think the beginning of the movie could have been done a little better but it was a good idea to show Michael as a child. It's very difficult to compare this to the original but I would have liked to have seen more of the original in this movie with today's society taken into account. I saw many homages to the original movie and to John Carpenter during the movie which was good. I had hoped Rob would have stayed true to the original by using more suspense in the film rather than blood and gore. It was an OK movie for a remake but it's not a must see. My advice is save money and see it during the day or when it comes out on DVD.,Halloween

Save your money and just watch the original. I wish I had. Horror is based on suspense, the unexpected, the element of surprise, NOT on simple gore and ridiculous back stories. A bad attempt was made at a different back story for Michael Meyers. I am not sure you should remake something that is real horror, using crazy carnival antics.I also have to add that the theater was packed with people before the movie started, but a lot of people were walking out and not returning for this poorly executed film. Needless to say, I wasn't the only one disappointed.",Halloween

I love Rob Zombie and his usage of characters, sound track, and how close he gets to the reality of how events really happen in this world rather than sugar coat them. I don't, however, condone the language used in this film but overall it was one of the best movies I have seen. It showed how Michael Myers escaped, got his ""uniform"" and his reasons for killing in the first place. I think it was a good remake and a good actualization of the characters' attitudes. But like I said, the bad language and things like Michael Myers' mom being a stripper probably could have been left out but that is in all Rob Zombie's crude humor and that's what makes his films so great. He does what he wants and doesn't follow any film making guidelines. I look forward to seeing more of his films.",Halloween
1042,tigersgrowl-2,The Worst In The Series,2,4 September 2007,"Warning: this comment contains a spoiler for the film of Halloween H20 (8). Halloween: Retribution (9) absolutely was the worst in the whole series, and I thought Halloween 8 was bad. Assuming John Carpenter is willing to make (or approve someone else to make) a Halloween 10, I would like to see John Tate and Molly Cartwell (the only characters who escaped the main set in Halloween: H20). Hmm, that gives me an idea. I might just write a screenplay and attempt to get it on the big screen. Laurie Strode is presumed dead after the beginning of Halloween 8 so I doubt there is a chance any writer can weasel their way out of the fact that the Laurie Strode Tate character is dead. That was a not survivable fall. I guess I am a little anti-gore when it comes to horror movies. If you are the type of person who likes blood filling up the screen, then you may enjoy this type of movie but if you are someone who enjoys a good horror flick, such a Halloween (1978), which if my memory serves me right, not one drop of blood was shown until Halloween 2 and even then, you would have to look for it, without the gore, then this is not for you.

They call them classics for one very simple reason. Most of them changed the way movies were made, the content allowed, or how we saw the stories unfold. I saw the original and thought it was great. I saw the new one and think that its good too, in different ways. A lot more gore, and a lot less suspense. A lot more Michael, and a lot less Laurie. And a lot more Dr. Loomis. So, if you have seen the original, you are already tainted blood, and you have all these expectations about what made the original great. So if you decide to see it, go with an open mind. It's not an exact remake, there is a lot of Michael as a boy, which made this different, and in my opinion a decent watch.",Halloween
1044,housepayne67,The perfect ending... Michael slashes Rob Zombie!!!!!,1,5 September 2007,"First off, Let me Thank Rob Zombie. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Thank you for taking probably one of the most terrifying horror movies of all time and completely ruining carpenters name. Heres a clue! Movies DO NOT have to be so vulgar! Yes i know that some movies need the language to make it more ""real"", but there was just way to much. The nudity???? Com'on Rob. I know most of your movies have lots of nudity, but this is Halloween. My son has seen every Halloween up to this one, and probably will not see this one. it is just too graphic. Rob Zombie = Gore, nudity, and language, and this one is no exception. Unfortunately for Zombie, Carpenter is going to be a hard name to follow, but Zombie has always done movies that are just OK, and this is no different. House of 1000 corpses, and devils rejects all seemed like the old B movies. Halloween is very similar. This movie does tell a story that is pretty good. I do give it that, But it would have been 95% better if there was a little less gore, less language, and less nudity. I am by no means a shrewed, but taste I would like to see. Because of taste, I would give this movie a D-. add the storyline, and I would give this movie a c-. VERY disappointed in this movie",Halloween
1045,Velrik,Worst One Yet,2,5 September 2007,"Rob Zombie shocked the 'horror' genre with house of 1000 corpses. A movie entirely based on TnA and a poor rip off of some kind of Wrong Turn meets Hills have Eyes. It was one of the worst acts he could have done, though of course, ever set as most people who shouldn't direct are, he proved this wrong with the shoot em up outlaw thriller of devil's rejects. Wasn't just a reject of the devil, but of the box office and audience as well.Then he turned around and decided he had to remake what was one of his favorites as a young man. Halloween. One of the original horror movies, the milestone in horror. It reared its magnificent head with Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elmstreet, and Hellraiser. Originals in the Horror industry and superb at what they did in the time they did them.This remake adds an hour of film at the start to try and explain what was done in flashbacks in the second and third movies. It tosses in more profanity then is even remotely necessary. Its like Zombie decided he wanted to see how often he could fit the 'F' word into a film and get away with it.Moreso, the pointless opening hour barely even set the stage for the line of disappointments. The kid who in the original is seen standing over his mother's body in a clown costume, instead is a deranged little child who tortures rats and kills his step father, sister, sister's boyfriend, but -not- his mother. No, that he leaves for her to suicide over.That was the first disappointment of the movie (second if you count the abundance of unnecessary language, and third if you count the useless lead up).They break storyline a dozen times or more, as though the characters mean nothing. The only surviver of importance being Laurie. This of course includes the death of Myers, who is like an android as he gets shot, stabbed, and butchered continuously without any effect.They kill off key characters who shouldn't have been touched until the sequel, or later. Even wrapping it up in one movie, doesn't account for the damages Zombie did in killing off lead roles like they meant nothing.This movie gets a 1 out of 10 in my books. The only reason I'm ranking it as a 2, is because my friend who I saw it with, actually jumped because Myers came from a different angle then anticipated.Being there with two women and one other guy, the other guy who is a paranoid asthma sufferer, was the only one that even flinched.This was a failure in activity, and I hope Zombie retires from film making after this one. I'm getting very bored of being dragged to wastes of time and film.",Halloween
1046,elephant_breath,Rob Zombie Makes Halloween His Own,6,6 September 2007,"Don't go into this movie thinking that it's just a rehashing of the 1978 classic, because it is far from that. I've read a lot of comments saying that after the beginning, the movie is basically the same as Carpenter's, and I disagree- Rob Zombie made this movie his own. For instance, there is more sexual content in his version than Carpenter's, and it focused more on Michael as opposed to Laurie. The main difference for me was that in Carpenter's version, Michael Myers is more of a stalker-type character and little gore is used, where as the new version is a bloodbath, but a bloodbath that works. The opening parts delve into a young Michael, something that was absent from the original, and the end portion is entirely different with one thing I definitely wasn't expecting. The ending parts may anger some fans of the original and the following movies in the series, but the viewer needs to understand that this is not the original movie. I wouldn't want to watch a rehashing of the old version when I could watch the classic 1978 flick instead.*Possible Spoilers* I had a couple of problems with the movie, however. The first was with continuity. In the original, Michael drives a car from the mental institute back to town. In the new version, however, Michael goes from the mental institution to a truck stop and then to town. It seems like there's a piece missing that would show how Michael got from the truck stop to the town. It's also confusing when in one shot he's at the truck stop and in the next he's in a dank room which we later find out is the old Myer's house. It all seemed a bit rushed and lacking.My next problem is that both my friend (who had not seen the original) and I laughed at the exact same moment in the movie. When Laurie looks out the window at school and sees Michael standing there staring back, we both chuckled. This scene was so creepy in the original, and yet here, for some reason, it looked funny.I came into this movie expecting a new beginning followed by a total rehashing of the remaining scenes, but that was not the case. Halloween does have its flaws, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it to both the casual movie person and the old-school fans, as long as they keep an open mind.",Halloween
1047,manning-18,Halloween 2007. A Trick or a Treat?,3,8 September 2007,"Dear Rob Zombie, You better be kidding me. Halloween is the BEST movie series EVER. And you screw the whole thing up. The Michael Myers as a kid story was decent but you need to learn that was a ""mystery"". I wanted to see what happened but Carpenter never said anything about school being a problem and he was good friends with his dad not ""I hate you"" rivals. And he killed his entire family except for Lorie who was adopted by the Strodes. Myers tricked people with his own way of being sorry then when you fell for it he killed you. You shoot him? The real Dr.Samual Loomis tried that but you want Mr.Carpenter to NEVER redo your movie so you kill Myers. And you think gore, nudity, cussing scares the crap out of people when if you think about it critics said ""Halloween tries to hard for it's Horror"" when quite frankly you can't scare people as easy as John Carpenter did with Halloween (1978). All I'm saying' is that you should never ever write, direct, or produce a movie that has a legacy to the series. Love Halloween fan #1",Halloween

For some strange reason, when he breaks out of the asylum he looks as if he's ready to take on Spiderman or Wolverine. He's close to 7 feet tall and and looks like ""Slipknot"" in his homemade orange mask and long greaser hair. At this point in the movie, it ceases being a true ""horror"" film and becomes something of a cross between a generic action movie and a gore fest. Very disappointing. This is the reason I stopped seeing the ""Nightmare on Elm St."" movies after the 3rd one. A total one dimensional rendering of a great character. Awful..",Halloween

1052,xavier117,Not impressive and unrealistic on too many occasions.,4,15 September 2007,"This comment is for people who have already seen the movie. The way Michael Myers is able to break through the chains and kill four prison guards, and not get hurt at all is insanely unrealistic. Also regarding that scene, they would've had that whole killing on a hidden camera, and more guards would go to Myers and attempt to stop him. That part was where I really became upset with the film. Other unrealistic parts of the movie were when Dr. Loomis shoots Myers I believe three times and hits what seems like around the heart every time and Myers still gets up no less than two minutes later and continues to kill people with ease. Also on a couple occasions when people would have a gun pointed at Myers and not shoot and give him time to destroy them, that made me think, ""What the heck are they doing not shooting this maniac? They have a perfect shot every time yet they seem to freeze up."" And when the girl stabs Myers in the neck, or maybe it was the back, but if it was the neck there is no way he is surviving that, yet he was able to just pull the knife out of his neck, and continue trying to kill the girl. There are other parts that were really just not impressive and it made me highly disappointed with the quality of the film. It seemed to me that Rob Zombie and others who wrote and had a hand in directing and writing and producing the movie just wanted to make it as bloody as possible and just focus on the shock value, but there is more to a horror movie than just making the people in the audience throw up in their seats after being overwhelmed by gallons of blood spray throughout the silver screen. I wouldn't recommend it, you can spend your money in a more wise way on a better horror movie.",Halloween

I like you Rob Zombie, but no more Prequels...",5,17 September 2007,"At moments this movie was good, not really scary unless you get scared at the stupidest things. Overall, it was a comedy. I laughed my a$$ off when I was watching this in the theater cause Rob doesn't go with Halloween's plot. Before I get a bunch of hate message, YES it shows young Mikey murdering some people then going to an asylum for I think it was 20 years until he breaks out in search of his baby sister.Now this is a HUGE SPOILER comment, so don't read past this...In the original 1978 John Carpenter film Michael Myers murders his babysitter and is then sent to an asylum by judges order. In Rob's film, he murders a school bully, his step father, his older sisters boyfriend, then his older sister. You go from 1 murder to 4. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in most 70's horror flicks, the murderer kills young sluts and guys for premarital sex, and for the sheer excitement... Well, in Rob's version, Ol' Mikey Meyers ""rapes"" a girl. Don't see it, but as she lays on the floor covered in blood, she explains to Laurie how he raped her. WTF?!?!?!? And if thats not good enough reason to make you laugh (rape is a serious subject, laugh at Rob's point-of-view), Mikey kills Loomis! Wth?

1054,kirbylee70-1,You're No Michael Myers,3,17 September 2007,"Rob Zombie has made a career of all things horror. From the musical group White Zombie to his own solo career, in comics with his monster fighting character El Superbeasto and into films. His first two forays, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" tied into one another nicely with the second film being a sequel to the first. But with his third film, ""Halloween"", Zombie falls short of offering not only scares but signs of a developmental director.Everyone already knows the tale of Michael Myers, the psychopath from Haddonfield, IL, who murdered his sister only to be committed to an institution he would later escape from with the intent of more killings back home years later. While that is the basis for Zombie's film, it is not a remake but more of a retelling, a reinvention of the same character.Here we are offered young Michael and the household he grows up in that forms his life. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper, saddled with a new husband (William Forsythe) who is disabled and a ne'er do well more interested in yelling at the kids than in offering any sort of role model. Michael's sister is a trashy sleep with anyone teen who dresses provocatively and does little else. All of this is not lost on Michael who spends his time killing his pets and taking photos of them. What we are being offered is a textbook glimpse as to why a youngster becomes a serial killer. The nice middle class family shown in the original is tossed aside for this new group. And in this first portion of the film, the problems Zombie has are apparent.Zombie has filled three films now with the same characters. Sure, they may have different names and different small time characteristics, but the fact remains that he focuses on the dysfunctional family and their housecleaning inabilities. Yes, it seems that all families in Zombie's world can't clean to save themselves. Not only that but they all have the same dingy look to their living quarters as well as references to pop culture. The house Michael grows up in could be a home that the Firefly family would feel comfortable in. It all looks the same and that detracts greatly from the viewing experience, unless of course you'd never seen another Rob Zombie film.Comparisons to the original film are inevitable and this will most likely be the downfall of the film in the long run. Michael goes overboard with his murderous rampage as a child in this film unlike the original. Where no blood was seen in that film, it flows freely now. Perhaps this is due to the changing times, but it adds nothing to the scares of the film or the character. It does make him a more brutal killer, leaving him one without a touch of sympathy. But the mindless killer from the original is replaced by someone we feel absolutely nothing for now.Once finished with the whole back story of young Michael, his family and the kindly Dr. Loomis (Michael McDowell) who takes care of him at the institution, we move forward 15 years to when Michael escapes and heads back home. The body count increases once more as he kills everyone he comes into contact with their, including a worker who had befriended him. Once out, the story becomes more familiar, almost a duplicate of the original shot from different angles, with different actors and focusing less on the character of Laurie Strode, the central character in John Carpenter's version.Laurie and her friends are nothing more than meat to be slaughtered by Michael in this one. There is no development of character, no reason for us to think of them as more than teens in peril that we have seen in hundreds of other slasher flicks. While we cared about the original teens, this time around they seem less human and placed in our way for two reasons: to be killed by Michael and to offer more exposed flesh than the first.By the film's end we are offered the traditional sliced and diced teens, gratuitous nudity and enough blood to make a special effects company weep for joy at the size of their bill. But we have gained nothing in the iconography that is Michael Myers. While we are given more background on him, we care less about him than we ever did.Worst of all is the fact that Rob Zombie, a director that showed such great potential before, seems to be telling us after only three films that this is all he has to offer. Stories told from the same world, a world that blasts apart the whole ""Father Knows Best"" world we would all like it to be. In his world, there is no caring parent. And when they are caring, they are twisted in some revolting way.I haven't given up on Zombie yet though. Having recently signed a two picture deal with the Weinstein's, perhaps he will show us he has more tricks up his sleeve than he let on. But if he returns to the carny soiled world he's offered in three films to date, then it looks as though he's a one note director. Let's hope he offers us more. It's in there somewhere.",Halloween

John Carpenter had a way of creating a certain amount of suspense and dread within his films while Zombie just tries to overload you with garbage. This could have been a sweet deal!

Michael stalked people, now you see him, now you don't. there was actually very little killing, and it wasn't gory. the first one worked. this one was just gross. too much killing, too much detail of the killing. the opening of the movie in the first 5 minutes had so much foul language, i almost got up and left. it was excessive in all the wrong areas, too much gore, too much killing, not frightening, just gross. too much nudity that was there not for the story, but just for the sex appeal...i wouldn't recommend to anyone. i'm ashamed i made such a poor choice of movies to view.",Halloween
1059,kimmelbee1,Unnecessary and unrealistic.,1,6 August 2009,"This remake was completely unnecessary! (In my opinion all remakes are unnecessary, but this one even more so.) The original stands up to the test of time. So much for Rob saying he'd never do a remake. Rob Zombie not only tried to take away the charm and fright factor of this movie by trying to ""explain"" why Michael Myers did what he did. But he did so in a manner that was completely unbelievable and to which I want to say ""boo-hoo for Michael""! I mean a lot of kids have rotten families, rotten childhoods and do not become serial killers! Come on! I prefer the original's stance of not knowing why he killed his sister Judith. Even the explanation in Halloween 2 (the Original Halloween 2, not the remake of the sequel that is due out soon) that he was a weird kid into some weird stuff, is preferable to ""his momma was a stripper, his step-dad a drunk and his sister a floozy, oh and he was teased mercilessly by other kids. Of course he's teased, the little clown mask wearing, animal torturing freak! Who wouldn't want to tease him? Heck, I wanted to tease him! But the worst part of this travesty of a movie is that Rob Zombie doesn't even bother to try to pay attention to detail. It is almost as if he picked songs and facts at random to put in this movie regardless of whether they fit with the time frame the film is set in. Perhaps just to be ""cool"". This is to Rob: if the setting of your movie is 1963 don't play Nazareth's 1975 version of Love Hurts! Oh, and the Manson Family murders, mentioned by the reporter the day after 10 year old Michael's rampage, were in 1969...not 1963! Hello! Those are just the ones I knew offhand. There are probably more. The bottom line is this: don't make a remake because you have questions about certain things and you feel the need to explain these things to the fans. Most of us have our own feelings about the unexplained things in our favorite movies and we don't want, or need, your explanation. Oh, and if you make a movie pick the date it is set in and stick to it! Check your facts! If you can't do that, then for Pete's sake and for our sake, don't make movies and especially don't remake movies. For everyone else, just avoid this movie.",Halloween
1060,tmw88,Bloody Slasher With Good Acting,5,10 October 2007,"If you like bloody slasher/graphic teen sex movies, this is right up your alley. I watched a version of this recently - I say a ""version"" because my scary movie buddy had been given a DVD copy from someone and she told me that it was not the theatrical release. I was not gung-ho to see this remake, mainly because I had a preconceived notion of what it would be like since I am familiar with Rob Zombie's music. It turned out to be just what I would have expected - lots of profanity, nudity, sexual content and very bloody killings. I get the chills when I hear the theme music from the original movie but this soundtrack was even worse. The music was loud, distorted and uncomfortable to the point of wanting to plug my ears, which I didn't like at the time, but looking back I have to admit that it worked - this isn't a Disney movie, after all. There was a very graphic and disturbing rape scene that takes place in the mental hospital that I'm told was not in the theatrical release. It was interesting to see young Michael's home life and get an idea of what caused the psychotic break that led to him becoming a homicidal maniac. I thought the acting performances were very good, especially young Michael. I see that the actress who played Laurie is set to be in the remake of April Fool's Day - you know you're getting old when the slasher films of your teenage years are being remade.",Halloween
1061,irongargoyleartworks,Returning to John Carpenter's true vision,10,14 October 2007,"Having seen many of the Halloween movies, and now having just seen Rob Zombie's remake, I must say that Zombie has done a true service to the storyline. And knowing he had Carpenter's blessing is a bonus. **WARNING**SPOILERS Although the remake does not follow the original storyline verbatim, the idea of going in depth into Micheal's childhood, including torture and mutilation of animals, an abusive step-father, exotic dancer mother, and typical teenage-angst older sister, adds understanding to this horror juggernaut. Zombie shows a loving older brother/baby sister bond between Micheal and infant Laurie, giving reason to Micheal's pursuit of his younger sister. At the movie's climax, although the viewer is left not really knowing for sure whether Laurie has finished her older, the audience is left with the distinct impression that most of the Halloween ""sequels"" leave a bad taste in Rob Zombie's mouth. All in all, my favorite Halloween movie.",Halloween
1062,armaggedom,At last a Halloween flick which brings something new...,7,21 October 2007,"This comment will be a short one. I just wish to thank director Rob 'Zombie' Cummings for this totally new approach to the Myers myth. Not only does he show respect for the original material by including some of it's key scenes, but he also brings a totally realistic approach to Michael's character. Certainly, Michael has now a more down to earth serial killer status, which makes him more believable than Carpenter's supernatural approach. There's no denying that. It's also a fact that the scares don't have the same impact, but hey, this is a remake, for God's sake !! When Halloween came out back in 78', there was no precedent save for Black Christmas, maybe, and people weren't use to this type of material. As much as I love Carpenter's film, I praise Rob for his unique style and for giving Michael a credible background and a soul. Yes, there's foul language and yes it is violent : a true reflection of the world we live in, folks... as for the acting, once again Rob comes up with big names of the seventies(McDowell, Haig, Foree) and some new ones too (though I do wish Scout had played Laurie in a less slutty manor...) At least he has brought something refreshingly different, crude and relentless to a franchise which had long gone down the drain... Amen.",Halloween
1063,jenniferdapper,Wow,6,21 October 2007,"Okay. This movie wasn't terrible, but come on, it was disappointing for a Rob Zombie film. I think seeing more into Michael Meyers childhood was great, except for the fact that in the original Halloween, he doesn't appear to be from some broken family. Their home is clean and well maintained, and they just seem to be a normal family. The 3 friends who represented Annie, Laurie, and Lynda, were extremely annoying. So annoying that it looked as if they were terrible actors, and now I can only assume they are. Plus Zombie made some changes to the movie, which is fine, but Annie had her throat cut in her car in the original, and died instantly. In this new one, it appears she may live. Secondly, in the original, Michael doesn't kill Judith's boyfriend because he is gone right after they have sex. (ha ha which by the way, seemed as if it only lasted 2 minutes total lol) Also the chase with Michael and Laurie in the Meyers house was too long, and lacked a lot. For Michael to take his mask off when he wasn't feeling like a killer was dumb. The real Michael Meyers had no emotion. He lacked it, and lacked everything that would really make him human, which is what I like about him. He isn't already dead, and he isn't a zombie, or even just a psychopath. He's Michael Meyers and that is as simple of a classification that he needs. Anyways, Rob Zombie has made excellent movies thus far, but I guess my hopes for this Halloween remake were too high. My hubby loved it and I can see why. Zombie made some great additions to the movie and made me jump a few times in my seat. I guess I have loved the original Halloweens and watched them so many times, that to see them redone, would be hard for me to accept, but Zombie had every right to try.",Halloween
1064,Fatty-Cherles,The farce to end all farces.,2,5 November 2007,"What in the name of holy hell where those gastrically challenged, cerebrally retarded buffoons in the film industry thinking when they thought up this monstrosity? Seriously, I have seen some stinkers in my time but this really does take the biscuit and eat it whole. Now, it would be unfair of me to say that everything about this disaster is bad. Hey, it's got moving pictures, it's got dialogue and it even has music sure what more do you want? Well, I'll tell you. A sustainable plot would have made a nice start, some believable acting certainly wouldn't have gone amiss and the odd scare, after all, this is a ""horror"" film, would have been quite nice now and then. Instead, we got Rob Zombie's burning, castrating and Crucifixion of a horror classic. The plot, weak from the beginning, does nothing to improve itself and gets progressively worse as the horrendous direction by Zombie's amateurish mind collapses into a circus of despair and absolutely abhorrency. Seriously, this film would have been better placed in the hands of a mentally dead plebiscite from the Outer Hebrides! Now, Zombie being Zombie, he had to go and change parts of the story, in particular those surrounding Michael's childhood. Now, although his ideas are good, the way in which he portrays them is derisory and he takes what could potentially have been a semi-good story into a total shambles. Now comes my main gripe. Firstly, the Halloween series got significantly worse when Donald Pleasance passed away and so couldn't reprise his role as Loomis anymore and so erasing the character seemed the most logical thing to do. However, as the eejit that is Rob Zombie is remaking the film and so Loomis is a vital character. What a load of old twaddle. Malcolm McDowell (through no fault of his own) turns Loomis into an egotistical lunatic and ruins the character, making this film even more unbelievably dire than first established. So, my verdict? Well, if by some unfathomable mystery you have failed to realise how much I loathe this film then I'll tell you again- I loathe it beyond belief. Thank you.",Halloween
1065,noxtheroxstar,What did you expect?,5,9 January 2008,"I watched this movie with a complete and utter hope that Rob Zombie would make a remake of the original at least some what decent. Which he did to a certain extent and I respect his efforts. After all, he took a classic horror movie and modernized it to todays standards...which is...expected. Considering how many movies as of recent have become remakes, or movies based off movies that proceeded them.... I'll be honest, I saw this movie and I realized how much I liked the original. I liked the cannon about Michael Myers past, sure it was touching, tragic and empathetic. I felt it was needed to a certain degree, the way he was tortured and how he punished things that were inferior. I'm glad Rob Zombie took the time to add extra events into this series, truly I am. However...I'm somewhat tired of these remakes of classic movies, and not just this one in particular. But because I liked Debra Hill and John Carpenters concept of a killer whose only intention was that of killing the things he loved most. Maybe I'm looking too far into this, it is just a movie after all....",Halloween
1066,jkiseleski,Zombie's version lives up to the pressure and then some!,8,24 November 2007,"Being a horror film fanatic myself, I'm not particularly fond of the classics being remade. A remake rarely lives up to the standards of the original because of the simple fact that the original is our first impression and what we naturally accept as the blueprint of the story being told. This is especially true when a film is as groundbreaking as the original Halloween was. So many people fell in love with this film because it was so original at the time and yes, partly because of the mystery and unanswered questions behind Michael Myers. Zombie's version however fills in many of the gaps in the original, answering all or most of the unanswered questions. Understandably, many die-hard Halloween fans resented this because as I said before, part of the attraction to Myers was the mystery behind the mask. The problem here was that if it was going to be a straight up remake...anyone could have done it because the blueprint has already been drawn up. Zombie was creative enough to show you his interpretation of what made Michael the psychopath that he was, tie it in to the original story and then serve it to us in a form of realism, essentially taking the fantasy out of the story. To me this enhances the scariness of the story because you can see the possibility of a real life tragedy/horror such as this taking place. The original Myers wasn't as believable(not that he was meant to be). He was more of a supernatural villain, therefore harder to relate to in a true life sense which to me isn't as scary. I've also heard some say that the early part of the film was too bloody, vulgar, and just set up as unnecessary shock treatment for viewers. Are you kidding me? For a seemingly normal boy to turn into such a cold hearted psychopath like Myers, he would need to go through a pretty traumatic experience or even many experiences to hit that level. For Zombie's story to work he needed to show you a glimpse of how Mike Myers progressed to become the brutal killer that he was. Anything less vulgar or shocking wouldn't have been believable. Another point I want to make is that many of the previous sequels to the original Halloween were not very good at all. That is....compared to the first. We've gotten used to this and accepting of sequels for the most part never living up to the quality of the originals. Besides, what die-hard passionate fan of the original wants to see a sequel or remake outdo or even equal the power of the original? Nobody! I personally think that this is part of the reason Rob Zombie took so much heat for his version.....because many fans of the first saw his version as a legitimate threat or one as equally powerful, if not more than the original Halloween...Nice job Rob!",Halloween

Got them all on DVD now of course.... See the original - 1 AND 2 - then watch this. It goes MUCH further into Michaels childhood and the making of the monster. Its no surprise he goes the way he does - and we finally find out how Loomis came on the scene.Flick forward 15 years and watch the carnage begin! Zombie doesn't hold back on the killing, staying well in line with the original themes but changing things enough to keep you guessing. And to have Danielle Harris play such a big role in the movie (you see A lot of her) is great - she played the child star in 4 and 5 (and should have played it in 6 too...) See it / hire it if you want to know how they should make horrors.

1068,bmouzakis,"Great movie, horrible remake",6,29 November 2007,"'contains spoiler'When I first heard about Rob Zombie remaking Halloween, I had mixed feelings. My favorite director of today is remaking my favorite movie of all time, which was awesome. Somebody's remaking Halloween, which sucks. When i went to see this movie, i kept an open mind. i knew it was going to be different, because the title was ROB ZOMBIE'S HALLOWEEN, not JOHN CARPENTER'S.It took the movie in an entirely new direction, which is good. What's the point in remaking a movie frame for frame. Many of my friends think the original is boring, and compared to today's standards the original is not very scary. We all agreed it was good to update it.The whole point of Michael Myers is that he is the embodiment of evil. Evil is not born, evil does not die. As long as there are things capable of choice, there will be evil. Explaining Michael's behavior takes away from ""he's pure evil."" Rob Zombie's version turns him from evil to a product of his environment. By itself, this is a great movie. If this were the first Halloween to come out, I would obsess over it like i do the original. But as a remake, it failed miserably. It almost overly stereotyped all of the characters, changed Michael from a force of nature to a regular (sort of) human, and got rid of the fact that evil can't die (although it would be great if this is the last Halloween, instead of continually bringing him back to life.)Rob Zombie had a lot of courage to take on this project, and i respect and admire him for doing it.",Halloween
1069,tattooedguy752000,Yet another great Rob Zombie film.,10,17 December 2007,"First off I am a huge fan of not only Rob's music, but I think House of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects where some of the best horror films made in the last 10 years. There are so many piece of crap horror movies out there right now, most being PG-13 horror that when i heard that Rob was remaking Halloween, well I got pretty excited. I am a huge fan of the classic Halloween nothing will change that, but I do think that Zombie's version stands up to it. The first time I saw Daeg on screen as Michael Myers I was just amazed. For a kid that age to play a part like Michael Myers, I mean it just amazing. I was real happy that Rob explained what Michael's childhood was like. The first kill has to be one of the best of the film, I will not expose who or how it happens but I will say it is brutal. Sheri Moon-Zombie proved she can play roles other than a murderous psycho, and she did a very good job. Then there was Michaels stay at Smith's Grove. Once again it was an interesting addition to the film. From the childhood scenes to adult, everything was filmed very well. It was good to see a Zombie regular like Bill Moseley. The escape scene was awesome, it shows just how crazy Michael really is. After the escape it is the remake portion of the film. It show Michael as he stalks his younger sister Laurie Strode who is played by Scout Taylor-Compton, who in my opinion does a killer job as Laurie. I loved this part of the movie cause it was similar to the original, but it also had new things. It all worked well together. The end was not what I expected, but it was still a pretty good ending. In my opinion Rob Zombie did what no one else could have, he made Michael Myers scary again and if you are a true fan of the original then you should realize that. If you are on the ropes on weather to see Halloween 2007 or not, well all I can say is if you do decide to see it I don't think you will be disappointed.",Halloween

The actors were great... It merely captured the spirit of the John Carpenter Classic. Even though I like the original, it's not as gory and cool like this one. It really captures the sincere moments in the life of Michael Myers and his sister Laurie Strode. And to be honest... I don't even think this is really a remake... it's a RE-DEFINED HALLOWEEN.",Halloween

Number two what the hell are said rednecks doing in Illinois. This must have been from the great hillbilly migration of 1982. Lastly they kill Michael Meyers at the end, what the fu*%. There were only two good things to come out of this raggy piece of sh*!. Malcolm McDowell did play a good role as Dr. Loomis.

But this film has a meaner Michael, he looks scarier. but because we saw the original back when we where children it seemed a lot more scarier than it would be if we saw it in out 20's or 30's, and we have that memory of it being scary. i think people are comparing the feeling they had then and what they see in the remake and because we're older it doesn't seem as scary.I bet the younger generation prefer the remake to the original.Me personally, i prefer the original but the remake wasn't as bad as people say.",Halloween

Zombie has casted Michael Myers perfectly the kid has a dark quality to him. The return of characters from his previous movies ,which you need to see before viewing this one, give a feeling of familiarity and aide along the ride. It is like being on a Roller Coaster and all the movements that go along with ride are here.Zombie has gifted talent for understanding evil and taking you down a road of Mayheim.

Rob Zombie himself said that he is making this movie not as a remake but as more a a back story explaining more about the life of Michael Myers. I loved this movie i have been watching horror movies for over 10 years now and i have watched the Halloween movies countless times. Although i will admit this movie didn't fill in everything it did fill in 90% of plot holes left in the first movie. I do not like it when someone criticizes a movie without first doing the research and looking into it. GET THE FACTS! Maybe then you will be a good critic.

I cannot stress the fact enough that this is not a remake, it is a re-imagining. Simply put, Rob Zombie did not just go in and re-shoot Halloween with different actors that repeat John Carpenter's script verbatim. No, Rob Zombie took the basic premise of Halloween and changed everything else. Giving Micheal Myers a much needed back-story. If you're going to judge this version of Halloween, then judge it on it's own merits rather than comparing it to John Carpenter's Classic. If you can do that then you can see that this movie is a good one. Is it as great as the 1978 original? No, but what horror film today is? I'll say this in closing. If all you want is to see is the original Halloween, then i'm sure you can find it on DVD or even VHS tape online. Any remake (especially one that is verbatim) will only fall short of the original. This, however works well because it's not trying to be John Carpenter's Halloween. It Stands on it's own very well.A good re-imagining of a classic tale.",Halloween
1078,slapstickity,"Not great, but it still kept me watching",5,23 March 2008,"Let me first say that the original Halloween movie and its sequels remains, in my opinion, the epicenter of classic horror movies and no remake will ever come close to the originals. That being said, I am not going on a tyraid about how disappointed I was in this film because it is still, after all, a remake.What I liked about this movie: The beginning. It does give you an in-depth look at the sequence of events that led Michael to the dark side. It gives you a definitive sense of the child losing grip with reality and you can feel the figurative ""sinking feeling"" as he becomes less and less responsive to his environment. For the legion of true Halloween fanatics - myself firmly included - it scratches a certain itch that constantly drove us to find out all we could about Michael Myers; allowing us a free run at the core of his motivations, his thoughts, his feelings, and his dementia. This movie has poignant character development and quite a few ""dry-swallow"" horror sequences that left me feeling a little uneasy to the point where I had to look behind me to make sure I was still alone in the room, resurrecting eerie similarities to the original.What I did NOT like about this movie: The wild variations in the sequence of certain events and facts made it unnerving for those who really have the original storyline down pat. You will find yourself thinking ""That didn't happen that way in the original"". One of the most glaring differences is that originally Michael was 7 years old at the point of his first murder whereas in Zombie's take he was 10. Not only that but his first victim in the original was his older sister. Here, he first makes his way through the bully, his step-father, and then his sister's boyfriend before he makes his way to her room. The confusion that followed trying to weave the two story lines together was a bit tedious, but it soon passes once you realize that this is indeed a remake and to just follow what you're watching. The flagrant expletives became a bit much and seemed totally contrived and forced at best. I do not have virgin ears by any stretch but I found myself almost being able to predict when an unsolicited blue streak would arise. Completely unnecessary and did not add anything to the film. A bit heavy on the nudity but hey, I'm a guy, so I really didn't mind that much. Anytime I am given rampant full frontal without having to overpay for it is OK with me.Synopsis: This movie is better than some of the later sequels to the original series, but it is not without its flaws. Don't go into it thinking it is going to be anything close to the original, or that it's going to improve the original, and you won't be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is and know that this remake could have been so much worse...",Halloween

1082,MickyD25,Don't dismiss this one.....,9,19 July 2008,"Halloween is the latest in the new wave of Hollywood remakes (or re-imaginings) of classic old school horror films. This is one of those remakes that a lot of people either hate or love, the latter mostly being Rob Zombie fans and the former mostly being big fans of the original. Here is a simple questionairre that should help you decide whether this one's for you.Do you consider the original Halloween a ""classic""?Did you really hate Devil's Rejects?Do you prefer your movie monsters to be mysterious, anonymous and only appearing behind a mask?If you answered yes to any or all of these then don't pick this one up. If the answer is no to these questions then you might just enjoy a film I rate up there with Alexandre Aja's Hills Have Eyes as one of the best horror movie remakes. This is really almost two movies in one. The first half is where we meet the young Michael Myers and watch the traumatic series of events that helped turn him into the monster we see later. We also see the budding relationship that Michael forms with his soon to be nemesis, Dr Loomis. We are introduced to his tragic white trash family including his stripper mom, slutty teenage sister and abusive stepfather and see the growth of his disturbing fascination with Masks. This beginning 40 minutes of the movie is framed by Rob Zombie's sharp dialogue and nasty violence and is carried by sterling work from Sheri Moon Zombie and the always great William Forsythe as the stepfather. The most impressive performance is no doubt the young Myers himself and the young guy playing him does an amazing job of making him both menacing and sympathetic.The second half of the film is more of a traditional slasher flick, albeit done with sufficient style and swathes of gore. We see the now adult Myer's escape from his institutionalized life and go searching for his now teen-aged baby sister in his old stomping ground of Haddonfield, leading to the inevitable confrontation with Dr Loomis. As Loomis, Malcolm McDowell provides plenty of pathos and Zombie manages to create a group of wholly believable, if not always likable modern teenagers. Also, it is in this second half of the film that Zombie shows a much improved eye for impressive camera-work including one significantly memorable shot of a slowly closing door and a slowly appearing Michael Myers from behind it. He also seemingly revels in the much larger budget than his previous work, leaving the gritty look behind while never moving too far from his trademark touches.I am one of the few hardcore horror fans who wasn't overly impressed with the original Halloween, and I also really loved The Devil's Rejects. Like I said at the start I think that's the key to really appreciating this film and it's what you need to consider before giving this one a shot. I am fast becoming a big Zombie fan and I can definitely see this and his film work in general continuing to gain a cult status in the years to come. At the very least he has provided us horror fans with some good argument fodder.",Halloween
1083,screamrjc,Forget everything you know about HALLOWEEN,9,26 July 2008,"This movie is very much hated but I liked it and you should to. Forget the fact that it is a remake (re-imaging?), what is done is done. Now i saw the movie the first day it came out and just made it before it sold out. There is much language in this film and much violence. It is in every sense ""hardcore"" slasher. Not a kids movie. The directing is not bad and the acting is pretty good. There are certainly no boundaries for the movie and it left me feeling a bit uneasy. But there are returning Halloween stars (Harris) and some nice scares. I would say if you see this movie, free your mind of the other movies and let yourself fall victim to the harsh world of Michael Myers and Haddonfield.",Halloween
1084,reptargomosh,acceptance?,8,3 August 2008,"First off, I would like to go back to this comment -> Horrible script and dialogue + horrible directing=GARBAGESheri Moon Zombie appeared in Tarantino/Rodriguez's Grindhouse. Also, Tobe Hooper's Toolbox Murders. Get your facts straight before you rack an actress.Now for the actual Rob Zombie's Halloween comment; I believe it was a well made film. While tracing back to the originals roots, it does not do it justice. But for the entertainment purposes of the film, it's good.It forces you to deal with language; forces you to watch a bunch of people get killed.But you people that just rack it as a horrible film, you need to watch it as a real film person. One who accepts it as a good movie.Because I can honestly say, none of you will ever make a good movie.",Halloween
1085,popapala-maca-jezik,Is Robbie boy avin' a laff?,6,9 September 2008,"Let's make things crystal clear right from the beginning: I gave Halloween The Remake(tm) a six because... Well... for one reason.OK, Make that two, sunny side up.Numero uno: Because the whole friggin' lot o'you gave it a one. While it can't hold a candle to the original, one wonders: What in the Nine divines were you expecting of a horror remake? For it to surpass the original? To outshine its gazillions of predecessors? To star Jamie Lee Curtis as a chirpy seventeenish-year-old and show off her knockers again? Strike that,breasts are quite abundant in the movie. Or perchance a Texas-hold'em remastered version of the original? I agreed with only ONE review, which said of the first thirty minutes were great. In my humble opinion, they were.The rest of the film is no better than the amassing hordes of slashers on which the shiny new policy of Hollywood resides. While it's Hollywood's fault they hire writers with an imagination of a Microsoft executive and actors with an average IQ of a walnut impersonating a watermelon in the remake of Thomas The Tank Engine,it was a wise decision of theirs to put foreign directors in play. But. I guess they had to do something with their domestic ones, so they put them in charge of horror remakes/sequels/prequels/Golden Girls.Rob Zombie seems to understand white trash. And he also seems to grasp the potential future and mental (in)stability of children living in broken families. It happens all the time all over the world, you see it on the news every day.I'm not saying that a child raised in a caring, loving, well-standing family wouldn't want to pick up a two-foot knife and go on a little killing spree for kicks, it's just they have no reason whatsoever to do so. Rob's Michael pretty much had.So sure, he's not a boogie-man anymore. Booo-flippity-hooo.I beg to differ if one of you would wholeheartedly stand up to a seven-foot mass murderer with no compassion at all and armed with a huge knife.What Zombie tried to do here was to put a myth into flesh. And did so in an OK way. If you want ghosts, watch Poltergeist. Or Casper the friendly ghost. Now that's scary.Imagine a ghost walking up to you with a see-through smile, whispering to you, like a possessive grandma, those horrendous words: ""Will you be my friend?"" Definitely trouser filling.I agree that Robbie's Halloween is not the best horror film of all time. In fact, it's quite average. He has a lot to improve on as a director and writer. But, was it the worst Halloween film? This was merely an attempt of an homage to a ghost with a mask, a character study as it were. Nothing more.And if you watch it from that point of view, you won't be disappointed. If you want a modern slasher that desperately wants to be old school, watch an Eli Roth film. Tarantino should be shot on sight for introducing an atrocity like him to the world.",Halloween
1086,omgnuhuho,seriously.. c'mon guys,7,6 October 2008,"i LIKE this movie, its honestly one of the best movies i've seen in a long time considering that most of the movies being released nowadays are completely unbearable to sit through. everyone is so caught up on the fact that its not like the original. its called a remake, not a re-release, which seems to be what the majority of you would have preferred or expected. if you want to see the original Halloween story, then watch the original Halloween movie. this is Rob Zombie's version of the movie, not ""oh hey lets redo EXACTLY what John Carpenter did, but do it with new people!"" no, i'm sorry, it wouldn't have worked because then you all would have complained about it ""lacking originality"" or some other crap like that.personally, i'm not a fan of Rob Zombie. i am however a fan of the original and this version of Halloween. and despite what everyone says about Michael Myers is supposed to be some soul-less monster, he's still a human and no one is actually born evil.not everyone is looking for a remade movie that's true to the original, some people just want to be entertained",Halloween

However, I was not at all a fan of the Psycho remake/re-shoot (because I can't remember it) or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake(s). Now, I was extremely skeptical about this movie when it was announced and saw the trailer. It just didn't look exciting. Well, it turned out to suck. I mean, it was just mean-spirited and nasty and unappealing. The characters were vile (except for Danny Trejo's janitor and Malcolm McDowell's Sam Loomis), the pre-murder stuff was worthless, the script is uselessly profane, the casting is (almost) terrible, and generally the movie just didn't feel fun.I liked The Devil's Rejects. It was nasty and violent, but I enjoyed myself. I did not see all of House of 1000 Corpses because it was so bad I couldn't keep watching. I like Rob Zombie. He seems like a cool dude. However, his movie sucked. Why? Of course, the above reasons play into it. The worst part, though, is that I liked some of the re-invented material, such as Michael's stay in the asylum and, later, his rampage across Haddonfield. Really, I just felt the movie had a lot of potential. I believe this is the type of movie that should be remade. They gave The Hulk and The Punisher restarts, so why not Halloween? Some major script rewrites and heavy recasting might just do the trick.",Halloween
1088,ad_willibums,Made a joke out of a classic,1,24 February 2009,"Every aspect of this film made a complete joke out of John Carpenters' original. First of all, their was no use for the amount of language they put in it. Ye we all know it's the norm but he went over the top big-time. They upped the gore and that didn't work, the only killing I did think was any good was Michael's step dad. And the ending the whole point of the original ending is to keep the audience wanting more,it was a superb ending. This just ruins it completely killing him off. The cast and the soundtrack were even worse. The only part of that film I moderately enjoyed was the beginning where you saw Michael as a young boy, sets the scene a bit and gives you some idea why he's the way he is. Overall give it a miss! And to top it off I've heard that Rob Zombie's making a sequel to this re-make as well.",Halloween

1090,MoveManAdam,"Some good visuals - but don't bother, just watch the original.",4,7 March 2009,"I've rated this movie 4 out of 10 but that's only because in parts it isn't too bad and actually makes a halfway decent effort at having the look and feel of the original.Overall it's pretty poor stuff.I actually think the cinematography is really good and I wasn't put off by the plot. I know that the demystifying of the Michael Myers character is a big problem for a lot of people but this didn't bother me and I thought the background and 'seeing it from the monsters point of view' actually made it interesting for me.Unfortunately that's where the positive stuff ends though, I'm sure there may be more 'plus points' but the biggest issue I have, and I just can't get past this gripe to focus on anything else, is the dialogue.For the record I haven't seen many other Rob Zombie films, I don't know if this is typical Zombie material but if it is then the guy seriously needs to get a new script-writer. One who isn't obsessed with the F word and trashy, foul-mouthed conversation.Bad language works in the right context, you have to have it otherwise certain situations would appear ludicrous and unrealistic. It doesn't work in this film, not when you're trying to remake a classic horror like Halloween.Zombie - get a grip! Nobody talks like this! It's not just the language, it's who speaks the lines and in what context!! Here's a clue for you ... Middle-aged, middle-class people don't have conversations that include vulgar references every other word. And neither, for that matter, do most teenagers. The scene that put the nail in the coffin for me was about a third of the way in where Laurie is talking to her parents in the kitchen. Her 'Dad' (who admittedly isn't her biological father, but does that even matter?? Jesus, if I adopt a girl at any stage I hope I don't ever make comments like this) actually comments on her having a cute ass, and this follows on from a conversation between Laurie and her Mother about how her teacher is a perve and wants to touch her tits and have sex with her - all expertly demonstrated to her Mother by Laurie and two ring donuts (seriously, I'm not making this up) that includes Laurie poking her finger through the donut and making groaning noises!The characters are annoying, lewd, over-stereotyped and boring. And this make you cheer Michael on as he slashes them to bits, at least then that's one less character 'F'-ing their way through clumsy script, but even if this is Zombie's intention he's achieved it by accident and for all the wrong reasons.I've developed a big problem with 'remakes' over recent years and this film really didn't help.PRO'S Cinematography Storyline (didn't appeal to everyone, I thought it was OK though)CON'S Script. Poorly written, under-developed characters Dialogue. (tedious, crude)COULD BE RESCUED BY: Remove 95% of the usage of the F word Remove 75% of the 'sexual' conversations Develop Laurie and her friends characters and make them likable (we shouldn't actively want them to die! Otherwise there's no fear there!)",Halloween

WTF! john never said Michael killed animals! third of all, Michael myers was bullied?? and killed the bully?? um I'm pretty sure Michael was never bullied in the old films, fourth of all, Michael myers kills people out of temper?? um no Michael actually kills people for no good reason at all, hes just a kid thats really messed up in the head, fifth of all, the actor that played Michael was 6'8 in 2007 version and the actor that played Michael in the 1978 version was only 6 ft tall but every horror directors do this (most directors would use actors that are around 6'3 to 6'5) but 6'8??? that is just crossing the line and just because you're big and tall that doesn't make a more dangerous and smarter killer, sixth of all, Michael myers has super-human strength?? um THIS IS NOT Friday THE 13TH!!! Michael Myers is physically normal but mentally sick, he is not retarded, he is not immortal and he doesn't have super-human strength in the older films, one of robs problems is that he is transforming Michael Myers into the new Jason Vorhees, seventh of all, Laurie seems like a nice girl, why would she wanna hang out someone that swears too many times and talks about sex numerous times, eighth of all, there is just too much sex and nudity in this film, there were barely sex/nudity in the old Halloween films and I'm going to say this one last time... THIS IS NOT Friday THE 13TH ROB!!!!!!! i just listed 8 things in this film that were terrible, 9 if u count me saying rob is making Michael Myers into the new Jason Vorhees, but even though this was a very bad remake, some scenes were kinda interesting to me because I'm still a teenager and i will always like the Halloween series, I'm just giving this film 4 out 10 to be generous",Halloween

1093,joel_armstrong86-1,Rob Zombie's White Trash Family Reunion,4,24 July 2009,"I'm a sucker for horror films. Especially if they have the right ingredients. My favourite? Take a few nubile college students, give them beer and weed, let them have unprotected sex, and then get slaughtered by an angry man in a hockey mask. Or a William Shatner mask. Whatever. Which brings us quite nicely to Halloween: The Rob Zombie edition.I caught the movie on the big screen. Was actually excited for it. (Kind of excited for the sequel, i sense a bad trend.) So what happened? Well the movie didn't bowl me over on the first viewing. In fact, I rather hated it. I couldn't understand why Rob Zombie felt the need to turn Michael Myers into himself. Was this supposed to be an autobiography? I didn't think so, i thought it was a remake of an acknowledged horror classic. Instead we get the story of an anti-social freak of a boy who has suffered through a white trash life and a terrible haircut.For this version of the film, Rob Zombie has decided to devote half the running time to the backstory of Micheal Myers. Not a bad idea, seeing as how we don't really need a shot-by-shot remake of the brilliant John Carpentar original. We're introduced to Michael's family, which includes an abusive booze soaked father, his stripper mom, and whoring sister, during a profanity laden breakfast scene. The only sympathetic character to any degree was Sherri Moon Zombie as little Mikey's mom. Sure she swears like a sailor, and doffs clothes for a living, but we get a sense that she loves her children. I should add by the way, that this has nothing to do with the original which hinted that Michael Myers had an average childhood in a middle income family. And a normal haircut, as well.Not surprisingly, the boy begins to act out. The first to feel his wrath is a school bully who gets more than he bargained for. This is probably the most effective scene of the movie. A brutal killing that we actually don't want to watch. The boy is beaten to death and we feel every bone crunch.Michael then moves on to make short work of the rest of his family, except Stripper Mom, who finds him after the massacre standing on the front porch, holding a dripping knife.Okay.The movie then turns to a psycho-drama and focuses on the mental institution years when Dr. Loomis tries to reach the boy. Dr. Loomis is played by that effective character actor Malcolm Mcdowell. It's as good a performance as the script will allow. (What is up with Rob Zombie's obsession with long hair? Even Dr. Loomis has lofty locks. Not every character has to resemble you, man!) Then finally, over halfway through the movie, do we get the material made famous in the original movie. All done in imitable Rob Zombie style. (Yes, I mean imitable.) My main problem with this section of the movie, is that there is no obvious change in style from the first half. Again we're introduced to a bunch of foul-mouthed, unsympathetic characters. Even Laurie Strode, supposedly the pure 'heroine', seemed rather unlikeable and white trash. Just because you're White trash, Rob Zombie, doesn't mean your characters have to be! So where am I going with this? Actually I don't know. He is a stylish director, and the last block moves pretty quickly through it's gruesome set pieces. There's a lot I admired about the film. But the bottom line is - it's not a halloween movie. It's Rob Zombie re-imagining his childhood as a horror movie. That might be cool, but it's an insult to the previous film and what it was trying to do. What was scary about Halloween was that there was no explanation for the madness, it just happened. Michael just decided to kill his sister one dark and unholy night...With all this backstory you get the feeling the whole nasty murder business could have been avoided if someone had just called the children's aid society and gotten that kid to a good barber.So this was my first attempt at a movie review. I know it's badly written, and I didn't make all the points I wanted to, but you have to start somewhere.",Halloween

At least, i'd say not entertaining at all except for the first 30 minutes or so when Michael played as a kid. That was the only part that i found interesting but after he grew up, the movie went boring and continued to be so till the end. All the other remakes that i've seen are 10 times the fun as compared to their originals and this is where Rob Zombie failed to deliver. For me, it was just an average or even below.

The first one had little blood, little language, etc. This one is full of the stuff that makes todays horror films popular.It revolves around who and how Michael became Michael. How he became so violent...I would say the first 40 minutes are of how and why he became who he did. The next 20 are his escape and finding his sister. The final 40 are of Loomis' chase, Myers killing, and Lori learning.I enjoyed the movie, as did my wife.

After seeing the film, It still amazes me at how caveman like this storyline is. The director, NEVER really got me to full understand why Mike Meyers was so compelled to kill his family and others, except the step dad was a jerk. Then again, I can see why the naked girls are killed as it feeds the demented male audience fantasy of seeing naked chicks being dominated by a male, beyond that I missed a real exam of how someone looses connection with reality and becomes psychopathic. OK, I forgot, I'm not to think in these films, ONLY the key I see is to connect with my primal CAVEMAN mind and enjoy it from that level. GOT IT!! So, simple a Caveman can enjoy it..",Halloween

1100,aprilleastephenson,Watch it.,7,17 October 2010,"The in depth look at HOW Michael Myers became The Shape made this movie worth watching. Michael is supposed to be completely unsympathetic so one is unable to relate to him in any respect. Michael is two people. Young Michael and The Shape. The Shape eats away at the young Michael until all that is left is a towering mass of killer. Seeing how and why such a process occurred is fascinating and realistic. Adding more dimensions to a villain/demonic character does not take away their ability to incite fear. On the contrary, it enhances it.The plethora of breasts in the film is simply a trademark of slasher flicks. The mixture of sex-crazed teenagers and glimpses into the lives of the dredges of society weren't added for mere shock value. At first, one wants to be sympathetic to Michael. He kills people who are awful. But when he begins to kill mothers and people who treated him with respect and understanding, it becomes apparent that he is actually an IT. Void of any human characteristic beyond the involuntary functions needed to survive.All in all, this movie was well done.

But against my instincts I went to see it with some friends to give it a chance. I wasn't expecting much, but oh my god was I was surprised.Rob Zombie takes you down a dark path into the mind of Michael Myers and attempts to explain why and how he became who he we all know he becomes. The story was believable and while the acting was lacking in certain areas, there were moments when that cold blank look from Michael Myers (young and old) had me feeling on edge. I was hesitant when I heard Zombie was going to make this a ""re-inventing"" of the classic. My philosophy is ""If its a classic, why remake it?"" But too be honest this one is competing with the 1978 version in my book. This one actually had me scared a bit a some scenes when you think, ""Wow this guys is creepy, and whats worse is there could be someone just like him out there..."" Thats what I like about this movie, Zombie made Michael Myers human, not some invincible entity like Jason or Freddy, not some ridiculous character killers like Chucky, but just a very strong, deranged human being...Overall I was very impressed with this movie. This movie will show you a semi-psychological profiling of Micahel Myers and how a little boy can turn into a psychopathic killer that we all love to fear...",Halloween

1104,emptywords6701,The most insulting horror remake yet.,1,1 September 2007,"Rob Zombie either has no understanding at all of the Michael Myers character, or he just doesn't care and wanted to cash in on all the dumb little mall rats who will flock to this movie and say ""d00d I totalie identifi wit Michael Myerzzzz.. He iz me!"" Let's revisit the original 1978 Halloween. The film presents us with a child who, for no apparent reason at all, stabs his sister to death. We are given the impression that up until this point, this was a normal kid from a nuclear family in a quite up-scale suburban neighborhood. We are given no motive, no warning, nothing. The kid simply... snapped. It was pure evil and nothing more that motivated Michael Myers, and the very idea was absolutely FRIGHTENING. The child never talks again. He spends fifteen years in a cell, staring at the wall, giving no sign of remorse, or even anger. He just sits, an empty shell, with nothing left inside but an evil just waiting to be triggered once again.And it finally does, the adult Michael Myers is triggered and escapes, and goes after his only remaining family member. Why? We still have no idea, and it's FRIGHTENING. Again, we're left with nothing but pure, unadulterated evil.Now let's also take a look at the character of Dr. Loomis. A man who spent years of his life trying to understand Myers, and was left with the same conclusion that we are brought to in the first five minutes of the movie. There is nothing there but evil. He understands this, and it destroys him to the very core. His entire world view is shattered, as his ambitions as a psychiatrist to help people and understand them and find humanity in the most hopeless cases are completely torn asunder. He becomes obsessed with the Myers case to the point that he tries to have Myers locked up forever (as well he should be).These themes are VITAL to what made the original Halloween such a brilliant film. Few movies have captured the feelings of evil, fear, doubt, hopelessness, and isolation so well, and few are ever likely to again.Okay, so now let's get to the Rob Zombie piece of garbage.It's like a slap in the face right from the beginning. The very first scene is a dead-on indicator that you are watching a PIECE. OF. GARBAGE. Everything that made the Myers character so frightening is almost immediately tossed out the window, as we find that Michael Myers is now a 10 year old mall rat kid from a white-trash family who has a stripper for a mom, an abusive alcoholic stepfather, and is bullied at school. Great. The angst-ridden teenager with the troubled childhood angle.So basically Michael Myers goes from a character that represents complete evil and lack of humanity, to a tortured psychiatric case gone awry.Add onto this the lesser (but still just as insulting) offense of Loomis' character. While I do love Malcolm McDowell, and his performance itself was very well done, the character was just plain wrong. One dead indicator of this is the idea that Loomis authored a book about Myers and went to colleges giving speeches about him. So basically Loomis was using the story of Myers as a cash-cow (shades of Zombie himself?!). Despite this, Loomis still displays a certain degree of sympathy and regret at having ""failed"" Michael. Again, wrong. This destroys the ideas of hatred and hopelessness that were so important to the Myers/Loomis relationship in the original.Honestly, I thought that of all people, a person like Rob Zombie who was always professed an undying love of horror movies would have understood that it was these ideas that made the 1978 Halloween work so well. Instead, he took a gigantic crap on it.What Zombie quite obviously lacks is the ability to write a film where much of the story is left to the viewer to decipher for themselves. Again, in the original, none of the back story is presented to us, and we know nothing of what happens between the first murder, and Michael's escape fifteen years later. We are meant to draw conclusions from the subtext of the film, from the actors' performances, from the dialogue, and even from our own psyches. It's brilliant film-making, and it works. The film has not aged at all because of it.Now, because of Zombie's inability to write such a script, he was forced to put everything right out in front, with no ambiguity at all. Unfortunately, his idea of Michael Myers was a disturbed white trash kid who grows up to be... what looks like the guitarist of Slipknot.This film had mall rat cash cow written all over it.DO NOT SEE THE HALLOWEEN REMAKE.",Halloween
1105,atrocityschild,Just a bad film....,1,30 August 2007,"I wish that I could find the words to describe how bad this film is. I really did try to get behind it, despite how much I hate remakes. I was let down. Hard.I won't say that it was the directing. I think that was OK. It was a very good looking film. But the script and the acting (or lack there of) really did this flick in. It could have been great, but Rob Zombie didn't just make a bad film, he made a film that actually takes away from the original. Why? Because the younger generation will See this film and think it's great. They really have nothing better to compare it to. All that will do is help more bad remake ideas become a reality. Also, every time i see the original I'm reminded of how bad this film really is.Don't bother seeing it if you are a true horror fan. It will only let you down.",Halloween

Michael Myers never did come from white trash nor was he ever a street-roaming wrestler.",Halloween
1107,pynerfamily,A good film in its own right!!,8,9 September 2007,"This film works a bit like a prequel, and is well made and interesting as such, but by over explaining what happened in Myer's childhood, his character loses most of its dark mysticism, and becomes less scary in the process. If the original had never been made, i would have loved this film, But being a huge fan of the original i can't help feeling that this movie has tainted the original, rather than enhancing it.The one thing this film does have in common with the original is the fact, that in both cases i ended up feeling sorry for Michael, but to an even larger extent in this movie, because of the way that guided through his child years. In the original there seemed to be a superhuman aura around Michael, which made him impossible to stop, the new Michael feels altogether more human, and comes across as a psychopath rather than a man possessed by real evil.",Halloween
1108,fire_bat777,House of Rejects on Halloween,5,2 September 2007,"I believe the summary line says it all. This isn't a reinvisioning as much as it is a mismash of different horror movies rolled into one film.I went into this film with great optimism. I was always hoping (with extreme optimism) that nobody would ever try to remake/recreate Halloween. When I heard Rob Zombie was taking the helm I was quite happy. I enjoyed The Devil's Rejects greatly and was hoping that Rob Zombie could do the original justice. Boy, was I wrong.The beginning of the film starts out very nicely. The atmosphere and mood was spot on. The acting on young Michael's part was wonderful. Daeg Faerch plays the part to a T. There is a gruesome scene that really got to me. That, to me, is the essence of good directing. I really felt dirty watching what was happening on the screen. I became very optimistic at this point.Young Michael's time at Smith's Grove was insightful and interesting. Malcolm McDowll really plays the part of the caring, helpful psychologist well here.Adult Michael's time in Smith's Grove was pure torture. Malcolm McDowell was absolutely awful at this point. I'm not sure if it was the acting, the writing, or a combination of the two. I wasn't comparing MM to Donald Pleasance. I was seeing if MM could make me feel like Dr Loomis cared for Michael. He seemed, at first, to really be a good person. Suddenly, he flips to not caring at all. This is where the movie goes downhill.Rob Zombie's adult Michael Myers just isn't scary. The MM in this film reminds me of Tiny from HOTC and TDR. There is nothing abnormal about being scared of a seven foot tall gigantic person. It is the everyday, normal looking homicidal maniac that scares the hell out of people.Enter the babysitters. In the original, you got to know Laurie, Annie, and Lynda. You felt for them. You knew what they were like. You really could tell they were the girls next door. It makes caring for them much easier. In this film, you generally can't like them. They all act like complete sluts. You meet them for a few minutes, you don't care what happens to them because they're not very nice and generally THEY CAN'T ACT.The entire second half seems rushed. The final ""chase"" is dragged out to the point of agony. Nothing about Michael is scary anymore because his childhood sets up sympathy for the main antagonist which is suicide on the big screen. In The Devil's Rejects you were supposed to be rooting for the antihero. In Halloween, you're supposed to be rooting for Loomis and Laurie.The whole movie just seems to suffer from poor dialog and seems to be rushed. I was happy with the first half of the film, but once adult Michael enters the picture, it is pretty much downhill.The ending has to be the most upsetting thing I've ever seen. Fans of the original will be furious with the ending of RZ's Halloween. All and all, it didn't totally fail, but it was a far from perfect film.",Halloween
1109,Wingfoot0701,EXCELLENT Horror,10,4 September 2007,"In a year where we are treated to boring, PG-13 films with un-scary CGI werewolves and loud noises, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" comes as a, um, pleasant treat and return to what a real horror movie should look like.What does real horror need? How about blood, gore, boobs, sex, and vulgar language. Throw in a few scares and shocking scenes, and you've got Zombie's film. I applaud him for not being scared to make a harsh and down-to-earth film.Is at as scary as the original? Probably not. But it's a different type of ""scare"" that gets you. It's the brutal, shocking scenes that make it hard to watch.Most folk are writing this off just because it is a remake. Yes I agree Hollywood is hard-up for originality these days. However the Halloween franchise was in desperate need of new life. Another pointless sequel would have horrible (just look at the old Batman franchise). A reboot was the way to go, and Zombie was the perfect director to pull it off. Just like a good band that covers a good, classic tune, Zombie gives it a fresh spin that is familiar and new at the same time.Rob Zombie is probably the best horror director out there right now. I hope he keeps it up.",Halloween
1110,throw_aways,Considerably worse than I thought it would be...,2,24 November 2007,"I really really respect the original Halloween film, but I have to admit it is slightly dated and a bit too slow for my tastes (even though I love psychological thrillers that take time to develop). So when I found out about this remake, I thought ""it probably won't be any good, but maybe the original could use a little modern-day intensity. This could be worth watching, even if just for nostalgia""Man, was I wrong. This movie was horrible. I'm only giving it two stars because the first third of the movie was almost good, in a way. Many people have said all the flaws with this movie, so I will just address the main on I haven't seen anyone say: The blood and sex scenes weren't even good!!! I am not a fan of overuse of blood and sex in horror movies, but when they are used, they certainly have their place. The Saw movies, for instance, use blood and gore very well. I don't love those movies, but they truly use gore in a way that enhances the movies. This movie threw red liquid around like it was water, but it didn't once give me the gut wrenching feeling that I had almost the entire way through Saw. Same with the sex scenes. These people had very boring sex for having libidos so high. Not that horror films are known for tasteful use of sex, but there was nothing stimulating about the scenes at all.Other than that, all the other 1 star reviews were pretty right on. No character development, no continuity in the plot, no good scares, no suspense, etc etc etc. I thought the back story COULD have helped if done correctly, but it didn't aid a thing.I can't believe this movie has a 6 on this website. Generally IMDb is the most helpful place for me to look at star ratings. Their top 250 films list resembles mine. But a 6 star average is insane. I can't comprehend anyone giving this movie better than 5 stars on any level.It fails at suspense, horror, character development and writing. If you're looking for a horror movie with those, watch a true classic. IT FAILS AT GORE, BLOOD AND SEX!!! If you want that, watch Hostel. It fails at being even a decent remake. (Though I don't know what to recommend if you want that...)",Halloween
1111,crl-277-415187,Enjoyable Remake,8,10 November 2014,"I think that Rob Zombie took the original bones of ""Halloween"" and stitched his ever unique twisted interpretive flesh to it. Micheal's back story and psyche had greater depth. You see Michael as a kid who grew up lacking responsibility, Guidance, and Family Support. He was forgotten about, abandoned, abused, and mistreated by family and others. After the anger inside Micheal's grew, he acted out by torturing animals, and creating/drawing disturbing Pictures. Finally, he became vengeful and violence which was the manifestation of his amount of rage.After he kills his family and is put in the asylum, You begin to see the destruction of all good parts he has left. Bit by bit he is stripped of every pleasure he once had, and becomes the Michael Myers we all fear and love. There is one small thing that bothered me though. I didn't like all the unnecessary whiny screaming that this (2007)""Laurie Strode"" did, but not a deal breaker. This was a good movie. Go see it.",Halloween
1112,emeryldlebeau,A disagreement,9,7 May 2009,"Being a child of the first film, I can honestly say I thanked Zombie for this film. Kids now days are so desensitized to what real fear is. I am a fan of the complete collection, but where the original sent me to the hospital and over 25 years of therapy, Zombie was able to give me peace and made the remake more understanding than Carpenter's original. Most kids now days have no idea just how terrifying Halloween was to those of us who are that generation. Meyers was the bogyman to us. He was the first movie monster that didn't die and to an 11 year old, who lived watching Creature Feature on Saturdays, this was a complete shock. On the big screen, in your mind, you saw him and everything he did and he saw you. There was no dead body on the ground at the end so in your mind, you were next. He was coming for you. Zombie's version gave us meaning, a reason for Michael to have done what he did. Gave us something to hold on to. On it's own, it could stand with out sequels, yet makes a sequel possible. To a person from that decade, from 1978, it was substance, something to rationalize. Does it make the original bad? NO. The original is simply that, original. It was the dawn of what was to come, it opened doors for more Michael, Jason, Freddy and every slasher that fallowed. But you have to remember, it led us to what Zombie has done as a director. I did not see House of a 1000 Corpses or Devil's Rejects in Halloween. I saw Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and counted it one of the best in my personal collection. I can hardly wait for H2 so I can add it as well. I place it in my Halloween collection, it's anthology so to speak, as a new beginning, not a simple remake. Had it come out before Carpenter's, had it been the first, I don't think I would have needed therapy. Though it had help from two very mean teenagers who tied me and gagged me in the theater. Back when a movie was shown 3 times before the theater was cleaned out, but, it had impact and I found I was not alone in my fear. I guess it says simply that in my generation, we feared the dark because of movies, not because of real life violence. As for Zombie's Halloween, I give him props for making it more realistic for this generation and more understanding for mine.Thank you.",Halloween
1113,randomoldpeople,A brutal re imagining,6,25 February 2009,"A lot of people dislike this film solely based on the fact that they are die-hard fans of the original and nothing was ever going to be able to match it. Therefore you get a lot of people saying this is a bad film and taking cheap shots at Rob Zombie. A lot of individuals fail to grasp the fact that this is more of a re imagining than a remake. It takes the characters and original plot and improves upon on it.This is a much more brutal and fast paced version of the original. In many ways it is a completely different film from the first. The original relied more on what you didn't know, and a slow ominous pace that built up into vicious killings. While the original remains a classic and legend among horror films, the new film, in my opinion, is just more fun to watch.Since the first half of the film examines Michaels childhood, it condenses the material from the first film down dramatically, therefore making it all move a lot faster. The new Halloween can't be described as more than a fast paced, brutal, fun movie. If you want to be scared watch the first film, if you want to be entertained watch Rob Zombies Halloween.",Halloween

Once again, this is its own movie.It delivered scares and was very original. I had no problem with them adding in the back story.... just felt they spent too much time on it.I enjoyed the film and will be looking for it on DVD when it arrives.

1115,xc_silversight,"Excellent remake, realistic display of what makes a serial killer",9,31 August 2007,"Okay, so you may be thinking that Rob Zombie's films are all about gore and disgusting lifestyles and such, but what a perfect way to explain the twisted up-bringing of the unstoppable Michael Myers! First off, for those parents out there wondering if this is suitable for a kid below 15, the answer is no! There's violence (obviously), sexual content, nudity, incredibly profane language and it's very mature subject matter.I, myself, was never that much of a fan of Rob Zombies movies, I found them cliché and over the top. However, I'm a huge fan of the Halloween series, except for Halloween 3 which SUCKED. Anyhow, I was really pleasantly surprised at his work in this movie. The original Halloween was incredibly well done; however, it did leave many holes to be filled, and Rob Zombie definitely fills them. After 9 different movies regarding a serial killer that doesn't stop killing, you'd obviously be wondering what would cause him to begin a killing spree every Halloween. Rob Zombie's characterization of an all-around abusive household was more than well-done, it was realistic, shocking and unnerving. People may say that this is just another one of Zombie's attempts to show that America is just a gargantuan population of white trash alcoholics, but how else is he going to explain what made Michael Myers go over the edge? The film is set up in two halves; the first half is an explanation (as you might have guessed) and the second is Zombie's depiction of what happened in Haddonfield, Illinois on Halloween 1978, to Michael's sister, his main target, Laurie Strode (a.k.a: Laurie Myers). If you are looking for a incredibly horrifying flick to watch, I'm not going to say you're going to pee your pants, but I am going to say that even if you end up not finding it scary, you will find it fascinating, and if you are a die-hard fan of the Halloween films, like myself, it will give you an exquisite refreshment of Michael Myers and his psychopathic tendencies on All Hallows Eve.If you haven't seen the original 1978 version of the film, it's not that big of a deal. It wouldn't hurt to see John Carpenter's version, but you will still understand and enjoy this remake. For those of you who have watched the original, or decide to before you see Rob Zombie's version, please understand that this is not identical to the original.I know that on this site there are many negative comments and critique regarding this film, BUT coming from someone who didn't like Rob Zombie movies before, and is a huge fan of the Halloween series and would never want to see these classics end up being followed by some ludicrous flop, I;m poretty sure you can trust me. I may be wrong, and some people enjoy movies others don't, but I'd advise you to take the chance, even if you just rent it. If on Halloween you are home giving out candy and you want to get yourself in the spirit, light your jack'o'lantern, stick the DVD in and sit back and give it a chance.To sum it up, this film will put you in the Halloween spirit, bring you back to classic serial killer films that aren't as Hollywood as they are these days, and, most importantly of all, will make you think before you agree to babysitting on Halloween. You never know, you could be adopted from a broken family, with one member who just... can't...stop...killing....Trick or Treat!",Halloween
1116,coughlinryan,i do like rob zombie and his previous collection...not this time,4,16 December 2007,"I can appreciate what Rob added to this film...his style. He's Rob Zombie and he made a Rob Zombie film. 3 times out of 4 I'm going to like the product. However, with Halloween, it was the other 1 out of 4. I didn't want to empathize with Michael. I didn't want to know that a bad-acting drunk (no offense William) ruined his childhood. Overall, this film lacked the depth and eerie scare tactics that are so perfectly imprinted onto my brain. The original Michael scared me. This Michael doesn't. I could flesh out another set of reasons, but bottom line, that's all it came down to. I wanted to be lost in the lack of reasoning, which truly is a scary thing (people who kill with no remorse and for no reason). Rob gave me reason to understand Michael. I was one of the fans that enjoyed wondering 'why?' while knowing we weren't going to get an answer. Compounding my lack of appreciation, the reason for Michael wanting to come back and kill his sister didn't add up. That's one of the most beautiful thing of simply naming someone the ""devil"" a ""mad killer"", etc...you don't have to explain to the audience anything. Done right, it's more scary than knowing what troubled a young boy's mind. In the original, that creepy ass little Michael just ran up into the room and hacked at his sister. He fell into the black hole of evil, never to return. No background given -- now that's freaky! My opinion, thumbs down.",Halloween
1117,SHLaw,a horrifying blow to a once terrifying story,1,2 September 2007,"When I first heard that Rob Zombie was remaking the original Halloween I was more surprised then anything. I didn't know too much about Rob Zombie, but I did think that remaking the film wasn't the best choice. my thought was that if they did want to remake it then first they should do a FINAL Halloween sequel to finish off the Halloween series and finally give it an end, then film a remake for October 2008 (the 30th anniversary) but instead we get a rushed written script, rushed filming and production and a back story to a once terrifying character that proved to be overdone and drawn out. I could not believe how poor the dialog was, it was if the director believed that use of poor language was necessary in making a successful movie. the movie opens in a such a way that anyone who has seen the original will say that it does not fit the story. Michael's family is just pure white trash, what's the point of that. all the death scenes contained way too much gore, and every girl that was killed, had to be done while having sex and nude. a lot of the characters that we're killed, had no point to be killed. the second half of the film was completely rushed we didn't get to see much of the other characters. Scout-Taylor Compton is a gifted actress, but the script gave her no acceptable lines or enough screen time. the placement of carpenter's music does not fit at all. being the fan of Halloween that i am, i could not wait for the movie to be over. if a sequel is made to this movie i only hope that rob zombie is not asked to write or direct it. this movie makes Halloween resurrection look like a masterpiece, that should explain it all.",Halloween
1118,pridewalker666,Zombie...what have you done?,5,4 September 2007,"Rob Zombie has said in interviews that he wanted to make Michael Myers frightening again. He also said that he 'got' the original. He was, to put it bluntly, wrong on both counts.I was 6 when I saw the infamous 'closet scene' from the original Halloween, on Siskel and Ebert's Sneak Previews (Ebert was on his 'new horror movies are exploitation kick). It, quite literally, scared me to no end. To this day, the original Shape and that eerie 3 note theme send chills down my spine.After seeing the trailers for RZ's re-imagining, I was kind of looking forward to this. I should have known better.By giving Michael a backstory of abuse and white trash living, the horror of his first murder loses quite a bit. The thing that made the original murder so terrifying is that it was senseless. Michael grew up in a fairly ordinary, suburban home, and he snapped...without cause. Instead, the terror is taken away, and replaced with an attempt at making Michael almost sympathetic. And this is only the beginning of the problems.Malcolm McDowell is probably the only person fit to fill Donald Pleasance's shoes, as Dr. Loomis. It's too bad that they wrote the character off as a pop psychologist, more concerned with making a buck on his book; instead of as a man who has fought for years to isolate Myer's as the evil creature that he is. Pleasance was a man who stared into the eyes of evil, and was humbled by it. McDowell's take was seriously lacking (I'm inclined to put the blame on the writing, not the actor's talent).On a side note: If it's obvious that Myer's masks are what he uses to manifest his 'evil' side (and as the character says...his secrets), why was he allowed to make them for over 10 years, while in the looney bin? Isn't that a little...counterproductive? The first 2 acts were an attempt to make the viewer understand the motive for the 3rd act. They fail.The final act is a rushed attempt at homage. There is no tension to the stalking of the 3 girls. Gone are the creepy, ""he's there, he's gone"" moments. The suspense of Michael following the 3 girls methodically, is nowhere to be seen. There are no moments where the mask is the only thing visible in the darkness. There is no hunt, by Michael, this time around...the subtlety is gone. Instead, we're given yet a third movie of 'murder porn' from RZ and company.There are more than a few plot holes that Rob fails to even consider addressing (and to be honest, they are the same one's that show up in the first) How does Michael find Laurie so easily? How does a person, locked up as a catatonic suddenly develop the abilities and strength that he has? Ironically, these questions only add to the original, while being detrimental to the remake (since we're given a more 'human' killer).The original worked because of a very deliberate, slow pace; while the question 'why?' is never answered. We're shown evil at work. The unknown things are what make it work, even to this day. By connecting the dots, Rob Zombie has made a film that, while brutal to look at, fails to deliver, in any way other than visceral.",Halloween

Truthfully, after watching Zombie's 'revision' and then watching the classic I was left feeling a little empty and wanting more of the story that Zombie put into his Halloween; and this from an avid Halloween fan who has seen every installment of Halloween several times and has seen the classic roughly a hundred times.

It really looks like someone with a lot of money decided to make a YouTube video project. In that vain, it's outstanding. For a major motion picture that reboots one of the greatest movies of all-time, it's truly a joke. Well, I'm being very kind to him. This is truly something that most critics would probably rip to absolute pieces. There's nothing about this movie that makes it worth seeing. If there was no original, this movie would be in the garbage. Even the Loomis character can't save it. Even his music is terrible, just as an aside. Hate to say it but it is.

1122,kforrestbaldwin1,Rob Zombie destroys a horror icon... and gets a sequel.,3,16 February 2013,"I watched this movie today in the morning, the unrated director's cut, to be exact, and I was utterly angered. Reading the 2nd review made about this, I noticed that they said that this film is enjoyable as a film and not a remake. I can safely discredit that to a sick mind. I know that it's been at least 5 or 6 years by now, but I'm a bit Nostalgia Critic-y in mindset, so I just like to talk about it. This movie bored me to tears. I didn't even flinch at the jump scares. I thought that the rape scene while Michael escaped was pure shock horror, not realistic at all, and that angers me. One thing that I dislike about Rob Zombie is that he feels that sick, twisted things happening in a realistic setting become realistic and thus scary, but it's not. All of the things that happen in this movie, from young Michael beating the bully to death with a stick to tying up his snoring father with duct tape even though (because there was a strand over his mouth) it would obviously wake him up and slitting his throat, right down to the fact that adult Michael can take a stab to the chest and 6 gunshot wounds without dying make this movie about as scary as waving a flashlight over your face and going OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!! Whatever, I could buy that if the story is told well, and if the characters have good characterization and likable personalities. Well, whoop-de-doo, these characters are as likable as Lisa from The Room, and maybe even less so. Even Laurie, the do-good surviving virgin, has the serious need to be stabbed repeatedly in the chest. Her first ten seconds of screen time introduce her by having her say a so-called 'joke' about being sexually molested that was so confusing and out of nowhere that I actually rewound the DVD to make sure that I didn't miss the reason for this bewildering exchange! But nope, she's just a sick f***. Even Michael Myers isn't done right. They try to explain a new, complex reason for his obsession with Laurie, but it doesn't make sense! OK, let's break it down. He loved both his mother and Boo, who grew up to be Laurie, but hated his older sister and father so he killed them. He goes back to Haddonfield presumably to reunite with Laurie, although this is never explained fully because he hasn't talked for fifteen years. His love for his sister is fully illustrated when, taking her to his lair, he takes off his mask and sits silently, trying desperately to get her to understand their connection. Although he later attacks her, she stabbed him in the chest and he's a psychopath, he just thinks that it can't work anymore! But he did love her, and maybe still does (keep in mind I haven't seen the sequel.) However, earlier he goes to his house and brutally beats his mother before breaking her neck. WHAT?!?!?!?!?! This is the woman that visited him in the mental hospital constantly, the only one that he had any like for before his mental break? So why is he killing her brutally, even more so than Linda, the slut? You could say that he didn't recognize her, but that doesn't make sense, because he can easily recognize Laurie despite the last time that he saw her being when she was less than a year old. WAIT A SECOND! I JUST REALIZED! SERIOUSLY, I JUST REALIZED! Laurie is still in high school, but Michael has been in the mental hospital for twenty years! What, is she just a really bad student? Well, that wouldn't make sense because she seems to be the brains of her trio of friends! Even Michael's motivations for killing don't make sense, but I don't mean about Laurie. She brutally kills Linda and her boyfriend, Bob, for no reason but to kill them. They weren't in his way at all, he just killed them with no remorse. But when he comes across Annie and Paul f***ing, he murders Paul but just leaves Annie bloodied and topless at the bottom of the staircase! Even more so, when he comes back to get Laurie once they've discovered Annie, the girl starts screaming for our heroine, alerting her! Yet Michael doesn't even silence her, let alone kill her! WHAT THE S**TF**K?! But, I'm seriously going off on a tangent here. Overall, this movie was horribly acted, excessively and sometimes laughably bloody, introduced a way too invincible killer that becomes sort of comedic, has huge plot holes and unrealistic writing, and has the one fatal flaw that a straight-up horror movie can EVER have: IT'S NOT SCARY! Bottom line, don't watch it. EVER!",Halloween
1123,TKern1,Great Remake!,8,25 November 2012,"In the famous remake of Halloween (2007), director Rob Zombie introduces Michael Myers' (Daeg Faerch) childhood. He grows up in a dysfunctional family that consists of his promiscuous sister (Hanna Hall), his sweet, innocent baby sister, his stripper mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), and her trashy boyfriend. Michael is bullied growing up by his father-like figure and his peers at school. As a hobby, Michael tortures and kills animals. His school discovers that he has psychological problems, but it is too late. On Halloween night his sister is supposed to take him trick-or-treating because his mom has to work and his father does not care about him. However, Judith is too involved with her boyfriend to even consider taking him out. Michael kills everyone in the house at the time with the exception of his baby sister. When his mother returns home the police are involved and Michael is sent to an asylum under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). Fifteen years later, Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) escapes from the asylum to go back to Haddonfield, Illinois to find his baby sister, Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton). On his journey, he kills anybody who gets in his way. After stalking Laurie, Michael attempts to kill her. However, he fails to do so when Laurie shoots him in the head and kills him.Michael Myers'appearance is extremely intimidating, even as a child. Ever since he was little, he would wear masks to hide his face.Michael's use of masks shows that he is a disturbed little boy because he does not want people to see his face. As Michael grows older his appearance becomes even more intimidating.Michael Myers is a monster. He contains many monster-like qualities. For instance, his appearance exemplifies his monstrous abilities. He is much bigger than the average male. He is capable of killing many people because of his super strength, making him capable of destroying anything that comes in his path. He has the ability of destroying property using only his body strength and he is capable of breaking out of chains. Michael Myers proves that he is indeed superhuman. He finds his baby sister without even knowing what she looks like.In Halloween (2007), we notice that there are psychological problems within Michael as a child through his actions. It is abnormal that Michael tortures and kills his pets for fun. He also kills his family because of his issues as well as a school bully. Michael Myers scares the audience with the help of special effects. One feature that this movie has is the Michael Myers theme song. When this music plays, the audience knows that something awful is bound to happen. This movie has many bloody scenes because of murders. Michael Myers brutally kills people and he utilizes a variety of weapons, including his bare hands. These scenes are gruesome and frightening, causing its audience to look away. This horror film shows a mentally disturbed child and the effects his illness has on him. Michael Myers is a monster. This film brings a whole new aspect to the horror genre. It not only combines psychological illnesses and monsters, but it also contains suspenseful music and gore. The audience loves this because it makes the movie frightening. Halloween (2007) truly is petrifying because it portrays the possibilities of what could happen if a child or even an adult is mentally ill. It shows the horrors of the family and the effects that a dysfunctional family has on a child. This movie is all around a great remake.",Halloween
1124,pauloalmeidda,"It wasn't as good as it could be, but it's not that bad either!",7,25 December 2012,"Just watched the movie at my place on the Blu-ray UNRATED release, and it was good. I have read so many bad reviews to this movie, so I was more afraid of wasting my time than any other thing! But at the end was a really good movie, very entertaining! Not a MUST WATCH, but it is a good tribute to the original version of the movie if you're a fan. I don't think that Zombie did a bad job, and the whole introduction was really deep into Michael Myers' past! Maybe people shouldn't compare both versions and just watch it as a whole new story. The cast is really good, and Scout Taylor-Compton really shines on her interpretation of Laurie (not as good as the young Jamie Lee Curtis, but, as I said, do not compare). Good enough to make me really forget about the old one while watching. I didn't watch the sequel yet, but it's on my watchlist! Overall, I wanna say that remakes shouldn't be taken as replacements to the classic ones, but as a simple tribute to what the movie really means: Michael Myers still lives!",Halloween
1125,mplshawkfan,An insult to the original film and the viewer's intelligence,1,16 July 2008,"I am about as big a fan of the original Halloween as you would ever find and although I am not a fan of remakes (especially remakes of movies that are barely 25 years old), I tried to approach this with an open mind. After all, it IS a Halloween movie, right? Boy was I in for a letdown.In all honesty, this is one of the worst pieces of $hit I have ever seen. Absolutely horrible from start to finish, with none of the suspense, pacing, scares or subtleties of the original. Seriously, what was Zombie thinking? I thought this guy was supposed to have a fresh take on the Myers story, but instead we get a dumbed-down rehash with over-the-top and quite frankly, unnecessary, violence. Mix in his usual cast of idiotic redneck characters from the other pieces of crap movies he made before getting his mitts on Halloween and you have an unwatchable movie.The storyline is pathetic, with Zombie unwisely deciding to develop Michael Myers' background by showing his abusive childhood and fragmented home. In doing this, Zombie removes a key element of the original movie and main protagonist. We don't WANT to know what makes the boogeyman tick! That is what made him so frightening  and it's also what makes the character so powerful. You don't really know why he is chasing you and the audience doesn't know either, but you better get out of the way because he is coming and he ain't gonna stop. His motivations, or lack thereof, are not important to the plot, at least in the original movie which was conceived as a stand-alone effort.Clearly Zombie doesn't get it, or more likely doesn't care. He was handed a treasured and much-loved franchise and made it into a boring and generic slasher movie of the worst kind.",Halloween
1126,Chynita,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,1,2 September 2007,"I have never walked out of a movie in my life, but I walked out of this one. I love the original Halloween movies. I tried to give the new one a chance. I hoped it would be good. Alas, it was horrible. The acting sucked, the scary parts weren't scary. People were actually laughing at it. The opening of the movie took 30 minutes to say what they said in about 5 or 10 minutes of the original. I don't need to know why Michael is the way he is. Part of the scary factor in the original is that there was no reason behind the madness. He's just pure evil. I agree this movie never should have been made, and Rob Zombie could learn a thing or two from John Carpenter.If you want to fall asleep watching a bunch of idiotic girls showing their breasts, and listening to dialogue that would put drunken sailors to shame, then watch this movie. Otherwise, trust me, and don't waste your money.",Halloween
1127,grantkimm,Too many 'corpses' cronies for my taste,8,2 September 2007,"I enjoyed this movie for what it was worth. A lot of cameos from Zombie's former cast in Corpses and Rejects, about 8 or 9 by my count. It is hard to take something seriously when you feel like you are watching a student film that uses the same actors in every movie. Once you get beyond that part of it, it was pretty enjoyable.A slight twist on an old classic. I enjoyed the rawness of Michael as a character and the gore was definitely abundant. Going into the movie I was pessimistic about a remake of Halloween, but it was almost a completely different movie than the original. I would recommend it to all horror fans who love Michael Myers and blood.",Halloween
1128,ringer7,A Gory Bastardization of a Horror Classic,1,31 August 2007,"The basic problem with Rob Zombie's remake of the classic horror flick Halloween comes from its purpose. The only reason he should have even considered attempting such a feat is if he seriously felt he could service the film by giving it an update and improving some of its shortcomings that result from the tests of time. Sadly, Zombie not only does nothing to improve the film, he hacks and slashes away all of the mystique the original had and rips open brand new gory, messy, and pointless holes throughout.The character of Michael Myers in the original film came from a fairly well-to-do suburban family, yet inexplicably turned out a rotten, merciless killing machine. It is pretty essential to Michael's ""Boogeyman"" persona that he appear as something almost supernatural, and certainly nothing the audience could ever sympathize with. Yet Zombie drags a newly fashioned back-story out for half of the movie, trying to give reasons for why Myers does what he does, stomping all over the mystery that surrounded the original character and struck fear into all members of the audience. It is also a major part of the character of Dr. Loomis that Michael be the impossible case study, one that even the most accomplished psychologist couldn't comprehend. Instead, Zombie (in typical fashion of his God-awful career) makes Michael the product of a run-down, white trash environment. Any movie-goer would find it difficult to not laugh at the ridiculous caricatures Michael's family members portray, if they were not already bored to death by Zombie's fetish with white trash, and his predictability as a director.Zombie saw it fit to remove almost all of the classic scenes that made the original so memorable and replace them with blood-strewn bodies of naked women at every turn. I'm not sure who exactly thinks ""porn + gore = horror"", but I'll tell you that there is a major difference between a creepy, mysterious mask-wearing man chasing after a scared babysitter and popping out from behind every corner and one bashing in someone's head with a baseball bat repeatedly to no one's amusement. It's fine if some people in the world enjoy goriness every once in awhile, it's not fine if Hollywood directors begin to confuse this with horror. Repeated sadistic killings are not what scares an audience, they're what sickens them. Mystery, suspense, and the creepy aura of the unknown are what make up a good horror film, and the original Halloween is THE classic example of this. Also, as a side-note but something that needs to be mentioned, who the hell talks like Laurie and her two friends in this film? These three girls, the blonde friend in particular, converse as if high schoolers find it extremely cool to drop the f-bomb every other word and sound as annoyingly immature as possible. The entirety of the dialogue written for their parts suggests no one involved in the making of this film has any idea what teenage girls talk like, so one of them decided to make it up and make them all look like total fools. I had already given up on the film by this point, but it seriously made me and everyone I came with kind of concerned that a film could get all of the way through the editing process and into theaters with such odd dialogue that would actually cause us to look at each other with quizzical faces.My one piece of advice to moviegoers everywhere is, instead of putting more of your hard-earned money into the pocket of a hack director like Zombie and fueling the fire of awful modern horror films and terrible remakes, stay at home, dim the lights, and watch the original classic to remind yourself of just what makes a horror movie tick, just how great movies of that genre once were, and just what it feels like to truly be scared - heck, that's exactly what I'm going to do to try and push this steaming pile out of my memory. It's bad when a horror movie comes out that's filled with lots of cheap gore, overused expletives, and pointless nudity, it's far worse when it's done as a remake of a classic. The only people this film will strike horror into the hearts of is fans of the original, and sadly this is not the type of horror they paid to see - they, like myself, will be absolutely horrified at just how bad the abomination of a remake that is Rob Zombie's Halloween truly is.",Halloween
1129,EVPinKC,pretty good flick,8,22 December 2007,"Slight potential spoiler First off this movie is a Rob Zombie film. If you've seen any of the other movies he's made you know that it'll have at least two of the following: over the top cursing, violence, and sex. I've seen some reviews from people who thought there was too much cussing or violence. My only complaint was .... how could a stripper afford so much of a house (as well as a pool in the backyard). I mean don't get me wrong ... I'm sure she was a great stripper and all, but how could a single mother of 2 children afford such a house (and a pool)? I definitely recommend the Unrated 2-Disc set that has been released. The deleted scenes and bloopers are great.",Halloween

I never seem to learn my lesson when it comes to Rob Zombie. Every movie the man has made has been awful and his remake of Halloween is his worst film yet.Zombie has taken everything holy and original about the 78 film and flushed it down the toilet. I don't understand why he feels the need to humanize killers like Michael Myers. He pulled the same garbage with the family of psychos in The Devil's Rejects. I do not want to sympathize with killers and I don't need their back story, I just want to be scared which is not an option in any of Zombie's movies.Pros: None come to mind, naked ladies? Cons: Acting, Dialogue, Back story, completely losing every aspect of the 78 film that made it a classic of the genre and ROB ZOMBIE's ""direction"" Bottom Line: Don't waste your time, buy the original on DVD.",Halloween
1131,jayanxiety,"Hey, I loved it, and I'm a die-hard fan of the original!",8,2 July 2008,"I've read many of the comments about Rob Zombie's Halloween, most of them negative. I have to admit, after seeing each degrating sequel released in the last decade, I had hopes for this one. Rob Zombie seemed the perfect fit for a 're-imagining'. I mean, what else could they do to shed new light on the aging series? The result? I actually liked it! Rob Zombie has a healthy respect for the original, yet manages to create a completely fresh approach to the subject. Most people said it was an 'insult' to the original or 'Mustapha must be rolling in his grave..."". The fact was, Zombie didn't want to replicate Carpenter's film. Zombie's film is a nice alternative to the original, certainly miles above the terrible Halloween: Resurrection. In closing, the cinematography is great, the story is fresh, acting good, and it provides some good scares. I highly recommend this new vision.",Halloween

Not only was the acting great, but the back story adds such a beneficial touch to the film. I also thought Sherry Moon was only there due to Zombie as the director, but I want to see her more often in the industry now knowing how well she performs. Not 1 actor blew their role or underscored it at all. McDowell delivers an unbelievable Loomis and Scout, although not being as virginous as Curtis, is a really good actress. She sounds 100% believable. The only thing I disagreed with were some of the deaths, although I was happy with the characters who came out breathing. All in all, this movie was almost prefect, and the music sounded the same. If you watch this, you will not be sorry.",Halloween

Seeing a Halloween movie that reminded me of the original and why I loved it so much. This is the very best in the sequels of the Halloween Series since the original and part 2. I know people have picking on and hating this new version but I'm not sure why. Quit comparing it to the original. This is a whole new take. We all know that the John Carpenter version will always be the classic that it has become. Thats why I love this version. It is a total different experience for 2007. Go see it for yourself and you be the judge. This ranks as one of the best and most violent & fun horror films since ""The Descent"" came out last summer. I loved the new Michael Myers and that the mask looked scary as hell. Not the kind of masks that were used in the lame sequels. This is the real deal. Go see it with a opening weekend crowd. Keep an opened mind and know that this is not going to replace the 1978 version and watch it for what it is and you should come away as pleased as I was. It was nice to see a whole new Halloween movie that lived up to the original standard of the John Carpenter version with a new Rob Zombie twist for a 2007 audience.",Halloween
1134,ph34rryan11,A unique take on a legendary tale that has some highs but mostly lows.,6,28 August 2007,"OK I JUST finished watching the whole thing. Here are my thoughts: The OG Halloween stands as the greatest horror movie ever made. It has always been one of my favorite films of all time. So when I heard about a remake being made by Rob Zombie, I was at first curious. I didn't know how it would turn out, because I thought Zombie would either really hit or miss it. I was wrong. It stands in between. When I look at the film as a horror movie, I find myself disappointed. I don't think Michael's back story should of been shown, but I do think if we have to know his back story, this wasn't a bad option. But it does take away from the horror element that made the original so terrifying. I believe Zombie should of thought of a creative way to tell Michael's back story, instead of show it visually. The scariest thing about the first one was because we didn't have any idea about him and what happened. The things we thought of were so terrifying because it couldof been anything, and we didn't know. That's what made him so terrifying. But you can't be too hard on Zombie because he loves the original and remade it to pay homage to it. I also think the pace of the movie is too fast. The tension had no time to build up. Which was a defining feature for the original. I would of also liked to have seen more of Laurie Strode. She wasn't as central as I think she should of been in this movie. On a really positive note, Malcolm McDowell is PERFECTLY cast as Dr. Sam Loomis. He really is the highlight of this movie. Also, the actor who played young Michael Meyers is very good for doing exactly what he was asked to do. I really don't see this as a bad movie in any way shape or form. I just see it as, the idea wasn't the best idea. And by that I mean showing Michael's life on screen, when it would of been more horrifying to hear about it. That said, the movie still is unique. It has Zombie written all over it. To some thats a very good thing, to others that can be a mistake. I see it has a good thing. There is amazing visuals in this movie that shouldn't go unrecognized. Also, my favorite part of the movie was the beginning. My favorite part of the original was also the beginning. When Michael escaped and the music played over the credits for the first time, leaving you like, ""Wow!! This is so crazy/bad a$$."" You kind of get that feeling from this version also, but Zombie does it a lot different but it is a unique opening. Also the ending is different, you will be surprised. And it is a good surprise, seeing it as it suits this version very well. But if it was in the original, it wouldn't even come close to being as memorable as the original's. Also the last act is too fast paced (as is with the whole movie), and at times (the ending chase) can be pretty scary. As a huge Halloween fan, I suggest other fans go see this movie for what it is...an attempt to make a new generation appreciate a legendary horror story.",Halloween
1135,MFINN23,You Reviewers are Ridiculous,10,29 September 2010,"I normally don't write reviews, but I just had to say something looking at all these ridiculous reviews. I think nostalgia has blinded you people, this movie was incredible and way above the standards for a horror film, let alone a remake. A true masterpiece. It makes me wonder if you have your own ideas or are just repeating what someone else had said because your reasons are astonishing. Seriously, your criticizing a film for character development? You honestly like it better not having a back-story, or any insight into the psychology of Michael Myers? Are you insane? This is exactly what remakes are for, to provide extra layers to the story. The casting was perfect, the makeup was perfect, the special effects were perfect. Rob Zombie is a genius of horror films and you should all bow to him for allowing you to watch this. Absolutely perfect film, and thank you Rob Zombie for making my year by providing something so incredible when most of the movies now a days are pure garbage.",Halloween
1136,zachbuehl,A worthy remake...,8,31 August 2007,"To start with, you aren't going to match the original Halloween movie. You just aren't. John Carpenter did an amazing thing in 1978 and you cannot hope to outshine that. All you can hope is to make something that actually does justice to the original, something most remakes fail miserably.This remake actually succeeds. It's dark and foreboding, with a lot of great scenes that build up a good deal of tension. Zombie has grown as a director, setting up some great shots and a wonderful atmosphere for the movie. He does what Carpenter did by misdirecting you in the most tense scenes: he puts the characters in situations you are just sure are going to get them killed and then kills them about 2 minutes later when you aren't expecting it. There are also a lot of great scenes with Michael just looming in the background and you just don't know what he's going to do. And I think my favorite part is that the ending didn't leave it open for any sequels (a plague amongst horror movies). I won't give it away, suffice to say, I am glad they can't make a Halloween 2 remake (though I guess they could go with a Halloween: The Beginning like Texas Chainsaw Massacre).If I had to say something bad about the movie, it would be that it's a little too dark at times to really tell what is going on. That being said, it's not that hard to imagine what's going on. Also, the first 5 minutes of dialog are a bit trying, as Zombie falls back into what he did with Devil's Rejects: putting swear words and harsh language simply for the sake of having it in the movie to try to shock you. If you can get past that, the rest of the movie doesn't disappoint.So, overall, Zombie basically didn't screw it up, and that's all I could ask.",Halloween

Coming from a Hardcore Halloween fan at first I was a little scared about Rob ruining the film especially because it is a prequel but also a remake and sequel. Whatever i had thought of myself and how i would of approached the film he completed every aspect, terror, violence, composition,lighting, story, originality and so on. needless to say I was very , happy with this new rendition and by far brings back the Halloween series to the map. Tyler Bates score, composer from recent movies as 300 did a fabulous job with his rendition of the Halloween theme and additional themes. I Strongely recommend you go see it, Howvever i do not recommend kids under the age of 14 see this movie, it simply too graphic and would be very scary for a child that age. Its borderline NC-17 in violence alone and use of language, and flat out disturbing, which is Rob Zombie's trademark.In addition, Halloween is set to make a new labor day record at 31.5 million for the 3 day weekend, not to mention an extra boost for Monday.",Halloween

I'm sorry, but what I saw last night was on par with the REMAKE of ""The Fog"", the REMAKE of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and every other horrible and inane remake haunting the screens these days.Granted, I had gone to the theater with big expectations. I felt that, after all, if anyone was going to do a good job of remaking ""Halloween"" it would be Rob Zombie: he has shown the knowledge, the know-how and the drive to offer a unique--even visionary--take of this horror classic. But this hackneyed work, in my opinion, fell far, far short of what he is capable of as a filmmaker...I also suspect that he did not have final cut. The Weinsteins are notorious for re-cutting their films, and I think ""Halloween"" is no exception.My hope is that Zombie's next outing will on par with the talent he so clearly has inside of him.

The only thing that the original has is JL Curtis, and you are just not going to replicate her performance. The new Loomis is as good or better. This movie goes into the background and it is interesting. Zombie keeps to the original but his changes are all improvements in my opinion. The original made myers look like a small disgruntled plumber and his character seemed not too bright and was flat and cardboard. The new myers is complex and a monster to say the least. What the original lacked in gore and violence this makes up for and then some, but it's Rob Zombie what did you expect. This is a gory ultra- violent thrill ride and Myers is an unstoppable and physically intimidating monster that would drop Jason Vorhees with one swipe of his huge hands.

1142,mmenges70,Extreme Spoiler. Description of specific scenes.,1,5 October 2014,"If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would. Do not waste your time with this movie! To start off, I would like to add that I love scary movies, and I can handle a lot of gore and violence, but this movie went way too far. I understand showing Michael Myers killing animals was necessary, considering that it is a characteristic of children who later have severe mental issues, and some of whom may very well become serial killers. There were parts early in the movie where crude sexual references were made of Michael Myers' older half- sister, one of which was made by Michael's father, and other by fellow classmates. But there is a scene in particular that I can't get over. There is a rape scene that takes place 15 years after Michael was admitted to the mental institute. The lead up to the actual scene was flat out raw and completely irrelevant and sick. This scene was not needed. It did NOT at all contribute to the sick- mindedness of Michael Myers, considering that he is already an adult and has his demented ways set. The workers at the institute subject one of the female inmates to rape inside of Michael Myers cell. Not only did they touch her and make crude sexual references to her and her body, but they actually showed them holding her on the bed and having their way with her. I am a grown woman, and I cried at this scene in front of my parents when we were watching this. This scene was way too personal and offensive and has no place being in this movie. Absolutely none! I have to admit that I stopped watching the movie at this point. I did not care to. And if you watch this movie, you'll wonder why I made it past the first 10 minutes. Because everything about this movie is dark, and ill- mannered. I am severely disappointed in everyone who contributed to the making of this movie. This was not a piece of work, it is a piece of trash that should have never made it through the editing room. If you want a good scary movie, go rent The Exorcist, because then you will have a substantial plot, with a thought out story. Shout out to the creators of this movie, you don't need to have your characters drop the f- bomb every 2 seconds to show how tough they think they are! Also, a REAL scary movie isn't about constantly showing dead people or animals, it's making your audience feel scared or hopeless as if they were in the situation that your characters are in, but to do that you actually have to make your characters likable. Not once did I feel bad for any of the characters who died in this film. Congrats on the worst movie of all time (and I've seen plenty of grade- B films!).",Halloween

(aside from the first one due to my lack of existence) and they have always been my favorites above the Nightmare and Friday the 13th series. Michael was just a bad Mama Jama and looked insanely creepy in the process. They are all greats in my book and remind me of my horror movie saturated childhood.Everyone says Rob Zombie slaughtered John Carpenter's masterpiece? I give these nay-sayers a wag of the finger. We should appreciate the fact that he had the guts to make such a bold move to rekindle this franchise fully knowing fans may potentially crucify him. Look at what we have had to feed on for the past decade? Paul Rudd, Josh Hartnett and Busta Rhymes as the stars? Now THAT is blasphemous!!!(not to mention the atrocious re-visioning of the mask in these poor franchise additions. They made it look like some S&M bondage mask. Horrendous.)I love blood. I love gore. I love the crusty, tattered mask that actually LOOKS like the classic mask, I love cringing at the sight of some 12 year old, scraggly haired fat kid beating someone to death with blunt objects. I honestly think Rob Zombie made the shape intimidating and truly brutal again... Not some stupid punch line for an out of work rapper to use. Pffffffffffft! I scoff at the casting directors of the previous 3 movies. Horror movies became so pacified and satirized. We should hail those who are trying to make them gritty and terrifying again. Not cast the first stone.So to all you horror 'afficianados' who think Rob Zombie has disgraced this franchise with his vision, I say look back... The franchise had become absolute garbage! Rob made it fresh and creepy again. Although he took a few liberties upon himself in the process, that was his choice. How about having some hope that it may rekindle the franchise to be GOOD again and not a series many of us love, to be disregarded as diluted schlock. (think of Batman Begins and how it delivered us from the bat nipples.) I mean, if they can chop Michael's head off like in H2O and figure out how to bring him back intelligently and we actually EAT IT???, making a REALISTIC return for another NEW movie would be a snap. Although it may be best to leave the franchise as is but I promise you, with how much dough this is making, they'll make a move for a new one soon.SO HAVE FAITH !!! So many people keep talking about the classics and how these new movies will never live up to them. That's because we have seen them all growing up and are now emblazoned in our minds as a boiler plate for what horror SHOULD be and how it should make us feel. Try watching the old ones again objectively. Not very scary anymore are they? Movies have evolved-For better or worse. Stop comparing apples to oranges. Most of it out there is total tripe anyway but sometimes a shining piece of originality comes along and wows you. Granted, THIS movies wasn't TOTALLY original, it wasn't supposed to be but it did a pretty fantastic job of making new where there was once void. I thought Zombie's re-imaging was great. Although it felt rushed once he started wasting drunken sex-crazed teens, he did it with such a vicious, relentless and brutal style I have NEVER seen the shape use before. Be grateful this franchise didn't die with that steaming pile of dog innards Halloween: Resurrection...In the wise words of Chainsaw and Dave...TWO THUMBS UP! MAKE THAT 4 FOR GORE...",Halloween
1144,katiekorn,Halloween - Rob Zombie 2007,4,27 September 2007,"I quite Like Rob Zombie Movies, House of 1000 corpses and The Devils Rejects were both awesome (Devil's Rejects being the better of the two).I was looking forward to it, but dreading it at the same time. Halloween is an absolute classic and I didn't want it to be ruined.If you try and watch it as a separate film from the original its OK. However, if you watch it and want it to be the 'same' film, you will be sorely disappointed. In the original, the main terror factor for Michael Myers fans is that he is almost an entity. Part of the fear is suggestion, his fleeting moments on screen and his utter silence. The new version ruins this completely, you see Michael as a disturbed child. In fact almost half the film is centred on his childhood. When Michael grows up, you don't see his face, but he is an absolute giant of a man, almost to the point of absurdity. His face is covered by his long hair and reminded me very much of Mankind of WWE fame. The film itself has the same basic premise of the original, but there is a LOT more blood and unnecessary additional slayings. In short, if you are a major fan of the original film and don't want your illusions of Michael Myers to be shattered then don't watch it. If not, then its worth a go, if only for Sherri Moon-Zombie's performance. (But that's just me!)",Halloween
1145,mindlessinsanities,It's not bad,6,1 September 2007,"It's really not as bad as people are letting on. Don't get me wrong, it's no masterpiece, but it is a decent enough of a flick that I walked away not feeling raped over the price I had paid for the tickets, which happens quite frequently when going to the theater on opening night. The majority of complaints I've read seem to be from the same kind of people that nit-pick through every movie they see. If you're the type of person who watches movies (especially horror) for fun, and not to pick out every little flaw, then it's a genuinely fun, and in the beginning, a little scary/creepy.At the same time, it's blatantly obvious that Rob Zombie has a 'thing' for both the 70's and white trash rednecks. And if you didn't enjoy his previous two films, I can promise you, you won't like Halloween in the least.",Halloween
1146,bnaylor04,People really just don't get it lol,7,11 April 2016,"First, let me say something. When a horror movie REMAKE comes out, 1) it's not supposed to be exactly like the original, and 2) it's not supposed to win a f****** Oscar.That being said, Rob Zombie's remake of the Halloween SEQUEL is almost too gory, yes, but the remake of this one? If you think it's ""too violent,"" you're honestly soft and have no business watching modern-day horror movies in the first place lol.Let's weigh out some pros and cons:PROS: - Myers doesn't just creep after everyone, like he does in the older movies. People....he's a psychopath. Either get it or don't... but a true psychopath wouldn't build up 2 hours of suspense before killing someone. He would just brutally kill them and not care one bit about it, how it's done, or what others might think about it? - The mask doesn't look like plastic, like something he casually bought out of a Halloween costume shop before going out and murdering people. This mask fits the bill way more than that of the originals - Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode are great characters. Also, finishing the movie with Laurie shooting Myers in the head is GREAT. Also, young Myers may be like most other Hollywood child actors (tries too hard on-screen), but he's truly a creepy little kid. Pretty good acting for a horror movie, in comparison with some others - The script is FINE, people, really. What do you expect? Shakespeare? The point of horror movies is to envelop what normal kids are like at the time of filming. Why do you think 80% of horror movies show kids doing literally the same exact thing? Sorry for those who don't get it or choose to deny it, or think it's exaggerated, but: HS kids nowadays party, they cuss like sailors, and they have sex lol. And they'll do all 3 until they're married. CONS: - I wish there was no sequel. I'm still waiting for the slasher flick where the killer doesn't live after multiple gunshots to the face and other things that would clearly kill even the toughest human being lol. Myers is a psychopath killer, but he's not Satan, nor is he a mutant lol - A little disappointed in how crappy his family was portrayed, and how little screen time they got. But, it makes sense in how it contributed to his psychotic instincts, does it not? - The sheriff's character is honestly just dumb. You don't need convincing from someone who studied a notorious local psychopath for over one and a half decades that said psychopath is back to grab his little sister, and especially after there's evidence of his escape from the mental institution and a spree of killings from that institution to Haddonfield. Put your ego aside, buddy.All in all, this was good. Not perfect, sure, but what horror movie is? Lol. When I watch a horror movie, I expect it to be more like Halloween, Friday the 13th, The Exorcist, and Evil Dead. And less like When A Stranger Calls. These are called HORROR movies, guys, not ""jumpy movies."" And like it or not, the world has seen some crazy stuff since the '70s and '80s, and horror movies require more gore now than they did back then in order to deliver the proper shock value that will either scare someone or make them uncomfortable, which is what horror movies are designed to do.If you want moving, heart-wrenching, detailed and upper-echelon-level script, watch something other than a horror film. If you want the original, watch it? But until you create your own script of a remake or original movie that makes it to theaters, stop posting 1-star, overly-critical reviews, thinking your opinions actually carry relevant weight.",Halloween
1147,segnir_the_cursed,A Fresh Start for a Dying Series,10,31 August 2007,This is not a remake as those who keep saying it is. I feel sorry for those who think it is because they are not going with an open mind. They need to realize that this is not the original Halloween it is a new vision and has a more realistic tone to it. It is also the scariest Halloween since Halloween II. Rob Zombie stays true to the legend and adding a new things to the mythology. Micheal is still the a being of pure unstoppable evil but Rob builds up to it. We start with Micheal as a child who seems like a good child but we start seeing a transformation into the evil being that we all love and know. Now those who keep saying it is unrealistic how strong he is have you ever taken a course about serial killers. Some killers actually posses extreme amount of strength. Also Taylor Mane plays the best Micheal that I have seen in a long time. He just seems to fit the role like a glove.One complaint that people keep saying is the dialogue. To me the dialogue felt natural and less scripted and forced. Doctor Loomis in this film has some awesome lines and his relationship with Micheal is shown very well. You can see that he tries to help Micheal as a child and looks to be a father like figure for Micheal. Also those who keep saying Rob Zombie can't write dialoge for girls properly need to stop. Many of you guys who are old fans high school has changed. The way girls were speaking to each other is just right. Girls will speak to each other that way. Now for some spoilers. So fair warning. To those who think Loomis died I believe he didn't. think he was badly hurt. Now Micheal Myers definitely didn't die because Tyler Mane was signed on for two. I believe The Sheriff will return to hunt Micheal down in the Sequel.End of SpoilersMy final word is go with an open mind. This isn't the 1979 version it is a new idea and spin. No more supernatural myers just a unstoppable killing machine. With great characters and interaction between those characters. I can't wait for Robs future movies.,Halloween
1148,nick_shoey,Better than the original in my opinion.,7,3 September 2007,"I know a lot of people will look at the title of this review and think that im crazy, but i watched the original the day before i saw this just so i could do an even comparison, and i found myself liking Rob Zombies version a lot more. The thing with the original, is that it didn't really have much story to link the beginning events with why he was trying to kill Laurie, there was only the one reference to MM having a sister when it was written on the back of his door after escaping the asylum, and even then there was no explanation to suggest that it was Laurie. If i hadnt seen the some of the later Halloween movies i wouldn't't have known this. Rob Zombies version clearly showed a younger sibling from the very beginning, and it made the connection between MM and Laurie much more obvious. I also liked how the movie was more about the killer than the victim/heroine, i enjoyed how Rob Zombie tried to get the viewer to sympathise with MM, although I didn't really, i just thought he was one hell of a messed up kid. This version was a lot more creepy and disturbing than the original, mostly due to the beginning with young MM, that kid freaked me out, and the kills were a lot more brutal/awesome than the original, which always makes for a great horror movie. I loved how much Rob Zombie made this version feel like an old horror movie, with the camera-work and of course the signature Halloween music. He also included the one thing that actually made the original slightly creepy, which was when MM face would appear out of shadows and in windows behind victims, that'll freak me out for a while, especially since i have to babysit tonight, lol. The only bad thing i have to really say about this film is the acting, not the best i've seen, but also hardly the worst. OK, that pretty much sums up my opinion of the film, one of the best remakes I've seen in a while, well done Rob Zombie!!!!",Halloween
1149,Waynes_world17,Best Horror Movie Since Saw,8,31 August 2007,"I just got back from the midnight showing and I must say that I was pleasantly unsurprised. Since I first saw the trailer for Zombie's remake of Carpenter's classic thriller I have been stoked about this movie. Up until a week ago I had never seen the original. I did not think the original would do it for me but I had to see it before viewing the remake (cinephile principles). The movie was okay but nothing special for me. This movie deals with Myers childhood in far more depth than the original, and I feel it did so to it's benefit. The acting in this movie is very solid in my opinion, the only dialog that seemed forced were recycled lines from the first flick (Totally!). This movie pays homage to the original in many ways but at the same time it mixes it up enough to make things new and exciting. The score is as creepy as ever, and I felt that this movie as a whole was scarier than the original. Everything just kind of worked for me. The violence was intense and gory but did not feel forced especially when compared to modern R rated horror movies. I think Halloween snobs are going to be very happy with this movie. It is superior to it's predecessor but some will not like it just because it's a remake. However it is a fantastic remake.",Halloween

Judith has no interest in taking Michael trick-or-treating.Michael unleashes his fury.Malcolm McDowell will never be Donald Pleasance. DP was the better Dr.Loomis.

Now,for every fan of the original expecting the same movie you saw last time around, don't. This is that plus way more. Rob Zombie finally did something in a remake that most remakes either do wrong or don't do at all, he actually RE-MADE it. A hell of a lot of things are different (notably the ending). He really made it his own, which I thought was refreshing and pretty cool. It's also pretty funny. All in all, I thought it was pretty good, especially for a remake, it had numerous scares, and a good amount of comedy, and enough things were different to actually have me guessing. It's not the original, but it's pretty damn good.",Halloween
1152,neddam,The Real Halloween....,10,1 September 2007,"I went into this torn. I have Faith in Zombie but I can't help hearing the trolls on these boards. In the first act I was worried and felt the movie maybe rushed. By the time the third act set in however, I was floored. I own the original in at least three forms of media, as well as all of John Carpenter's other work, so as a true fan I feel this is the best vision that could come during our generation.The movie keeps most of the structure and characters true in the third act, it only adds depth that the original did not have (which would make the movie boring for us today if in theaters). Loomis is only added on to look like a bad psychiatrist who knows his meal ticket, the girls are updated to our times, and Myers has the added fear of you knowing him and why, but still you don't know his motives (and he doesn't drive in this version).All in all, this movie takes it's place as the third best remake in horror movies, behind The Fly and The Thing. I didn't think I would be saying so this soon after The Hills Have Eyes either...",Halloween

The freeze framing with music, the clown mask made me think of Capt. Spaulding...yes Rob we know..clowns can be eerie. A lot of the stuff in this version of Halloween were done in Devils Rejects. Very poor on Zombie's part. He should be ashamed to try to compete with a classic like John Carpenter's Halloween. What's next for Zombie..a remake of E.T.?",Halloween
1154,linehantony88,Halloween: The curse of rob zombie,7,2 September 2007,"My first thought:""why remake such a technically perfect piece of horror masterwork?"" Answer:""Money"" Horror remakes are so common now days its laughable just how many there have been in the last 5 years! Including the Texas chainsaw massacre and the hills have eyes (both terrible and not in a good way) the you have the house of wax (crap) Black Christmas(crap) and dawn of the dead (not so bad). But to remake the daddy, the horror film to end all horror films is somewhat of a new low for Hollywood you would think.But I was excited! actually looking forward to seeing Micheal myers make an appearance once again. Hell I even sat through Halloween H20 and resurrection to see my favourite horror icon. This time around however I was more than disappointed. the idea of the devil's rejects director helming a Michael myers movie (remake or not) was too good to not get excited over. Only thing is Rob zombie was less interested in creating a new experience in horror then he was in making some weird cross breed. Devil myers and the house of 1000 Halloween clichés.I wasn't about to hate this Halloween remake just because I am mad on the first film in the series, but I can't help it! Even with A clockwork orange star Malcolm as loomis, I just can't handle films this badly made and damn lazy. It was like watching Michael myers murder the original film before our very eyes, then turn around and tell the audience ""Don't forget to rent devil's rejects folks!"" Film today sucks!",Halloween

The story centers around Michael Myers also known as ""The Shape"" and his ultimate killing spree in a small town.",7,21 September 2007,"As far as remakes go not bad at all! A decent mix of a psychological look into the mind of a child who becomes a psychopathic serial killer and an horror movie with plenty of gore, sex and nudity, and excitement. It is similar to Zombie's other works in a lot of ways, but I do not agree that he totally abandoned Carpenter's great character at all. He did however revamp the time period, the origin, and the style to fit today's market. It is worth a look!On other sites I have seen many people state that this movie was not as good as the ""80's version."" Do not allow this to cloud your own opinion of whether or not to give it a try. This statement alone should show you how much these so called horror fans know about the original movie. It was not an 80's movie at all! It was released in 1978! So please try it out and have fun with it. It may be funny to you, it may have a decent musical score, or maybe great effects.

Im not trying to be a voice of reason nor am i defending this movie but i didn't think it was that bad. As just a film, it was entertaining but as a ""re-invention"" to what could arguably be considered the scariest movie of all time, disappointing. The idea of showing how Michael Myers became Michael Myers makes him seem more human and makes the audience want to seem almost sorry for him when that wasn't what the original movie did. The original film depicted Michael as pure evil and made you terrified of his every move where in the Rob Zombie film, he tries to make you feel bad for him because he had a rough childhood and tries to show you why he acts the way he does. What all these directors who want to remake horror movies need to understand is that character development is good but too much character development is bad, the only exception to this rule being George Romero's films. To be honest, i enjoyed because it was entertaining and i looked past the idea of it being a ""revival"" of a horror classic.

1157,mddonnellan,Might Help If You Write An Outline First...,2,16 February 2010,"....to actually see which way you want the final film to go. SPOILERS ALL OVER.Okay: Rob Zombie's Halloween (1): The first half of it is a decent (and that may be stretching it) movie about how someone could grow up to be a serial killer: bad hair, stripper mom (with heart of gold, of course, but still allows her children to be abused by her jerkoff cripple, drunk boyfriend???), questionable taste in music (KISS fan), pet murderer, slut sister, and the use of four-letter words in every single sentence he hears. Example ""Pass the mother f*#king c*#ksucking cereal you stupid whore bitch c*nt!"". But it's not a Halloween movie by any stretch of the imagination, except possibly for the fact that this little fruit, who runs around calling his baby sister 'boo', suddenly starts killing everyone in these incredible over the top ways (all within the course or about 10 minutes) in a gigantic Michael Myers mask, which is unintentionally comical. Then we cut to the underdeveloped Loomis talking to a kid that doesn't remember what he did in an asylum. This is the most successful part of the film because at least the acting isn't distracting....that is until the little guy attacks a nurse out of nowhere and in lieu of it being actually frightening they just pump the screaming and volume up. Get used to that cause they fall back on it. A lot. So after 45 minutes or so of that crap it seems pretty obvious that someone over at Miramax told Mr. Zombie that he hadn't remade Halloween at all and the meathead tried to cram the whole remake into the last 45 minutes of his movie. Brilliant. So now after his mom blows her head off Michael, who is the size of the Sears Tower and may or may not have super-powers (depending on how Zombie feels when he's trying to explain himself in interviews), breaks out and kills twice the people in half the time in ridiculously over the top violent ways. The 3 girls, who were the center piece in the original and the ones that the viewer was supposed to relate to, are now just 3 extremely annoying dumb sluts that you can't wait to get filleted, which does eventually happen but it seems to take forever between all of their terrible acting and worthless dialog. Since there was a theatrical version and an unrated version (complete with hillbilly rape!) we're not sure if Loomis gets his eyes crushed in and dies at the end or is just down for the count. Also since we don't know if Michael is some supernatural being or just a misunderstood hick we don't know if the point-blank gun shot wound to the head actually does him in or not. Great ending(s). The movie is just a mess. There are continuity issues all over the place (after Loomis' said eye-crushing a scene later he has no blood on his face, mirrors/glass are shattered and are miraculously back together in the next shot) and the dialog is just so over the top with profanity you can't help but scratch your head. Plus no mother that loves her kids would ever surround them with a profanity-spewing crippled bag of hate that talks openly about how hot her own daughter's ass is. I mean who the hell are these people? And NOTHING makes Michael Myers less scary than thinking that he was just some stupid whiny kid that even the nicest kid in class would want to slap. Last time I check he was the Boogieman. Stick with the original and by all means avoid the sequel at all costs.",Halloween

RZ's take was very very different from the original, and thats what it should be. if he were to make an exact remake of it, then why? he is a phenomenal filmmaker and it shows wonderfully in this movie. go in to this movie as if it were any movie, not thinking about the original. although it wasn't as ""jump out of your seat"" scary as i wish it would have been, it was a great horror film that was well made. my only disliking towards it was that there was no reasoning as to why he killed the people he did. we know he goes back there for Laurie, but then why all of that? because hes a crazy killer? interesting.... all in all, i would recommend this movie to any horror fan. the ending was quite surprising which I'm sure many people wont be happy with.",Halloween
1161,SAKU23,If you like Rob Zombie?,3,31 August 2007,"I was very disappointed with this film, but it was expected. Once again, we are presented with a B film slasher horror concept(although a remake) through the eyes of Rob Zombie and it becomes a train wreck from the beginning. John Carpenter's Halloween had suspense, decent acting and horror. Zombie's version lacked all the above. Also, I agree with a comment made on this page earlier that Rob is trying to ""humanize"" Myers and make him a character we can sympathize with. This is a mistake and destroys the entire concept of pure evil incarnate. We are left confused as to why. The original did not attempt to have the audience sympathize with Myers for the simple fact it would incite viewers to ask why. One last point I have to mention: I think the f word was said more times in this movie than in Goodfellas. Even Dr. Loomis drops the f bomb. I personally don't mind any profanity, no matter how excessive. It is a human expression, as Talib Kweli once said ""our society is immersed in vulgarity"".

The one thing that I thought was dreadful was the transition to night time in the third act of the story. We all the sudden see Bob and Lynda in front of the Myers house ready to have sex. It was possibly the worst transition I have ever seen to continue a story. Other than that, Rob Zombie did a nice job making a cool horror film. The more I watch this movie, I begin to respect and understand what Rob was trying to convey. Although I do understand why a lot of people don't dig it, they don't want their precious original touched. Well at least this wasn't a film that was made a second time like Psycho. This movie stood as a whole completely different story. If you disliked it, then it should not impact the way you feel about the original. If someone is going to let Rob Zombie's movie upset them, then you are a wimp and should just stick to bazooka bubble gum and watch the original.

Especially if you are a fan of the original but let's point out that first of all the audience that is going to see this version are between 18 to 24 and it has been 29 years since the first Halloween. Most of the people in that age group may never have even seen the original and for sure never in a theater. Not to mention that the last time any of us watched Michael Myers in the theater he was kicking it up with Busta Rhymes so if you really want to complain about something then there you go. What Rob Zombie has done is freshen up the story and the characters to fit the movie to a new generation of horror fans and I don't think he did too bad of a job. I hate to here about remakes as much as the next guy. Most of them end up being crappy vehicles for young teen Hollywood and never even enter the same room with the originals they are ripped from but this time I think it was a valiant effort. Rob Zombie took the story of Michael Myers and made it seem more real, like something like this could happen in any town. You have to admit if the original was released today it wouldn't have packed the same punch.If you have never seen the original or it has been awhile then your going to enjoy this version but if you one of those people who feel you have been wronged every time somebody even mentions your favorite movie in a unfavorable light then please just don't go. I love John Carpenter's movies and I don't feel that this takes anything away from what I love about the original and I can tell that Rob Zombie is a fan too otherwise I don't think he would have done the film if he didn't think he could do it justice.This version has a high body count, loads of blood, and a rich back story. I think it was well done and will scare people for years to come. Rob Zombie is really becoming a fine filmmaker.",Halloween
1165,kennyeatsbirds,Somewhat disappointing...,5,3 September 2007,"Like many of the horror fans out there I went through my phase of being angry and disgusted that they would remake Halloween and especially that Rob Zombie would be the director to do it. This eventually wore off and I came to terms with it. I am a fan of Rob Zombie and as it got nearer to the release date I came to believe that I would probably enjoy the movie, although I figured it still wouldn't compare to the original. Hell, I was even pretty excited to go see it (It's rare these days that we get to see horror films out of Hollywood made by people who actually give a sh*t about the genre, which is why I like Zombie even though I don't find him to be a genius director or anything like that.) Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with what I saw. For the most part, the first half of the movie was interesting and held my attention but once it became night time, the whole film went downhill. Essentially, like many ""slasher movies"" today, the last 30 minutes or so of the film turned into a string of boring chase sequences. Don't get me wrong, chase sequences are essential to these kinds of movies, but they can't carry a movie for half an hour.It seemed to me that one of the main problems was that Zombie seemed to drop the ball when Michael Myers completely turns into a silent killer. His talent as a writer is in creating interesting characters (i.e. house of 1000 corpses & the devil's rejects), but with no personality left in his killer, the script and other characters become boring. Rob Zombie is not a suspense director and the attempts he made at it during this film were pretty lame. It wasn't scary and none of the ""jump scares"" worked. This isn't to say that he is a bad filmmaker, he just seems to be out of his element with this movie.Although I thought the back story was decent and entertaining enough, I still tend to find Michael Myers a more interesting character with less back story and more mystery like in the original.I appreciate the effort put into the movie and I have given it a rating of 5 because I still think it was probably better than what they would have made with a different writer and director, but this movie just didn't work for me.Luckily I got to see this at a drive-in theater along with the original Halloween and Grindhouse, so the night was still pretty great.",Halloween
1166,halcyon_78,A disgrace.,1,2 September 2007,"If I could give this zero stars I would. Rob Zombie is an idiot hack. Why does he have to simplify Michael Myers as a product of white-trash America? What is his fascination with white trash? He revels in it. The original Michael Myers was scary because he WAS a typically normal human being with REAL evil in him. Rob Zombie turned him into a wrestler skulking around killing half-naked babysitters for no apparent motive. His plot is still unclear! The scene in the original where Myers is outside of the classroom window, standing by a tree, was thoroughly creepy. Zombie ripped it off and made it a frigging joke. Michael was as big as the tree!!! If anyone DIDN'T notice him, now THAT would be scary! At my viewing of ""Halloween"" people got up and left. There was chuckling and openly snide remarks at the supposedly ""scary"" scenes. Rob Zombie is a B director, only interested in cussing and nudity. He couldn't tell an interesting story if Sheri Moon's next big-time part in one of HIS movies depended on it. Hollywood, please stop giving this man projects. As a long time Halloween fan I was and AM disgusted and can only hope the franchise can recover. In closing, Moustapha Akkad is spinning in his grave. Excuse me while I go vomit.",Halloween
1167,cellpiant,Two Different Views,9,31 August 2007,"Okay, I just got out of the movie, and I decided I wanted to give my input on the movie from two different perspectives; from a fan view, and from a stand alone view. Here it goes Fan: I have been a huge Halloween fan for years now. It was the first horror movie I ever saw, I remember watching it with my father. I must admit, after reading bad reviews and hearing about the working print, I went into the theater terrified that they destroyed a classic. The movie is different, indefinitely, and they changed a few key elements. Michael's back story removes a lot of his mystery and honestly his fear, it was creepy not knowing why he did what he did, he just does it. They also changed a couple of the personalities of the the main characters, Lynda and Laurie mostly. Dr. Loomis is also different, he isn't so much, terrified of Michael like Pleasance was, he sort of, feels sad with him in this one. Like, I said, its different. Those who came into the theater expecting either an exact copy of Carpenter's master, came in without any expectations, or most commonly, came in already hating it, might have been a bit if not very disappointed. Everyone remembers what the original was and this is something that is, again, different, and there for to a lot of people, its bad. All in all, compared to the original, I'd say about a 6/10, only because they changed a lot.Stand Alone: For those who have never seen the original, or those who don't mind that they remade it, or those that were happy they remade it, go see this movie. In a world where the horror genre has been mutilated to the point of Saw and Hostel, this is a great refresher for those who, actually want to be SCARED. As a stand alone movie, it creates a fantastic killer, one who is merciless and pretty much unstoppable, a 6'10'' monster. Michael still stalks, though not as much, and he is still pretty much Michael. He waits, and plans his killings, and pops out in great moments that definitely had me and my 45 year old father jumping and screaming in the seats. When this movie isn't compared to the original, though it is fast paced and kinda crammed, to me, is simply amazing. The best horror film in a very long time. 10/10 Overall: Was it as good as the original. Some say yes, some say no, some say they were equal. Personally, I have to say they are very evenly matched. Despite the master piece that was the original, this movie scarred me, and I haven't been scarred in a long time. For those die hard fans who never wanted a remake, who hate it already, don't see it, you will probably be disappointed with how much they changed. For die hard fans that never want Halloween to end, and always wanted answers to Michael, like myself, this movie was incredible. Overall, 8-9/10 for me.",Halloween
1168,vanderbogart_2001,equals the original,10,1 September 2007,"First off all let me start out by saying, I'm a huge fan of the original, and i don't like any rob zombie movies. house of a 1000 corpse was a laugh fest at how stupid it was.. devils wasn't much better. I've personally seen the work print and thought it was OK. So i figured id give the final version a shot. I read a lot of reviews saying how there's no character development and its not edge of your seat....anyone who said that must have not seen the final version and must be basing those statements off of the work print. The final was equal if not better than the original. The back story was great, truly sets up the mind frame of mike. After an hour of prequel the remake kicks in. It follows pretty close to the original. This movie was probably the only remake that brings that old school horror theme back. Without giving it away the ending had everyone i was with at the edge of their seats. This movie was truly a GREAT remake, worthy of seeing again and owning.",Halloween
1169,chuck34609,Terrible Rip Off,1,31 December 2007,"What a Terrible Rip Off. I actually got weak from watching this. Couldn't handle all of it - hard to stomach - like your high school drama club put it together using the original as a guide. It was like they threw the teens from Hannah Montana - told them to use profanity where ever possible and we'll use the first take. Probably the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I would say that this one is probably on the same lines that being - watchable - as Travolta's Battle Field Earth. If you could be by that one then your probably vegetable enough to watch this one. I suspect if you never seen the original you wouldn't know any better. As they say ""ignorance is bliss."" This one can be expected to be heavily discounted at the stores. Save your time and energy level on this one.",Halloween
1170,moore-1561,"Good horror movie, but not when compared to the original",6,10 September 2007,"Here's the good: the movie was exciting, fairly scary, and took a new approach to the classic story of Michael Myers. I also enjoyed the character development of Michael Myers, which took him from disturbed child to demonic mass murderer. Director Rob Zombie certainly has established a unique and over the top blood and gore style, which many can appreciate, but at some point do ever you just want to stop and say ""Okay, I get it, you like blood"". Some problems I saw in the movie included the lack of suspense. In the original (and yes I will compare this movie to the original classic Halloween, because when you remake a classic you must be able to withstand these comparisons) John Carpenter creates a feeling of suspense that rivals the best of the horror film genre, and this is where Zombie falls not only short, but flat on his face. One other distinct problem with Zombie's film is his choice of actors, with a $20 million budget I guess I expected more than Zombie's wife playing the major part of Michael Myer's mother.",Halloween
1171,mastrim,Extremely disappointing,1,2 September 2007,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!I usually keep my opinions to myself about movies, but I really really feel the need to vent with this, and I feel better that I'm not alone on many of the things I felt were wrong with Zombie's so-called ""re-imagining."" Firstly, they made Michael Myers too relatable. In the beginning the viewer is made to feel sorry for him, and is actually cheering for him to kill some of his prey (namely his jerk of a dad), which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do when you are trying to make a scary movie, as opposed to an over-the-top gory action movie. The viewer get's legitimately scared when characters that they care about are at risk, if the viewer doesn't care about the people about to be murdered, then those people don't come across as human, but rather as mere fodder. Secondly, again with Michael Myers, he was an abused kid who takes his frustration out on small animals. This just brings back memories of NOES part 6... oh and apparently Myers was a KISS fan. Maybe it's just me but I preferred thinking of Michael Myers as normal kid with a totally normal upbringing who, for some mysterious and evil in how it blatantly contradicts reason, murders his own sister. It was much more creepy that way IMO. Thirdly, they screwed with the time frame way too much. I would have preferred it if they kept the movie to the 70s, but instead they moved it to the present-day. Also, they say that Mikey murdered his sister when he was 10, but 17 years later (or is it 15? I could have sworn at one point in the movie they said it was 15) he returns to kill his other sister. In the originals, Michael Myers is 21/23 when he comes back, so he would have been about 6 or even 8, but not 10. I guess the viewer just has to assume that Michael Myers is 27 in the remake... not a big problem, but it's just annoying to see Rob Zombie take such liberties with the time frame. Really, I don't care how old Michael is or was... but I really wanted this to take place when it should have. Fourthly, the pacing was all wrong for a Halloween movie. Unlike the first where the tension is allowed to build along with character development, in this the audience witnesses gory murder after gory murder with brief periods of character development squeezed in between (the bits with Laurie and friends especially feeling abrupt). There was much too high of a body count, and yes, there IS such a thing as too many fatalities in a horror movie, contrary to what Zombie and other gore-fanatics seem to think. In fact, as a movie on it's own, unlike the original Halloween, this one feels much more like a follower than a leader in the horror genre in that it relies so much on slasher clichés like nudity=death and helpless ditzy teens as fodder, speaking of which... Lastly, what did they do to Laurie's character?!!! In the original she is an intelligent likable character, but in this she's a ditzy teenager, almost an exact clone of her two friends in personality. I really felt nothing for Zombie's ""re-imagined"" version of Laurie as she haplessly scrambled about, making sure to constantly scream for help so Myers can keep on her tail. The original Laurie was pretty crafty and, when backed into a corner, would try to fight back (ex: trapped in the closet and using a coat hangar). That kind of resourcefulness is totally lost on neo-Laurie who only fights back when Mike prostrates himself before her, allowing her to take advantage (but, not nearly as much as she should have) of his brief period of weakness. Also there was the end which was a big abrupt and anti-climatic ""WTF?!"" that signals to me that Zombie had no idea how to properly end this movie in such a way to provide the same chill that the original's conclusion had. For a ""re-imagining"" there seemed to be very little imagination behind it. Everything that this film did differently than the original, it did out of either cliché or to merely add to the body-count. Seriously, it was just dumb, like ""leave a metal fork with a homicidal maniac patient"" dumb. Now for the good... uh.. well I liked hearing some of the songs from the original movies in here, like ""Mr. Sandman"" (though I prefer the faster, happier version in part 2) and ""don't fear the reaper"" (which they played in two death scenes... just once would have alright, the second time around it was a bit much). I also liked seeing the young Myers and Dr. Loomis talking together at the asylum, I always wondered how their meetings went.",Halloween
1172,gman_666,Surprisingly entertaining and exciting,9,9 September 2007,"As I sat back to watch this movie, I was preparing for a horrid abortion of the likes of Halloween Resurrection; but I suddenly felt really excited at the prospect of a new take on Michael Myers! Personally, I thought it was brilliant. Reading through the other comments on this film, it really depends on the person. Some people, like myself, prefer to be told what is happening and hate loose ends. Others prefer to be left in the dark and ponder on what could of happened. I thought the window into Myer's childhood was done very well, but I agree with some users finding Michael's return rushed and too short.But as you compare this movie to the original, it is easy to forget that the original was not that spectacular. There are lots of sloppy mistakes, if you want a list read through the trivia page of the original movie on this website; the original is too drawn out and takes nearly 40 minutes to even get any where. I really don't care about Annie or Laurie and how she has forgotten her chemistry book.I personally don't like Jaime Lee Curtis either, I do prefer the new portrayal to the old.If Rob Zombie's Halloween is not on par with the original then it is definitely the very best sequel/prequel/remake.",Halloween
1173,mikebrushedred,Unique Vision,3,8 September 2007,"Well, I can definitely agree that it is a unique vision. Rob Zombie took on the most epic of all slasher flicks, and butchered it with absolutely no sense.The tale of Michael Meyers is a tale of evil. As I watched this new Michael Meyers, I saw no evil.I'm not going to sit here and complain about the dialog (which really has no words to truly emphasize the failure of it), and I'm not going to cry about the vision of white trash Rob Zombie inserted into his version. I expect that out of a Rob Zombie film. What I'm going to complain about is the complete lack of respect for the character of Michael Meyers.Michael Meyers is evil in every sense of the word. He's not like Jason, where he kills because thats just what he does. Meyers kills with a final goal in mind - getting to Laurie. And thats exactly what he did. Until he dropped the knife, dropped to his knees, and pulled out a 17 year old photograph. Automatically, all sense of terror is lost. After his rampage, thats what it came down to for him? Why did he have to be provoked by Laurie to get back to the Meyers he has always been? Zombie made him weak. He made him remorseful. He took the psychopath out of him and made the audience lose respect for this sociopath that has caused nightmare upon nightmare.That brings me to the death of Loomis. Not only is it inconsistent with Zombie's own version of Halloween, but it serves no purpose. Throughout the film, Meyers always seemed to have a reason to kill. Kill those who are not innocent. The teens sneaking into his house to have sex. The guards who keep him locked up. The family that deprived him of life. So why kill Loomis? Why kill the one man who was always there for him? Who tried so hard to help him. And then not kill Laurie, who is also an innocent.Everyone can call this a ""re-invision"" of a classic, and use that to avoid the word remake. But when it comes down to it, its still the tale of Michael Meyers and he put that tale through a shredder. All dialog and setting aside, what made the film a failure was the failure of recreating Michael Meyers.",Halloween
1174,Levison-1,Excellent.,10,1 September 2007,"I just saw this movie yesterday in Queens, New York to a packed audience ... I think everyone had a great time. Perhaps the only problem was the great time everyone had watching Halloween, so many screams and jumps ... the audience became a little distracting.As far at the film goes ... Rob Zombie has seemingly come into his own cinematically speaking. The slightly ""Mtv"" feel of House of 1000 Corpses is pretty much gone, as well as the downbeat and bleak feel of the Devils Rejects ... instead what we have is an artist using his considerable sense of time and rhythm to make one of the greatest rewrites in the history of the horror thriller. What one has to remember is that this was first and foremost a summer movie, with all the thrills and excitement of a summer movie. This was not the down-to-earth art-house vision of John Carpenter; this was a great big scary movie to eat popcorn too. And at the same, Rob Zombie seems to have captured something lacking in the first film... which is a sense of the present moment.The true genius of this film is that Rob Zombie has captured our current fear of misguided youth in the context of the Columbine High School massacre and other tragic school shootings, some which go unnoticed in the underclass within the US. Watching this movie, one can't help but feel thrilled and terrified, yet also a compulsion to watch the movie unfold. Zombie does not take the Halloween myth and transcend the franchise ... Zombie simply reminds us that Halloween has always been larger then the sum of its parts including John Carpenter, Rob Zombie reminds us that Halloween has always been as American as Mickey Mouse or Pumpkin pie.So, should you pay the price for the ticket? Well, I'll put it to you this way ... in lieu of ""Superbad"" or ""Chuck & Larry"" I had an awesome time watching the movie and so did the audience.",Halloween

1176,edge2420,"An Excellent ""Re-Imagining"" That Pays Homage to the Original",10,31 August 2007,"People giving this movie terrible reviews are simply braindead; Believe me, I've seen Zombies other movies and thought they were ridiculous, over the top, etc; this is NOT the case with this movie, and frankly, I cant recall a single slasher remake that does as brutal and terrifying a job as this one accomplishes. This is a movie full of no-nonsense (and not over the top) brutal killing that does justice to the mind of a true pyschopath. Everything from the cool and dark look behind Michaels eyes, to his calm and terrifying mannerisms, right down to his targeting of even those closest to him, does justice to how twisted a human mind can become. We learn by watching that Michael is not simply an inherently ""evil"" monster (a la John Carpenter) but how individual flaws combined with a destructive environment create circumstances which twist and warp his mind. We see how the isolation of his institutionalized life further corrupts him, and how he learns to expand his ""mind"" beyond the realm of his cell in order to indulge in his fantasies. When he returns as an adult and begins his merciless killing on the way to his sister, he lacks the lifeless mass that Carpenter envisioned, and moves more like an enraged human being with murderous intent. He is intelligent and has patience, but moves brutally and kills like an animal. Thumbs up to Zombie for making a masterpiece, and for bringing it down for the human level in its brutality.",Halloween

1178,izeck,a more substantial look into the life of a killer,9,23 June 2008,"This film gets a bad rap because fans of the original film say it isn't a faithful remake. I however was also a fan of the original Halloween and I would pick this one over the original any day. Now before you go marking this review as ""not helpful"" let me just say that this is my opinion and by no means do I intend to speak for all of the ""original Halloween fans"". While this is not completely faithful to the original it succeeds in creating an all around more substantial piece of work. It also creates an interesting twist by following the character of Michael Myers more than focusing on the surrounding characters.Part of what made the original Halloween so horrifying was the fact that you knew almost nothing about Myers. Because of this the viewer could not relate to his character; He was something non-human, incomprehensible and his motives were ambiguous. This isn't completely lost in the new film but Rob Zombie gives you a wider scope into the life of Mike Myers and in the beginning I felt empathetic to him. I found myself relating more to Mike Myers' character than any other character in the film. This is part of why I liked it so much. Perhaps this is another reason the film gets a bad rap; Because people don't like to relate to killers. However, although you get a more in depth look at the life of mike myers which give incite to his motives, his motives only seem to stimulate his already present violent impulses.I suggest everyone give this rendition a chance. It is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The only thing I don't really like about it is all the sex. I feel like it subtracts from the all around scariness.",Halloween

In most cases they refer to Carpenter's masterpiece, instead of trying to look at this as a different take on a story.I for one enjoyed the movie from the beginning to end. I had very few problems with this movie. The biggest was that the actress cast as Laurie Strode just wasn't even comparable to Jamie Lee Curtis. But then I think that this is set in different time period, and I can tolerate her.Unlike some, I didn't think the film tried to make Michael a hero. It just tried to give some sort of background into a very disturbed man. The completely original parts before and during the asylum were brilliant, and I knew that there was no going back when Michael stabbed a nurse with a fork when she turned around to read a newspaper.The only things I found I just didn't like were: the fact that Michael survives some serious wounds throughout the 3rd act just to have his brains blown out in the end, and they killed Dr. Loomis (that madeeveryone I went to see the movie with very upset).All-in-all I enjoyed this movie. It was a great slasher flick, and it is the first one that has made me jump out of my seat in years. I think everyones problem is they are stuck on the ""classics shouldn't be remade"" argument. If you really step back and look at from the ""it's a re-imagining, it's not supposed to be the same"" angle everyone would be a lot happier.",Halloween

After reading the reviews on this, I wasn't expecting much. Then I saw it.Not a bad movie at all. As another poster said - you need to keep your head clear. This is Zombie's version not Carpenters. That said, I think it all works. The back story didn't ruin it for me. I though it was played well and while not really making one feel sorry for Michael it gives clues as to why he does what he does. I didn't read too much into it. As far as gore - well what the heck do you expect from Rob Zombie? There's a lot of gore AND sex (and Danielle Harris is worth the gratuitous nudity - check her out in 4 and 5 - you ain't never seen her like this before!) AND language. Some works, some not so well.Overall the movie succeeds. Myers is terrifying, the mask is perfect, and it is nonstop from about the halfway point.

The thing that people don't understand is the original Halloween is damn near the greatest movie of all time! of course a remake cant be better! But was it a bad movie? Was it another crappy Michael Myers flick? The answer is no. Its hard to top the original Halloween, but what Rob Zombie did was breathe life into the Halloween films after horrible sequel after horrible sequel. It showed that Michael Myers didn't have to die in the same film the Busta Rhymes movie career did.The first half of the film added life to an otherwise faceless serial killer. Sure we all know the back story from the originals but it added new back light to the twisted ming of Michael Myers and further showing his brutality carried out in child form.So all in all, it wasn't the greatest movie, but it should be shunned upon.

The movie itself is not bad, but if you have ever seen any other halloween movies you'll find out just how repetitive they all are. The movie is basically in two parts, a prequel when michael myers was a child which lasts about 30 minutes, and then the rest is practically a ""remake"" of the original. When michael myers is a child the movie is amazing. It is really a different and fresh angle of the character of myers. however, once the movie moves to the older michael myers it is bleak and boring. so if you want a generic, mindless slasher that is painfully predictable then this is your movie.",Halloween

Rob Zombie has stated that numerous times. I went in with an open mind and I loved this movie. I can't wait till it comes out on HD-DVD. I loved how he did the background on Michael Myer's. The original Halloween is my all time favorite movie. But the one problem I had with it is that they never explain why Michael goes after Laurie Strode until you watch Halloween II or you get a hold of the TV version of Halloween. People just need to learn to go to a movie for the enjoyment of it and stop being critical. But hey it's a free world and it's your money.,Halloween
1187,darrellkneice,Rob zombie is the king of modern horror,8,28 April 2021,I am not a big fan of remakes so this being more of a reimagining made me very happy to say the least. With that said I believe that Rob zombie is one of the best modern horror directors that we have the pleasure of watching his astounding work and I love the actors that he uses in his movies and he hand picks them all he is a very involved executive director producer and the other 10 titles I'm sure he holds. As for this movie I believe it is a great portrayal of Michael Myers as a child and his gradual progression toward the inhuman unkillable killing machine that he comes to be and everyone knows him for. Even though the original Dr Loomis character could not be played by the same actor I do think that they chose a good replacement actor for his role about as close as they could come to the original. I think that Rob zombie's portrayal of Michael Myers has him much more violent and he doesn't just stand around he actually runs after his victims which I thought was exciting. As always I will patiently await the next creation from our beloved Rob zombie and can't wait what kind of creation he stuns us with next.,Halloween
