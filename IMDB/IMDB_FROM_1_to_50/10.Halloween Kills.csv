0,nogodnomasters,Evil Dies Tonight,6,25 October 2021,"Michael Myers escapes a prisoner transport bus crash (they only move prisoners on Halloween) and returns to kill people. A vigilante group lead by previous survivors goes out to hunt him down. Do I need to tell you how it turns out?They didn't kill off Jamie Lee Curtis and her role was limited. I don't know what to say except, been there, done that, got the t-shirt. It is not bad and is keeping in line with the series. (The main series and not the Rob Zombie porn.)Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Halloween Kills
1,kosmasp,Sidelines to the front,8,28 October 2021,"Let's be clear, if you are out for a story, you very likely will not like this Halloween movie. There is little to none here, the focus being the Kills (duh, I know, the title is sort of a giveaway, right?). But it is not just the Kills, it is all the small roles from the Original finally getting their 15 minutes of fame - though for some it is way less than that.Now if you suspend your disbelief enough (especially when it comes to what makes sense or not, like how the Killer looks and who is being chased in the Hospital to name one example), you are going to be able to be quite entertained by this. It is a fan service - but it also may dissapoint some fans. Especially those who are here for Jamie Lee Curtis character - she is quite passive in this movie to put it mildly.That being said, there is enough tension here and the violence level is as high as any horror fan would wish it to be. There is even a scene with firefighters (and another one later on), that may remind you of action movies rather than horror. Still it works and the stunts and effects are as good as they can get.Giving us a motivation for Myers is kind of a risk - even more so, because apparently that does not involve Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) ... even if a sequel was not already announced, you'd know there is never an end. Even if there is one ... don't be mad at the characters here who seem oblivious to that fact ... even if they sort of come up with an explanation for the ""unstoppable"" force that is Michael Myers.A lot of throwbacks and winks to the fans of the original, starting once again with the opening credits. Love it or take it as pandering - up to you to decide. But you're better off if you go with the flow.",Halloween Kills
2,Sleepin_Dragon,"Halloween Kills, well it caused me some pain.",6,28 October 2021,"The latest saga in the world of Halloween, what an absolute mix of good and bad this was. It has the same feel as Halloween 2, the first time I saw that, a slightly patchy follow up.The previous film I really rather enjoyed, I was hoping for this to follow the trend, where the had the vibe of a horror thriller, this ventures more into the horror fantasy genre, Michael is transformed into some unearthly killing machine.The opening few minutes were awesome, I loved what they did, and how they did it, creative, well realised, and somehow respectful, it was incredible, it really did work. The core of the film was as you would expect, lots of gore, lots of violence, and the ending was again a mix of good and bad. It didn't have much in the way of suspense.The only upsetting death here for me, was the suicide, that was about the only time the screen went silent, it was a very upsetting moment.My favourite characters were Big and Little John, those guys were really good fun.It'll have its fans and its haters, for the season it's a thrill ride, does it enhance The Halloween catalogue, sadly not, it lacked structure, it lacked a cohesive narrative, it was just a killing spree slasher.6/10.",Halloween Kills
3,lee_eisenberg,evil is a state of mind,6,21 October 2021,"""Halloween Kills"" was pretty much what I expected it to be; after all, when do we expect anything highbrow in these movies? I did like Laurie's analysis of evil and how it transfers, though.",Halloween Kills
4,jboothmillard,Halloween Kills,5,27 October 2021,"The previous film, a reboot disqualifying all events from previous sequels, was a great return to form for the franchise, this follow-up was delayed by a year due to COVID-19, so I was hoping it was worth the wait, directed by David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, The Sitter). Basically, it opens with a flashback to 31 October 1978, the police are on the hunt for murderer Michael Myers (Nick Castle, the original Michael from 1978, and James Jude Courtney). Michael is cornered when he returns to his childhood home, but Deputy Frank Hawkins (Thomas Mann) accidentally shoots his partner dead while trying to save him from the killer. Michael is eventually caught, surrounded by many officers outside the house, and is incarcerated for forty years, until his escape. Returning to the present, Halloween night 2018, teenager Cameron Elam (Dylan Arnold) finds the dead body of Dr. Ranbir Sartain and calls an ambulance for Hawkins (Will Patton) who was left for dead after Sartain stabbed him. Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall), who witnessed the attacks of Michael Myers in 1978, is in a bar with fellow survivors Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens, reprising her 1978 role), Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards, reprising her 1978 role), and Cameron's father, Lonnie Elam (Robert Longstreet) to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Michael's imprisonment. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has escaped the house fire with her daughter Karen Nelson (Judy Greer), and her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). Firefighters responding to burning house unknowingly release Michael, who slaughters them with their own equipment. The trio are taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, where Laurie undergoes emergency surgery, while Michael continues his killing spree while heading back to town. Tommy, Marion, Lindsey, and Lonnie hear of Michael's return from an emergency news report. Bar patrons Vanessa (Carmela McNeal) and her husband Marcus (Michael Smallwood) supposedly encounter Michael in her car, but the unseen driver escapes unnoticed. Tommy forms a mob of vengeful Haddonfield residents to hunt down and kill Michael. Karen is informed that Michael is still alive but hides this from Laurie to allow her to recover. Allyson reconciles with Cameron, her ex-boyfriend, and she joins Tommy's mob to avenge the death of her father. Laurie and Hawkins both awaken in the same room and reminisce about their former relationship. Hawkins admits that he regrets not allowing Dr. Sam Loomis to execute Michael given the opportunity and vows to kill him. While warning the Haddonfield community to stay inside, Marion, Vanessa, and Marcus are killed by Michael. Lindsey escapes and is found alive by Tommy, Lonnie, Allyson, and Cameron. The group map out Michael's path and deduce that he is heading towards his childhood home. Tommy takes Lindsey to the hospital and reunites with former Haddonfield sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), whose daughter Annie was killed in 1978, and informs Laurie about Michael's survival. Michael's childhood home is now owned by gay couple Big John (Scott MacArthur) and Little John (Michael McDonald), Michael breaks in and murders them. While Laurie tries to leave, convict Lance Tovoli, who escaped Smith's Grove Psychiatric Hospital following the bus crash, and stole Vanessa's car, arrives at the hospital. The scared criminal is mistaken for Michael, Tommy's mob pursue him through the hospital, but Karen realises that he is not Michael. Despite her attempts to calm the mob and help Lance, he jumps out a window to his death. Tommy and the mob realise that Michael has turned them into ""monsters"" themselves because of their rage for his crimes. Laurie urges Karen to work with Tommy and Brackett to hunt Michael down. Elsewhere, Lonnie heads in alone to Michael's home and is killed. Allyson and Cameron also turn up and find Lonnie's body, and Michael attacks them, murdering Cameron. As Michael prepares to kill Allyson, Karen stabs him in the back with a pitchfork, steals his mask, and taunts him to follow her. She leads Michael towards Tommy's mob, who swarm, attack, and seemingly kill him. When the mob disperses, Michael recovers and massacres the entire mob, including Tommy and Brackett. Back at Michael's home, Karen finds Allyson who needs medical attention. Michael appears and stabs Karen to death in Judith Myers's old bedroom as Laurie stares out of her hospital room. Also starring Jim Cummings as Pete McCabe, Brian Mays as Brian the Bartender, Omar J. Dorsey as Sheriff Barker and Tom Jones Jr. As Dr. Samuel Loomis (a spitting image of Donald Pleasance). As before, Curtis goes from post-traumatic stressed victim to determined fighter wanting to end the maniac's reign of terror, and the indestructible killer is menacing enough. The previous film felt a bit fresher and more exciting, whereas this follow-up feels a bit samey, using the same predictable formular and slightly silly dialogue as past instalments, at least the over-the-top violence and inventive kills work well, and the fear of the people having consequences stuff is interesting, all in all, it is an alright slasher horror. Worth watching!",Halloween Kills
5,BA_Harrison,David Gordon Green sticks the knife in and twists it.,1,16 October 2021,"Those who thought that Rob Zombie was the worst thing to happen to Halloween, think again. David Gordon Green is the new boogeyman, out to terrorise fans of the original film with his atrocious approach to all things Michael Myers. I thought that his Halloween (2018) was pretty bad, but this follow up is an absolute travesty: the tone is all wrong, the dialogue is laughable, and the acting sucks. Sure, it features plenty of gory kills - and god knows, I love my splatter - but Halloween has never been about the gore. It's about atmosphere, palpable suspense, sheer terror, with believable characters you can care about. And Halloween Kills has none of that.Following a flashback to the aftermath of events in Carpenter's original classic (complete with CGI-enhanced Donald Pleasence lookalike), the film picks up immediately after Green's previous film, Laurie Strode and family driving away from the burning house in which Michael is trapped, presumably gone forever. Except that Michael never dies, and when a firefighter crew turns up to tackle the blaze, the killer emerges from the burning building to slaughter the lot of them.From there-on in, the film consists of a series of graphic murders at the hands of the 'boogeyman', resulting in the townsfolk of Haddonfield declaring enough is enough, and forming a mob to track down Michael and put an end to his grisly shenanigans once and for all. Don't they ever learn? Writer/director Green, once again assisted by Danny McBride, fills his script with characters who act and talk like idiots, and frequently places them in perilous situations from which they could easily run away, but never do. There are numerous touches of comedy throughout, none of which has any place in a Halloween movie. There's nothing funny about Michael!Jamie Lee Curtis is given nothing to do but pontificate from a hospital bed about the nature of evil. She's not alone: several characters expound long, boring and completely unnecessary theories about why Michael kills, when all we need to know is that he is pure, unbridled evil. It's been said before, and doesn't need expanding upon.There are so many awful scenes in the film that it's a tough call to pick the worst...The gay couple (who call themselves Big John and Little John) checking their house for an intruder is a serious contender, especially when the second bloke (Big or Little... I can't remember) spots Michael and just stands there waiting to be killed.Or could the lousiest scene be the attack on the car in the park, in which Michael kills one of his victims by kicking the car door, causing the person to shoot themselves in the head (it actually pains me to type that!)?Or does the film hit its nadir when Tommy Doyle (an embarrassingly bad performance from Anthony Michael Hall) rallies the masses in the hospital into finding and killing Michael? The crowd, chanting the slogan 'Evil dies tonight' ad nauseum, spots one of Michael's fellow escaped lunatics (who just so happens to wander into the building at the wrong time) and assume he is the killer. They chase him and trap him in a corridor. Terrified, the loony smashes a window and falls to his death on the concrete below. It's a terrible scene that adds nothing to the film except for the messy sight of a smashed body on the ground.In another ill-advised move, Green tries to placate long-time Halloween fans with nods to previous movies, the most obvious being the inclusion of the deadly masks from Halloween 3. It's not a clever touch: it's just a reminder that even the much-maligned (unfairly so) Season of the Witch is a far better film than the one we are currently watching.The movie's ending - another possible choice for most ludicrous moment - sees Tommy and his chanting followers finally cornering Michael and bludgeoning and stabbing him, then turning their back on him, only for Michael to stand back up and get in a few more kills before the closing credits. It's bad, not only for the way that the people allow themselves to be slaughtered so easily, but for the fact that it heralds another sequel: Halloween Ends, coming October 2022 (how I hope that the film lives up to its title).1/10 - I don't hand out the lowest rating lightly, but the way this film trashes the legacy of the original movie, it deserves it.",Halloween Kills
6,moonspinner55,"Well, the music score is nice...",3,19 October 2021,"Follow-up to, among other films in the canon, 2018's ""Halloween"", again directed by David Gordon Green, rather adroitly ties in flashbacks to--and new events from--that film and John Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" from 1978 (with Donald Pleasence lookalike Tom Jones Jr playing Dr. Loomis). Haddonfield survivors from '78's rampage band together with the 2018 characters to take down boogeyman Michael Myers, who somehow escaped the fire set by Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the last installment. But what begins as an interesting concept soon turns into yet another illogical hack-'em-up, with Michael's victims acting like foolish sitting ducks (in a ridiculous sequence, Michael eliminates each member of a firefighting team--one at a time, because that's the way they do things in these movies--leaving the whole crew decimated). Curtis, recovering from surgery at Haddonfield Hospital, consoles a wounded police officer who blames himself for Michael's killing spree (seems he stopped Loomis from shooting Michael in the head in 1978--but, since Myers ""isn't flesh and blood like the rest of us"", the conversation isn't useful or productive). When an angry mob finally encircles Michael and has him on the ground, one might think executive producers Curtis and Carpenter would be happy to call it a night...not in Haddonfield, it seems, nor in sequel-hungry Hollywood. *1/2 from ****",Halloween Kills
7,paul_haakonsen,"Sure, why not?...",6,15 October 2021,"First of all, I must admit that I have never really been much of a friend of the ""Halloween"" franchise, though I have seen all the movies. Might seem odd, right? Well, you're right. Sure, I've seen all the movies as I do enjoy horror movies and slasher movies, but I've just never warmed as much up to ""Halloween"" as I did for franchises like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"".So when this 2021 addition to the ""Halloween"" franchise was announced, I wasn't just exactly thrilled. But as I had the opportunity to watch it, of course I did sit down to do so.And sure, ""Halloween Kills"" is a watchable movie, and it certainly is among the better of the ""Halloween"" franchise since the original movie. But I have to say, though, that this wasn't a milestone in horror cinema by any account.The storyline told in ""Halloween Kills"" is adequate, although I found a bit unnecessary. But it made for adequate entertainment, given the sheer brutality of the murders committed by Michael Myers. And yeah, there were some pretty cool-looking kills in the movie, I will say that much. And those alone actually make the movie well worth watching.Sure, I was thrilled to have Jamie Lee Curtis return to the movie - yet again - but she didn't really play that much of a big role throughout the movie, so it was somewhat disappointing. But of course it was nice to see her in the movie, and she did add a good element to the movie. Judy Greer actually put on a good performance in the movie.Visually then ""Halloween Kills"" is top notch. It is a dark and gritty movie, and they definitely upped the game in terms of visceral kills that puts you right in the slaughtering gore.""Halloween Kills"" is a watchable and entertaining enough movie if you enjoy slasher movies, and it will definitely bring enjoyment to the fans of the franchise, of that I am quite sure.My rating of ""Halloween Kills"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Halloween Kills
8,preppy-3,Good sequel,8,5 November 2021,"Direct sequel to ""Halloween"" (2018). Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is in the hospital sufferi0ng from a stab wound she received in the previous film. She believes she has finally killed Michael Myers...but he's alive and slashing his way through Haddonfield.Good but VERY gory sequel. There are tons of vicious killings that I think went a little too far. On the other hand I liked it. It was great to see some of the original actors back in their roles. Especially fun was seeing Nancy Stephens who was killed by Michael (here and in H2O). Also the acting was great especially by Curtis and Anthony Michael Hall. A worthy if needlessly gory sequel.",Halloween Kills
9,CinemaSerf,"Poor remake, lacking inspiration or scares.",6,16 October 2021,"Ah, had only the contents of the trail been a tease for the rest of the film, rather than a reasonably comprehensive depiction of the best bits! Regrettably, this is a pretty poorly stitched-together rehash of the original with a rarely seen Jamie Lee Curtis still on the hunt for the murderous ""Michael Myers"". He is still loose, and is wreaking havoc - but how can they they track him down and stop him? I have to say that by around half an hour in, I felt that with no notable exceptions, the entire town of gung-ho eejits deserved all they could get from their avenging tormentor. The ""evil dies tonight"" nonsense just made me cringe, almost as much as the truly mediocre acting on display; a script - pretty much entirely devoid of humour - that could have been written by one of his victims and an ending, well I am sure you can guess. There are the odd scenes that are gory, but for the most part it is a poorly assembled and structured story that culminates in a pretty risible last ten minutes. Sorry - I know this film will appeal to ""Halloween"" die hards, and I was delighted to see it play to an almost full cinema on a Friday night (I saw ""Malignant"" (2021) in the same screen four weeks ago all by myself), but it's really all rather a let down.",Halloween Kills
10,Calicodreamin,Effective,7,15 October 2021,"While not perfect, this installment in the Halloween franchise was quite effective. The entire audience was screaming and shouting and just in general having a spooktacular time. The storyline was modern but yet paid homage to the original. The scares, the gore, the stupid decisions, it all came together to make one killer movie.",Halloween Kills
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Very different, and that's mostly good thing",7,22 October 2021,"Michael Myers(Jude Courtney and Castle, at his most sadistic, leading to an extreme body count and incredibly grisly gore. Some have questioned whether we're actually supposed to find it disgusting, and feel ashamed that we're continuing to watch. They have a point) survived, because of course he did(...well, no, I'm not complaining). Never underestimate the power of fan interest and profit motive. Once word spreads, so does a strong drive to stop him. This leads to armed mobs of civilians roaming the streets, trying to find and stop him. But are they actually counterproductive?Did they seriously try to put a message inside of a Halloween movie? Yes, and while I understand those who say that it ruins the film, in my opinion, it works more often than not. Unlike the 1980s, you can no longer simply do a slasher flick(a sub-genre that I continue to love) and expect people to be passionate about it; you have to be offering something else. The previous entry used an exploration of PTSD(which this tries to replicate, here expanding beyond the scope of one person and how that ruined her family, to an entire town, with mixed results) and a lot of elements that very heavily homage the 1978 original, to the point where its plot structure, among other things, is extremely similar. You can think of that one as proving to the fans that they share their love of John Carpenter's masterpiece, and that we should give them a chance with a more unique vision for the franchise. For my money, this one does do a largely great job at that. The fan service, however, is excessive, and often does more to hamper the overall effect than to improve the final result. Yes, bringing back so many of the OG cast members is impressive, no, sadly it did lead to this being overstuffed.I recommend this to huge fans of the two in the series that are in continuity with this, and make sure you watched them very recently, or you will definitely be confused. 7/10.",Halloween Kills
12,george.schmidt,You (seriously) can't kill the bogeyman!,8,15 October 2021,"HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021) *** Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, James Jude Courtney, Nick Castle, Will Patton, Thomas Mann, Jim Cummings, Dylan Arnold, Robert Longstreet, Anthony Michael Hall, Charles Cyphers, Scott MacArthur, Michael McDonald, Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens. Filmmaker David Gordon Green (who re-unites on the screenplay with Scott Teems & Danny McBride) returns to the scene of the crime from HALLOWEEN (2018) where the attempted kill of Michael Myers by the long-suffering Laurie Strode (Curtis back in Mama Bear mode) fails to stick to the landing letting The Shape continue his bloody carnage of vengeance & homecoming, albeit amidst Haddonfield up-in-arms with a vigilante group let by Strode's former babysitting charge Tommy Doyle (Hall). While there are some impressively cool kills with so many annoying new characters to knock off, and a decent body count the film only suffers in very little for Curtis to do let alone have a moment with her sibling rivalry.

13,trashgang,"excellent starts, drops in the middle, great final",7,18 October 2021,"Starts exactly were the 2018 left us. So if you do wants to understand the fire and the bleeding Laurie just watch the 2018 one first. Once you did it's time for this one.What I did like was the moment they explained what happened with Michael back in the seventies, his first kill on Halloween, take-outs from the first and second Halloween flick and they used Dr Loomis which made it so real. I was stunned. Opening titles, and then we go to the fire. Nice to see Michael coming out of the house, a bit exaggerated what he did with the fire brigade.Killings are messy and just on the edge of being gory but then it lost my attention a bit. To much blah blah, long time no see from Michael, laurie not being in it that much, left me bitter. The final did deliver and the final scene, well, you know what we can expect.So overall it's not that bad but it's still the same as always.

14,mm-39,Not as bad as I thought but not that good either!,5,22 October 2021,"Not as bad as I thought but not that good either! Halloween kills is not as bad as the woke predecessor! There was no woke Hollywood insulting 2 d characters of the macho super hero female character, the Lisa Simpon over explaining back female character, and the self doubt guy who cries and whimpers every 30 seconds annoying character. Halloween Kills actually has depth character, which reflects real people that the audience can relate with. Empathy for the victims and a story about the past fears tells a great past story. A good retro movie about a small town in fear. I thought wow real story development the first third was solid story environmental development. Suddenly, Halloween Kills has the town of Haddenfield turn into a un trained community watch group which is hunting for Michael Myers. Well written and directed until the mid point with a social message about mob riots which creates true evil town. In the end Michael is bulletproof, fire proof and indestructible to chains and bats. Maybe, a flamethrower would of worked. A disappointment ending. That is it ending there should of been more 5 stars.",Halloween Kills
15,deloudelouvain,The man that can't be killed or injured...,4,1 November 2021,"For Halloween yesterday I watched the new Candyman and Halloween Kills. Both movies have been done repeatedly and to be honest at one point enough should be enough. Candyman wasn't bad though but it's nothing like the first movie when it was all a surprise. Halloween Kills on the other hand is just another movie too much. Nothing new, Michael Myers can't be killed, it doesn't matter if you stab him, shoot him, set him on fire, he just can't be killed nor injured. It's getting lame to be honest. Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't a huge role and that was maybe best like that. I hope this one was finally the last one because there's no milk to be milked anymore here.",Halloween Kills

Really it's plenty of killing, rage, and blood and gore.You find Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) in a hospital from her injuries and the film also does fine to flashback in time to show the past of other characters and how the story and saga has continued since 1978. As many clips and scenes are shown from Carpenter's 1978 original, the whole town is looking for Michael and blood and gore is spilled it's like you can't keep evil or the boogeyman down. Nothing great still it's a watch if your a fan of the series as the violence and evil blood gore does not stop with this horror legend icon in one Michael Myers.",Halloween Kills

And Halloween (2018) GREAT, Halloween Kills...meh.Thanks to Peacock, I'm gonna rewatch this, probably this weekend. For starters, I just finished it and I'm puzzled on how this got made and need to see it again to figure out something, anything. Some clue on what the writers were thinking. It felt like there were 6 writers, none of which met each other followed by 6 editors who just lost their sight.When the movie begins there's a flashback to the original film and my immediate thought: well, that ""looks like the classic, but doesn't feel like it at all. Clearly there were two different directors."" As the movie progressed, I felt the same for the director of both Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills....even though they are the same person, they looked the same, but felt wildly different.The same part I probably liked best: on how many characters they took from Halloween (2018) I wanted to see more of last time around and had such small roles beforehand. Honestly, I don't have too many more positives here. I think I'm giving it 3/10 stars because I'm biased for this series and characters and while it's bad, it's not Halloween: Resurrection or Halloween II (2009) bad.Hard to describe the plot, but it follows some of the subplots/locations of the original Halloween II, but mixed in a ton of III and 4. Michael's on his set path of destruction, Laurie did even less in the hospital than she did in 1981 and Dr. Loomis shows up and looked even more creepy than Carrie Fisher or Peter Cushing in Rogue One.I believe the next/final (ha) one is named ""Halloween Ends.""

Michael Myers is again free and he is searching for his next victim.Since I had already watched all the previous movies of the ""Halloween"" franchise I knew what I was about to watch and there was not any surprise. The direction which was made by David Gordon Green followed the same pattern as the previous movies of the franchise without something new. For one more time the interpretation of Jamie Lee Curtis who played as Laurie Strode was very good but she was not as good as in the previous one. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Will Patton's who played as Officer Hawkins, Andi Matichak's who played as Allyson and Judy Greer's who played as Karen. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Halloween Kills"" is an average horror movie comparing with some of the previous movies of the franchise and I do not believe that it adds anything on this.",Halloween Kills
22,cruise01,Halloween Kills is thrilling but lacks everything from the first movie.,7,18 October 2021,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Halloween Kills is a pretty fair slasher film that follows right after the last film. When Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) thought she killed Michael Myers. He comes out of the burning house and is back on the killing spree. Tommy (Anthony Michael Hall) bands a community together to help and fight back. To kill Mike Myers once and for all.Halloween Kills is everything you can ask for a slasher film. Different in tone from the first film. This film has more of a bloody and gory body count. While the other movie had more of an intense thrills.What worked? Well Halloween Kills does have a lot more body counts deaths which you can expect for a slasher film. Check mark that off the list. Mike Myers walking in a path and killing anyone he sees. Breaking into peoples homes and slaughtering them. And posing the dead bodies in a disturbing way. Tommy who is a character from the original Halloween movie bands a community to help face the evil. With the help from other survivors from the original movie. This can only help set up a higher body count. Even during the climax of the film which becomes a blood bath.The cast ensemble was decent. Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, and Andi Matichak are back. Andi Matichak going with her boyfriend and his father to help hunt Myers down. Jamie Lee Curtis spends the whole movie in the hospital and sitting on the sidelines in this sequel for now. While Judy Greer is stuck in the hospital when chaos is breaking loose with people living in fear. And paranoia. Anthony Michael Hall is a new addition playing a previous character was a great addition.The music score by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, and Daniel Davies was great and menacing.What did not work? Like all slasher films and characters falling for the whole making stupid decisions and getting killed off. The previous sequel Halloween at least had a smart script which had characters trying to trap Myers. However, Halloween Kills falls for the characters making stupid decision. Everyone setting up for there own trap and getting killed. The script is filled with characters making dumb decisions and slasher horror movie clichés.The plot also felt like a middle chapter with setting up the after math of the movie. While making the community fall into chaos while Myers is back on his killing spree. Not really much is thrown with the plot. The one thing that was interesting with the concept is the theme of essence of evil with Myers about him transcending every time he kills. And his obsession with his old home. Without giving away any details.Halloween Kills is an okay sequel. The script fell into the horror slasher cliché with a thin plot. While setting up for a third film.",Halloween Kills
23,zkonedog,An Embarrassing Take On The Halloween Legacy,2,23 October 2021,"When Blumhouse's 2018 ""Halloween"" hit theaters, it was billed as the franchise sequel that would be the most faithful to the spirit of the 1978 original. While that film was a mixed bag in terms of overall quality, it now seems like a masterpiece compared to the near-complete incompetence of ""Halloween Kills"".For a very basic overview, ""Kills"" picks up right where the 2018 effort left off. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is in the hospital with daughter Karen (Judy Greer) & granddaughter Allyson (And Matichak)--all recovering from their horrifying ordeal--while The Shape (aka Michael Myers) escapes his presumed fiery grave and proceeds to his old Haddonfield home, leaving a trail of carnage in his wake.Getting right to the point here, there is not a single idea that works in ""Kills"", and many puzzling filmmaking decisions are made. Some examples include:-The Strode family--such an interesting dynamic in the first Blumhouse one--is largely inert here, largely constrained to scenes looking worried in the hospital.-A supposed theme of mob mentality? Almost laughable in its execution. I'm not sure what would be worse: if it was meant to be serious or joking.-A big selling point of ""Kills"" was bringing back some legacy characters like Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall), Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers), Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards), & ""Nurse"" Marion (Nancy Stephens). Regrettably, not one of them is given an ounce of interesting character arc. Hall's Tommy is especially egregious in its cringeworthy nature.The one scene in this movie that I actually enjoyed? A flashback to that fateful night in '78 that fleshes out a few behind-the-scenes details. Though somewhat sad to say, it took being placed in that exact environment to make me feel anything. The present-day material from the writers and filmmakers certainly wasn't doing enough to make that happen.As the minutes ticked on during my viewing experience of ""Kills"", it became clear to me that this movie was all about the carnage being inflicted by the jump-suited boogeyman. Almost torture porn-esque in certain spots. Had this been a Saw sequel or some B-horror schlock, fine. But for a franchise that seems to want to bask in the aura of the original (more focused on thrills than gore), this decision seems wildly out of place.To a certain extent, ""Kills"" also suffers from the ""second in a trilogy"" conundrum in which the stakes are relatively low when the knowledge of a third entry (""Halloween Ends"" coming 2022) is already on the books. Yet, I'm not going to let this one off the hook that easily. As the legend goes, when John Carpenter was asked/forced to pen a sequel to his masterwork he was utterly terrified. He went out on his boat with a copious amount of alcohol and churned out what ultimately became 1981's ""Halloween II"". As flawed as that movie is, it still remains the best attempt to capture even a glimmer of what happened in 1978. ""Halloween Kills"" certainly did not in any way, shape, or form.",Halloween Kills
24,eddie_baggins,This franchise dies tonight,4,4 November 2021,"There's a scene very early on in David Gordon Green's follow-up to his surprise 2018 smash hit Halloween, where we venture back to seemingly unkillable mass murderer Michael Myers bloodthirsty beginnings of 1978.The police force are out in numbers to track him down, Myers is on the loose and potentially hiding anywhere in the small town of Haddonfield, with a scene showing a kindly police officer pulling up alongside four children enjoying their night of festivities as he then proceeds too ask them if they've seen a man in a mask as his just killed a number of people in the neighborhood, unfortunately they haven't seen him, which is sad news for the policeman who suggests to the children they should probably go home now before driving off into the night.Considering this scene plays out around the same time we cut back to the 2018 timeline and witness a heroic firefighter take to a very angry Myers with a firehouse whilst he marches towards him with a crowbar like tool of death and mayhem, you quickly begin to realize that Halloween Kills is going to be one of those films that features a plethora of dumb people, doing dumb things, in dumb situations with Myers and his chaotic carnage only able to carry Green's film so far as it struggles to make an ounce of sense or find a justification to exist.We are repeatedly told throughout the course of Kills that ""evil dies tonight"", a slogan and battle cry that a very sweaty Anthony Michael Hall's Tommy uses to rile up the citizens of Haddonfield into a frenzy as they charge around hospital wings and dimly lit parks to hunt down a Hulk like killer with baseball bats monikered Ole Huckleberry and weapons they have no idea on how to use after Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode (here getting screen time that amounts to laying in a hospital bed wincing or wandering with grimaces around a hallway after muttering some mumbo jumbo about Myers being evil incarnate) and her family fail to put an end to Myer's existence in the finale of the previous franchise entry but the only thing that ends up dying in this installment of the Halloween brand is enthusiasm one may've had heading into watching the film.Working once more with screenwriter and friend Danny McBride to bring Myer's back to the big screen this time around, in what has been long planned to be a trilogy of films with the next entry Halloween Ends due sometime next year, one of the most frustrating aspects of Kills is that somewhere inside it there's a really fun ""one night"" horror/thriller that could've existed and some scenes in the film must surely rank up there with the most gruesome and memorable of Myer's kill cannon but these well structured moments of carnage or intrigue are always quickly undone by the next dimwitted character decision, daft dialogue or nonsensical story arc, that when you bury down into it amounts to Myers merely wanting to head back home to stare out a window while everyone else believes his concocting a master plan to bring Haddonfield undone once and for all.There's likely to be many viewers that find Kills incessantly stupid moments and undercooked elements too lame to handle, while long term Halloween fans may find simple joys in seeing Myers go about his grisly business once more (with another killer John Carpenter concocted soundtrack to boot) but regardless of where the end sentiment falls, it's hard to get excited about where this modern day version of Halloween ends up while it continues to be held back by fire hose heroes and mobs of vigilante seeking citizens that appear to not understand you're able to run away if need be or attack in a group when a lumbering murderer is loose on the streets.Final Say -You don't need to scratch the surface of Halloween Kills to gain an insight into its daftness with only a handful of well designed scenes and blood letting all that holds up this sequel from being one of 2021's biggest misfires.2 car doors out of 5.",Halloween Kills
25,Tweetienator,Let Michael Rest In Peace,3,17 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is a mindless splatter movie, and that's already all that the movie got for you - some well staged killings. The rest is a rather tiresome affair, including characters who I can't related to and don't care for. The story? Just filler time till Michael does his next job. Is it the worst Halloween movie? I don't know, because all those new additions of the late 90s and after 2k I watched only once and are hidden behind a dense cloud named oblivion. To be honest, I can't remember anything of those movies. Verdict: Halloween Kills won't get a recommendation, but if you just need some dose of splatter, you may give it a try.

There is very little downtime in this movie. If you get up to go to the bathroom, you're almost guaranteed to miss something that you don't want to miss. The cast is also strong with standout work from Anthony Michael Hall. Unlike the recent 007 movie ""No Time To Die"", ""Halloween Kills"" respects the franchise and tries hard to give the fans of Michael Myers what they want. Honorable mention: having scenes of ""Minnie and Moskowitz"" playing on the tv. (I saw this movie last night at the Regal in Westbury, NY.)",Halloween Kills

This picks up immediately after the finale of the previous film where Michael Myers continues his killing spree across Haddonfield. Laurie (Curtis), Karen (Greer), Allison (Matichak) and Frank (Patton) are hospitalized, but the town decides to stand up to evil after 40 years. This isn't bad, but could've been better in my opinion. Some of the characters make poor choices, the apprehension of Michael in '78 is absurd and the ""Evil Dies Tonight"" quote was a bit much.

29,jtindahouse,Awful characters and adds nothing to the 'Halloween' universe,4,15 October 2021,"'Halloween Kills' is the definition of a sequel for the sake of making a sequel (or more accurately the sake of making money). It not only adds nothing to the story, it destroys some of the good things from the 2018 version. I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time with the COVID delays, and I sadly have to say it was not worth the wait at all.The characters in this movie were atrocious. Firstly, they destroyed 'Laurie Strode'. Not only does she do absolutely nothing in this movie, she is rude to kind nurses and assaults a doctor. Yup, that'll get us on her side. But that wasn't even the worst of it. The side characters they created for this film were embarrassing. There is a scene where a character just stares at 'Michael Myers', says something to the effect of, ""Michael, you've come home"", and then just stands there and waits to be killed. That's the worst example of it, but this is very much a rinse and repeat thing throughout the film.The pacing of the film is all over the place too. There's a very strange and uninteresting opening scene. Then we get a couple of admittedly great scenes with the firefighters and in a house with a couple. At this point I was having a good time. 'Michael' was ferocious and in no mood to mess around. Then we hit a wall and frankly never recovered. Even at the end when the film should be building up to the big conclusion, it feels like it's stuck in first gear.Also there's a subplot involving a mental patient that is just unpleasant. It's not scary, it's not clever, it's just depressing and unnecessary (and quite insulting to the audience that we are expected to buy it). I didn't find much to enjoy about this film sadly. It looks great and the start was decent. Otherwise though it's not one I can recommend. 4/10.",Halloween Kills
30,Stevieboy666,"Great kills, poor plot",5,19 October 2021,"Part two of the recent (and unnecessary) Halloween franchise reboot, knowing that The Shape/Michael Myers will be back for Halloween Ends it is obvious that this is just an inbetweener movie. Like my title says the movie contains many gory deaths, as a put your brain in neutral slasher flick it is very effective. Sadly the silly plot really lets things down. An insult to the original movies. One of the most entertaining things is a gay couple, Little John and Big John, they provide some funny humour, however I don't think comedy has a place in the Halloween franchise. This movie is way too far fetched, it's laughable. If a nuclear bomb was dropped on Michael he'd still be standing! I always say that Halloween H2O should have been the end of it, but when Halloween Ends is released in 2022 you can be sure that I'll be buying my ticket. Kills 8/10, plot 3/10.",Halloween Kills

There are people that show up that are from the original 1978 Halloween movie that were kids back then-Kyle Richards is among them-and there are new people playing some of the grown up versions, too. Anthony is one of the new ones-he is playing Tommy-and he is hell bent on killing Michael Myers. Jamie has top billing but she spends most of the time in a hospital-kind of like she did in the second Halloween-and she doesn't even have any scenes with Michael Myers here. Judy returns as her daughter and Andi is her granddaughter, both from the 2018 installment. There are flashbacks and Easter eggs scattered through out, including one for the third Halloween movie which wasn't even about Michael Myers. The usual violent kills are abundant and the ending leaves it open for the sequel-Yes, Halloween Ends comes out in 2022, but I doubt it will ever end. Basically, if you like the series-I do-then you will probably like this one, too.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, grisly images, drug use and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.I liked it and would buy it on DVD.",Halloween Kills

Here is a copy & paste comment from my review of Halloween 2018""This Halloween film needed to much more violent imagery for me to get a gut-deep bodily response and stimulus for a true visceral reaction experience I was hoping for. While the film appealed to my nostalgic like of the 1978 film. This incarnation did not push the envelope to be the Halloween that , the 1978 version, has always deserved"".I am happy to report that Halloween Kills 2021 Director David Gordon Green swung for the fences.Michael Myers, once again , feels like a unbridled force of nature; Halloween Kills knows what you're here for ...and the film delivers ! The kills are much more creative , gory , fun and brutal this time around. The script is pretty ludicrous. This may hold the film back for some. But if you embrace the lunacy in a ""so bad it is actually good frame of mind"" it IMO adds the the enjoyment with its ridiculousness of the character stereo types, genre tropes and violent chaos. I really want to go off and talk more about this film but do not want to spoil anything . It will be fun to read others thoughts on Halloween Kills as we all see things differently :)I did not read any professional reviews before hand but I did sneak a peak and they were pretty dismal.Here is the thing...... I had a gut instinct that what the lackluster reviewers took away from the movie, that I would actually walk away polar opposite and very satisfied with this Halloween Kills 2021 effort . And my gut instinct was correct ! Halloween Kills brings on the crazy and I can not wait to watch it again .The film has some great over the top exaggerated fun characters, creative cinematography, tight pacing , visceral kills , bat - s h i t crazy script a unique take to John Carpenter's vision.Overall great film and excellent addition to the American slasher film genre .8/10.",Halloween Kills

S. flames douser will NOT just hand over his fire axe or chainsaw to any maniac standing within arms reach, with which said miscreant can immediately hack or slice him to death. In the first place, the standard protocol at a smoking problem scene is to use a lot of police tape to cordon off a ""no go zone"" for the general public. Only authorized first responders are allowed inside this working precinct. Everyone else MUST stay outside the line, ESPECIALLY homicidal monsters. The main duty of the fire chief or deputy captain in charge is to use his .357 to take out any chainsaw killers threatening to breach into his subordinates' working area.

Needless to say Michael Myers survived the fire in the previous film and sets forth once again on a path of mayhem and murder. But it's not just Michael who goes wild, Simpsonsesque mobs charge around a hospital seeking Michael, determined that te evil will die that night. Hysteria and victimisation are subtly dealt with in this film even if the determination of Myers' surviving victims to kill him is justified. A gory film, Michael slays firefighters using a Halligan Bar, then turns their own tools on them , including an angle grider cutting into a head. Stabbings abound as does eye-gouging and impaling. Some really disturbing scenes with a more than adequate number of jump shocks. The tension is generally maintained throughout but two scenes could have been edited: the mob charging around the hospital; the survivors at the start of the film reminiscing about 1978 in the local bar. Maybe ten minutes cold have been shaved off the running time. The film also flips back to 1978 at times, revealing new facts about what took place then.

38,questl-18592,Halloween Kills... My Enjoyment,3,29 October 2021,"By way of disclaimer, I think it's worth starting this off by saying I've only ever seen three Halloween movies. In order, H20 (which I barely remember), the original (which was at a drive-in with awful sound) and now this. Suffice to say, I don't really have a connection or history with this material. Kiiiiinda why I think this movie isn't for me. There is a lot of nostalgia, a lot of ""Hey, remember when we all dealt with Michael before?"" and I'm just like, ""No?"" So, gonna look at this as someone coming into all this fresh and... That doesn't paint this movie in a good light.I kinda hated this.Is Michael supposed to be an immortal killing machine, cause I always thought that was Jason's gimmick? There is no way this dude isn't dead like a LOT in this movie. Beyond that, is there a reason he is silent ALL the time? Pretty sure there's no way someone endures what he does without at least a grunt. Especially a 60 YEAR OLD MAN! Look, being 60 doesn't make someone inept or anything, but I doubt Michael has a membership to Planet Fitness, health insurance, a stable diet... How is he in this supernatural form!? Unless we're just saying he's not human at this point, but that feels boring.Anyhow, enough of me bagging on the slasher icon. There are other problems here too. I think this plays too heavily on the nostalgia and the idea that someone has seen all of these. It's possible to make a movie late in the series that's still accessible to people. I hadn't seen most of the Fast and Furious movies but for some reason I saw Hobbs and Shaw and I still got it, because they lay enough of it out there to let new people in. It also falls too hard into old slasher tropes. For instance, the people are *!)&$* stupid! It doesn't address the cell phone issue and why people aren't just calling people...Overall, I think this is a disappointment of a movie. It just doesn't make sense, it's too catered to old fans and the 'villain' just feels dull and unrealistic. There's no charisma or intrigue or anything compelling about it. To quote Dean Winchester, Halloween Kills is so vanilla that it makes vanilla seem spicy. It's a well shot, nothing of a movie that I'm struggling to remember half an hour after watching it.",Halloween Kills
39,aidanratesmovies,Beautifully Brutal Sequel that takes the franchise to a new level,9,15 October 2021,"Brutal, terrifically acted, and incredibly entertaining- Halloween Kills is a mind-bogglingly unique horror sequel that incorporates the best of the franchise like the film before it, but with a completely different spin. I don't care what the critics say, I really freaking enjoyed this movie. And as someone who has seen every last Halloween and Michael Myers centered film- I think this is by far the most honest review you will read out there. No this film is not perfect, it's a bit over dramatic at times like the film before it, and the plotting is a bit weaker this time around. However, thanks to the brilliant direction from David Gordon Green- this film just works so tremendously well. You'll be on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Everything is paced so beautifully and done to such perfection, you can't help but admire the beauty of how everything is put together- as horrifying as it may be. As I said before the acting is a lot better this time around, with an all out cast of returning characters and actors- as well as the brilliant Anthony Michael Hall as Tommy Doyle- who just steals the show in every scene. The kill scenes are so well done and so effective and brutal- it's impossible to not squirm in your seat. The cinematography is also excellent all the way throughout with some incredibly unique shots, as well as a perfect rendition of the original Halloween night in a classic 70's pov. In the end, Halloween Kills is yet another great sequel from the minds of David Gordon Green and Blumhouse entertainment- and I can not wait to see what will happen in the franchise next.My Rating: 9/10.",Halloween Kills
40,masonsaul,Flawed but fun,6,31 October 2021,"Halloween Kills has a lot of problems and definitely feels like a placeholder until the next one but it's still fun, almost gleefully violent and slightly unpredictable with an interesting message.

41,rgkarim,"It's Got Kills, Some Nostalgia, and Gore, but This Halloween Kills Horror/Thiller/And Scares",6,16 October 2021,"LIKES:The Nostalgia Factor:
The opening of the film takes us back to the night that started it all, and it's a wonderful recreation to sort of whet the appetite and explain the ties some of the characters of this film. That opening is only a superficial intro to all the nostalgia factors that they loaded in the movie, working towards the goal of baiting you back into the fanbase and generating more cash for the film. That nostalgia factor is fun to look out for, finding relics to the movies now alternated to non-canon, and is fun for rewatches to see what you can find.Pace:
The movie does not take long to dive into the antics you love about Halloween, establishing the terror and killing that Meyers is known for. Once the opening number finishes, the chaos of the Boogeyman begins to unleash itself upon the town at breakneck speed and seldom deviates from the formula. Those who don't need complex tales and character moments, have nothing to fear past the first act, because there is plenty of the flash in the pot moments to get you ingrained.The Multiple Aspects:
This ""killer"" flick, goes down the formula of multiple mini tales moving in sync with the serial killer combining them all and it works pretty well to keep things lively. This sequel is all about bouncing between the groups out on Halloween night, and trying to do its own brand of representation in between the groups scattered around the Indianapolis town. You'll find your favorite collection to follow, and waiting to see which ones will fail and which ones will triumph. It keeps the feeling of the hunt at large and helps integrate all the players without losing much traction, so kudos for that approach.The Music:
I love the soundtrack for the series and the haunting scores designed for this film and the chilling feeling you get from it. The familiar techno piano track welcoming you into the night of terror is of course the star, but there are other scores that are as deep and haunting to sell the tone of terror and remorse that comes with those scenes. It's a subtle feature that works so well, and should call the fans of the series into the experience even more.The Acting:
For what it's worth, the acting gets props for the characters put into this film. The leads do a fine job with what they are given, selling the terror, the frustration and the antics that are at large. All the single minded and simplistic characters have their moments brought out in full swing and you can appreciate them selling the cheesy lines and dialogue these movie are made famous for. Many of them look to be having fun, and there are moments where we dive into deeper character waters and pull some of the layers that the original series held. As for the screaming and dying aspect, yeah, most of the cast has that down and reacts quite well to the fictious mauling they receive.The Killings:
Let's face it, you are coming in for the thrills, chills, and kills that this series is famous for and no surprise, the title tells you what's in store. Meyers carnage is bloodier than ever, and ready to give you that taste of carnage that we all seem to love in this series. You've already seen an opening moment from the trailers, but again it's merely a scratch to the crazy, hyperbolic death montages that will arrive. With the sensitivity down in this age, the amount of blood and graphics have escalated to give you the same vibes the reboot movie did. There are some clever moments to the carnage, and a new edge that puts the killer nature into a new light that shows just how much influence these killers have on the world. It's definitely the highest point of the film and for fans of the series the ultimate line to reel you into the film.DISLIKES:The Plot:
Actually the lack of plot is better, because unlike the first saga of this movie, the plot is surprisingly stretched and weak compared to other installments. Halloween Kills goes more into the carnage row than the plot we've grown accustomed to and tries a symbolic approach instead of the usual threadbare storyline. There is little character development to be pulled in, little story to uncovering more of Michael and how to stop him, and lacking some of those connections the original series, or the predecessor held. It's a bit disappointing to be honest, but it works with what it can do given the focus on the kills.The Stupidity Of the Characters:
I'm not saying they've been the brightest bunch of bulbs in the past, but this film really dumbed down the characters logic to the point of absurdity to make them cannon fodder. Sure there is some ability in some of them, but the rest are just mindless extras that did little to impress compared to the top films is sad to see diluted in the modern era.The Acting/Characters:
While never expected to be Oscar worthy, I can't say that the performances were nearly as strong as they were in the last reboot. Once more, the movie dilutes the quality acting and gives us these lamer characters to portray, with dialog that does little but to impress teenagers into being tough and foregoing logic. I know, you are really looking more for victims, but some of the bit to the originals comes from the fact of them having a surviving chance and requiring some level of strategy and surprise to kill them. However, the acting is simplistic, and a bit overacted, with little control and balance to characters that make that difficult to achieve. It's not my favorite group to come in and there are roles that need a little tweaking at times to be honest.Lacking Suspense/Scares:
The movie franchise for horror has to work a lot to make me jump due to my desensitization of the franchise, but in this case it was very anticlimactic. Slasher films seldom have the strategy and smarts, but in the past there was at least some suspense and fun to be had for who would survive the ordeal. In Halloween Kills though, much of the group is easy to predict, and combined with the lack of intelligence in the characters, that goes up in flames. A step back into the art of slasher films could really help this series and straying from the artistic/moral driven moments that do little to elevate the scene. Speaking of which:The New Angle on Horror:
Yep, in an age where we have to put a lot of politics into the film, not even the cheesy slasher movie can escape the new age of driving a point into your brain the way Michael drives a knife into the victim. Halloween kills detracts from the sole slasher and decides to instill an artistic lesson into the movie and paint a new terror. Relevant? Absolutely, but in a film like this, making a gigantic third of the movie to detract from Michael and try to humanize him is not the direction the film needed to go. It does little to add to the selling points of the movie, and in all honesty could have been done much better than the in your face components we got. As the ""force"" spreads, that motif bleeds into a new approach to facing Michael, and again does little in the grand scheme of things than bloat the movie's run time.Jamie Lee Curtis' waste:
Understanding she is not the spry individual she used to be, Halloween at least gave her character a new run and involvement in battling Michael to the point of still being the beloved heroine we loved. In this case though... nothing, reducing the woman to a logical, monologue toting speech maker that really does little in the tale. There are attempts at story, attempts to dive deeper into the psyche of the woman who has hit so much, and that is fine and dandy. However, her involvement is sort of tangential, and seeing the spearpoint dulled was not the way to go to this movie given the synopsis, the previous movie, and the potential she could have brought. It was the most disappointing factor of the movie for me, and though realistic given the small time lapse... it's not the direction fans will go for.The VERDICT:
Halloween Kills is not the awful, cantankerous movie some call it, because it still has elements that make the series the same ""loveable"" cult following it always has. It's fast, it's simple, and it's loaded with the gory and cheesy kills that made this franchise the legendary horror it always totes. Michael's latest adventure has those elements that are just alluring enough to come in and stay, with the finish that this adventure started long ago. However, the movie has lost a lot of the other tropes that made the installments more of an exciting adventure that we got immersed into. A story that does little to elevate things, alongside characters that are one dimensional and boring are really poor choices for keeping me int eh series, especially lacking some of the smarts and bravado that made the early ones much better to watch for me. Throw in trying to tie a new angle to the mix, and dropping Jamie Lee from the main works, is something that was very disappointing in terms of suspense. The movie is just a fun gore fest, but in terms of the elements of suspense and horror, it's a bit of a dud in those regards for yours truly. Overall, the movie is fine, but given they offered it on Peacock, the quality mirrors the streaming platform for yours truly.My scores are:
Horror/Thriller: 6.0
Movie Overall: 4.5-5.0.",Halloween Kills
42,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Halloween Kills,7,16 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is a sequel of a sequel of an original of a sequel. Just kidding. But seriously though, ""Kills"" is the twelfth film in the Halloween franchise canon. Its story picks up right where 2018's Halloween left off. Halloween Kills, well it's an appropriate title. Michael Myers (the bad guy, duh) ""kills"" just about everybody in this flick. We're talking recurring characters, new characters, long-lost cameos, and paper mache denizens just waiting for the slaughter. He even comes off as an action star doing some serious Van Damage. ""Evil dies tonight"". Uh, not exactly (spoiler).Halloween Kills is also made for the die hard fandom of Halloween franchise mongers everywhere (I'm kinda one of them). It bleeds nostalgia, weaving tons of persona arcs, new revelations, and story-lines from Halloween in Haddonfield circa 40 years ago.As a modern-day follow-up, ""Kills"" has huge intentions and grated enthusiasm. It doesn't want to be middle-of-the-road stuff (like tons of other direct-to-video swipe). Director David Gordon Green's vision rather, is to be faithful and further the origins of Halloween's fanciful notion from 1978. Heck, even Donald Pleasence shows up CGI-style (it's an impressive feat).Helmer Green goes a little 70s with a few zoom shots in ""Kills"". He also gives Jamie Lee Curtis a pseudo break from raged vengeance and lets Anthony Micheal Hall's Tommy Doyle get his angered revenge on (welcome back Gary Wallace). Halloween Kills doesn't have the most creative ""kills"" in the series (that honor goes to 1981's Halloween II). It's still pretty violent and the blood, well it flows like Merlot-d red wine.""Kills"" is a decent combination of brains and well, brains (of the squishy kind). It's truly the dark second act of a trilogy that will give us Halloween Ends in 2022 (no happy ending here folks). Based on the box office take of these new Halloween endeavors, there's always more tricks to be treated.",Halloween Kills
43,vengeance20,Evil Dies Tonight!!,9,16 October 2021,"Have been anticipating this film since Halloween 2018 which I found to be a bit of a let down & lacking, but when I heard of this film, I was hoping for it to be better & boy did I get it!The film continues on the events from the last film directly & sees the whole town of Haddonfeild clubbing together to take down the monster Michael Myers for good!I found the film to be good, ok, not quite as gory, but still pretty damn close to it that's for sure! The violence was pretty epic for what it was & the scares were ace! Yes, there's no focus on a specific character, but hey who cares!? The story is simple also & straight forward, that's not an issue! Moreover is the fact that the film continues on directly after the film & sort clears uyp loose ends & back tracks to 1978 also which was good! The violence & body count are revved up in this sequel & put the 2018 film to shame! The eye candy is good also!Overall it's an ace sequel! Don't listen tot eh haters, watch it for yourself!9/10!",Halloween Kills

45,m-47826,Stole the prize from under Zombie's nose...,1,18 October 2021,"As most unwatchable Halloween entry. Complete hit rock bottom. The 2018 movie was bad, but not THAT bad. So bad I deeply wish I could send a big fat « serves you well! » to these bozos who thought they could reinvent the franchise, with such revolting movies. Everything I thought was missing in the previous movie, is there. Only it is only showing how unskilled, disingenuous and tacky their intents are. Where is the horror in seeing people being butchered in the most inane way? And how can you take any of this seriously? Even Saw movies plot holes made more sense. This is just laughable, when you're in a good mood. And straight out infuriating, when you know you paid to watch this. Who are they kidding exactly? And more importantly, who are these people giving it a 5 and beyond?! This is trash, pure and simple, and a sad excuse at another unwanted political message, in the genre. With an acting so bad it should be illegal. But who can blame them? The directing sucks! And that ending... It is unbelievable the bad name movies like these are giving the slasher genre, when it is usually seen as a subcategory of horror cinema. Well thanks to Kills, nobody can argue with that now. Why even bother with Ends? I'm maybe too harsh, but all the pretentiousness regarding the way the movie was made and released, is only asking for these bad reviews.",Halloween Kills
46,arungeorge13,"Haddonfield residents -1, Audience 0, Michael Myers 1. [+43%]",4,19 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is that dull, patchy middle piece that serves as nothing more than a brutal murder showcase for Michael Myers. The story doesn't progress at all, and even though David Gordon Green brings back some characters from John Carpenter's 1978 original to play key roles, the film feels muddled. It is challenging to stay truthful to Carpenter's work and the follow-up 2018 flick and not give away too much in terms of plot or character development. There are some great cinematic shots (such as Michael popping out of a fiery blaze and that entire climactic stretch where an angry mob surrounds him). Still, Halloween Kills struggles in its storytelling department - one moment, it tells that Michael isn't after Laurie, and then in the very next scene, subverts that idea altogether.Halloween Kills introduces many characters, but it is easy to see through the makers' intention of building them up only to be egregiously bumped off by Michael one by one. These are the idiotic cardboard characters we see in lousy slasher films. None of them can fire a gun to save themselves; they all patiently await their turn to attack Michael; a few even believe that a tiny cheese-slicing knife or a baseball bat is sufficient to hurt a towering killer. The only characters worth caring for, the three generations of Strodes women, all have somewhat meager roles to play. While it is understandable that Laurie's involvement is being kept aside for the trilogy's finale, she spends almost the whole time in a hospital recovering from the wounds she suffered in the earlier film - a bit of a disappointment, honestly.The theory of Michael being an unstoppable, possibly supernatural force is introduced very late into the film, when that could have been its starting point. This is what I've heard Carpenter mention umpteen times in his interviews, and Halloween Kills tries to stick to that notion even though the subtlety of it is completely lost on the viewers. Also, this time around, Michael's way more vicious. Some of the (random) kills seem to have been shoehorned into the screenplay to raise his ""savagery"" factor. The violent mob scenes at the hospital are straight out of a Purge movie, part of which reminds you of the Capitol building incident back in January. The political messaging here is weak, however. The film, as a whole, lacks soul.",Halloween Kills
47,Analog_Devotee,Wow...,3,15 October 2021,"The ending to the 2018 film was way too satisfying to be undone for such a mediocre, convoluted, needlessly padded and ultimately underwhelming sequel.So disappointing.",Halloween Kills
48,btreakle,Halloween kills,8,20 October 2021,I thought this version of Halloween Halloween Halloween kills was probably one of the better ones and the franchise and I would highly recommend us to anyone who is a Halloween fan J meeting Jimmie D Curtis and Judy Greer were both excellent in this as well as Anthony Michael Hall so definitely it must see.,Halloween Kills
49,Pumpkin_Man,"The True 'Revenge of Michael Myers' is a Fun, Nostalgic, Brutal, Gory, Bloody, Psychotic Blast!!!",10,16 October 2021,"I've been a die hard fan of the Halloween series ever since I was eight years old, and of course I absolutely loved this newest installment. It's different, and very fast paced. It goes by so quick because there's so much stuff happening, so you better pay attention. If any movie deserves to be called 'The Revenge of Michael Myers' it's this one! If you love and adore slasher movies and the legacy of Halloween, you'll enjoy this one. The music was top notch. The flashback scenes were done really well. It looked just like 1978 and the Myers house looked just like the original. I was very impressed.Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie is kind of on the back-burner in this movie, but I expected that. It's similar to her role in Halloween II 1981 where she stays at the hospital the whole movie, so if you're expecting a huge showdown between Laurie and Michael, you'll be very disappointed. Anthony Michael Hall was great as Tommy Doyle. He steps up and becomes one of the leaders in the fight against Michael. It was also great and refreshing to see Kyle Richards back as Lindsey Wallace, Nancy Stephens back as Nurse Marion Chambers, and Charles Cyphers back as Leigh Brackett. James Jude Courtney is still awesome and brutal as Michael Myers. Judy Greer steps Karen up and gives her more character development than the 2018 film. Also, Andi Matichak is awesome as Allyson. She's thirsty for blood and out to hunt down Michael, along with the mob.The mob was a different, intriguing and interesting aspect of the film. It was touched on in Halloween 4, but this time, almost the entire town is out to destroy Michael. There is a subplot at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital that many people probably won't care much for, but I liked it. I'm very open minded.The 'fancy talk' that Dr. Loomis used to spew in the original films, is definitely cranked up to 100 this time, mostly involving Tommy, Laurie, Karen, and a surviving character from the previous film. At times, it can be cheesy, but that's to be expected in a slasher film.There are many nods and easter eggs to the past films, mostly regarding the infamous Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween III: Season of the Witch.There are two new characters introduced that I feel almost steals the show, for the better. It's the couple who now live in the Myers house. They were fun characters, and I enjoyed seeing them together.The only gripe I had is that I thought there were gonna be a lot more deaths than there were. Don't get me wrong, there is a decent amount of fun gory kills, but everyone overhyped it and I just expected there to be more. That's my only small complaint.Michael is just unstoppable this time around, and I LOVED that. There was one scene in particular that was so epic to me, that I shed a few tears. He's more supernatural this time around and I like that there's hardly any explanation for it. Michael is just evil, that's the only explanation needed.Halloween Kills picks up on the same night as Halloween 2018. I always love when sequels take place right after the other. The firefighters come to put out the fire, and of course, Michael Myers is waiting for them, to begin his next round of killings. Laurie Strode is taken to the hospital, along with her daughter Karen, and granddaughter Allyson. Once word travels around Haddonfield that the Boogeyman is back with a vengeance, Tommy Doyle leads a mob of angry residents that will stop at nothing until Michael is dead, but that's easier said than done.I was happy and satisfied with the shocking ending. It just means that no one is safe, no matter how much you like the characters, everyone is fair game to The Shape.If you love horror movies, slashers, the Halloween series and the character of Michael Myers, I would highly recommend HALLOWEEN KILLS!!!",Halloween Kills
50,Xstal,Shalloween Shallowscream Shlasher Shocker...,4,26 October 2021,"A continuation of the shambles and charade previously unleashed, once again a shield is the best deployed to guard your gaze from the shambolic and shameful shenanigans that shovels the proverbial into buckets.",Halloween Kills
51,gedikreverdi,He's transformed Haddonfield,8,16 October 2021,"It reminded me of Halloween 2 because Laurie is at the hospital heavily sedated at both the sequels. So she's neither the final girl nor the leading character but it's very nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. The film contains some flashbacks to the Halloween when the first movie takes place and the officer that killed his partner accidentally in the Michael's house and stopped Dr. Loomis from shooting him so he feels responsible and he is in a hospital bed with Laurie side by side and it turns out they were somehow into each other in the past. (And the actor who plays Dr. Loomis looks so much like him and it gave me the goosebumps).The kills were very gruesome especially the mass killing when they stop to warn the kids at the playground and Michael displays the bodies later on the playground. And then the elderly couple flying a drone in their house, the couple that bought Michael's house. He killed a lot when locals wants to lynch him and then he killed Laurie's daughter at his sister's room. But what I like most is the chaos at the hospital and the way how Michael transformed the people in Haddonfield so much so that they caused an insane man jumped from the window at the hospital.It's very gory compared to the previous film and it tries many things that has never been done in this franchise and it seems to work so well.",Halloween Kills
52,hnt_dnl,Terrible movie with really dumb characters,1,15 October 2021,"I've never been the biggest fan of the Halloween franchise, but at the end of the day, I know what feels like a good movie and even if I don't care for a series, if a movie within the series is good, I will gladly acknowledge it. HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021) is most definitely not that! Just like in any movie, what I want is internal logic and character consistency. People always use the excuse that characters in horror movies are supposed to be dumb and make mistakes, but unless it's some parody or spoof, the decisions that characters make should be internally consistent and for them to be relatable to the viewer, externally as well. The character decisions in this film were mind-bogglingly stupid!Jamie Lee Curtis was barely in this movie and she's the headliner. Laurie was literally in the hospital for the entire movie while most of the action took place in the streets of Haddonfield. And sadly in the little screen time she got, Laurie sounded like a philosophical rambling lunatic! But she wasn't the only character. For some reason, EVERY character spent the bulk of their time pontificating about evil and Michael Myers and when they actually were face-to-face with him, acted like total dummies.Where to start? First, the character of Tommy (dubiously played by 80s icon Anthony MIchael Hall) is the worst character in this movie! When he gave that incredibly bland and weird monologue at the bar recounting the events of the 1978 movie, I knew that this film was going to be odd. He spends the entire movie playing a fake tough guy wielding a baseball bat and forming and inciting a town mob to track down Michael Myers. Hall's acting is so 1-dimensionally loud and obnoxious and I didn't buy this character for a second. And there were way too many close-ups of him. He was featured so much that he felt more like the main character than Laurie.Second, the cops were totally useless. Why is the Sheriff even allowing Tommy and this mob to get so out of hand? He literally gave one order at the aftermath of the fire massacre, telling his cops to set up a perimeter around the town, then spent the remainder of the movie doing nothing. For some reason, none of the police in this movie (and there were a bunch of them) ever did anything to try and stop Michael. It was always armed civilians trying to do their job for them. The cops didn't even try to stop the mob at the hospital and were never roaming the streets looking for this serial killer, who was so easy to spot. You had a perimeter set around a small town for a killer who was leaving a trail of blood easy to follow and you couldn't catch him?This leads to all the dumb actions of the characters in this movie. Why did no one ever just run away when confronted with Michael? Characters could easily just get away from this guy who was WALKING, but instead they opted to stand there and try to fight him. The group in the car could have just driven away, but nope, let's sit here and battle a crazy killer! The gay couple who lived in Michael's old home were cringe. None of their jokes landed and instead of just leaving the house they decide to stay there. Michael was upstairs and they were safe downstairs, so where do they go? Upstairs, of course, and the one guy just stands there and let's Michael mutilate him. Why did no one use a cell phone to call 911 when they were in danger? It's like writers were confusing the 2018 scenes with the 1978 flashbacks and forgot that the modern day characters actually had cell phones.Other issues. This movie had really bad editing with weird and untimely scene transitions to the point it felt like scenes were interrupted abruptly. Characters spent a bunch of time rambling about evil dying tonight. Moments that should have been sad and heartfelt were incredibly bland and empty. Michael's kills were all dragged out ad nauseum. Characters were obviously dead yet Michael kept on going for like 2 extra minutes after each kill dragging it out unnecessarily. Also, how on Earth did the old lady at the farm survive Michael shoving that glass light bulb through her neck? He almost took her head off yet somehow she was still alive. How did Michael even get by all those people downstairs to Karen in the end? And where were the cops during all of this? This is a murder scene where 4 people got killed and it's a bunch of civilians, yet again, doing their job for them.What was that weird scene with the 1978 flashback of the young cop stopping Loomis from shooting Michael? He had just accidentally killed his partner so if anything he should want revenge on Michael for forcing him to do that. Why would Loomis give up just because this rookie cop stopped him one time? Why would he care what this kid thinks when he knows the depths of Michael's evil and menace? What were the other cops doing just standing there? Why didn't any of them stop Loomis? Apparently, they were OK with him killing Michael, so how did the rookie grabbing Loomis' hand one time have any effect? Loomis or the other cops could have easily still finished Michael anyway. Made no sense.Finally, the dialogue and acting in this movie was so bad. Most of the conversations felt unnatural and the tone was inconsistent. No one talks like the characters in this movie. And there are actually several good actors in this movie, but they couldn't overcome the terrible writing. I actually watched the predecessor Halloween movie from 2018 on the same day before watching this sequel to prepare myself and I honestly thought the 2018 film wasn't very good. But Halloween Kills is so bad that I might re-evaluate my opinion of that movie because at least it had a semblance of decent writing and simplicity that Kills completely lacked. Halloween Kills is a contender for worst movie in the entire franchise and that's saying something as there are some real bad ones in the mix.",Halloween Kills
53,Fernando-Rodrigues,The Terror Continues!,6,16 October 2021,"McBride, Green, and Teems are repeating here, on a larger scale, the same writing mistakes from the 2018 reboot. First of all, this movie is NOT the worst of the franchise, but it's not the best. It has its chaotic and bloody moments, but this film has pacing problems. And I mean it because it feels like you've watched a filler episode at the end. Maybe I was overhyped by it, because it sold itself as a quintessential Halloween movie, and it's just a camp horror that goes nowhere, and its script (full of cringe lines) could've gone FURTHER. I'm not disappointed because I hope this is just a setting for the third entry, and I may learn to love this one on my next rewatchings.",Halloween Kills
54,dtucker86,Forty years ago....,5,15 October 2021,"At the time of its release in 1978, who would have guessed that Halloween would become the longest running franchise in Hollywood history next to James Bond and Rocky. Its just the story of a masked killer who goes around slashing people to bits, boy how did they get so much out of so little? There are serious pros and cons about this movie. I will list them as follows
PROS:
As always Jamie Lee Curtis ROCKS. I would rank her among the greatest actresses of all time. She has created an amazing body of work and its unfair so many just remember her as a scream queen. She is really amazing as Laurie who has more demons in her then a haunted house. She spends most of the film in a hospital bed but still dominates every scene she is in with dignity and power. I also wanted to mention its kind of ""cute"" for the director to include five characters from the original film that survived the first massacre, Tommy, Lindsey, Marion Chambers, Lonnie and former Sheriff Brackett (played by the same actors). There is a scene where they are in a bar at the opening and Tommy gives a chilling monologue about what they went through, sadly at the end of the film only Lindsey is alive.CONS:
This movie so damn bloody and gross. What made the original Halloween a classic was that John Carpenter was such a genius he realized that gory special effects don't make a great film, another celluloid genius named Alfred Hitchcock rarely used gore. Carpenter relied on things like spooky music and sound effects to create an eerie atmosphere. The director of this film to me is a bumbling wanna be for he just serves us a disgusting plate of blood and guts well no thanks. There is a scene where Myers pushes his thumbs into a guys eyeballs bursting them and another where a man leaps to his death from a hospital window and we are treated to the sight of his ruptured brains upon the ground. Also I wanted to mention that I hate how this film ended where Laurie's daughter Karen is killed just before the final credits, hasn't this poor woman suffered enough. She is stabbed repeatedly and the director makes us watch the slashes and her screaming like its something entertaining.",Halloween Kills

56,Anurag-Shetty,Halloween Kills almost kills this franchise.,6,1 November 2021,"Halloween Kills takes place immediately after the events of Halloween(2018). It's the next chapter in the long running saga of Michael Myers(James Jude Courtney, Nick Castle) & Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis).Halloween Kills is a film, that's just about passable. Returning co-writer/director David Gordon Green & co-writer Danny McBride have really struggled with this second movie in this three part sequel trilogy to Halloween(1978), which includes Halloween(2018), this film & next year's Halloween Ends(2022). The dialogues are cringe-worthy. I really can't decide whether this is a legitimate movie in the Halloween franchise or, if it's a spoof. The decisions that the characters make are laughably ridiculous. There's just a lot of gore but, zero jump scares, suspense or creepy moments. This is a real letdown after Halloween(2018), which is my favorite film in the franchise. However, I've only watched Halloween(1978), Halloween II(1981) & Halloween(2018). The background score by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter & Daniel Davies is mind-blowing & is the highlight. The main flaw of this movie is that, Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode barely has any screen time. However little screen time she's given though, she's the standout performer in all her scenes. Judy Greer is spectacular as Karen. Andi Matichak is impressive as Allyson. The supporting cast is great & I appreciate the references to the 1978 original. I really hope Halloween Ends(2022), is the end of this never-ending franchise. Halloween Kills is not worth a watch, unless you have some time to kill. It had so much potential though. Co-writer/director David Gordon Green & co-writer Danny McBride really need to overcome a lot of flaws to make next year's Halloween Ends(2022), as memorable as Halloween(2018).",Halloween Kills

60,wetmars,Evil Dies Tonight!,8,17 October 2021,"I must thank God that they didn't do the same old crap that H4-6 and the Rob Zombie's Halloween movies did because I was worried they were going to fall into that again. The Burning Pumpkin opening sequence was incredible. The soundtrack is absolutely stellar, all thanks to our beloved John Carpenter. The 1978 flashbacks were amazingly spot on, it makes you feel like you were in 1978, and the cinematography was amazing. If you didn't know, they didn't deepfake or CGI someone to look like Loomis, they actually did makeup and prosthetics, and it is gorgeous. A couple of scenes that really do pump your adrenaline, and a lot of awesome gory kills! I do feel like this was scarier and better than the 2018 film. I will say that it was great to see the old cast returning. Tommy was a wonderful tough presence. I was quite sad to see him die. Speaking of the kills. I feel so bad for that guy who escaped and from Smith's Grove, and the people thought he was Michael meanwhile Karen was keep screaming that he wasn't Michael, and she was being ignored. That hit me deep in the guts. I loved how Karen was protecting him, locking the doors. As the crowd tried to get to him, he chose to jump off the building since he didn't want to get hurt. He was so scared. =,( God damn, man. I think this one is my personal favorite kill. Although Michael didn't kill him, the gore effects were astounding. Definitely taking the first place being the goriest Halloween movie, don't even believe the Parents Guide. The movie said a lot about society and said it well done. We Humans are truly evil, and against each other.The scene where the firefighters were watering down the house as Michael killed them one by one was great. What makes it greater is the shot where he steps out of the house, and you can see the firefighters' shock seeing him. They gathered out fire axes and some saw-blade thing coming together to fight him, but it led to them being killed by the stronger upper hand of the Shape. That scene where Michael murders an old couple in their house was satisfying when he was picking what kitchen knife he should use (( he lost it in the fight. )) and stabs the knives on the guy's back. Oh, that moment when Michael slammed that car door on the Nurse, and the gun fires back at her. Beautiful. Although, I am somewhat disappointed by the lack of Laurie Strode. But, it makes sense that she needed to recover from the wounds she got from Michael. About Michael, he is absolutely ruthless in this one. His mask looks way more badass with the burn mark on him. ""I must thank God that they didn't do the same old crap that H4-6"" About that, they almost did the same thing where Karen was presumably taken by evil as she was standing over the same spot where Michael's sister was killed but died due to Michael. Karen was a likable character than she was in the 2018 movie. She seemed pretty smart. Props to her kicking a lot of azz. It was sad to see her go. Although, I do agree that the rules of a horror movie are that someone important has to eventually die. Big John and Little John were enjoyable characters. I laughed so hard when one of them said: ""One cold night, Michael Myers stabbed her sister in the tits."" We can all agree that Cameron was an azzhole in the 2018 film. He cheated on Allyson, AND THREW ALLYSON'S PHONE INTO A BOWL OF PUDDING! But, in this one. He became a redeeming forgiving and likable character. His death was completely brutal. I thought he was going to be decapitated judging by where his head was placed. Speaking of Allyson, she was portrayed better and tried to put up a fight with Michael. There is not that much to say about her, but hopefully, we will see her character develop in the next film since it has been confirmed that we are getting a big-time skip. That scene where Michael is faced with the town of Haddonfield was probably the best scene, it was a slaughterhouse, and the soundtrack was so god damn amazing. Michael would later get his azz beat up by having a knife stabbed to his neck, with multiple brute forces like that lovely little callback where a citizen fires at him six times. I love the narration of Laurie here as Michael rises, and begins his massacre. ""I always thought Michael Myers was flesh and blood, just like you and me, but a mortal man could not have survived what he's lived through. The more he kills, the more he transcends into something else impossible to defeat. Fear. People are afraid. That is the true curse of Michael. It is the essence of evil. The anchor that divides us. It is the terror that grows stronger when we try to hide. If they don't stop him tonight, maybe we'll find him tomorrow. Or next Halloween, where the sun sets and someone is alone. You can't close your eyes and pretend he isn't there. Because he is."" That gave me some chills down my spine. And of course, a cliffhanger! Great unexpecting last five minutes of the movie. I think this was a good decision to do a cliffhanger because you don't want to use that same old method where Michael is defeated, then revived in the next movie, and repeat. I can't wait for next year!Now, for all of those who are complaining ""Oh, what is the point in making more Halloween movies. Just kill Michael off already!"" Not sure if you heard of this, but Michael is arguably a supernatural being. This isn't supposed to be all realistic, you know. But, I do agree that the paramedic twist in Halloween: Resurrections was one of the worst BS writing ever done in Cinema History, and cheapened H2O. Like, how did he survive being pinned by a van against a tree? Not taking his mask off / screaming. Besides my rambling. And yes, of course, the dialogue isn't all that strong, don't expect every horror movie to have interesting dialogue, a tight plot, and the slasher to appear long as the runtime. I don't think the acting was bad, but it was the script. I do agree that the movie was too marketed, and kind of ruined the movie. ""Oh, not enough gore!"" We got that a lot in the final trailer, but if you didn't see it and watch the movie. Too many trailers that we got, even though we fans were hyped for it. It is a slaughterhouse. Is the movie perfect? No.8/10.",Halloween Kills
61,Sir_AmirSyarif,"All filler, no killer",3,27 October 2021,"David Gordon Green's 'Halloween Kills' shows that the residents of Haddonfield are utterly powerless to defend themselves against a single guy, even with all the weaponry at their disposal. Worse, the town's cops are as incompetent at upholding the law and managing their firearms. It doesn't help that Michael Myers is a one-man army on the verge of becoming superhuman. Everyone in this one deserved to die because of their pure stupidity. All filler, no killer.",Halloween Kills
62,kjproulx,A Very Solid Sequel with Some Horrible Dialogue,7,18 October 2021,"I have a very strong love/hate relationship with the Halloween franchise. I think the original Halloween from 1978 is a very solid slasher flick, but it also feels very dated today. After the endless number of mostly poor sequels and even a remake by Rob Zombie with another sequel (which I very much disliked), I slowly started not caring about the franchise as a whole. Then they decided to release a direct sequel to the original film back in 2018, ignoring all of the films that came after and they surprisingly struck gold in my opinion. 2018's Halloween isn't a great film by any means, but it brought back the feel of the original and I may even say that I prefer it to the original. For that reason alone, I was intrigued as to where they would take this series next. Halloween Kills is now playing in theatres and here's why I believe it's pretty much just as good as 2018's Halloween (for different reasons).Picking up immediately after the events of the previous film, Laurie Strode (played once again by Jamie Lee Curtis) is being rushed to the hospital. Spending the majority of the film in the hospital, the film focuses on a number of side plots to further this story while she is laid up. More than half of this film is devoted to a storyline that involves the survivors of the original 1978 film and that was easily my favourite portion of the film, even though most of their dialogue was very clunky and overwritten. Many performers from the previous film also make a return and have bigger roles to play here, but it really came down to the simplicity of this movie that won me over.There are very few locations here. Aside from the hospital, a few scenes on the streets, the police precinct, and some homes, this is a very confined movie. Halloween Kills exists simply to further the murder count of Michael Myers so that when Halloween Ends comes out next year, the finale of the Myers character will feel earned. Due to this though, there are many instances where it felt like the writers didn't have anything for characters to say. The word ""Evil"" is said far too many times throughout this film (referring to Michael) to the point where I actually began to find it annoying, rather than be in terror like these characters were. The repetitiveness of the dialogue in this film actually hurt my enjoyment of an otherwise great entry in my opinion.When it comes down to it, everyone just wants to see Michael Myers deliver on clever kills. If you're going into these films hoping for something more meaningful, I think that's a mistake right off the bat. Looking at this film from that lens, it's a terrific Halloween film. The issue is that the issues with this film are very apparent. Again though, it's hard to pick this film apart when it's very clearly just trying to be one thing and it does exactly that.In the end, Jamie Lee Curtis is solid once again as Laurie Strode (even though she doesn't have much to do here) and all of the supporting cast is doing their best. I especially liked Anthony Michael Hall as grown-up Tommy from the original film, but again, some of his dialogue is atrocious. It really came down to the screenplay for me here. The same lines are muttered almost constantly and it made for an irritating experience in that respect. If you can get past the repetitiveness as I did, Halloween Kills is a solid sequel and if the ending of this film says anything about next year's Halloween Ends, I""m very excited to see how this all comes to an end.",Halloween Kills
63,kuarinofu,You still expected it to be good? A 13th film into the franchise? Did you?,4,16 October 2021,"The biggest problem with the film is that it's not funny enough to be a gory dark comedy. Oh, it's not supposed to be a comedy?I don't think most of the viewers had any hopes for the 13th installment to surprisingly be good.I'll be honest, I've seen only three films of the franchise before 'Kills', all of them titled just ""Halloween"", 1978, 2007, and 2018.Halloween Kills tries to be gory funny nonsense, and some people may enjoy that, but we're already past 12 films, why not just leave it alone? I'm not saying that all sequels should be the same, I'm saying that at some point you should stop so you don't have to waste your time on creating garbage like Halloween Kills.The film was stupid, not particularly haunting or tense, full of weird characters and weird choices. As a cherry on top, we got some hamfisted social commentary. Instead of a haunting atmosphere, we just get some basic Halloween decorations and masks (probably a reference to H3 but I haven't seen it, just bits). Stuffing the film with references, music, fonts, scenes, actors, morgue nametags didn't do anything for me at all, since I'm so burned out after so many franchises were mutilated by producers to milk some nostalgia money.I did like the kills though, those were great.",Halloween Kills
64,Movi3DO,It's aight,5,17 October 2021,"Halloween: Mob PsychoThe attempt to rebuild the Myers franchise continues and we returned right after the event from 2018.The story aimed toward the theme of mob mentality and deindividuation. The people of this town were terrorized by the man with the white mask long enough that this Halloween they tried to be the hunter. Honestly I almost thought they pulled it off. However, near the end when some character had to do voiceover to reiterate the theme, the movie became kinda lame.The characters were boring. I didn't root for any of them, because I'm pretty sure that won't be able to do anything against Myers and just get slaughtered one by one.This led to my favorite part of the movie, Michael Myers himself. He was just as menacing with the old and slightly melted mask. He walked past houses and people died. The gore was plenty and entertaining. The scene where he killed a character at the stair was quite alpha.Overall, an okay slaughter fest from Michael Myers. 6/10.",Halloween Kills
65,DarthVoorhees,Vastly disappointing,5,28 October 2021,"I can only relay what I thought going in. I was a huge fan of the 2018 'Halloween'. I thought for the most part it was fresh and scary and added to the mythos and so I was very much looking forward to 'Halloween Kills'. I will say though that in my original review I thought that the 2018 film didn't lend it's self well to setting up a sequel. There are many branches in the story of Michael Myers. I know he will never be ""killed"" but trying to continue this story from the previous entry definitely ended up being a thankless experience. 'Halloween Kills' is a thematic mess with no real reason to exist other than being a sequel. It counts on us having nostalgia for characters from better entries because otherwise there is nothing and no one to care about here. In the long run I thought it was very mediocre. It's a movie full of set pieces and yes some do work. When the film tries to say something it is a pretty inept venture.The Achilles heal of the film is it's myth making around it's main character Michael Myers. The only breaks we get from the carnage are when our characters discuss the ""evil"" that must die tonight. The movie doesn't know what Myers is. Every character and every line of dialogue is designed like it is meant for a trailer or a tagline for a poster. Nobody sounds organic. To some Michael is an uncomplicated base evil and to others there is a vague supernatural tint in how he is discussed. The base idea of Myers turning the people of Haddonfield into monsters isn't a bad one but there's no build up. Everyone is dialed up immediately. The movie has nowhere to go.James Jude Courtney is probably the best Michael Myers we have had in the series. There is acting behind the mask. He is very frightening. This isn't a movie for the faint of heart, 'Halloween Kills' is probably the bloodiest film of the entire series. I know the body count is probably the highest. That isn't necessarily a good thing though. In order to achieve this carnage we are introduced to some of the stupidest characters I've seen in one of these kind of movies. 'Halloween Kills' feels like the kind of movie 'Scream' tore down years ago.It isn't an entirely worthless film. I guess I may just be a big softie for the series but I did enjoy the prologue visit to 1978 even though it was a blatant nostalgia trip. And I'll be there for 'Halloween Ends' which it feels like the story that the people behind this movie want to tell. As for 'Halloween Kills' this is close to Rob Zombie 'Halloween II' quality and that is very very unfortunate.",Halloween Kills
66,jp_91,The night I came back to the movies. Evil dies tonight.,7,15 October 2021,"After three years of waiting and tremendous excitement, tonight I went to the premiere of ""Halloween Kills"", the result is bittersweet. The beginning is brutal, followed by incredible opening credits, in addition to the appearances of Charles Cyphers, Kyle Richards and Nancy Stephens reinterpreting their iconic characters from the franchise, also return other important characters from the first film and archive footage that pays tribute to some characters who have been killed by the horror icon Michael Myers, which led me as a fan to smile and get excited. The big mistake of ""Halloween Kills"" falls on the middle part that becomes faggy and does not finish starting. Jamie Lee Curtis is tremendous as Laurie Strode although this time the aforementioned character remains as a dramatic element and not as an opponent for Michael Myers. The filming locations provide a good atmosphere of horror and nostalgia, the cinematography is good, the script could have been better since it is unstable but it is interesting as it shows the human fear of the unknown, unfortunately this element is not well taken in some scenes, the editing is great because it plays between horror and drama, the makeup effects are excellent, the classic ""Halloween"" theme by John Carpenter accompanied by a new music score has a magnificent result, the performances are good highlighting my beloved Jamie Lee Curtis and Judy Greer. David Gordon Green's direction plays with suspense, horror, some comedy and drama, the latter genre is the best exploited by the director. As I already mentioned, the movie starts off brutal and electrifying, but everything is decaying between good scenes and others that feel forced, the tribute scenes to the previous films of the franchise are pleasant and appreciated, the end result is a bittersweet film that could go further.",Halloween Kills
67,SoumikBanerjee25,"They need to put the brakes on, for real!",3,23 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is an incoherent, arbitrary mess that is by all means deprived of any logic or explanation! While capitalising exclusively on the kills and the gore; the makers have purposefully disregarded the franchise' true essence. Therefore, this newly rebooted iteration has failed to leave a long-lasting impression. Not that it ever was their first and foremost priority, still this time the situation is even poorer.They need to put the brakes on, for real.Some percentage of the audience as well as a relatively vast faction of the media were covering this film up like crazy. The hype was indeed there. I can't possibly accuse only the makers of cashing in the popularity or rather the 'nostalgia' that comes alongside the name of Michael Myers. Producers will keep on milking the franchise for as long as they could. And we as viewers are partly responsible for that. Simply cause, we don't convey enough. Neither our frustration nor our annoyance.Now, rejuvenating the classics isn't a terrible idea; when it's done responsibly, nobody would bat an eye. However, that's not the case here. The expected standard has plummeted quite a bit and is still in the degradation phase. Before it's too late, the creators must realize, Blood and Gore isn't the only thing that puts together an attainable Slasher horror.It takes a lot more than that. For instance, reasonable writing, relatable characters and most importantly a competent enough Screenplay that can and will sustain a particular level of tension that is imperative in these kinds of productions.All the aforementioned aspects have been sorely omitted in this sequel. Corny dialogues, mediocre performances, uneven editing; the kind of impact they were hoping to achieve, it's nowhere to be found.",Halloween Kills
68,RussHog,Decent addition to the Halloween franchise,7,28 October 2021,"I heard this movie sucked, and parts of it in the middle did - but lots of Halloween movies have sucky parts. The beginning to his film is excellent, and the ending was also quite good. The middle had some moments that I don't feel worked - but mostly it was because the movie made Michael Meyers the anti-hero and the townspeople were more the villains. Nothing wrong with that in slasher genre - but that just is what it is. I recommend this film if you like the Halloween movies.",Halloween Kills

70,cardsrock,Squanders the promise of the last film,5,18 October 2021,"I was a little skeptical when I saw the negative critical reaction to this film; however after seeing it, I can understand why.There's this overwhelming feeling of things moving at a snail's pace in order to stretch the story out for the next film. The whole town mob thing was weird and unnecessary. The ""evil ends tonight"" mantra was pretty cringey as well. I don't expect Oscar-winning dialogue in a film like this, but man the writing felt extra terrible combined with some truly dumb decision-making from countless characters.This film just felt obligatory, best exemplified by a disappointing faceoff between Michael and a group of firefighters. That scene had the potential to be very cool, but is filmed in the most boring, unsatisfying way possible.As expected, Carpenter's score is great and Michael still has a terrific screen presence. The kills are suitably gruesome and while I appreciate trying to flesh out the character of Michael Myers, they bungle it so badly I really just ended up more confused. The lack of Jamie Lee Curtis also hampered this film quite a bit as she was a big reason the last film was so enjoyable.Hopefully Halloween Ends can send this trilogy off on a high note, as this middle entry really took a nosedive in quality.",Halloween Kills
71,apryla-58795,Best thing about this movie was the comments from the audience members in the theater,2,16 October 2021,"I love Halloween and wanted to do something in keeping with the season SO...even though I saw Halloween 2018 and swore I would never see any future films in this franchise I went and saw this. I have to say that although this was terrible it was not nearly as bad as Halloween 2018. That was so dumb and ridiculous. This one actually had a tad better atmosphere to it BUT that doesn't mean it was great because it was a mess.Disjointed is the only thing that comes to mind. Def won't make sense if you didn't see Halloween 2018 because it picks up right where that one left off. I did like the flashbacks and those were pry some of the best scenes but the rest is just filler. They had most of the characters just waxing philosophical and that was sooo boring.JLC stabbing herself dramatically in the butt with that shot was straight stupid! What hospital just leaves stuff like that laying around?! Also she directs the nurse to give Will Patton a ""double"" and she just does it?! WTH?! So unrealistic. Also groin kicking that one guy after her surgery?! So then she's ripped open her stitches and is completely useless. Yeah that's helpful.You could tell they were trying to look for anything to provide filler for this movie otherwise what was the point of that mental patient taking up so much screen time while those people went on a witchhunt for him in the hospital?! Ridiculous!AMH looks so old and heavy now. I can't believe I was looking at the same actor who played a geeky scrawny kid who sang ""You say it's your bday?! It's my bday too!"" in 16 candies! Wow! Sometimes you forget these people age. His part was so bad. He's acting all tough and then he just gets killed in the end. Where's all your big talk now idiot?!And finally I love that there is this high school girl who's going all vigilante with a shotgun that she all of a sudden knows how to use even though Michael took out a whole team of firefighters (one with a chainsaw no less!) and yet she's just gonna go and take this guy on basically by herself?! We saw what happens - big talk gets her boyfriend brutally murdered and she gets her a*s handed to her. These people are such idiots! When Judy Greer (who by the way is seriously an underrated actress who gave the best performance in this) stabbed Michael with a pitchfork why didn't she just keep going until he was a pool of mushy goo?! That's the problem with these people! Why do they stop?! All they would have to do is cut his head off! It's not like he can reanimate with no head and yet he takes on all these people and still survives?! It's gone from trying to portray Michael as someone with super strength to the concept that he is now supernatural?! They could try to explain away about how he survived each thing before this but when they were all beating him up and he just kept getting up it's become a joke and they know it so instead of trying to give it any credibility they just throw their hands up and say ""Screw it! He's not human any more!""Why can't they make a good Halloween film? JLC needs to hang it up too. She added nothing to this.Do yourself a favor and go back and watch the original. It's the best and honestly it's the most realistic.",Halloween Kills

74,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,24 October 2021,"The stage curtains open ...It took them 3 years to bring us the next chapter in the Halloween series since Jamie Lee Curtis re-emerged as the fated Laurie Strode. Was this movie worth the wait? I personally felt that it was. It's true that nothing is resolved here. Some have touted this entry as ""filler"" and nothing more - but, I beg to differ.The story literally picks up right where ""Halloween"" (2018) left off with the Shape trapped inside a burning house and three generations of women (Laurie, her daughter, and her granddaughter) all believing they have finally rid the earth of the evil known as Michael Myers. But, of course, Michael surivives his own impending death only to emerge and continue slaughtering anything and anyone who gets in his way. We are introduced to new characters as well as reacquainted with some familair faces/characters from the original 1978 film - more than a few at that. Haddonfield has finally had enough and in a frenzy and a fervor, they exclaim that ""Evil dies tonight!"" as they hunt down Michael. Bloody chaos ensues.""Halloween Kills"" was much more than just filler. It was a nice homage to the original film with characters that matter. I knew going in that this was the 2nd of a planned 3 movie segment which will eventually pit Laurie against her brother. There was no way that was going to happen in this 2nd film. This film was also especially brutal and violent, even more so than normal. It almost felt like a Rob Zombie film, it was that vicious.I personally enjoyed this movie. It had a good flow to it. It also had a nice CG cameo of Donald Pleasance's Dr. Sam Loomis - when I saw him on screen, I had to smile. With the final kill in the movie, the scene is now set for the 3rd and upcoming Halloween movie where I personally feel they will hold no punches. I expect hell to be unleashed and I can't wait. This one is a recommend at 8 stars out of 10. Halloween and Horror fans will enjoy it, as long as they remember it comes with no resolution. It does, however, set the stage nicely for it in the next one.",Halloween Kills
75,Stanlee107,The title says it all,5,1 November 2021,This is reminiscent to the original storyline. It continues on from the last movie. It is a slasher film that does what it states. There are a lot of murders that are quite gruesome & not much insight into the reasons for Michael's insatiable murder spree. It is a revenge film whereby the angry mob gets their be come-uppance.

76,statuskuo,The Franchise Got Diced,2,16 October 2021,"Just came out of this abortion and now I can join the chorus of haters. This movie is bad.Now, my rating for the first one was below sewer, this is just a fraction above toilet. Here they, again, try to lay onto Michael Meyers what is not there. A motive to murder or a cause to inflict pain. There is no reason. That is the frightening thing about this monster. It isn't until the end when you realize this. In fact, one of the characters says this. What is truly sad is the level of joyful violence the filmmakers put upon the audience. Its gruesome ugly murders aren't made to scare the townfolk of Haddonfield. In fact it desensitizes our brains to it. To the extent of finally crying mercy and laughing due to the comical gore they display. I do not think this was the intention. And so it goes Laurie Strode is relegated once again to the hospital bed. A call-back or sorts to ""Halloween II"". That movie is an underrated gem in my opinion. It adds creepiness and melancholy. And the sense of foreboding. Kills seems to understand this but goes about fear with a sledgehammer. Oof. The one shining moment is Will Patton. He brings a silent regret to his role and allows humanity into this ugly picture. No one in this film is remotely worthy of Michael's mercy. As it were, and again explained it feels as if they were painting Michael as some philosophical curse on the town. Perhaps. But it didn't need the level of unbridled carnage shown. It saddens me we are here. I agree with one reviewer that is on par with Rob Zombie's incoherent mess.",Halloween Kills

Even in a slasher it can be if you choose the wrong persons. Was Jamie Lee in the movie? There's no story or common sense here. Characters decisions are pretty dumb. And all of them looked like drunk. There isn't anybody who I didn't wanted not to die. Thanks Michael.Second, acting is horrendous from all the cast except from actual Michael. Even the old Michael's acting looked like a Z movie. Who made the cast? Just get him fired please.Last, this movie looks like a bridge from first and last and the only thing well done were all the deaths, mostly brutal and well executed. I don't know why they wanted three movies instead two. Quality here is pretty low.So, overall two steps down from it's precursor and a wasted opportunity to do something great like the first statement. Hopefully Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills
81,dfle3,Halloween kills: a superior if very gory sequel. 75%,7,1 November 2021,"""Halloween kills"" follows on directly from the previous entry in this franchise, ""Halloween"" (2018)...eventually. Maybe it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the 2018 film...or the original 1978 film of the same name but it would make sense to watch the 2018 film first, since this follows on from it.Unexpectedly, the film draws on moments from the earliest entries in the franchise (I've seen at least the first three entries of the original series, then ""H20"" and lastly these two most recent entries) as well as adding to them, a bit like seeing something that would exist in a ""director's cut"" of those original films, even though they don't exist.Something that I like about this film is that you get a glimpse of inspiration for what the story of inhuman serial killer Michael Myers (for some reason I think that that should be spelled ""Meyers""...maybe it was originally spelt that way?) could be. In other words, what is his nature? How did he become what he is? How do you bloody well stop him killing again (glancing at Wikipedia for this franchise, it seems that sequels that I haven't seen have delved into some of this territory)? Another way of saying this is that the film tries to grapple with the nature of its subject. That makes the prospect of seeing the next film in this series something that fills me with anticipation (I probably shouldn't have looked up this film on Wikipedia before seeing it, because it has a 'spoiler' that there will be another film in this franchise out next year). That being said, these 'glimpses of inspiration' for the story might just be teases, an empty promise, that even if delivered on, would underwhelm as any such explanation would necessarily disappoint for being unsatisfactory in some way, shape or form, if you pardon the pun. Of course, one lives in hope that the next instalment could in fact deliver something satisfying on that front, so it would be worth the attempt to come up with something good by the film-makers.As for the film itself, well, as with the last one, it's not really scary, as far as I remember (I did review the previous film here) but it is gorier. After I watched it, I was thinking that it really should be an R rated film, not the MA 15+ that it is here in Australia. It looks like the film is rated R in the US, which would leave teenagers unable to see it. You can't really say that Michael Myers is revelling in the carnage...I would say that the film-makers are, for the benefit of the implied audience. So, there is an emphasis on extreme horror, as opposed to fear, which isn't really generated here. The carnage can be nasty, cruel and sadistic, with the camera lingering on horrifying situations, unnecessarily so, I'd add. Early on, the murder of two black people in their home had me thinking of Michael Meyers ""You monster!""...just because they were not typical of the kind of victims you get in this genre of film.Also unexpectedly, there is some social commentary to this film, concerning mob violence, which was not something that I saw coming. This element does add some poignancy to proceedings and you could ponder the morality of the ones which bring about this outcome or how they compare and contrast to Michael Myers himself.Watching this film, I did wonder how much I had forgotten from the original, 1978 film...without looking at Wikipedia, I'm thinking that maybe names have been retrofitted to previously nameless characters but even if that is right, maybe they became more than nameless characters in the sequels that I haven't seen?Before seeing this film, it was likely, I thought, that I would include in my review of it that I would end my involvement with this franchise here, just because I was bored with it or finding it mindlessly repetitive. As I say, instead this film has whetted my appetite for the sequel. Hopefully that will be final instalment for this franchise. Hopefully it can at least function as a canonical ending to the series...until some producers think that they can make some money resurrecting Michael Myers, which is probably where I will finally have lost interest in seeing any more of these films. There is actually a film in this franchise with the word ""resurrection"", I see!My prediction at the end of my review for the previous film as to where I thought the next film would go was dead wrong (I didn't state my predictions but I had some thoughts on where it could go, given the finale of that previous film). Instead, after a strangely long opening credits sequence, this film offered up some more surprises for me (even though in some respects, it necessarily follows in the footsteps of ""Halloween II"", the sequel to the 1978 film). That's what has lifted my score for this and made me interested in seeing the next instalment. Hopefully it can deliver on some of the promise in this one, perhaps be a bit less gory and wouldn't it be nice if it was scary to boot?Recommendations:Halloween (1978). Years ago I learned that this was one of the most successful films of all time, based on box office returns on the production costs.Halloween II (I'm going on memory here, I saw it a very long time ago on VHS rental but remember liking it).Hellraiser. This film is the stuff of nightmares and I found it genuinely scary, from memory.The shining.

82,ethanbresnett,A very solid horror film and a worthwhile instalment in the franchise,7,1 November 2021,"A real mixed bag of a film but ultimately a positive movie experience.Firstly there's lots of good horror in this film. Plenty of solid gore, some terrific tension and suspense, and some properly creepy moments. There were a few jump scares but generally the film didn't lean on them and cultivated a sense of dread and tension pretty much from the start that I really enjoyed.The plot I actually could mostly get behind. It wasn't overly refined, a bit messy in parts and with a sometimes lacklustre script, but broadly it was solid. A very strong continuation of Halloween (2018). It felt like quite a fresh instalment in the franchise and was well paced and had decent acting for the most part. The general themes were well explored and I'm excited for the finale of this trilogy now.It's also hard to escape the fact that Michael Myers, the Carpenter's epic music, the character of Laurie Strode, are all so iconic that it's hard not to have a good time when they are on screen.I can understand where the criticism of this film is coming from, but if you suspend your disbelief and throw yourself into the chaos of this film I think you'll have a good time.Not a standout film, but by no means a disappointment.",Halloween Kills

I actually really enjoyed this, the best part in my opinion was how it started where the previous ended so it felt like the journey never ended, it sure as heck hasn't for The Stroads.Michael Myers is one of my personal favourite killers eithin the horror industry, i like how walking after your victim is still effective, it always gives me a chuckle, but as for this new addition is concerned, i liked it and i do think its worth the watch, loads of great moments. My one and only issue is that it came out weeks before Halloween and i would've loved seeing it in the cinema on the 31st.Highly recommend; Great Horror!",Halloween Kills

Then yeah we'll hunt him down yet split up sure that's what you do. There's about 5 police in the show this is 2021 and we are to believe a hospital is allowed to have a village idiot riot whilst they all watch the lynch mob. So he killed one car but we'll go to his old house, drive up with the lights out incase he sees us but I'll knock on the door for good measure hahaha seriously writers was this comedy writing deliberate?

If you don't know the previous films, you won't really be able to do anything with the story. The director also manages a very nice retro look.

89,Mike_Devine,'Halloween' comes off the rails,4,7 November 2021,"When David Gordon Green embarked on directing the trilogy sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 classic, there were high hopes that the reunion of familiar faces including Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens and of course, Jamie Lee Curtis, would elevate the series to being must-see horror for a new generation. Unfortunately, 'Halloween Kills' shows us that this is unlikely to come to fruition.Despite kicking things off with a bang with 2018's 'Halloween,' the follow-up suffers miserably from sequelitis. Picking up where things left off, the story shifts to focusing on Michael Myers' pursuit of his nemeses from 40 years ago as he terrorizes the town of Haddonfield once again. 'Kill' ups the ante in a lot of areas, from actual kill count to gore, and there are flashbacks that are meant to frame things up for viewers to get them familiar with the ""angry village crowd"" that pursues the infamous Shape. However, 'Kills' overreaches and loses a lot of the elements that make 'Halloween' stand apart from other films in the genre - especially around that of surprise and mystique that surrounds the masked killer.While there's still a chance for things to turn around in 2022's 'Halloween Ends,' don't expect a masterpiece based on recent history.",Halloween Kills

director: David Gordon Green
starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Maticheck, James Courtney, Nick Castle, Will Patton, Dylan Arnold, Robert Longstreet, Anthony Michael Hall etcThe Halloween night when Michael Myers returned isn't over yet. Minutes after Laurie Strode (Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) left masked monster Michael Myers caged and burning in Laurie's basement, Laurie is rushed to the hospital with life-threatening injuries, believing she finally killed her lifelong tormentor. But when Michael manages to free himself from Laurie's trap, his ritual bloodbath resumes. As Laurie fights her pain and prepares to defend herself against him, she inspires all of Haddonfield to revolt against their unstoppable monster. The Strode women join a group of other survivors of Michael's first rampage who decide to take matters into their own hands, forming a vigilante mob that sets out to hunt Michael down, once and for all. I have to say, Halloween Kills was good, but I found it disappointing and anticlimactic.My first few positives would be the fantastic gore and kills. As well as the amazing soundtrack and sound design. Also, the great flashback sequences and campy tone. The film truly lived up to its name with a much more brutal tone when it came to its kills, that were much gorier, and the body count was much higher. The kills were creative and left an impact truly making Michael Myers even more of a threatening presence within the film. I also thought the soundtrack was amazing as always, the theme tune always gives me so much nostalgia. And it always adds such a cinematic and tense feel to each scene. The sound design as well was particularly strong with the diegetic sound of breathing and the impact of the kills being felt more. I also really loved the campy tone this film had. It really bought similar tonal qualities to the original with the over-the-top performances and dialogue. It felt like a truly classic slasher, and it was a great pay to pay homage to the original. Another great element was the flashback sequences. Not only where they excellently shot to look like the 70's but they actually had a reason for being there and had importance to the story in the present. So, it wasn't used just for nostalgia.My next few positives would be the great cinematography and Jumpscares. As well as the nostalgia of bringing back older characters, adding an interesting dynamic to the film. The cinematography and visuals for this film were very impressive. Some of the shots with Michael Myers, especially the mid shot of when he steps out of the burning house was just amazing. The kill scenes were also excellently shot, and the film tricked the audience into believing Michael was somewhere he wasn't. With the use of diegetic sound, close ups and tracking shots that was executed brilliantly. These made the jump scares of the film work excellently. They were startling and well executed, as the film made you believe Michael was somewhere he wasn't, so when he appeared from somewhere different it always was executed well and the threat and danger to the characters made the scenes even better. I loved the nostalgic elements to the film and the interesting dynamic it bought. I think adding characters from the original added a lot of great nostalgia to the film, but it also focused on the victims of Michael and how they survived the ordeal, it added a great dynamic to the film as different generations stood up and fought back against Michael.However, I had a lot of issues with the film that made it disappointing for me. The script was mediocre, there was a lot of genre tropes used. As well as lapses in the logic, a restrictive plot and messy final act. The script for this film was pretty poor. As a campy slasher you can get away with over-the-top performances and some corny dialogue. But this took it to the extreme, with so many on the nose and corny moments that it actually took some of the enjoyment out of the scenes and made the characters seem dumb. There was also a lot of frustrating genre tropes used with the kills. The first film was mostly just innocent bystanders, but this time around a lot of the characters deliberately put themselves in danger or tripped over when being chased and it made the film feel less original and more generic. I also thought there was a lot of lapses in the logic, mostly due to frustrating character decisions and the film trying to over explain motivations for Michael that just felt unneeded. A lot of the film threw logic out of the window which was never explained until the final act where it felt too late. I also feel like the plot was very restrictive. It felt very much like a middle chapter, where it felt more like set up instead of its own product, always feeling like it was delaying having more plot and trying to distract the audience due to wanting to have more development in Halloween Ends. Because of this the final act was a big mess and it felt anticlimactic. I thought the film got repetitive and had completely unnecessary and unneeded storylines especially within the hospital. And wasted its main characters.My final few positives would be the interesting elements to the plot and building of tension. As well as some good development with Michael, and strong set up for the final instalment. I think that the film having the residents hunt down Michael added an interesting element to the film. And turned the plot in a different direction compared to the first instalment. It made the film had a fresh and different appeal to it and made it easier to rally behind and support the characters. I also thought the building of tension was strong. Due to the plot development with Michael and his sister, as well as the guilt especially from Officer Hawkins of not killing Michael. Really increased the stakes and tension, as you understood Michael's motivations more whilst also balancing the fact that he is pure evil and will kill anyone. Finally, I thought the set up for the final instalment is strong. The film introduced some great elements and concepts for Halloween Ends to explore, with the more killing Michael doing the less human he becomes.Overall, Halloween kills lives up to its title. With a much more gruesome and gritty nature to it. Some very strong visuals and delivered as a campy slasher with some great character moments. But it suffers greatly from its restrictive plot and being a middle chapter. It honestly felt like filler, it didn't have enough to it to stand out and be anything more than set up for the final instalment.Overall score 64/100.",Halloween Kills
95,msunando,The merciless murdering machine chugs along,6,3 November 2021,"Take a deep, hard breath if you thought that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) finally succeeded in seeing the end of Michael Myers in the basement of her self-constructed fortress in the 2018 release of Halloween. The horror refuses to die, and in ""Halloween Kills"", Michael uses the help from the fire fighters of the Strode House blaze to set himself free yet again. Once the mean killing machine is out, massacre follows. He starts with a number of the firefighters that arrived to douse the blaze and then turns his attention to all the old residents of the community where he once lived. Revenge is set off from both the warring sides, Michael Myers goes solo on one side and the rest of the town unites to get him on the other.The outcome is a murder a minute, and the most gruesome ones, that too. Michael chugs ahead, unabated, unabashed and untiring, he must continue with his Kills indiscriminately. Whilst Laurie recovers from her deadly wounds at the hospital, it's Karen and her daughter Allyson who need to take up the cudgel and ward off the menace called Michael Myers. This time around, the entire town is ready to get to him and finish the story.""Halloween Kills"" continues with Michael's unquenchable thirst for Kills and blood, developing more gross and maniacal methods of killing. It turns somewhat predictable as matters progress and you realise that this certainly isn't that last offering of the franchise, and must wait for ""Halloween Ends"" releasing in October 2022. But it's a fulfilling time for the horror and thriller buffs as Halloween Kills hurtles down like a juggernaut, unpredictable, unstoppable and merciless!",Halloween Kills
96,flicklover,"Certainly not perfect but a very effective, brutal slasher film!!!",9,24 October 2021,"After more than a year of being delayed for over a year because of Covid Halloween Kills is finally here!!! Obviously there was alot of hype surrounding this film and as much as I tried to avoid reviews I started seeing some negative ones so I went in with diminished expecations.What I can say is that after a kind of awkward start I liked it more than I thought I would. I really liked Halloween 2018. I liked that it was a direct sequel to the 1978 original and avoided the nonsense after Halloween 4!!! The franchise became a joke with its druid cults and man in black ridiculousness!!! 2018 brought back the idea that Michael Myers was just evil. Period. I liked that. This film expands on that idea.Halloween 2018 was also criticized by some tgat it didn't have enough kills. This film delivers on that. Michael Myers is completely unleashed in this film so anyone who wants to see some blood this film will satisfy them. The film brings back characters from the 1978 original such as Tommy Doyle played by Anthony Michael Hall and Lindsey Wallace, Tommy's friend that was with him when Michael attacked Laurie in the 1978 film. Will Patton comes back as Deputy Frank Hawkins and his character has more importance in this film. Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurue Strode but takes a back seat in this film and is relegated to the hospital.because she was badly wounded in the 2018 film. At first I didn't like that she was not in the film but she is good in her role and I'm sure she will be a bigger part of the last film. Andi Matichak is also good as Laurie's granddaughter. As in the 2018 film, tge weakest performance comes from Judy Greer as Karen, Laurie's daughter. I don't like her performance in either film. But she is given a prominent role that would have been better with an actress with more presence. She's not bad in the film, but she just doesn't fit in my opinion. The film has some good sequences involving the people of Haddonfield becoming a mob hunting Michael Myers but some of the dialogue becomes very repetitive. Especially a particular line that is repeated way too much. The film really gets going in the second half and has some really gory kills. The tension builds to a very violent finale that doesn't completely satisfy because as we all know there will be a 3rd film in this timeline.Overall, an imperfect but solid slasher film that is definitely better than the sequels that came after the 1981 Halloween 2.Grade: B.",Halloween Kills
97,ragingbull_2005,Inventive kills alone do not make up Halloween,5,16 October 2021,"The first 20 minutes may be amongst the most pointless of the series. The best part about Halloween was how brainy it was, for a slasher. Here, all that is undone in these first moments as Myers escapes the death trap of the first part in a jiffy. There are no thrills in the kills and it seems as if they are there just to pad up the run time.It is the next hour which is as intense as it can be, with lot of gore and horrific deaths. This was made the first part such a lot of fun and it is what works best for this follow up.And then comes the ending that might be the stupidest of them all. Made me want to punch the director and the writer in the face because of the sheer laziness that it hinted at.The first was such a cult classic and box office smash hit. This one would not be a pale shadow of it and the blame lies at the doorstep of the director. Severely disappointed.",Halloween Kills

So as you can imagine, I was very excited and looking forward to this film. But upon conclusion while I did like it I wasn't blown away and most likely wouldn't see it again.I did enjoy what they did with Michael Myers from the acting to the costume design. The movie also had plenty of blood, violence, & gore throughout which was great.However the movie is severly lacking almost everywhere else. The pacing was inconsitent, character actions were dumb, plot was non-existant, and lastly the visuals felt dated for a newer movie.Overall its decent watch for those who're into slasher films or fans of the series wouldn't recommend to anyone else.",Halloween Kills

The storyline was awful it's like they didn't know what movie to make/ the whole hospital storyline was awful. The acting was awful the editing was awful the characters where awful.

101,movieman6-413-929510,"Entertaining sequel for slasher fans, but otherwise lacking in depth.",5,16 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is the sequel to the 2018 Halloween film and thus the third film in the new Halloween film series. The film is again directed in part written and produced by David Gordon Green who also directed the previous Halloween film.In the film, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks he has finally stopped Michael Myers for good, by leaving him in a fiery trap. Laurie ends up in the hospital due to her injuries, not realizing that Michael Myers manages to escape from her burning trap. Myers thus poses another threat to all residents of Haddonfield. Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall) decides to visit Myers and stop before he can reach Laurie.With this sequel, they provide an entertaining slasher, but without real story or depth. With some flashbacks they try to add extra information and characters to the original Halloween movie. All the time that is spent on this comes across more as filling in the story and further light construction for the sequel of this film. The flashbacks are portrayed in a good and appropriate way, making it appear as if they were filmed at the same time as the first Halloween movie of 1978.For fans of the Halloween film series, there are more fun references and retrospectives in the film to previous Halloween films. Since the 2018 Halloween movie made a sequel to the original Halloween movie that ignored the rest of the sequels, it's strange that they bring back aspects of these ignored movies. This decision makes it somewhat uncertain whether the further prosecutions count or not.Michael Myers provides creative and entertaining kills for slasher fans to enjoy. Besides these bloody slasher scenes, the film lacks real tension. With Michael Myers his character they also seem to be a bit insecure. After the original two Halloween movies, Michael Myers died, but later brought him back to fans in the film series, giving him more supernatural sides. The 2018 Halloween movie is said to ignore the other sequels and take Michael Myers' supernatural side out of the film series, however. In this new film, he seems to be even more than a human being. Because of all these unclear decisions, it sometimes becomes difficult to follow the different Halloween film series clearly. By putting Jamie Lee Curtis on the sidelines in this film, they bring back other characters from the original Halloween movie. Some of these characters are even played back by the original cast members. For fans it can be nice to see these original cast members again. Unfortunately, the returning cast does not consist of the best actors, which sometimes makes for strange or uncomfortable scenes. Anthony Michael Hall can also seem a little disoriented with his mission to stop Michael Myers himself.",Halloween Kills

103,Darkjak007,Evil dies tonight Really?,5,16 October 2021,"Halloween kills is the sequel to Halloween(2018) it picks up right where the last film left us. Laurie Strode(Jamie lee Curtis) is on her way to the Hospital with her family's leaving Michael to burn. The fire department shows up and through that Michael manages to escape and goes on a rampage through Haddonfield. The news shocks the town to the point that they band together and lead a manhunt for Michael. This movie was such a letdown, marketing into think you know want your getting then not living up to those standard. This film is convolute and a mess with zero payoff. It try's to be a mixture of the 2018 film with 2 and 5 thrown in. The characters are some the the most reckless, dumbest, ridiculous in any of the movies. With movies in general in certain circumstances you have to put some sort of disbelieve to wants going on. You know that none of these people are a match for Michael Myers. This movie takes itself so serious, but yet everybody act like an incompetent jackass. It not even hilarious stupid like H20 or resurrection. There's a scene where they chase down somebody and even you know it clearly not Michael, they pursue this person. Everybody talks like they know who Michael Myers is, even without the Mask he's a 7 feet tall hulking old man. It also wasted potential that you have members of the original back, like Tommy Doyle(Antony Michael Hall) and Lindsey Wallace) the two kids Laurie babysitted. Most of them are pointless with the exception of tommy who forms the mob and escalates things. I didn't care for anybody in this movie, but Laurie not even her family. Karen and her daughter are still useless in this. Jamie lee Curtis is basically pushed to the sideline in favor of tommy and her granddaughter. She's condemned to the hospital the whole movie which is fine and makes since given want she's been through. Though she doesn't really say anything of value, or importance other the final speech of the film. Her and Michael don't have one scene together. The majority of the dialogue from pretty much everybody is just constantly bring up the original. I don't need to keep being remained of the first movie if I want to enjoy the original watch the original. The only enjoyable thing is Michael and the kills it great seeing him go to work. However you can't expect the slasher to carry the movie especially one that doesn't talk. There are a few nice Easter eggs like the Silver shamrock mask from season of the witch a nicely done stand-in of Donald Pleasance Loomis. Overall Halloween Kills is a mess with it's boring commentary, poorly written characters and mess of a story. Nothing is really rewatchable in this other then Michael.

105,zac-04879,It's More of an Extension to 2018's Halloween,6,1 November 2021,"Halloween Kills: a surprisingly well-functioning excuse to bring fans back for more brutality inflicted by Michael Myers. Slashing, talking, slashing, ""evil dies tonight"", slashing, this is a sequel that truly lives up to the suggestion made by its title. Halloween Kills definitely won't work out for fans who are expecting a full-on story, aside from Michael Myers killing people in brutal fashion.This sequel's main story connects smoothly to the happenings of its 2018 predecessor, which had an entire story. Since Halloween Kills is a direct link, there's no real character development or introduction to other thrilling concepts. It's just brutal slayings and the whole town attempting to defeat the seemingly-immortal villain. Overall, if you're really anticipating more plot ideas or something similar to 2018's Halloween, you're better off turning away here.There's still the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, the leading protagonist, alongside her other related generations of heroes. David Gordon Green also returns with his excellent direction and we listen to the classic, exciting and familiar Halloween theme.

106,darkreignn,Disappointing,5,15 October 2021,"The saga of Michael Myers continues in ""Halloween Kills,"" the sequel to the 2018 reboot ""Halloween,"" which is the sequel to the 1978 classic ""Halloween."" The 1978 slasher is one of my favorite horror films of all time - the purposeful minimalism at play works wonders in setting up a simple story, as well as a simple villain whose existence seems to revolve solely around stalking and killing his prey. The 2018 reboot acted as a direct sequel, serving to show the negative aftermath that such a traumatic event had on Laurie. Once again played by Jamie Lee Curtis, Laurie was depicted as a clear sufferer of post traumatic stress disorder - she never quite got over what happened to her, and has spent her entire life waiting and preparing for Michael to return. And return he did!2018's ""Halloween"" showed Michael doing what he does best: brutally murdering others in various ways. While the marketing teased a reversal of the slasher trope where, seemingly, Laurie would begin hunting Michael, effectively turning the prey into the predator, instead we witnessed what we originally witnessed in the 1978 film - Michael walking up and down the street, slaying people as he sees fit. And again, the trailer for ""Halloween Kills"" seems to tease the same reversal. And once again, marketing has led us astray.""Halloween Kills"" offers nothing that you haven't seen before, and I mean that literally - it seems like the filmmakers cannot think of any different plot point, or of anything unique for Michael to do other than walk from location to location and kill people in various ways. And sure, the kills are disturbing - if you find yourself scared of slashers, then there is certainly enough violence here to frighten you. However, if you hoped ""Halloween Kills"" would be the revitalization that this franchise desperately needs, you'd be sorely mistaken.The second entry in this trilogy, ""Halloween Kills"" can't seem to find its footing. Not only does it offer nothing new when compared to the previous entry but it also doesn't seem to move the story forward in any meaningful way, as at the end we are basically where we were when we started - just with a significant bodycount tacked on. There are no twists or turns, there is only Michael slaughtering what adds up to be the population of a small town. And hey, if you want to see that, then more power to you! But for me, this wasn't entertaining, and perhaps the greatest sin of all - it wasn't scary.The tone is all over the place here, with brutal violence in one scene and ridiculous comedy (intentional or otherwise) in the next. And perhaps these bite-sized bits of humor do manage to add some levity, but they also manage to suck dry all feelings of horror or tension. I want to feel afraid when I'm watching a movie about a masked madman; instead, I felt embarrassed at the filmmaker's attempts to lighten the mood. Additionally, some of the editing and dialogue is so bad that I couldn't tell if the director was purposefully trying to make the movie cheesy or not; scenes of mobs of people screaming, ""Evil dies tonight!"" and chasing someone through a hospital are so ridiculous that you'd expect to see them in the latest Marlon Wayans parody.""Halloween Kills"" is a disappointment. If you're in love with slashers, you might find some entertainment value here. However, if you're watching this movie expecting to see this new story move forward in meaningful, surprising ways, prepare to be most surprised by the lack of innovation.",Halloween Kills

With some shocking deaths, as well as some over the top ones. But Michael Myers is still creepy here. So it's not just one horrendous death after another.

I don't like these Halloween movies like that and I think this just might be the best. It's definitely one of the best. I really like this cast and love that Kyle Richards is back as Lindsay. The scene at the playground stole the movie for me. Hilarious. I surprisingly really enjoyed this. Horror movies are dumb, the characters should be dumb. That's part of the fun!

I mean, at this point we are just rehashing the same thing over and over again. Just make it entertaining and I thought that they did.",Halloween Kills
110,meathookcinema,Let's cheapen the legacy of the first Halloween film,1,15 October 2021,"After the frankly dreadful film from 2018 I wasn't looking forward to it's sequel. I even intended on not seeing the film but someone posted online that this was 'The Film of the Year'. Mission accepted. I had to see and review it.After the dodgy political posturing of the previous film ('The Night The Patriarchy Came Home') I was wondering which issues the new film would try to slyly convey. I looked at Jamie Lee Curtis' Instagram profile to try to find a few clues. Maybe the new film would depict Michael Myers as an embodiment of inactivity against global warming with Laurie becoming a Greta Thunberg type Final Girl (or should that be Final Granny), accusing Michael of stealing her childhood and exclaiming that she can *actually see* CO2. Or maybe it will tackle transgenderism with Michael engendering (pun not intended) cis-gender bigotry and heteronormativity. Maybe Elliott Page could battle Michael. The options are limitless.The start of Halloween Kills seemed to confirm my notions with the first character we see being the stunning and brave Bonnie (actually a man in a dress) from the fancy dress party from the previous movie still all frocked up and arguing with his Clyde on the phone.But then the film goes light on the political agenda posturing. There are a few touches here and there- the mainly white lynch mob who go after Michael, the mother-daughter action near the end of the film ('I'm an innocent woman!' screams Mommy Strode to Michael. 'Just like my mother was!' There's Michael as patriarchy again).Talking of Granny Strode, Jamie Lee is stuck in the hospital for much of the film rather than being the geriatric Linda Hamilton wannabe she was in the previous film. There is a God after all.There was only one character I actually enjoyed and rooted for in this film and that was Michael. Maybe that's his role in the later franchise entries and that's viciously killing the film's most irritating characters- the doctor, nurse and Marion (yes, the Marion from the first film), the couple flying the drone around their house, the gay couple who have taken over (and decorated to perfection) the old Myers house.But the worst crime of this film is that it references, steals and pillages far too much from the first film. In fact it does so in such a heavy handed fashion that it reminds you that you could be watching a genuine masterpiece rather than this anaemic entry. Characters from the first are introduced so thick and fast that it feels like there is an air of desperation about proceedings. There are sequences shot depicting other events from THAT night from 1978, a CGI Dr Loomis and even clips from the original film inserted here. Does it feel authentic? Does it hell. Halloween 2 felt wayyy more like the original film in feel, tone and visuals. After coming out of the movie I read a review that said these ham-fisted pilferings were 'poisoning the well' regarding the original's legacy. I couldn't agree more.Halloween Kills feels like an episode from some kind of Halloween spin-off TV series that hasn't even been made- yet. But give it time. It's a film for the fanboys to salivate over, the kind of viewers who will lap it up as, y'know, Michael Myers is in it and he kills people.Stick with the original and also Part 2 and the excellent Part 3: Season of the Witch. Everything after that is fanboy territory.One final thought. During the runtime I kept thinking about John Carpenter (who acts as Executive Producer for Halloween Kills as well as composing the soundtrack). I kept thinking 'This is the worst thing he's ever been associated with during his whole career. And he's done it by seemingly not caring if he cheapens the legacy of the first Halloween film'. Maybe that's the real horror regarding this film.",Halloween Kills
111,tmccull52,"Not Bad, But...",5,24 October 2021,"This was pretty much what I expected it to be, but there were two things that really didn't make much sense:1.) Most of Haddonfield had either outgrown the memory of Michael Myers, or knew nothing about him to begin with. Despite this, Tommy (Anthony Michael Hall) manages to rile the entire town into a frenzied, almost maniacal mob thirsty for Myers' blood.2.) Lonnie, his son Cameron, and Allyson go to Michael Myers' childhood home, certain that he is there. Lonnie insists on going into the house alone, going in after a killer that seems to border on the supernatural. Lonnie is killed within minutes of going inside, but gets off a gunshot. This gunshot prompts Cameron and Allyson to go into the house. Cameron, who is supposedly SO in love with Allyson, so determined to redeem himself to her, let's her go into the house first? As far as he knows, something terrible may have happened to his father, they're going in to face a ruthless killing machine, and he let's the love of his life go in first?3.) Allyson and Cameron find Lonnie's body, and then they find the corpses of the current residents of the Myers House. These bodies belong to a guy couple who call each other Big John and Little John. Now, Allyson doesn't know either of these men, but she reacts like they were her lifelong friends. She goes over to the bodies and kneels down. She sets her sawed-off shotgun and flashlight aside to pull a knife out of Little John's corpse? Why?4.) While Allyson is lost in inexplicably lamenting the loss of the men that she didn't know, Cameron leaves her side to go and search the rest of the house for Michael Myers. Of course, Cameron finds Michael Myers, and ends up being killed by Myers while Allyson watches helplessly.5.) Myers launches Allyson over the second story staircase Bannister, and she badly injures her leg during the fall. She can barely stand up... and she dares Michael Myers to come and get her?The violence and gore were a little over the top, even for a ""Halloween"" movie, but I could overlook that, but the incredibly stupid actions taking by the main characters didn't seem to fit the movie somehow.",Halloween Kills
112,TheVictoriousV,You don't know what death is,5,15 October 2021,"Following up on the 2018 reboot of John Carpenter's beloved, often imitated Halloween franchise, Halloween Kills was always an inevitability. This always happens with slasher movies, especially the classics; nothing stays dead. The only one that seemingly managed to suck hard enough to kill the series was the 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street remake. As far as I know, the other big ones are still kicking (yes, even Hellraiser).You might want to joke about this being ""the third 'Halloween 2' ever made"", on top of the original Halloween II from 1981 as well as the sequel to the version made by Rob Zombie (who very clearly should've remade The Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead). But remember, the 2018 movie only acknowledges the very first Halloween picture, ergo the reboot was Halloween 2 and this one's Halloween 3. I guess it spares us some confusion to simply name it Halloween Kills. My only wish is that they name the next one Halloween Kills... In Space.I couldn't help but snicker when I read the synopsis. This blurb promised that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and a few other survivors of Michael ""The Shape"" Myers will ""form a vigilante mob to hunt down Michael and end his reign of terror once and for all"". Is there anyone on this Earth who will believe that? There's no ""once for all"" in movies like this. Remember Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter? That's movie 4 out of 10. Which is also my rating for it. Haha, take that!Halloween Kills does set itself apart from its predecessors (canon and non-canon), in the most annoying way possible. Instead of being a generic slasher film (which, typically, is fun even at the genre's worst), this one partakes in a more modern movie trend: trying suddenly to teach us something (specifically in a film that exists in a franchise that ""used to be fun""). It's not too bad - we're not at the level of, say, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier turning a Marvel superhero into a megaphone for terror apologia - but it's a bit odd.Obviously, there is a time and place for films with important points to make (I'm not the type to use the phrase ""message movie"" derogatorily). We still have Jean-Luc Godard with his ""essay films"" and I wouldn't be a true cinephile if I didn't admire the works of filmmaker-philosopher Andrei Tarkovsky. More modern, more approachable, and less obscure works, including the recent Squid Game, deliver timely commentary without detracting from what they're supposed to be at the ""entertainment"" level.However, Halloween Kills isn't a particularly remarkable (or scary) slasher film and its preoccupation with suddenly-serious preaching about mob mentality is going to prove jarring to a lot of fans. When I said that there's a time and place for this stuff, I included horror cinema. But this isn't Frankenstein. There's no reason we should decry a witch hunt when Michael effin' Myers is at the receiving end. Fortunately (?), they do shoehorn in a different character who becomes a ""bogeyman"" in the non-horror sense, so we're not meant to take pity on Myers. Still, it's a weird angle for a Halloween sequel.The message isn't subtle, nor is it a good fit here. If you came for the kills or Jamie Lee Curtis, you might be disappointed - even if Curtis does appear and there are a few fun kills and gore moments that made me go ""Oh, sh-t"".The previous movie also took its sweet time before we got to see the ultimate confrontation between Strode and Myers, but we all had fun getting there (judging from the reactions at the premiere I attended), and we either enjoyed the formulated side characters or enjoyed watching them die. Now, we're basically being finger-wagged for wanting that stuff - not in a purposeful, Michael Haneke-style anti-horror sort of way, but in a ""Why see a silly old slasher when you can read my paper on groupthink?"" sort of way.We don't even see Strode meet up with Myers again (that's for the sequel). Instead, the only true charm for long-time fans will lie in the callbacks to the 1978 film. Actors like Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens, and Charles Cyphers are brought back (adding little of substance to the actual story) and we even see a recreation of Dr. Loomis in flashbacks. I'm less enthusiastic about the gay couple that calls each other ""Big John"" and ""Little John"".As a film, Halloween Kills is a bit clunkily edited, boring in terms of cinematography, and some of the delivery is awkward and corny. These issues, along with the superfluous subplots and misplaced focus I mentioned earlier, point to the actual problem: this ain't Carpenter's Halloween, but someone else's. And I'm not just hung up on the scene where the mob finally descends on Myers and we go from Halloween rules to Mandalorian rules.",Halloween Kills

I agree with previous reviewers who said this felt like a filler movie for the trilogy. I will say one positive, I liked the idea of some of the original characters coming back but they kind of squandered them too. The script was so bad and literally nothing happened!!! Too many side characters/people shoved into one movie but we barely care about any of them because we don't know them! Where was the original actor who played Tommy Doyle? Don't think he should have been recast. The townspeople were so ridiculous and so was Anthony Michael Hall. Jamie Lee Curtis, was barely in here and deserved better. Don't even get me started on the 30 minute hospital stampede situation. So unnecessary, ridiculous & boring!I seriously felt like the creators/directors/writers didn't care about the audience at all with this film, it was so halfway done. I wasn't scared. There was no suspense, no build up, no intrigue! Literally the movie trailer had more suspense than the actual movie. I'm so disappointed, there could have such a great thrilling horror movie with better writing. We can only hope that Halloween Ends (2022) has a better beginning, middle & end.",Halloween Kills

117,Lewis_Heather787,What is the point?,3,18 October 2021,"This franchise has a problem with sequels doesn't it haha, although small confession I actually really like ""Halloween 2"" from 1981.....I know thats extremely unpopular but I don't know there is something about it I like. Which is the opposite feeling I have about this film.What is the point of this film? I am having a real hard time trying to understand the decision to make this film. Why did the studio green light this film because its another example of a franchise having absolutely no direction whatsoever. Especially considering we knew that this reboot of the Halloween franchise was going to last 3 films, you'd assume they would have a plan before announcing that. I could be wrong but this film feels completely pointless and made up on the spot. ""Halloween"" which came out in 2018 I thought was a decent film and a good foundation to build upon for this trilogy. This sequel now adds completely nothing meaningful to the story and barely progresses it........is it just me that can see this ?There are only a few ""minor"" areas this film needs to improve on, they are: Directing, Story, acting, and editing.......well when I say ""minor"" I might have been lying slightly hahah.I'd like to know what David Gordon Green thought after he saw the finished film for the first time, did he think it was a masterpiece? Just like the writing, acting and editing, the directing is completely all over the place. Which is odd because he directed the 2018 film which was good.From the very start of the film it doesn't really have any idea what it wants to be and it gets worse the longer into the film you get. The dialogue is really clunky and cheesy, the performances (even Jamie Lee Curtis) are poor and the character choices are just plain dumb.However one of the biggest issues I have about this film is the fact that it is not scary whatsoever! Adding loads of gore and blood to a film does not necessarily make it scary. Suspense, silence, occasional jump scares, a interesting/complex villain and consequences to characters we actually care about.......that to me is what makes for good horror.30% out of 100 I thought that ""Halloween Kills"" was bad because it adds completely nothing to the franchise and the modern day trilogy. Plus being laughably odd and strange in terms of story, acting and editing. What a shame because I genuinely thought that this could have been a good film!",Halloween Kills
118,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Disappointing sequel,6,29 October 2021,"A kind of disappointing sequel. I liked the premise of the whole community getting together and the themes around the dangers of mob mentality. But, it's such a messy execution. The movie spends too much time on flashbacks (sometimes even flashbacking a flashback) and it constantly jumps around. Am I supposed to care what's happening with Laurie and family, am I supposed to care about about Tommy and crew leading the charge? About the cop that missed his shot 40 years ago? And the characters make dumb decisions. They'll be concerned about kids still out at night but then not care that Lonnie's teenage son and his girlfriend are hunting down Michael too? And I liked that the 2018 film basically retconned all the movies where Michael was supernatural. But then at the end of this movie they basically go ""Nah, Michael is supernatural af"". I actually thought it was a quite a cool scene where he gets circled and everyone starts beating on him. I mean, I knew that Michael would have to come out on top it survive because of third film coming out, but it was kind of lame that I'd basically ""he's supernatural, he grows stronger the more he kills"". I thought the actress who plays Laurie's granddaughter (can't remember her name)the boyfriend character and Karen (Judy Greer) we're all really good in this. And I really felt the anger, sadness, fear they were experiencing. Jamie Lee Curtis is fine, but honestly didn't need to be in the movie. Everyone else was serviceable but not standouts by any means.

The movie jumps all over the timeline and the map without warning; there's no clue who any of these people are or how they're related to each other; the dialog is puerile, stilted, and repetitious; and the ostensible star of the film, Jamie Leigh Curtis, spends most of her time either unconscious or in a hospital bed, saying that it's her duty to go and kill the killer, but she never even gets close.I used to see every SF and fantasy film released (about 80 a year), so I've got a sense of what a truly bad movie is, and this one qualifies.",Halloween Kills

Flawed, but has enough in it from the franchise to keep you interested. In saying that, goes a bit loopey near the end. But enjoyable.These types of Horror Movies should have the audience rooting for the protagonists to defeat and overcome the Antagonist. BUT, the characters in this film are either, weak, annoying, arrogant, idiots or flat out unlikable. So I was almost cheering when he killed alot of them. Tommy and Karen had to die at Michael's hand. I was so delighted when he killed them, I clapped. Unless you want to make Michael Myers a good guy and take the franchise further after part 3, I would make the story more anti-micheal and full of likeable characters who the audience want to see survive/live. When they die you want the viewers to feel sad, anger etc. Not happy cause their not in the film any longer.At this stage I'm looking forward to seeing Michael Myers murdering Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween 3. To shut her up 😆. In saying that, I will be watching part 3 regardless.",Halloween Kills
124,Otkon,It's fine with different themes and tactics than other entries in the franchise.,8,18 October 2021,"So this movie is literally called Halloween Kills. Because this sequel is about what happens when the public tries its hand at figuring out and defeating the Shape on the eponymous holiday.This is not a standard slasher film. Yes, it is a Michael Myers vehicle. But this isn't him vs. Babysitters. It is about what happens when a mob atempts to solve the murderous conundrum that plagues Haddonfield on All Hallow's Eve. And it doesn't go well.One of the main complaints from critics and viewers is that it is ""all over the place"". Yes, intentionally, because the mob is all over the place. They are running around like chickens with their heads cut off before they become people with their heads cut off. And a good chunk of the deaths are because the masses drunk on over-confidence think they can beat Michael with guns, bats and numbers. But as we learn, Michael cannot be figured out. He was never headed to the hospital to get Laurie, as everyone assumed we would (and as he did in the sequel to the original.)The other complaint is that this timeline supposedly dispensed with the supernatural elements of franchise. Not sure where people are getting this. If Michael is a mere, destructible man with discernible motivations, he is in no way the legendary cinematic threat that he is and always has been.Michael had a very specific plan while the townsfolk are mad with public hysteria. Get to his childhood home. Back to the origin. After he offs the Johns - one in the very spot of his sister's murder, he is fully recharged with whatever evil drives him. But because the mob has been underestimating him all night and still thinks him a mortal man, they swarm.Doesn't turn out as they would like. At what point are people going to realize that he is impervious physically and psychologically? Oh and then he kills Laurie's daughter in the room that feeds his sorcery. Yeah, so now we all know what has to happen in Halloween Ends. Laurie (who is hardly in this movie) stated that she and Michael have to die together to break the town's curse. She will have to offer the ultimate blood sacrifice of her life because as long as she is alive, Michael appears to be immortal. And now he is empowered with Strode blood.That is the explanation of this movie. They couldn't just make another girl power or perceptions of the PTSD elderly story. They showed us what happens when a pitchfork-wielding horde tries its hand at Michael Myers.That is a fairly new approach. And of course he still prevails.I did find the references to other films in the series fun. And the gore was absolutely delightful. One just has to see the movie for what it is.",Halloween Kills

About 20 minutes in, Jamie Lee Curtis suddenly appears picking up where she left off in the.2018 version of Halloween and it helps if you remember where that left off. I didn't as I don't remember a thing about any of these other than, vividly the original. And the first sequel. I'm sure I haven't seen a few that did not involve Curtis. I don't know. They're all the same. This version of a sequel contains a mighty large amount of stupid people getting killed primarily for that reason and I've never seen a movie in which so many people cannot shoot their target. They mostly get killed in various creative ways and many take a longer than possible time to die. Much like the first sequel, Curtis spends much of her time in a hospital, which may or may not be coincidental. She doesn't really have all that big of a part, but she does what she's supposed to do well and she gets to do it again as there is another one on the way! So many characters from the pervious films are killed here, Curtis should have the playing/killing field pretty much of the herself the next time and that is not such a bad thing.

Maybe after the disappointing 2018 version I had lower standards. But it's not acting like something else, it's a slasher and it's got the body count to show it.It does pick up right after the 2018 version, and if you haven't seen that you'll be confused with who the characters are and why there are there etc.. Honestly I was still confused sometimes because I can't even remember half of that movie.The performances here are good overall. The score, as always, great. The directing though, if I do have to give 2018 one advantage it has to be that the directing in Kills is a lot less impressive. It's appropriate, just not that interesting. Visually the movie looked good though.The story, well one could say nothing really happens. But it's definitely taking care of history, and I think that counts. It also shows that the next installment has very little left to work with, so that being the ending for the ''trilogy'' seems appropriate.The kills, from good to average. I expected a bit more creativity from this. Something that did exist in older installments of the Halloween franchise. Most kills are stabs and cuts. And the few creative looking kills, are only shown in the aftermath which is a bit disappointing.Character decisions, this is where so much goes wrong. But with these types of movies I accept a lot of stupidity. That said, people are always splitting up for reasons unknown and it gets a bit annoying.The way Michael was portrayed here I thought was fine, I still find the mask from the original that much more effective and alienating. This movie does ask more from Michael in terms of action scenes though. And I don'' find those effective in selling him as a creepy stalker serial killer. It makes it look a bit cheesy.All in all, you're going to the 100th Halloween movie, you're gonna get what you expect, and it does it pretty well.",Halloween Kills

Michael was so brutal as always. However, in that film the kills were amazing and so gory. Also, the scene, with the nurse and the gun was the funniest scene of the entire franchise, I laughed so hard. Anyway, the ending was expected, but the kill was unexpected. Even though, I'm not a fan of the ""Halloween"" franchise, I have to admit that this film and the previous one ""Halloween"" (2018) were so good and enjoyable. Moreover, it wasn't scary at all, only 2 jumpscares were in the movie (and they were predictable). Last but not least, they only thing I don't like about the ""Halloween movies universe"" is that Micheal never dies (I mean, it's not realistic at all).",Halloween Kills

140,cdjh-81125,The Most I've Ever Enjoyed A Halloween Film,7,28 October 2021,"To be completely blunt, I've never really understood the hype surrounding the Halloween franchise. Having watched the original a few years ago I thought it was only okay and to be honest a bit dull. I also didn't get much enjoyment out of the 2018 version, I didn't find it to be particularly tense and except Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode I didn't find myself really latching onto a single character. While I don't think Halloween Kills is devoid of the issues I've had with this franchise I was pleasantly surprised by this film and is easily my favourite from what I've seen of the films so far.I thought David Gordon Green did a very solid job directing this movie. I liked how he framed the violence and lingered on all the gory details. That's really what people come to these movies for after all. I thought he kept the film at a fairly consistent pace and the film certainly didn't overstay its welcome, a complaint I've had with too many movies in recent memory. Editing wise I thought the film was also pretty strong, I didn't think they fell into quick cuts to much and there were a fair few scenes of tension throughout. I thought there were probably a few too many jump scares but they were still effective for the most part.Character wise this was a pretty mixed bag. I liked Jamie Lee Curtis a lot , she's the one thing I've never denied loving about this franchise, I thought they did a good job of giving her things to do despite being confined to a hospital for most of the runtime and she really sold more of the emotional scenes. I liked the characters of her daughter and grand daughter more here than in the 2018 version. I thought both the actresses gave great performances and they were about the only characters making smart decisions throughout. Beyond that the rest of the cast were essentially just vessels for Michael Myers to brutally murder and I wouldn't say I cared about any of the drama or character development that was being set up. I see what they were trying to do with the Tommy Doyle character but it honestly came across as too forced and loud for me and I didn't think anything he did amounted to much.Even passionate lovers of the Halloween movies will admit that they're not exactly masterpieces of writing and this film is no different, the more attention you pay to the script of this movie the less you'll enjoy it. I will say that I enjoyed the flashbacks to 1978 and I thought the ending was fairly effective. But beyond that the script is full of characters making horrible, idiotic choices that make it incredibly obvious who is about to be murdered and the dialogue as whole was forgettable bordering on cringe worthy.Maybe it's the fact that I had very little expectations going in or my lack of nostalgia for the franchise as a whole but I found myself surprised at how much I ultimately enjoyed this movie. The writing and dialogue is better ignored where ever possible but I thought it was well directed and edited. It has all the violence and gory kills I'd want from a Halloween film and I wouldn't say I was ever bored while watching it. I suppose the biggest compliment I could give Halloween Kills is that it does make me want to give the original a second chance.7.3/10 - B (Solid)",Halloween Kills

Jamie Lee Curtis spends 1 hour and 4 minutes in a hospital bed, then she stands up and ruptures her spleen and ends up spending the rest of the film standing up in the room where the hospital bed is. Literally does nothing.Everyone who dies, does so because they make stupid decisions that no human would ever make.Nothing happens for at least half the film. Literally nothing. I expect trash from a slasher film but this was garbage. Stupid, unintelligent, pointless, boring garbage.Please stop making characters do stupid things, that no human would ever do, just because you aren't intelligent enough to write a realistic scenario.I don't want a documentary or a case study on serial killers but I also don't want to feel like an idiot, just for watching a movie.

147,Go_For_The_Jugular,2 weeks WASTED!,3,3 November 2021,"So I've finished my Halloween marathon...all 12 films in just under 2 weeks...and I can some it up in 3 words:I'M AN IDIOT!What a waste of time! 12 absolutely mediocre films. Admittedly, some were better than others, but ultimately they're all garbage. Every last one, a carbon copy of the original...just with a slight change. As I said in a few of my other reviews, it baffles me how this franchise is still going after 43 years. The only explanation I can think of, is that there wasn't any real competition, or anything similar to compare it to...so it's good by default.Good God in Heaven...wake up, people!If you asked me what the key points were in any of them, I couldn't even tell you. They're all so forgettable. There's no classics in the entire bunch. Take Star Wars - A New Hope, for instance, released around the same time...and I can remember nearly every scene from it, because that's a true 'classic'. And yes, I have watched Star Wars a few times since 1978, so it would be fresher in my memory, but my point is - I've watched all the Halloweens over the last 2 weeks...and I've already forgotten them! I've even forgotten what happened in Halloween Kills...which I watched TODAY!I honesty never want to watch any of them ever again. They all have zero replay value. However, I will watch Halloween Ends when it's released...just so the last 2 weeks won't be a complete waste of time.In summary - growing up, I always heard about this Halloween franchise that was supposed to be so amazing, but I never got a chance to watch it until adulthood. So here I am, as an adult, catching up with the rest of the world...and I'm sorry, I just don't get it. The hype, the love, the horror, Michael Myers...any of it! I mean, the dude isn't even scary looking. An emotionless white rubber mask??? Come tf on! I've seen scarier looking people in real life!Anyway, the whole franchise (all movies) gets a 3/10 from me.

The idea that Haddonfield as a whole is sick of Myers and what he's done to their community is a good one, though the execution of the ""mob mentality"" trope isn't without its issues. Namely, the pacing in the middle of the movie sags a bit. Still, I really enjoyed pretty much everything else here. This is the most brutal Michael Myers has ever been, and the movie can be very unsettling. I also like that this trilogy seems to be working toward an answer about why Michael is so difficult to take down. Also, the flashbacks that tie to the 1978 original are fantastic (and these are more than simple nods).Overall, I was satisfied with this follow-up and had a good time while watching it.

So, was the sustained master that showed Michael in and around the house. This thing is just off the tracks. It lacks focus and just isn't very enjoyable.

It really felt like the old halloween movies from the original and the 1980's. Watching those would always be a tradition and would get me feeling like halloween. This movie was fun but dumb at times.Most of the victims were IDIOTS! I felt bad for the escaped mental patient who leapt to his death. I didnt feel bad for any of the other victims. They were all IDIOTS! Idiots! From the fire fighters to the idiots from the bar, to the gay couple(funny) to everybody else.The judy greer lady stabbed him with A PITCHFORK! She stabbed him once! She could've kept stabbing him but nope! Just one stab and then she runs away! Lol. They always do that in these movies. She could've keot stabbing and stabbed him in his neck, but nope! Just once. The mob could've killed him with a shotgun to the head a few times. But they(the writers) didnt want to finish him. There might be a third film. The mom dies. Good. The marion lady dies. Good. Lindsey or whatever didnt die but let michael kill everybody who was in her vehicle. She was unreliable. Dumb!This was still a fun movie to watch but they didn't even try to kill him. And in the previous movie, laurie thought she could burn her house down and it would kill him?! Lol. She should've had a flamethrower and shot him in the face with a shotgun but NOPE!

158,BijeshNagesh,An Impressive Sequel,7,30 October 2021,"As director, it must have been tricky for David Gordon Green to helm a project that's not only part of a beloved horror-slasher franchise but contains a continuation-conclusion storyline for the ever-popular Michael Myers, the man-monster behind that creepy instantly recognisable mask.In ""Halloween Kills"" 2021, the emphasis was equally placed on Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) - they did much the same in this title's immediate prequel, ""Halloween"" 2018. I found this decision highly laudable. No longer did they simply have her playing the helpless 'scream queen'. In this film, she becomes an avenging angel of sorts and takes the fight to Michael instead of quivering and lingering, waiting for him to find her...again.All her sequences were as nostalgic as they were interesting. I loved the spirit that Jamie Lee Curtis brought to ""Halloween Kills"" 2021, but was a tad disappointed to see her daughter land the killing blow near the end of the film. It would have brought poetic-justice closure to watch Laurie end Michael, but oh well. Then again, he lives... So there's that.The original creators of these super-popular characters were (late) Debra Hill and John Carpenter. I'm certain they'll have appreciated what David did with this movie. John's still alive, so am only guessing as to what his reaction might have been to the film, which is currently in theatres and streaming exclusively on Peacock. I saw ""Halloween Kills"" in theatres after it released in Chennai on October 29, 2021.The three-man team of screenwriters who took on this project are deserving of praise. They made the film feel classic yet new. Kudos to Scott Teems, Danny McBride, and David Gordon Green (the director playing a double role J).Michael Myers in the movies is called 'The Shape'. In this 2021 title, the scary baddie was played by three people, I think, for different sequences - James Jude Courtney, Airon Armstrong, and Nick Castle. You'll never see any of their faces directly, even that one time when Karen pulled his mask off. Therein remains the evergreen mystery that is Michael Myers.Officer Hawkins (played by Will Patton) was great to watch. They almost killed him off right at the start, though, but he survived to give viewers an admirable performance as the story progressed. Will was taking over from the younger Haddonfield Sherriff's Department officer who actually saw and pulled a gun on the Shape - I don't recall if this scene was established in the original title. Michael's killing spree (in 1978) was drawing attention, and Hawkins was the first officer to chase the Shape down an alley only to lose him soon after. Oddly enough, Hawkins knew Michael as a kid - he calls him 'one of those weirdo freaks' in this film.Another officer whose entry surprised me was Pete McCabe (played by Jim Cummings). Surprised, because I only recently came to hear of Jim's work in ""The Beta Test"" movie - looking forward to that one. Albeit a small role, Jim made it work in ""Halloween Kills"". The character Pete also knew Michael as a kid. He shared his strange memories of the boy from 1963 with Hawkins. This was around the time a six-year-old Michael killed his own sister.I liked the way David Gordon Green had Hawkins accidentally shoot Pete in the neck when he was being assaulted by Michael. And then in 'modern day', Hawkins sustained a near-fatal neck wound. Quite karmic, in a way, that scene.I thoroughly appreciated the way David used the asylum escapee to stir deep emotions in me, the viewer, about how easy it is for people to lose themselves in a 'blame game'. Goes to show that true evil doesn't always suffer in the wake of its cruelties. I absolutely loved the sequences where the patient in questions was cornered in the hospital, wrongfully accused of being Michael Myers, and being hunted like an animal by ordinary people who were chanting ""Evil dies tonight!"" as they ran fear-fuelled every which way to kill the mentally disturbed asylum patient. The patient, though a mad man, felt the sanest of the lot. He somehow seemed to realize that the only way to escape the insane mob was to leap to his death from a higher storey window.Karen (played by Judy Greer), Allyson (played by Andi Matichak), and all other cast members did good work as well. Everyone's performances kept the tension taut throughout the movie, which in its first twenty minutes proved that it was a worthy successor to 2018's ""Halloween"".That flashback scene even had one officer trying to corner Michael Myers in his old, now abandoned, home and sounding (voiced by Colin Mahan) an awful lot like Dr. Samuel Loomis (originally played by Donald Pleasence). The lookalike (played by Tom Jones Jr.) they showed on screen was eerily similar. So much nostalgia in a matter of minutes!Cody and John Carpenter both did excellent work on musical scoring for this sequel along with Daniel A. Davies. They hit the right notes, especially that variation-tune inspired by the original. Several nostalgic layers played up at all the right moments during the film. Their work re-introduced the classic 1978 ""Halloween"" movie to the current generation of horror lovers. I'm sure it will inspire new viewers to at least go see the 2018 title, if they haven't already.Michael Simmonds's cinematography was the cherry on this frightfully good cake. He too kept the focus on classic nostalgia without sacrificing modern capture techniques. All the 'classic original' flashback sequences felt like watching the first film in several regards - exceptional detailing and camera angling. In close connection, Timothy Alverson's editing made a lot of things work on behalf of this movie.Emily Gunshor's costume design brought back the late-70s feel for Michael Myers while keeping the rest of the characters rooted in contemporary styles. It must have been a bizarre balancing act, but she pulled it off with elegance.Special shout to all crew members who worked on Makeup, VFX, Stunts, Special Effects, Art, and Production Design. Their seamless work lent great credence and credibility to ""Halloween"" 2021.This movie is so good - hysteria, mob instinct, mass panic, you name it - it will make you want to go back and see the original 1978 title, which was relatively sombre but just as bloody. While 2018 ""Halloween"" and 2021 ""Halloween Kills"" were great movies that showcased character-centric revenge arcs, particularly for Laurie Strode, the 1978 film that started it all remains, in my opinion, the best of the lot - it holds tight to its bloodied knife.That said, I recommend you go see the 2021 sequel, it was absolutely worth the wait and as entertaining as it should be. I have a good feeling this is not the last we've seen of Michael Myers.",Halloween Kills

It not only adds nothing to the story, it destroys some of the good things from the 2018 version. I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time with the COVID delays, and I sadly have to say it was not worth the wait at all.The characters in this movie were atrocious. Firstly, they destroyed 'Laurie Strode'. Not only does she do absolutely nothing in this movie, she is rude to kind nurses and assaults a doctor. Yup, that'll get us on her side. But that wasn't even the worst of it. The side characters they created for this film were embarrassing. There is a scene where a character just stares at 'Michael Myers', says something to the effect of, ""Michael, you've come home"", and then just stands there and waits to be killed. That's the worst example of it, but this is very much a rinse and repeat thing throughout the film.",Halloween Kills

166,scott-sw,Good addition to the Halloween Franchise,8,15 October 2021,"Halloween Kills lives up to its name. It kills - quite a bit.As the second installment to a sequel trilogy, it picks up right after the first one let off. However, we do not have John Carpenter penning the script, or handling the director's chair. Both those duties fall to David Gordon Green (and two other writers in the mix).Although not a perfect segue from the first installment, it is a solid entry into the oft-awry Halloween franchise that has taken so many twists and turns that previous entries often end up on the wrong track, lost, and driving the wrong way. The previous installment did have more scares and tension, but Halloween Kills packs a pretty good punch.It picks up right after Halloween 2018 leaves off - sort of. It also picks up right after the original Halloween as police search for Michael Myers after he escaped from Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). We then get the backstory on how the Shape was apprehended.That's when we get the story of Officer Hawkins, his younger self played by Thomas Mann and his partner are able to track Myers down and use the police to finally capture him. Then we are catapulted to 2018 when Officer Hawkins as Patton Oswalt is found alive. We also see how Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak) are fleeing the house just burned.Yes, Michael (Nick Castle) survived and proceeds to murder the entire fire crew. He continues to find new victims.At the same time, we jump over to a bar where an aged Lonnie Elam (Robert Longstreet) welcomes Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall), Lindsay (Kylie Richards) and Marion (Nancy Stephens) are reuniting from the terrible night from 40 years ago. A point to make is that while Marion and Lindsay are played by their respective actors from 40 years ago, Tommy was recast because of an unsuccessful attempt to find Brian Andrews who originally did the role.Tommy tells the story of the vicious evil that still exists: Michael Myers. He then retells the story with a palpable effect, ending it with the idea that he is still out there, and he will die. Suddenly the news breaks, and the town knows the terror is on the loose again. They will stop him at any cost, much at the rallying cry of a jaded, angry, and cynical Tommy.True, the film is good - but not perfect. It does have some flaws. First was with the number of characters we have. David Gordon Green wants to do good fan service - mostly in using common characters and many of the original actors. Even Charles Cyphers returns as Sheriff (retired) Leigh Bracket who is still mourning the loss of his daughter. But sometimes it is overkill to keep up with the old guard (some of whom are killed) and the new guard (also some are killed).On the other hand, one scene has Michael climbing atop a car, providing a throwback scene from the original. Also Dr. Loomis returns - mostly by voice and stand-in in a couple of flashback scenes. I thought adding the voice was good, and seeing the movements of his arms and legs, but showing his face (a stand-in whose face was digitized) seemed disrespectful to the late Donald Pleasance.Another flaw was the use of two other sets of characters: Scott MacArthur and Michael McDonald as a gay couple who have bought the old Myers house and upgraded it, as well as Michael Smallwood and Carmela McNeal as an African American couple dressed as medical professionals. Both were used for comic effect - and not in a great way. It was cringeworthy mostly with McNeal and Smallwood, filling the trope of the black people who will be killed, with often humorous lines that are not funny. More than anything, though, they detracted from the main plot.One flaw I saw with Michael is a betrayal of character, which is something I detest more than anything in a movie franchise or a TV series. Character growth is good, but Michael, or rather ""It"" (as Dr. Loomis would say) does not grow. Instead, he becomes more ruthless, striking down several people at once instead of the old tactic of splitting them up as he did in the original. He also inflicts more pain and vicious attacks instead of a one slice or stab move.A great strength, though, is there is no attempt to explain this evil. In the forced ""Halloween II,"" Carpenter came up with a decent reason - although it is shied away from in this day. However, a worse take were the 4, 5, and 6 chapters that tried to blame family, occultism, and astrology. Even more disastrous was Rob Zombie exploring the pathology of Michael Myers.On the strong side was an underlying theme that as society works to rub out evil, they become evil itself. This is prevalent as a mob at the hospital chases down an innocent man, thinking he is Michael Myers, and killing him. As Nietzsche said, ""When fighting monsters, do not become one."" The Boogeyman's evil triggered hate in the victims who struck back - and that's why you cannot kill the Boogeyman.",Halloween Kills
167,evilnigga,Real piece of work,2,29 October 2021,"Lacking any tension and basically anything that makes it scary. It's main focus is this ridiculously stupid angry mob with a cringe catchphrase. Combined with a great score the kills are actually not that bad, some of them are entertaining and well directed. Though it's not enough to make me forgot the dumb stuff that happened beforehand. Just like the plot every single character is an idiot, glad Michael killed most of them. The only nightmare it gave me is that the fact that one day they're going to milk this franchise again and it'll probably going to be worse than this.",Halloween Kills

172,ryanpersaud-59415,A Trainwreck. You Kinda Can't Look Away,3,25 October 2021,"The Good: Michael Myers. As usual, the silent masked slasher is the highlight of the Halloween movies, who by himself, can generate enough tension and entertainment. I liked how this film depicts Michael's cruelty; it was a nice tough and made him even more terrifying. He's not just a mindless machine, oh no. He LIKES killing people and the more suffering he can inflict, the better. It's chilling.I also really liked the cinematography in parts. It was reminiscent of 1970s horror films, with a swooping camera, zoom ins and side-by-sides. When the movie flashes back to the 1970s, it kinda looks like a movie from that era, which was a nice touch.The Bad: The film eschews Laurie and her family to instead follow residents of Haddonfield mobilize to take on Michael Myers. It's not an inherent bad idea, but it's executed terribly.This movie is stuffed with terrible characters, who spout stilted, weird dialog, act incredibly unrealistically, and don't seem to remember what movie they're in. This movie was made by comedic people, and it's quite obvious; there are so many instances of misplaced, odd humour that contribute to an overbearing sense of tonal inconsistency. You'll have characters delivering lines as if they're in a bad Judd Apatow movie, and then see Michael gouge someone's eyes out the next scene. It just feels...weird.The movie has so much going on, but as my girlfriend said to me about 35 minutes in: ""nothing is happening."" It spends so much time juggling all of these random people that the movie forgets to be scary. Michael kills a lot of people, it's often quite shocking and brutal, but it's devoid of tension or atmosphere. We don't even get the classic Michael walking slowly towards the screen scenes. We barely get any hide and seek. Instead, we get a ludicrous scene where Haddonfield collectively delivers mob justice to an innocent person, in a way that just defies any semblance of realistic human behaviour.Not only that, but the idea that this town would be so incensed by a killer who terrorized them 40 YEARS AGO is just incredulous. In hindsight, removing all of the sequels from the canon seems like a mistake. If Michael Myers was this killer who came back every few Halloweens, I would understand the ""mob"" storyline a lot more and it would at least make sense. By removing all of that, you have all of this mythos built up that the audience is aware of, but the characters shouldn't be and they act in ways inconsistent with the premise of the rebooted series. They wanted to have their cake and eat it too.The Ugly: This movie shares more in common with Jurassic World or Rise of Skywalker than it does with contemporary horror movies. It takes itself so seriously at times and treats EVERYTHING from the original with such reverence, that it becomes laughable. Studio tentpoles nowadays weaponize nostalgia to the extent that these movies can't really stand on their own. Skip it, or watch it drunk and laugh.By the end of the movie, I wasn't really sure where they would take this franchise. It seems like they squandered a decent idea and might just need to go back to basics.",Halloween Kills
173,Benslie,Evil might not die tonight but my attention span did,5,17 October 2021,"The Halloween series is not known for having very good stories and usually just having a basic plotline that can still be followed but this movie just felt like they didn't fully understand what they wanted the story to be. The best way I would describe the plot of this movie is that they created the kills for this movie and then threw a generic mob storey around it because that's what it felt like to me. This movie just jumps around way too much that it's hard to figure out what exactly is going on and more importantly which characters are still alive. This leads to the audience not really caring about any of the characters and routing for them. I won't give too much away but there's this one group of characters who legit just disappeared and I forgot about them entirely. Obviously, the jumping around is also a result of the editing and let's just say it's not that it could be better. There were hardly any transition techniques used to switch between scenes so when it changed, I got startled and just thought so we're just going to not continue that scene alright. This doesn't help with the pacing of this movie where honestly, I couldn't figure out how fast or slow this movie was going. Now, this might seem like a good thing but for this movie, it's a bad thing since this movie has so much stop and go to it. I wish I could say that the acting in this movie was any better but unfortunately it wasn't. You can tell the actors were doing their best but at times I laughed when I knew I wasn't supposed to be. In the end, Halloween Kills isn't the best movie and I would recommend staying in and rewatching the 2018 film.",Halloween Kills

175,clarkmick33,Tone all over the place!,5,16 October 2021,The tone of this movie seemed to be all over the place ... the first part seemed campy and even cheesy.Then we are introduced to randoms who had loose links to the Halloween franchise - all are forgettable and hard to remember the relevance.The kills are gruesome and satisfying for a slasher flick. Although most victims seem incompetent and ridiculous.The problem I had was the instead of the stalker and sneaky approach of Myers as in the past .. he just takes everything on .... In a non-scary way ..... almost like a kinda mask wearing terminator.It's ok movie but it ultimately feels like a direct to video movie.,Halloween Kills

Amazing gore and some good scares really aren't enough to make up for the boring and stupid characters, the terrible and predictable script and most importantly the insanely crap acting. This movie was a huge let down, it had all the potential to be a hit and another good edition to the series but sadly not. A terrible follow up!",Halloween Kills
179,hotrobinproductions,Inspiration from nostalgia may help... but not entirely.,6,9 September 2021,"Let me start by saying I MAY NEED TO REWATCH, this is my first theater experience and I'm going based off of how I feel, I do have a lot of mixed feelings but here is how I feel at the moment...The movie is very entertaining and uses what worked in the first one. When they said it was Halloween Kills on Acid, they weren't lying. They really do go balls deep into the direction of the first one. The performances and actors literally CARRY the movie. I think the problem isn't David Gordon Green and his vision but it's more of the absurdity and convolution in this script... the movie tries to force into it all at once into your mouth. From nostalgia, to introducing characters you don't really need to know, Sometimes It feels much more bloated than what it needed to be. I appreciated the spectacle it was trying to be in a way, but the way they executed it was just poor for my taste... We don't need to be spoon fed by nostalgia I'd rather focus on the characters at stake introduced in the 2018. I'm guessing we needed the older characters to wreak Mayhem just so that we can have the characters we are familiar with to be involved but it just ends up becoming this mess that makes no sense... when they end up chasing who they think is ""the boogeyman"" and it ends unexpectedly I literally sighed in disappointment. I understood the purpose from what the officer says after it, but it's just executed so poorly. I will say what saved this movie certainly were the kills, mystery of michael I do respect the nostalgia and homage, and I also enjoyed the scrambled mess at times and did feel nice. It won't be for everyone. It certainly isn't a great or even ""good"" movie but it is solid enough to be worthy of a sequel and of course is better than anything else in the franchise. I would rank this a top 3 or 4 halloween movie in the franchise. I might have to watch H20 to debate whether or not it's better but nonetheless not a TERRIBLE movie. It's got moments and I think I just need to rewatch it again.",Halloween Kills
180,waltermwilliams,Evil Dies Tonight,6,2 November 2021,"To balance all the good that ""Halloween' (2018) did for rebooting this tired franchise ""Halloween Kills"" manages to somehow undo.In case you are a total newbie to horror and this saga heres a quick revision.Michael Myers has been incarcerated for most of his natural life for initially stabbing his own sister in the breast with shears when he was just a sick 6 year old kid and taking down a few other local teens in the course of a bloody Halloween night in October 1963...Oh what a night!Well he's back up against his nemesis, Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis the babysitter from those heady days (again).However in this thrilling chapter which is essentially a part two to Halloween (2018) the same night goes on for seemingly 36 hours.No one is safe from Michael's killing spree including eleven first responder Firemen.In fact, I stopped counting the death toll when it reached 30, but I know it went even higher and in many grizzly, inventive ways to die.Both Jame Jude Courtney, Nick Castle and Airon Armstrong all play The Shape as Michael is referred to in the Cast because of the use of archival footage from other previous movies in this franchise.One of the best things about this movie is the editing and seamless inclusion of old stock film from 1978 onwards with the current film.Somehow though this 6 and half foot tall monster gets mistaken at the local Hospital for a tiny bald bloke who also escaped from the same mental institution van also transporting Michael.Go figure...now the villagers are the monsters after hunting this nobody down and causing his inevitable suicide.Meanwhile Mr Myers and his grotesque now burned mask are still raking up the body count as he is hunted down by a pack of locals baying for blood and headed by baseball bat swinging Anthony Michael Hall and his comic relief cronies.If you thought Rob Zombie was the worst thing to happen to Halloween, think again.Using the term ""Evil Dies Tonight"" and it's derivatives you could have a great drinking or bingo game.All I want for Xmas is for Santa to bring me the Tee Shirt.How did Director, David Gordon Green go so off his path with this sequel?It was a slam dunk, but instead he kicks an own goal.And where is Jamie Lee during the majority of this movie?She's in a hospital bed swapping fireside stories with Will Patton as ""Officer Hawkins"" playing a blame game.Apart from the one time she jabs herself in the butt with a cocktail of painkillers, gets out of bed, ruptures her wounds from the last film and is promptly carried back to her bed.It reminds me of The Shining and how ineffective Scatman Crothers, ""Hallorann"" was in protecting Jack Torrences family.Good luck killing this S. O. B. Myers, after 43 years he still takes a licking and keeps on ticking like the watches in my collection of timepieces.Will some just please take a headshot/double tap to Michael in the next incarnation.Have they never seen a Zombie movie?Please tell me ""Halloween The End"" is going to be a return to form in October 2022.",Halloween Kills

184,A_Llama_Drama,A stop-gap on its way to a finale,6,20 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is like a 22nd episode season that needs to shuffle it's core cast to a point in the 20th episode before the two-part finale. While it's got blood aplenty and a decent enough twist in the end delivered by Laurie Strode, it doesn't offer a satisfying whole.Picking up immediately from where Halloween '18 left off, Laurie and her family are on their way to the hospital with Michael hopefully burning to death in the basement. But because this is a sequel, we all know he's survived it. After hacking up the fire department on hand to put out the flames, he's off on round two. This time, however, the townspeople of Haddonfield are not willing to let him get away with another massacre.The story could be great. It should be great. The entire town should know about his evil actions from the past, and by the beginning of this movie, know he has returned. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters need Michael to survive into the final part, and without a convincing reason as to why the townspeople would lose this fight, they get left to behave like absolute muppet lemmings lining up for the meatgrinder.Thankfully, the movie works in a few of its moments. The first victims after Michael escapes the burning inferno (a delightful elderly couple) and the gay couple now residing in the Myers' home, are given plenty to work with so that when Michael erupts into their living rooms, you do feel a pang of sadness for them. The townsfolk (many from the original movie, played by their original actors), get given a little to play around with, and their violence and recklessness is understandable when you consider the 40 years of fear and confusion they must have been harboring. Just look at how traumatised Laurie was in H18. That collective trauma explodes here in a desire to end a nightmare. Sadly, as mentioned, the writers allow far too many errors to occur so that Michael may survive the night, making the victims appear hapless and dumb. Tommy, who should be a hero, does everything wrong from the second he picks up the baseball bat.There is an interesting fatalistic streak to Halloween. Laurie felt it first, as Michael got ever closer to her, 40 years ago. Even now, there appears to be a willingness on the people populating this town to embrace the death he'll bring. Michael isn't so much a cause but a symptom of violence and fear, and, as Laurie explains to surviving Detective Hawkins, it's gonna require more than just weapons to take him down.There is a good movie hidden somewhere in there, but without enough plot to make this a full product, and with a town full of lemmings dressed in people clothing, it's difficult to form a strong response to it. Still, next year's Halloween Ends is gonna be something, alright!",Halloween Kills
185,MovieWarfare,So incredibly stupid that it is difficult to enjoy,3,30 October 2021,"Halloween is such a weird franchise with its constant reboots and different timelines, weird 3rd anthology movie and Busta Rhymes. Halloween (2018) was a surprisingly decent sequel/reboot and I was definitely interested in a sequel. So does this sequel live up to the 2018 version or is this another failed sequel?Firstly, it does live up to the title as Michael Myers kills A LOT of people. The kills are also quite enjoyable to watch and it is a blast to see him take down multiple individuals. Actually, Every scene featuring Michael Myers is a highlight including him stalking his prey is fun to watch. There is also a flashbacks sequence that occurs in this film that involves using a filter to make it seem like the original 1978 movie. They also used makeup instead of CGI to bring back Dr Loomis and it looks phenomenal. The scene also fixes a plot hole from the 2018 version so that was appreciated. Surprisingly, Halloween Kills explores some social commentary about mob mentality. It shows how the fear of Michael can turn people evil as well.However, the social commentary is dampened by how stupid every character is in this movie. So many characters in this movie make the stupidest decisions ever made. So many characters for some reason love splitting up instead of sticking together. The movie also shows that it is clear people can buy guns yet we will see a bunch of people try to fight Myers with baseball bats and hockey sticks. There is also one scene where a couple hears that someone is in their house but for some reason don't go outside and call the cops. One massive annoyance in this movie is that people for some reason, don't just gang up on Myers and instead come at him one at a time like complete morons. Furthermore, these people don't seem to ever try GOING FOR THE HEAD. It also baffles me that none of the characters realises where Myers is planning to go when it was extremely obvious.The story is also a complete let-down. In Halloween Kills there are two parallel plot lines, one with Myers and one with the mobs. While the mob social commentary is interesting, the plotline doesn't have any bearing on Myer's plot. It instead feels like it is taking a lot of screen time from what the audience wants. Additionally, Halloween Kills seems to change how Myer's operates compared to the previous canon films. In Halloween (2018) there was a motive that Myers is returning to finish Laurie but Halloween Kills decides to just toss that motive straight out of the window. Michael Myers also felt like a psychotic killer in the previous canon films but in Halloween Kills he must have supernatural powers because he is surviving way too many unbelievable injuries with ease and magically teleporting. He also seems to know martial arts now or something because he is doing some ""IP Man"" style kills when fighting multiple individuals.One of the big disappointments is how they handled the iconic Halloween character, Laurie Strode. Throughout the film, Laurie is just in a hospital talking and monologuing. Her scenes are so irrelevant that you could remove her character and the story will still be the same. So if Laurie is not the protagonist then who is? Well, the movie splits the screen time between Laurie's daughter Karen (Judy Greer), granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak), Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall) the child who survived in 1978, a straight couple and a gay couple. The problem is that there is not really a clear protagonist and they just split the screen time between a bunch of less interesting characters. None of them has enough screen time to develop their characters and none of them is even that likeable either.Overall, Halloween Kills is unfortunately a very bad sequel. It does provide the fun slashing kills that a fair amount of fans would want and enjoy. However, it is difficult to fully enjoy this film when there is a high amount of stupidity in it. This franchise was rebooted to remove itself from the ridiculous supernatural nature but seems to be making the same mistakes. Halloween Kills was a middle instalment that doesn't build up to anything for the final instalment. The inevitable conflict between Michael Myers and Laurie for Halloween Ends just feels less meaningful now. Hopefully, Halloween Ends somehow does better.",Halloween Kills
186,garethwooduk,Wasn't brilliant but still enjoyable..,7,18 October 2021,"There's no denying it so no spoiler, there was always going to be third and final instalment so this movie is planting the seed.Like Laurie said the more he kills, more he takes on a new shape of evil... Which he does still on a complete rampage picking up from last movie.I liked the flash backs to the 70s, from some of the characters in the present day, film was very steady throughout with more menacing kills and much more bloody, also making you jump never knowing where Michael is lurking...Not sure what else people can expect from a slasher movie but let's hope Halloween Ends goes out with a bang!",Halloween Kills
187,CaressofSteel75,The Mob Rules...,9,17 October 2021,"Woah, we really have something here...Michael Myers returns to Haddonfield stronger than ever...the law is defeated...evil and fear reign without equal...the people realize they have to fight...but they don't know the nature of their enemy...they don't have a chance...John Carpenter speaks loud and clear in this version of the old Halloween story, where the spirits of evil, fear and confusion get top billing. It's an allegory of the bug running through society woven into classic horror. The evil has been there for years, but now the Shape is more cruel, more merciless and more present than ever before. Halloween Kills shows you characters that existed on the fringes of this series from the beginning- people who escaped and survived Michael Myers decades ago, and who mostly thought they weren't part of this, but now are forced to realize that death has returned for them, and they have never been free of it. It's been a ticking time bomb their whole lives. It's not just about Lori Strode. It never was. It's all about them, too. And a good number of them don't survive.It's ably directed by David Gordon Green who shows us the futility of mob action, but recognizes that the individuals involved ultimately had no choice. The duly constituted authorities have failed to contain this contagion for decades. ""Evil dies tonight"" becomes the peoples' chant. Some hold out against it as long as they can...Lori's daughter implores her mother- ""We have police; we have a system,"" but ultimately she too has to put herself within the path of a spreading evil.It doesn't work out well for her or for a lot of other people. Lori's daughter unmasks Michael and leads him to the mob for retribution. They do get a measure of it, until Michael Myers shows them the full measure of what he is, and there are no survivors of that. No standard Halloween ending in this one- no ambiguous, quasi-death for Michael Myers- no way for any survivor to claim some type of victory and live to seek peace or fight another day. Michael Myers, the monster who couldn't kill Lori Strode, has destroyed Haddonfield.",Halloween Kills
188,robinsonaustin-07490,The Bogeyman Lives,7,15 October 2021,"I will admit the screenplay isn't the best for those wanting a narrative to go in hand with the kills. The film also suffers slightly from the lack of a strong lead and the returning characters being fan service.I did like the idea that Michael is such a poisonous monster, Haddonfield is tainted by his evil causing the citizens to revert into rabid animals with little rhyme nor reason. Though the side plot about it does kind of bring the film down.And the last thing it does is sequel bait which makes the film end abruptly. Because of that, it feels like half of an incomplete film.But it is an enjoyable watch nonetheless even when it amounts to being a bog-standard slasher.",Halloween Kills

This is where it should've stopped...on a side note type of film.This film?Just another unnecessary continuation of a film franchise that further bastardizes Carpenter's original. Gone are the days of exploitive slasher films in the mainstream, but instead replaced by bland, dumbed down reinterpretations of classic genre cinema. Instead of naive, oversexed teens dealing with the tension and horror of the unknown, you get bloated baby boomer pseudo slasher theatrics--and apparently this sells?The origin story, at this point, is beyond convoluted and contrived---and Anthony Michael Halls character portrayal is one of ""when does this idiot die already"" and the family dynamic is just plain tired at this point.The final act just sealed the cringworthy idiocy with Michael somehow getting up and walking in slow motion slaughtering the ""villagers.""

What are the odds of a biracial & a gay couple in a tiny town of Hadddonville both getting killed in the same night??Hollywood just can't stop messing up movies/TV show by making sure they check off those PC boxes!Next, why do people in horror movies 'line up' to be the next victim?? The town KNOWS about Michael Meyers and how many people he has killed, but they keep going into places alone or few people and keep getting slaughtered.Then, sure seems like it was simply too easy for Michael Meyers to slaughter not just the one's and two's he is out to get, but take on and kill 10-20 people at a time!!.... I know its a movie & he is ""Pure Evil"", but I didn't know he was the Terminator or Rambo.Lastly, the 'frenzy' of the town folk in the movie is just corny and I have heard its a jab at the protest at the Capitol in Jan over the sham of an election.Glad I didn't pay money to see this in the theater.

192,pronitmallick,Just for the vibe,5,17 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is a movie that starts its night with a mild atmosphere and goes on heating it up. Right from the beginning the vibe of the film indicates towards one single suspense to the end. All the characters in the movie have given a nice performance that blends quite well with the overall theme. The intensity and suspense thrown at us by the presentation of this movie makes us engaged in the seat on one side but on the other side it makes us just wanna skip the film to the end and find the end result of it. In terms of story there's nothing that stands out as something really dynamic or branched, it's just the mix recipe of thrill and suspense that's good enough to make the audience eat their popcorn for one and half hour straight. All in all it's a film that audiences can watch for once and enjoy on their own. In terms of watching it's a little heavy towards one time watch.",Halloween Kills

(the soundtrack was really great, elevating it from a 6 to 7.. unfortunately, this new soundtrack didn't seem fresh or exciting) This was a pure cash grab and really awful. It was funny at times, but it's EXTREMELY bad. It's too bad because 2018 felt like they were really doing something kinda fun. Even the soundtrack wasn't nearly on the same level as 2018... this felt like a rushed cash grab. It seriously has some of the worst written dialogue I've ever heard uttered on the big screen. The flashbacks to 1978 were the only good parts, thanks to the extremely talented Jim Cummings (I highly recommend you check out his work and search him within the IMDB database). Too bad his part was so small. Anyway, you've all been warned. Anything that was good about 2018 has been completely thrown out for this horrible sequel. Enjoy the original. Hell, enjoy part 2 (it's good!). Maybe check out 2018... Be prepared for a travesty if you watch this one.This film was made for one reason and one reason only. To make money off of the buzz 2018 had. It is a blatant cash grab with no shame that takes advantage of a built in fan base. At least the Rob Zombie trashy remakes were an attempt to honor Carpenter's creation... 2018 made the same attempt and gave us something pretty fun... this... Halloween Kills... what is this? This is disgusting. They set out their lures for Halloween fans, fished them in and cheated them. Now we have to live with a half of a faithful fan base living in denial that only compares to when the Phantom Menace hit theaters. I rather be strapped to a chair and forced to watch Halloween: Resurrection until I starved to death than see this film again. What a betrayal.",Halloween Kills
194,crickwill,YES,8,31 October 2021,"Halloween Kills wants to please (us) and its a film that shows it desperately wants to not put a foot wrong. In this, the film does succeed quite well besides all its detractors and people born way too late. If you weren't around in '78 upon the release of the original Halloween and haven't lived to see the institution it became, you are in a league of people too young to be able to make judgements or assess merit. The personal affiliation can run very deep. On this particular film or any others preceding it, and some of them have been truly lousy. But Halloween Kills is solid. It does have great kills, it looks great, works well and even comes with a gift wrapped 'message' and there's nothing wrong with that. It's a vast improvement on the last entry and an indication that at least someone has been doing their homework. Halloween Kills was being so critically trounced that I almost considered not bothering. Just goes to show the ignorance of a great percentage of popular opinion these days. What it all boils down to for the Official Halloween Crowd, is either a YES or NO as to whether or not to go to it. For me its a resounding YES.",Halloween Kills

Interesting story, interesting characters and cool kills. For some reason it seems like most horror movie directors nowadays have absolutely nothing interesting to add. They just ...make. Like they have zero work ethic or love for or pride in anything they do. And that's ""Halloween Kills"" in a nutshell. Dumb, stupid, uninteresting and boring.

196,FixedYourEnding,Halloween kills - mostly your spare time,5,1 November 2021,"Halloween kills (2021) falls into the trap of ""hey, it doesn't matter what we make, people will come see it anyway"". It is an unimpressive attempt at making something that will be just enough for people to not ask for their money back. It is the worse movie in the series yet.Listing what this movie has to offer can be summed up in one line: mindless gore. Ok, it's a slasher and it's being done by the already well-known Michael Myres with his silly mask running after a couple of hysterical people. What we don't have in this movie can easily filled up a whole notebook, here are some quick notes from that notebook:
1. No story
2. No likeable characters (including Jamie Lee Curtis)
3. No good dialogues
4. No good scenery or exciting shots
5. Bad pacing
6. Bad cut scenes (read this either way you want)
7. It is not scary at all

202,~AleXa~,Paying homage to the original is not enough to save this from its grueling pace,7,18 October 2021,"Reviewed October 17, 2021 - 1ST viewing 10/14/21 in Dolby at AMC
Universal Studios - Rated R - Directed by: David Gordon Green
Based On: Sequel/John CarpenterThe Halloween franchise has certainly had a sordid history, with a spattering of mediocre sequels and clichéd remakes, however this latest installment offers a dichotomy of excellent ideas bogged down by a painstakingly slow pace in an amateurish effort to slow the events down to drag this latest reboot out into a trilogy.Halloween Kills (2021) picks up following the events at the end of its predecessor, Halloween (2018), where Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis, Karen (Judy Greer), and Alyson (Andi Matichak) are riding away from their home, now engulfed in flames, with Michael trapped in the basement as it burns around him. They yell at first responders as they pass them, going to extinguish the fire they'd hoped would end their collective nightmare once and for all. Some players from the original are included in this installment as well, including the great Will Patton as present-day Officer Hawkins, Robert Longstreet as Lonnie Elam, Anthony Michael Hall as Tommy Doyle, Kyle Richards as Lindsey, and Nancy Stephens as Marion.Returning to once again co-write and direct, David Gordon Green does an exceptional job paying attention to the minute details to honor the source material and offer fans lots of easter eggs and subtle nods to previous films, including some of the less popular sequels. The death scenes are appropriately graphic and iconic, not only paying homage to previous iterations, but the ever-popular video game as well. The choice to one again incorporate the original theme song and keep the opening credits as an updated mimic of the original was a smart one, lending the all-too-familiar eerie quality from the beginning. As previously mentioned, many of the original characters return, with the original story elaborated.Where interest begins to wane is in the second act when the plot becomes repetitive and slow, seeing Tommy run around recruiting an army and simultaneously inciting fear, and Laurie stuck in the hospital much the same as Halloween II (1981), pacing in her room after invasive abdominal surgery talking about what needs to be done. To that end, as someone who was blissfully unaware of the planned sequel, there was a certain expectation for some sort of resolution by the end of the film. Trilogies only work as individual films if there still exists some sort of payoff and bookend to the chapter for each installment, and unfortunately that does not happen here. Instead, the audience is left with an unsatisfying cliffhanger ending of sorts after enduring a repetitive series of events ultimately leading nowhere, with our characters learning much of nothing, save Laurie who effectively gets to do exactly that in the entirety of the film.FINAL VERDICT: While respecting, incorporating, and expounding upon the source material is appreciated, the writers should have included more substance into the middle chunk of this film instead of reducing its lead characters to monologuing hospital patients. By the end, the audience is left with nothing but a mild dissatisfaction and a bad taste in their mouths. A lazy way to turn this otherwise well-conceived remake into a trilogy.6.5 = 1.5,1,1,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1 - Rewatch Value: 3.",Halloween Kills
203,hkpolarbear,It really deserves 0 stars,1,26 October 2021,I rarely rate a movie so harsh if there is something that shows that the movie has a nice plot. This one fails in every category. Total Waste of money to make it. The only good deed is giving some employment opportunities.,Halloween Kills
204,omarcantbestopped,Kill them all I say,5,20 October 2021,Okay who wrote this crap? The monologues are ridiculously stupid. The actors are faking their lines or what?I seriously feel like Hollywood makes unbearable stories just to make us root for the bad guy.I swear of Michael Myers killed the granddaughter Allyson I would have it a masterpiece 10 😂.If they ever make a movie and call it Michael Myers and the entire thing him going street to street killing idiots I would watch it multiple times.,Halloween Kills

It's dreadful,2,18 October 2021,"Once again, some people who have no idea what ""suspense and sense of dread,"" two traits that made the original movie so great, are. How do these people get the rights to make these movies?There's no terror. It's just Michael killing people over and over. Now it's a big mob who yell catch phrases.""Evil ends tonight!"" They keep repeating this like a bunch of Trump culters at a MAGA convention. It's so cringey.There's no suspsense of any kind. If you're scared at any of this movie, it's your first monster movie. It was boring.Worst of all was Jamie Lee Curtis, who clearly is just doing this for the money, reciting lame lines like ""the boogeyman is coming"" in her hospital room over and over. It can't believe she read this and said ""yeah, this is great.""Also funny is when Michael has his mask taken off to reveal an old bald man underneath. Yeah, keep the mask on.Terrible terrible terrible movie.",Halloween Kills

207,flowerstardust1979,Why Does Michael's Mask Never Melt?,5,24 October 2021,"The amount of times he has been set on fire yet the latex mask never melts! Anywho.....Minor spoiler ahead!I was very much looking forward to this after the initial 10/10 ratings and from the trailer it was made to look like this was purely The original survivors VS Myers, it would of been a great movie if that was the case, sadly it wasn't.What had a strong first 25 minutes or so and what felt like a back to basics pure slasher flick with brutal and fun kills and with some of the original Halloween surviving characters it went into a ridiculous vigilante manhunt. The silly part being that a good 45 minutes of the movie was 100s of people lead by Anthony Michael Hall (bless him, was quite frankly terrible in this and didn't belong) hunting Michael down in a hospital despite being told by Karen that the man they were hunting wasn't Myers. Cue 45 minutes of boredom, missed opportunity and the most stupid plotline of an innocent psychiatric patient running for his life for, yep you guessed it, 45 minutes! Whilst Karen is running around trying to save the poor man.Whilst Jamie Lee Curtis spends the entire movie in a hospital bed and has little screen time this was not only an incredibly pointless instalment but also kind of a scam towards the audience.Cue to the final 15 minutes which was actually pretty decent, if only the fun and brutality of those 15 minutes stretched through out the whole movie.... Sets it's scene for Halloween Ends.Overall some fun slasher scenes followed by 55 plus minutes of utter pointlessness. There was no need for this instalment at all. Halloween 2018 to Halloween Ends 2022 would of been adequate. Halloween Kills is basically a unnecessary filler movie purely made for money with no important elements other than finding out how Michael got out of the fire which could of played for 10 minutes in the future Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills

Unfortunately, my excitement turned into annoyance shortly into the movie.This movie is full of cliche horror tropes. This is the type of movie that spoof horror movies make fun of. This franchise must try hard to be so inconsistent, because it can't be accidental.Too bad the franchise didn't truly end with the previous movie.Michael needs to die. Properly die! Cut off his head. Cut off his limbs. Burn the remains. Place the ashes in a box with a dozen locks on it, Bury the box in a 50 foot hole. Pour concrete into the hole. Place a 12 ton structure on top of the hole. Build a 30 foot electric, barbwire fence around the structure and let this franchise die along with it! That's the humane thing to do at this point.",Halloween Kills

212,influxtwo,So random and wacky it makes Michael Myers seem almost commonplace,5,15 October 2021,"I enjoyed about 65-70% of this. It was a fairly decent ride in certain parts. Lindsay Wallace played by the electrifying Kyle Richards steps back in here to offer one of the better scenes in the movie, and Andi Matichak got her own decent or notable scene as well. This film is clearly done to bridge the gap between the first film, and then the third film.I can only hope the third and next film is more iconic, devoted to the brand, and has more depth to be more realistic feeling. This time I admit I came for Kyle Richards, Andi Matichak, and of course Jamie Lee Curtis, and I was not too disappointed. The ending, although good, was executed kind of cheesy. This film was entertaining, but feels almost like a campy TV show now.Every single film in this series, I see as a stand alone movie taking place in the Halloween Universe, and I appreciate every consecutive sequel there is to offer for these films. There is something unique about each one in an almost David Lynch kind of way about this series now with all of it's convoluted twists and turns, and with all the different takes and timelines, you can't help but see what kind of weird stuff happens next.These films all build certain aspects of this created universe, and serve to tell a different side of a similar or related story of events. Even when things are no longer considered canon anymore, or of quality, I like to view it as a fever dream fantasy and a what-if; spin-off in the lore. This film is random and wacky enough that it makes Michael Myers seem almost commonplace. Each one paints a different picture of the same kind of similar story. And that is where these new ones take some liberties that might be a little strange or not fully developed. This one is more a piece about chaos and loses it's cat and mouse sensibility and sense of realism a bit.It doesn't feel like a complete story because it of course will be followed up with Halloween Ends, the third film. This film is just another strange little snack for the franchise like most of the other sequels. I enjoy these movies quite a bit, but I admit this new trilogy would or could have benefitted from improved writers. It's turned in to a soap opera and kind of a fan fiction that makes it seem like a TV show. The cliffhangers are like episodic bait.As I mentioned this series so far would have benefited from better writers. It was the weakest noticeable aspect of the film yet again, as I felt the 2018 film also suffered in the writing department. Tonal consistency however is luckily better with this one, which overall had some notable strengths in contrast over the previous one. It just feels like it goes a little astray in to campy land and loses some of the formula, or expected charm and realness that it needed to truly anchor some of it. It had some good moments and some irrelevant moments, up until a certain point the pacing really took a few drags. The film spends a lot of precious screen-time focusing on random residents and it becomes too much of a joke in parts.I was not a fan of the script or majority of filler scenes in the plot. Supporting characters such as the elderly bi-racial couple and the gay couple were not good scenes to showcase violence in. It was not at all good in many parts. Michael Myers does not have a lot of time on screen and it was quite noticeable. Otherwise Michael Myers looks and acts his best here, when the writing allows and offers him decent enough material that we don't find cringeworthy or insulting there's a few scattered moments to enjoy. But many of his victims are whimpering, shivering, & frozen in fear for a swift kill like cattle. This one had strange looking and extremely annoying child actors playing majority of the trick'or'treaters as well, it was really off-putting and didn't feel as realistic as previous films in the series. I thought it was an odd choice. The flashback scenes worked in moderation to a certain point too... but also grew a bit tedious and tiresome, and lost a bit of their credibility as plainly being plot development.And yet some how the plot needed some more cohesive elements, details, or characters to make it interesting and more fully developed and fleshed out for a second film to stand on it's own, and some of the screen-time and pacing proves that some of that precious time was wasted or misused. Bringing a few characters back wasn't quite enough for a one off. I didn't hate it I just found it underwhelming as a theatrical film and more like an odd tv series episode of high budget fan-fiction for the franchise. And Although the music and score was good, and better than the 2018 effort, the plot lost some of it's formula and charm along the way.It's fun, but the ability to pick it apart might have some fooled. I love this series, I do. Despite these newer installments somehow feel a little half-baked, Halloween never dies.",Halloween Kills

Kyle Richards looks great for her age and Jamie Lee Curtis looks great for 120. Anthony Michael Hall also doesn't look a day over 75. Judy Greer plays an irritating shrew appropriately named Karen.The movie takes a more realistic approach to horror which is alot better than 80s cheesiness and bad acting.

215,johnnyhbtvs27,Halloween: The Middle Chapter,4,27 October 2021,"Such a big disappointment. After the very good Halloween (2018) this one bogs it down with needlessly throwing in characters who weren't in the original and saying they were there standing off to the left by the bushes & changing so much backstory it will enrage true Halloween fans.They used a crew member who bore a resemblance to Donald Pleasence and threw it in this and i have a big problem with that, i really wish they would just let him be, if it's not soundalikes imitating his voice it's now lookalikes, it just takes you out of it.The worst thing the movie does is speeches, it's got more motivating speeches in it than Buffy The Vampire Slayer Season 7! It feels like once every 60 seconds someone has to cry out ""he's here"" ""it's Michael"" ""He's Evil"". It was fun when Donald Pleasence was doing it but EVERYONE in the movie? No thanks.Acting wise it did appear that something was amiss. For such ridiculous dialogue, everyone appeared to be playing it so straight it almost felt like a joke unto itself. Anthony Michael Hall in particular is screaming out nonsensical dialogue and ""Evil Dies Tonight"" with such woodenness that it makes be realise why his career dried up when it did.Having Nancy Stephens & Kyle Richards back is a nice touch but ultimately pointless, they're not there to do much besides gather fanfare. Jamie Lee takes this movie off to be the focal point in Halloween Ends i presume, she spends 95% of it in the one hospital room.Sadly enough bar some nice deaths, a really good score (always good to have the classic Halloween theme) & a really nice call back to the 1978 Michael Myers Mask which was great, there just isn't enough here to be satisfied with it.Also the less said about Big John & Little John, the better. I thought at one point I was watching an episode of Big Cook, Little Cook that used to air on Cbeebies.Here's hoping Halloween Ends can end the trilogy on a high because with this showing, I'm not convinced.",Halloween Kills
216,jon_anderson77,Screenwriting at its worst,4,29 October 2021,"What happened here? The 2018 movie ticked all the boxes and emulated the scares of original. This wasnt scary in the slightest and it was boring. Most of the scenes with Michael are decent but everything else was horrible. What was the point of Jamie Lee Curtis being in this?. Anthony Michael Hall was abysmal as Tommy, as were all the other shoe horned in characters from the original. Dialogue awful ""evil dies tonight"" was so cringey. Rabid mob chasing a 5ft 4"" overweight mental patient believing him to be Michael who is over 6ft tall and slender. Ridiculous. The set pieces and continuity was also a complete mess. People moved to different locations after being killed (park), deaths that were impossible (body in attic door), doors that were locked in one scene then unlocked in another (Myers house). Having watched all of the previous films this month It pains me to say this is the worst of them all. A prime example of why you dont rush a movie in order to release a sequel. At least thats what I think happened. It may just be that Mcbride and Gordon Green are bad at writing. Im giving this a 4 because of the soundtrack and the practical effects. I enjoyed the 70s flashback scenes and I thought Michael's mask looked great also. Lets hope they conclude this in a better way.",Halloween Kills

Micheal was literally everywhere it seemed at moments. Like he just done killing one couple and then bam he teleported and was somewhere else. The acting was the worse I've ever seen for the series as well. Like the last movie was not so campy in acting. I had high expectations considering the last movie was great.

221,FilmChamp20,What was that??,2,16 October 2021,"I seriously had to make sure I was watching a real Halloween movie and not some skit of a Saturday night live parody type deal where they mock the themes of horror movies for comedy. This was dreadful. Only kept watching for entertainment with the people I was watching with, it's so stupid it's hilarious. There's absolutely nothing about this movie that's believable or acted well. The actors/actresses, the extras, and even the main top billed actors/actresses were all laughably bad with their bad over the top theatrics and actions. This movie would have sold better if it was a purposeful comedy or something.It's like a bunch of amateur high school theater kids made this movie based off of tropes and elements of the Halloween movies. I'd be embarrassed if I was involved in this. Everyone in that town was incredibly stupid, inept, lacking in situational awareness, and absent of common sense. That's how Michael wins, he walked into a town with people who have a collective IQ of less than a child. ""He's a 6 year old boy, with the strength of a man, and a mind of an animal"" or something similar that was said in this movie. So a man who is mentally ill causally wiping out morons via natural selection on his way to his old house. That's the whole movie in a nutshell. I cannot stress enough how incredibly ridiculous this movie was. The worst Friday the 13th movie made more sense than this comedy skit. You actually root for Michael in this almost.As you can tell, I really disliked this movie. Don't bother if you're looking to watch a good movie, a good slasher, a nostalgic Halloween movie, or just something interesting. Watch with friends or family so you can laugh at it with them. The over dramatic acting alone is worth laughing at. Or the cringey over dramatic monologues.2 stars for the fact that Michael looked cool.",Halloween Kills

In all the slasher the characters are like this, it is a hallmark of this type of film. Halloween Kills is a masterpiece, brutal, ferocious and not the usual horror for kids, behind it there is a much deeper discourse, the madness that is consuming our society, the mass losing the light of reason and Michael who it is a metaphor for fear.These elements make Kills a great movie, not to mention the various extraordinary kills, Kills is one of the crudest and most heinous chapters and for all these reasons my rating is 10/10.",Halloween Kills

224,travisvincent,Halloween Kills is the Halloween 2 of Halloweens,6,15 October 2021,"Halloween Kills delivers when it comes to advancing the storyline for Halloween Ends. While keeping a similar pace there are moments in the film that I felt was only there to justify the run time. By bringing back favorites from the first Halloween (1978) like Nurse Marion and Lindsay, Tommy Doyle but played by Anthony M. Hall will certainly delight franchise fans but gives them little to chew on and one wonders whether they could have had meatier roles to justify bringing them back into the fold.HKills has effective death scenes and brings the gore and kills more in line with H2 (1981) than the original. While not as scary or tense as the previous Halloween (2018) it does deliver a few scenes that did the trick. It's not a bad sequel in the soon to be trilogy of Halloween 2018 but at times it feels like it's filler material to justify the middle chapter.

Almost every gunshot was well off target!Other than that, great flash black scenes, & incredible film score.Also, this movie now officially marks the only film out of the entire franchise where Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) doesn't share a single scene with Michael Myers.I'm hearing people say that ""Halloween Ends"" (2022) will be the final movie where Michael Myers finally dies, but what if Michael kills Laurie Strode? Did nobody think of that? He's spent over 40 years hunting her down and what if he finally does and it all ends with her death? This will be the end of Halloween...",Halloween Kills
229,actaction,Funny trumps scares,6,16 October 2021,"I'm convinced that because this was written by people most known for comedy, they are incapable of taking any scare moment totally seriously & that's too bad because the mood of the new films are so tense and promising. However, every single time when we are supposed to be scared the character says or does something that is not just stupid for a horror movie character but defies even a moron logic of the film's own rules. I'm used to characters running into a fray at stupid moments, but what I'm not used to are characters who at no time even have a chance of saving themselves. They make themselves useless and are convinced of their own superiority despite no reasoning, even by their own thought process. To me, this is a product of filmmakers who rightfully want to make horror about more than just the kills and the scares, but muck it up by showing us how little they care about the moment to moment reasoning as they barrel toward a deeper meaning or a next sequel. This film stops more often to reflect, which I liked, but they cannot resist the impulse to make humor where humor is not wanted or needed and it damages the scare aspect taking what should be scary and turning into a cringe-worthy let down. Even characters that are there to fill a body count can act smart and do occasionally smart things. They are not just tropes to get you to the next moment or fill in time.",Halloween Kills

I loved how they started with newly created scenes from 1978 and even brought back Donald Pleasence which was awesome! I liked the fact that we got to see a lot of MIchael in this movie. And it was classic Michael all the way. I loved how they made it a little deeper in explaining what Michael really is and how he is so much more than just the person. They had a ton of characters and side stories which was good and bad in some ways as some characters really didn't add much to the story and some weren't even necessary. And I admit some of the scenes were a little goofy and they should have been rethought and redone, but, I loved how they just cut Michael loose on this one so there were plenty of people getting killed - I thought the amount of people he killed was absolutely perfect and I'm not even someone that really like slasher movies, but I liked this one. And wow - what a great, great ending. 10 all the way!",Halloween Kills
233,Whitneywest10,No no no no...,2,16 October 2021,I'm a huge fan of this franchise but this wasn't it. I have waited for this movie so long and this is what was served. I'm shocked. There were too many flashbacks. Too much homage trying to be paid. There should have been the equivalent of a novella if they wanted to give this much backstory and side stories. They tried to do too much and in different directions no less. Take it back. I don't want it. What even was this?! I walked out of the theater channeling Jessica from Twilight (New Moon) saying was this some sort of parallel or metaphor because I was trying to make it make sense. It still doesn't.

It was a great ride with tons of suspense, tons of scares, lots of kills (though veeeery brutal, has to be the most brutal so far) and a darker tone and an interesting story with new elements to it. The whole town comes together to hunt and take down Michael, which is a great premise imo. Though they sadly made so many of the characters really stupid, while the main ones were pretty great.However... the critics are right in that it did feel like a filler movie for the purpose of simply making this a trilogy, and it's kind of a shame that we already know another sequel is greenlit, cause then we know exactly how this one is gonna end.Take the movie for what it is and just expect some characters to be dumb and to dumb things, because sadly these kinds of movies rely on it :PIt is absolutely a decent follow up to 2018, and I would recommend any horror fan to watch it.",Halloween Kills

241,bdpeterson-06310,So incredibly disappointed...,3,17 October 2021,"Despite Michael Meyers wearing our his welcome YEARS ago I reluctantly went and saw Halloween (2018) and it actually was decent to say the least! We finally got a satisfying conclusion to the decades long saga of Michael and Laurie. After years of training Laurie and her family finally defeated her foe and literally rode off into the distance. I stood up and cheered in the theater! Then just last week I heard that Halloween Kills was coming out in theaters. I instantly was enraged and felt sick to my stomach. I knew that this movie was going to me a shameless cash grab.... and I was right. Not only was this movie ridiculously unnecessary, it was trash. Unbelievable and stupid from start to finish. Just a horrible movie with virtually no redeeming factors, besides a great performance from Judy Greer. She is a phenomenal actress and I was further mad that they wasted her talent in this mess of a movie. When will the filmmakers get it through their thick heads that we are tired of these Halloween movies?? Not only are they so old and tired, but Michael is just too strong. We want him to die. He literally kills like half the town in this movie.... after being shot, stabbed and beaten with blunt objects by an angry mob. PLEASE! Don't waste your time and money watching this trash.",Halloween Kills
242,crowes-18865,A Huge Fall From 2018,3,18 October 2021,"What made the original Halloween great was something very much akin to what made Alien great.... a slow burning, get to know the characters, limited exposure to the monster until the end kind of pace. Though we have already been introduced to Michael and the need to build up to that is not necessarily present any longer the need for suspense still is and this film throws in so many kills that it loses that suspense very early on. This coupled with the fact that characters we know from so many years ago are now unlikeable and afflicted with some of the worse decision making skills you've ever seen and you also end up wanting Michael to win. This one is simply too busy and not only fails to take the baton and run from the very solid 2018 film but also revisits the one failure of that movie in the ridiculous doctor subplot. There are some brutal kills so fans of Michael might rejoice in that a little but the rest of this movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a sermon on the dangers of mob mentality, an exposition on mental health awareness, a slasher flick in which people make decisions which practically allow Michael to kill them with no effort whatsoever, a head scratcher which makes us wonder about a scenario where you flee from Michael and after looking back and confirming you have a good lead and he is still just walking you decide that instead of running you'll find a nice hiding spot behind a tree or is this simply a cash grab middle tier setup for the final entry? In closing I'll leave with something I am still completely confused by as to whether it was supposed to be funny or not.....Big John?Little John?Hey Big John
Yes Little John
Where are you Big John?Over here Little John
You ok Little John?Yes Big John

243,TruView,Please don't let him put his MASK on!!!,7,30 October 2021,"This was indeed such a fun movie to watch. It was definitely true to form very much in the style of the slasher films of the venerable 80s. Hell, they even managed to apply that same leafy citrus tint, giving it a rustic quality. Avid fans will doubtless consider this a worthy addition to the series - I did.Jamie Lee Curtis' role in this installment is minimal but no less important to the legacy and over all success of the film as that of Michael Myers. BUT!!! Myers made this movie work. He delivers on all accounts. Of course, you can (and should) expect the bonehead mistakes of some of his victims; which were almost slapstick funny to just downright unfortunate. There was a choke point in movie where Myers is strategically engaged without his mask and things get interesting. But what is Myers without the mask? Maybe Myers IS the mask. Alas, this is the enduring lesson yet to be learned. There are other lessons too, some so timely that they border on cautionary. Perhaps you'll agree, perhaps not. One thing's for sure, this was a fun movie. I've seen twice already.",Halloween Kills
244,bbevis-47954,"Michael is Game, Everything Else is Not.",4,18 October 2021,"Any scenes involving Michael doing what he does best were entertaining if not particularly scary. I love the way he hides until he feels necessary to pounce on his prey. The sequence involving Michael and the firefighters was ludicrous and awesome at the same time. Seeing Michael standing in front of the burning house was an awesome shot as he put fear into the Firefighters.Some of the kills while not unique in any way were suitably gory at times. A few moments I said ""wow that is pretty graphic"" and I appreciated the use of prosthetic effects for some of the kills. This was definitely a brutal sequel.Unfortunately anything not involving Michael does not work in any way shape or form. I don't watch Halloween movies expecting any kind of deep message, impactful story or A-list acting but man what was on display was hard to watch. The acting was mediocre, the writing was absolutely awful and the message of mob mentality being bad failed. The writing really is terrible in this movie. None of the people act like or say anything realistic and it comes off as awkward. Not to mention the film looks cheap, intentional or not the cinematography is poor throughout the film (A few shots of Michael are good). There are no surprises in this movie, even the last five or so minutes were predictable. The decisions characters made who decided to confront Michael were laughable. This is the kind of movie where you may see yourself yelling at the characters on screen because every decision made has no logic.As I said before I don't expect Oscar worthy storytelling when watching a Halloween movie. What I do expect is tension, scares and gore. Halloween kills served the gore, provided minimal tension and did not scare me once. When Michael was on screen I loved Halloween Kills but everything else was a miscalculated decision.",Halloween Kills

Dare I end of horror movies.How much information is to much. Have everything at our finger tips. The internet has websites made for gore and death. We as humans are no longer scared of movies.

246,guskeller,An embarrassing cash grab,4,15 October 2021,"When a franchise churns out endless sequels, the writing decays quickly. The most fundamental flaw of Halloween Kills is its lack of purpose. This movie simply has nothing to say and quickly devolves into a hot mess. It doesn't have a beginning/middle/end structure because it's all middle. Michael Myers kills people and everyone else talks about it, but that isn't a complete story. Furthermore, there are far too many underdeveloped characters. Waves of people are frantically running around while viewers get to know very little about any of them. Resulting in absolutely no emotional connection.It is telling how the original is so concise yet Halloween Kills is so convoluted. A jumble of half-baked storylines loosely crashing into one another, which is immediately exhausting. All in the service of nothing because the movie ends up right where it started. This undermines the technical aspects of the production, which are generally passable (especially the music and effects). However, it is not just the writing that stinks here because the acting is equally lackadaisical. Probably because the cast is a collection of underqualified youth and tired has-beens. Overall, this movie is painfully tone-deaf and an embarrassing cash grab.Writing: 1/10

249,Entertainmentsparadise,Surprisingly Funny,4,16 October 2021,"Michael Meyers never dies, no spoilers but here a secret , he doesn't die again. I do question the direction of the Franchise now with such similarities to previous installments.🔪
After 40 years of terrorizing Haddonfield, the hunter becomes the 'huntee' the town attempts to band together to hunt down the masked murder. Of course, they fail miserably in a comical way, too, with scenes of dialogue that left me laughing a little.For example the conversation with the couple at home, the woman goes, ""What does he want? "" and the man responds, ""Who gives a s**t? Call the cops.""
The amount of characters and side issues occurring makes the plot unorganized. The film sprinkles some gruesome fatalities by Mr. Meyers but not enough focus on the slashing aspect for a movie predicated on that for success. The climax leads to an underwhelming feeling; the ending leaves it open for another film. Leave DJ Khaled at home because I don't know if I want another one.Verdict:
Halloween fans, of course, are going to vouch for this film; the comical aspect has some untapped potential, but then that may take away from the originality of the franchises, yet the killing wasn't consistent enough to push the needle to meet the standards of a Halloween film for me.Does this take me to paradise?

It is like, in a different genre, trying to top Singing In The Rain with a remake. So when you accept that, lowered expectations become different expectations.1978 has the cast with an enormous energy, beautiful cinematography, the soundtrack, and Michael creeping around in a subtle way, just like the thing did in The Thing in 1982. This kind of horror is not repeated though. Otherwise it would be a simple copy. One should expect a new story line, with some respectful hints to the past as this movie has done. And that is what this movie has done: it was not as creepy as the first but it could never be again. It was a true slasher, and true, Halloween 1978 was really more than that. Still, this is probably as good as a remake of this genre can get. I look forward to the third one.",Halloween Kills

We don't stick around to GET killed but these black folk are a different breed. ALL the folk in this movie, black and white, are just itching to die! No common sense at all! They are shooting out the windows of a car being attacked by Michae but are locking the doors, staying IN the car while he attacks someone inside, running AWAY from a car that has the keys in it, are shooting themselves in the face, staying INSIDE a house that has in it upstairs but instead of going out the door and calling the cops the stay inside and lock the doors and are standing in front of an open door screaming instead of getting the hell on! WTH? I like that some characters from the original 78 film have returned but this film is such a disappointment.All previous had Jamie Lee's character in the light of a bad ass who was finally gonna get Michael but she is nothing but a frail, gray haired old lady running around and rambling and is confined to a hospital bed most of the film!

259,bradykitchen-33648,They made a fun movie that's about it,6,17 October 2021,I loved Halloween and Halloween 2018 but this didn't have that feeling in this one. I think they did a good job with the kills. Those scenes are fun and provides the horror type gore you want. I also like that they tied 1978 and 2018 characters together but they had way too much going on. The run of the movie went like this: flashback-killing-Laurie in hospital- town hunting Michael- and repeat. It just kept jumping around and made for a poorly constructed film. The ending didn't feel like an ending it felt like a climax. Which makes sense in a way since it is the second film of a trilogy but it didn't feel earned. There were some really poor moments of dialogue as well as humour. They lost the cinematography in this one. Not that the cinematography was bad but it didn't have those scenes where you follow Michael around until the camera stops and he drifts off just to come back in that same frame to kill. We lost that there was none of that. Overall I had a fun time because it does deliver the kills and the gore but sacrifices the writing.6.5/10.,Halloween Kills

The Bodycount is High and there is some nice Gore Scenes, however Halloween Kills has his flaws with mediocre Acting, Jamie Lee Curtis Screentime is too short and Dialogues but in the big Picture it is more Serious and darker than the 2018 Film, what I like.

262,S_dot_M_dot,Relentless,7,16 October 2021,"Moments after the Strodes (Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, and Andi Matichak) escape Michael Meyers (James Jude Courtney), leaving him trapped in the basement with the house ablaze, first responders arrive to battle the flames. In doing so, the singed face of Myers re-emerges to continue his murder spree. After the town locals hear the news, a group of survivors create a mob to finally bring the monster down.This film channeled all of its energy into the dominating presence of Myers. The writers transformed him into a machine who is relentless in his pursuit. The violence depicted is not for the faint of heart, as the effects team spared no expense when it comes to realism. The performance and focus on Myers is the driving point of this film and helps solidify him as the top slasher out there.Director/writer David Gordon Green had a vision for this franchise and brings a style that is cohesive with the original. The flashback scenes bridge the gap between the style elements and the way shots linger to let you search through the darkness is a nice homage as well. The score in this film once again brings this film to life. The score itself could drive this film.The acting throughout is consistent, with some performances standing above the rest. The mob element can be bothersome at times. The thought of an angry mob hunting down our antagonist has been done countless times and more times than not comes off as cheap filler. As well as the Myers character is written, it feels as if other areas are left out.This is the second film in the current trilogy and overall does a fantastic job at pushing the central plot closer to the finish line. The complaints are few and far between, but fans of the franchise may be divided over the portrayal of Myers. This may seem like a deterrent, but true horror fans will always get behind characters they have grown to love.",Halloween Kills
263,Shadowboy_25cm,"Competent, gruesome and solid fan service slasher",6,21 October 2021,"""Halloween Kills"" is the second movie in the trilogy by Director David Gordon Green, so the suspense this horror-thriller should transport to the audience is a little bit low, because we know, there will be a final third part (""Halloween Ends"", 2022).As often with the middle parts of trilogys, the second part is more like an interlude, an inbetween-episode that narrows some directions, but keeps the audience more or less unsatisfied.This second part is very solidly crafted, nice camera work and editing, very beautiful score and has a lot of connections (flashbacks and also in the present time with some characters) to the original Halloween from 1978.There are some very stupid scenes in this movie (I won't spoil, just be warned as it is in a lot of horror movies that people make very stupid decissions beyond reason. Leave the logic and try to be entertained. Nothing new about this trope concerning horror movies), ok, that comes to the minus rating, but overall, this second part has a lot of fan service stuff to offer, because the story is very tightly woven around Carpenter's Halloween (mostly part 1, but also some references to part 2), and creates an atmosphere of the late 70s in the present time.David Gordon Green has crafted a competent, gruesome and solid slasher movie based only on the original Halloween movie, with some references to the second (Halloween II, 1981) and third part (Season of the Witch, 1982), which might be interresting for the fans of the franchise.In my opinion, this second part is better than the first part by director David Gordon Green and his team, but is flawed by inflationary dumb decissions by some characters in the movie resulting in a high body count.Ignore some logic, take it as the foreplay for the final third part ""Halloween Ends"" and you'll enjoy it.",Halloween Kills

265,JoelAlexanderr,A disappointing sequel that never captures the true spirit of the Halloween franchise,4,27 October 2021,"What a fall it has turned out to be for horror junkies. We have the disturbing and odd Titane, the bonkers Malignant, and next week we have two more anticipated violent horror films: Antlers and Last Night in Soho. However, true horror fans will have been looking forward to HALLOWEEN KILLS, the newest sequel of the overlong slasher franchise that starts directly after the events of 2018's Halloween reboot. David Gordon Green's previous Halloween film was astonishingly good, and is debatably the best film in the franchise since John Carpenter's 1978 original. Green returns to write and direct this second film in a planned Halloween trilogy, which me and many others were highly anticipating because of the amazing job he did paying homage to Carpenter's classic in the 2018 movie. Unfortunately, in between 2018 and now it seems that Green has lost the ingredients to what makes a Halloween slasher movie fun and interesting.HALLOWEEN KILLS continues almost exactly where 2018's Halloween left off, with Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer), and her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) escaping from the burning house with Michael Myers in it. They all assume they have finally bested the notorious serial killer, but anyone who has seen more than one Halloween movie knows that Michael Myers doesn't go down that easy. Myers emerges from the fire with a reborn passion for murder, and in this movie he kills more than he ever has in a single Halloween movie. Along with this, the movie gives us a major subplot involving the mob mentality of the town of Haddonfield, Illinois in which they all come together to track down and kill Michael.For the first 20-30 minutes of HALLOWEEN KILLS, the movie feels as though it has little to no plot other than just continuing the ending of the previous movie. The beginning includes many drawn-out flashbacks to the night of the original killings in 1978, all of which feel tacked on to create mediocre plot points and to include some fan service for the die-hard Halloween fans. Once a semblance of a plot begins to form, the ingredients are all so weak and forced that the movie never comes across like something that understands how to perfect the specifics of a good slasher flick or a movie in general. Green and the other screenwriters seem to have been fixated on the idea of the town of Haddonfield coming together, trying to hunt down Michael Myers, and then being consumed by their own fear in a way that further harms innocent people. This is a clear comment on how mob mentality and groupthink can cause more harm than good in a serious situation such as this, and while this isn't a bad idea in concept, the execution feels quite ridiculous for most of the runtime and doesn't deliver anything by the end.Possibly my biggest issue with HALLOWEEN KILLS is that it completely misses the tone and spirit that makes a slasher movie worth watching. Almost every violent death in this film (of which there are many) doesn't match the tone of the tense buildup that leads to it. For example, there are two kills near the beginning that are built up in a lighthearted and campy way, but the deaths themselves are so disturbing that it left a bad taste in my mouth for the next 30 minutes of screentime. Meanwhile, there are another series of kills later in the movie that have a genuinely creepy build-up, but then the actual deaths are so ridiculous and dumb that the entire scene was laughable. Green could never seem to get the tone right, which is especially surprising given how great of a job he did with Halloween 2018.Without spoiling anything, the ending of HALLOWEEN KILLS cemented the mediocre quality that the majority of this movie seems to exemplify. The writers create the setup for a truly great and gory ending with Myers shredding through basically half the town, but any slasher movie satisfaction is ruined by the most confounding and distracting camera-work possible given the situation. The kills aren't even visible because of how badly they are shot, and a major character death is glossed over due to the fact that the camera only shows Michael Myers' blank expression. The movie is gratuitously gory for 90 percent of the runtime, but then during the one scene where seeing the gore would have helped the impact of the movie land, nothing is shown. HALLOWEEN KILLS contains a decent amount of good ideas, but simple mistakes like these prevent the movie from being anything more than one of a great many mediocre Halloween sequels.Green proved he is more of a talented director/writer than meets the eye with 2018's Halloween, so it's a shame that very little of that talent is visible here. HALLOWEEN KILLS feels like it was helmed by completely different people than the last one, which had some great homages to the original John Carpenter film and knew how to create some fantastic bloody kills ripe for enjoyment. There are definitely some fun scenes within this sequel -- the opening scene involving firefighters sets the tone well -- but those scenes feel like exceptions to the rule this time around. The third film, titled Halloween Ends, is slated to release in 2022, and because of HALLOWEEN KILLS, audiences will be approaching that film with skepticism instead of anticipation.C-",Halloween Kills
266,tloader-1,Entertaining but dumb,6,29 October 2021,"This had some nice nods to the original movie - some characters (and their original actors), scenes set in 1978 and the main halloween theme was surprisingly subtle.Unfortunately most things about this movie are just dumb - from the characters actions to the silly plot points and over-the-top score, it makes you think ""wtf???"" at regular intervals. Examples being the cop shooting his partner when Michael was attacking, and the whole side plot with the mental patient.If you're going to add scenes that are technically part of the original movie, at least have Michaels actions and mannerisms the same, not super fast and brutal which is a long way from his original characterisation.It's clear they want to ""update"" the original movies for the current horror crowd but adding lots of brutal kills, but it cheapens the true nature of Michael Myers and what sets him apart from your standard slasher villain.There was some good scenes of suspense, that were unfortunately marred by quick attack scenes where all tension was lost really quickly.By no means a terrible movie, just not a great Halloween movie, although still better than Rob Zombies abominations!",Halloween Kills
267,jjdausey,All over the Haddonfield map,5,16 October 2021,"I grew up watching the original series and loving it despite all the continuity issues, etc. So i had a big chip on my shoulder about 2018's relaunch, especially when I didn't think it surpassed any of the existing (and now canceled) sequels in any notable way. (Personally, I think H20 is a better ""reunion"" than H40). But for some reason, I was more open minded about this one. Thinking that, with Laurie's storyline out of the way, we'd get to know and savor other characters, new or returning. Nope. No one was developed. The first act rushed into action way too quickly, shortchanging Lindsey and Tommy and Nurse Marion (who actually got a much better sendoff in H20). Who are they now? Are they married? Do they have jobs or children? We learn nothing about them before they're dispatched or discarded by the storytelling. Then there's the issue of tone - weird quirks in dialogue and behavior (guy in drag in opening, karen in christmas sweater, couple playing with drone inside) that undermine the suspense. Could the gay couple have been any more ridiculous? And wimpy? What is this, a 1994 Michael Bay movie where femme queens get tossed off roofs? And the other characters- god, all their dialogue sounded like trailer lines. Horrible writing. I'm disappointed in this sequel. And could really care less about this series going forward.",Halloween Kills

She stayed in the hospital on pain pills and Jamie lee Curtis just looked deceived. I hope next years are installment is a bigger deal than halloween kills. I'm shocked that everybody was killed in this film. I will never see a slasher film like this ever again. Micheal Myers is too immortal and the townspeople keeps saying evil dies tonight.

The townspeople believe that this 5""4 deteriorating man is Michael Myers? And that he would run away from them screaming as they gave chase?Even when a slasher flick has poor plot and dumb characters you can at least expect awesome kills that make up for it right? Well in this movie that is missing as well. Most kills in this movie you get Michael stabbing something off the screen as there's a million cuts, fake blood splashes in the air and it zooms in on the victims face. It feels cheap and very poorly made.",Halloween Kills

277,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021),5,30 October 2021,"In 1978, a 6 year old by the name of Michael Myers killed his teenage sister Judith in cold blood. This introduced the world to one of the most brutal killers that ever lived. He would stay institutionalized until his 23rd birthday where he attacked several young teens, after his escape 17 years later exactly on Halloween night. The only survival was that of a young Laurie Stode (played by genre icon, Jamie Lee Curtis). He was eventually found and taken back into custody that same horrible night.This takes us to 40 years later, when a now 63 year old Michael Myers who is now under the care of Dr. Loomis' former student Dr. Sartain who has his own agenda. The same day when two young reporters come by for their thesis on the infamous killer, he escapes once again and goes on a brutal killing spree where no one is safe leading up to his possible demise at the hands of The Strode Family.Laurie and her family escape with battle wounds which take Laurie to Haddonfield Hospital, with the idea of Myers' death she rests comfortably. Unbeknowst that he escapes due to the local firefighters who all meet death that night of the form of the ""Boogeyman"" who continues he trek of terror as the community rests and enjoys their holiday gatherings. Hours seem to pass as Tommy (Anthony M. Hall), Lindsey (reprising her role from 1978 - Kyle Richards), Marion (another Halloween alumni played by Nancy Stephens), and Lonnie (played by Robert Longstreet) a few who also were witnessed to that horrible night enjoy drinks and company at a local bar. That gathering of spirits and fun is soon to be interrupted when the news of his escape and the fire drenched Strode house hit the media. Thus slowly turning the town into a lynch mob, who decide that they will take Michael Myers out themselves.The night continues as Michael evades the mob and the local police, the death toll continues which include children, the elderly, and several others. The kills are some of the better ones in the series.The finale of the film seems to have a underlying message about mob mentality, which leads the townspeople to have mano e mano with Michael which doesn't end well. The cliffhanger of the ending leaves us wondering what exactly will end when...Halloween Ends??The cinematography and the directing was quite superior to its 2018 counterpart, thus making this one of the better films in the discombobulated series. The addition to having the band GHOST in the soundtrack was a sick addition and a very cool surprise whilst watching the credits.I now will address the unneeded and ridiculousness that leave many of us fans squirming in our seats. First off some of the dialogue is really badly written and badly timed as well, it'll make you laugh out loud its so bad. If these scenes were taken out it would drastically improve the tone of the film making it the darkest one in the series.On to the kills, the gore and visual effects are beautifully done. Some of them are quite brutal and great to watch but...some are ridiculously overdone and will give some viewers a eye roll. I say this cause what 63 year old institutionalized man is going to have the power of a muscle bound 23-30 year old, who gets up after being repeatedly stabbed and shot so much it would kill a elephant!! Let's not forget the lady who decides to fight off the ""Boogeyman"" with a Black and Decker steam iron (insert cringe here)
Another quirk is how after a serious bout with Myers and undergoing major surgery Curtis' character is ready to get back into the fight.There are several other moments but I'll leave those for you to decide.Its all a bit over the top...but still fun to watch just the same.After soaking in all that is HALLOWEEN KILLS, I'll end on this note:
""Love is today and evil doesn't die tonight. Night, Night...""",Halloween Kills
278,bishysbus,It's ok,5,17 October 2021,"Just an excuse for another Halloween film really. The usual slasher movie where you know the story. Michael Myers comes back, kills everyone who gets in his way whilst trying to find Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). You know he will 'Die' at the end of the film only to be back for a sequel in October 2022 in time for Halloween.Okay, joking aside, take a look at the special effects, mostly blood and gore and ways to kill people, and it's original and pretty good. But there isn't much of a story.If you just want a scary movie for Halloween then this is it. That's about it.",Halloween Kills
279,zombieoutbreak-74199,Evil Dies Tonight? Evil Never Dies!,6,15 October 2021,Halloween Kills lives up to the hype. The soundtrack pays homage to the original. The story was interesting but some of the dialogue felt forced. This may be the angriest version of Michael Myers we have seen. The kills were brutal and different. It was definitely better than Halloween 2018. If you want to see a savage Michael Myers go watch Halloween Kills!,Halloween Kills

281,NotAFilmCritic101001,"A jumbled, confused & incoherent mess.",3,31 October 2021,"From the word go you can tell somethings off with this film... Like:-The random time jumps at the beginning that don't seem to fit and could be placed elsewhere or completely omitted.The moment Michael goes from ""The Shadow"" a man who moves unseen and kills in an instant... To full-on John Wick-ing his way through literal groups of people.The random hints at Michael potentially being some form of non-human entity... No, I do not mean it's said in a figurative manner, I mean literally! Like the occult or mystical sense. Similarly to what they did with ""The curse of Michael Myers"" to drum it home they even say a line like ""he grows stronger with each kill."" I found this so strange, in the 2018 reboot this idea was non-existent and he was just an evil guy, a big durable guy, but still, not some paranormal activity entity capable of the unimaginable.It's all just off, it seemed like there were multiple directions they wanted to take the film but just couldn't settle on one. So, we as viewers, received a film that doesn't have a coherent story, yet somehow also has one of the most convoluted stories ever seen. It's astounding that they managed to do these things simultaneously.This is not something you should watch, but if you do, at least have the decency to not pay for it.",Halloween Kills

He isn't some cured, super powered human.More gore fest than real scare fight factor.This franchise should stop and hopefully will after 2022.",Halloween Kills
284,tonik_2000,What is the point of these movies anymore?,5,18 October 2021,"And why do we still like them? Step away from the original backstory for a moment, of which this movie spends little time exploring anyways. What are we left with? People in various stages of being stalked. That's it! Yeah, it causes a scare (more than the inevitable murder that follows,) but not a scare we haven't already experienced here. Honestly these movies have become the most predictable and boring on the planet. And what is the final message? After all these years of films, what is the final answer? That Michael Myers is invincible. Weak! There is just very little to work with, with Michael Myers and his schtick. Certainly not enough for however many films there are for it to not become repetitive. I give it a 5 because of the decent cast, and my own nostalgia for the moments when these movies were good.",Halloween Kills
285,Fortressofdoors,The Hobbitween,5,16 October 2021,"Where to start? I'm a huge fan of the original 1978 film. There are those that will defend any Halloween film, just on the sole reason of it being a Halloween film. I am not one of those fanboys. In my opinion, they had a shot at continuing the story with Halloween 2018 and that's where it should have ended, even though that one had it's own set of flaws. Of course, the inevitable happened, greed kicked in and they saw to also milk this version dry.I didn't want to go into pinpointing the bad points of the movie, but it was so bad that I can't help myself. The ugly trick-or-treater kids at the beginning are weird and off putting. Old characters are brought back or new pointless characters were introduced, for no good reason other than fan service and filler. What was the point of repeating the scene from the first film where Michael jumps on top of the car, smashes the window with his hand and grabs the nurse's hair, just so she could deliver some corny one liner, ""this is for Loomis"". The celebration at the bar was so unnecessary and contrived that it was cringeworthy. They have Michael do all of these weird staging with the bodies that is just dumb and purposeless. Why would he bother or care. He's not in it for the shock factor. The whole town rallying together for the never ending ""evil dies tonight"" chant was just laughable. Most of these people were not around when the original killings happened, so it's pretty safe to say that they would not be involved or care. The entire hospital sequence is a shambled mess with jump cuts of things happening here and there and people falling over things. They somehow mistake one of the inmates that escaped with Michael as him, somehow, who knows other than the shirt he's wearing because he doesn't fit the description, at all and then they have him jump to his death for what has to be one of the most awkward scenes of the movie. Maybe, there were too many to choose from. Kyle Richards was brought back as Lindsay in this one to.... run, scream and cry by a stream. Anthony Michael Hall was brought into this to pose as Tommy Doyle and has far too much screen time as an unbelievable vigilante who plans to take Michael out himself...with a baseball bat.The town members finally get their chance to confront Michael who they again, shoot, beat and stab. Remember though, this is after he left Laurie's house where he just lost two fingers, was shot and stabbed multiple times and nearly burned in a house fire. In a scene that I could not believe I was witnessing, he jumps up to channel the spirit of Bruce Lee and slaughters the entire group. Laurie stumbles around the hospital a lot and delivers yet another speech. I can't remember how many mini speeches there were in this. I lost count at four. This film was ridiculous and I'm glad that I didn't go the theatre to watch it like I had planned. At this point I do not give a damn what happens in Halloween Ends because I can only believe that it's just going to get worse. Remember kids, the more he kills, the more he transcends. Oh man.",Halloween Kills
286,stephanie_wal-04572,Former victims show up,8,17 October 2021,What a pleasant surprise to see former victims who survived Michaels wrath. I was expecting the ending to be a little different. Movie was entertaining and didn't disappoint.,Halloween Kills
287,chancellorpink,"Oddly Out of Step, But Still Goid",7,19 October 2021,"I keep rewatching this movie & then upping the score.At first, it comes off as an odd mashup of the a-bit-too-reverent and overwrought past crashing into the overly-violent present. I think the filmmakers got so caught up with paying homage to the original 1978 movie (with so many cameos from past cast members, full of corny back story), that when they shift back to present day, the violence, with so many nasty head-bashings and neck slashings, seems a bit shocking & out of place. But maybe that was the idea, to starkly contrast movie horror - then and now.Regardless, although it first ends up feeling kind of disjointed and messy, it's well made, certainly never dull, & definitely worked for me on Halloween night 2021.",Halloween Kills
288,Necroambulant,Evil Dies Tonight!,8,16 October 2021,"Halloween Kills picks up on the action only minutes after Halloween (2018) rolled credits. As Dylan Arnold's Cameron walks home, upset with himself and wallowing a bit, he comes across Will Patton's Officer Hawkins where he lies bleeding on the pavement as he'd been left to die in the final third of the previous installment. Though Hawkins appears to be dead at first, he is soon revealed to be clinging to life.We are treated to a surprisingly well-produced return to Halloween (1978) in a flashback that shares the concluding events of that night from the perspective of a younger Hawkins and his partner. In this, we discover that Hawkins has cause to feel no small amount of guilt over the events of that night 40 years before.We witness further events of that night, encountering children having an altercation before being sent home by police roaming the streets in search of Michael Myers. One of those children will be a familiar character to discerning viewers of the older Halloween.We meet up with Tommy Doyle (now played by Anthony Michael Hall), Nancy Stephens's Marion (returning to the character for a fourth time in the series, though only the second in this internal timeline), and Kyle Richards's Lindsey (reprising her role from the 1978 classic) at a bar where open mic night is in full swing. While I would have enjoyed seeing a nod to The Curse of Michael Myers, with Paul Rudd returning to portray Tommy Doyle, I was nonetheless pleased to see so many performers returning to roles they played in 1978 and 1981 respectively. This includes Charles Cyphers returning to take on the mantle of Leigh Brackett yet again.As emergency services race toward Laurie Strode's burning home, Jamie Lee Curtis's Strode shouts a desperate plea that they let it burn. If they had heard her and heeded her request, the movie would have turned out quite differently. A single firefighter falling through the floor into Strode's trap basement provides the means for the still breathing Myers to remove himself from his imprisonment below the house.Carnage ensues in a scene that pits Michael against a group of firefighters, in which the killers prowess is displayed to be anything but diminished. This is something we experience more than once in this movie that has rarely, if ever, been incorporated in a slasher flick. In Halloween Kills, we are treated to one-against-many conflicts that are typically antithetical to the slow, methodical stalker and prey relationships we often expect from such stories. The Michael Myers of this movie is more a force of nature than we've come to expect, capable of bursts of intense violence directed, rather than toward singular targets, at groups of people. An economy of brutality is on display with murderous efficiency, as Myers dispatches multiple opponents with expedience and ruthlessness.I went into Halloween Kills with the expectation that it would suffer from middle movie syndrome, being the second of a planned trilogy of sequels following the events of Halloween 40 years before. What I experienced was more like The Empire Strikes Back than The Two Towers, a self-contained narrative that--while it is designed to carry the plot between beginning and end of the trilogy--manages to satisfy my needs as a standalone experience.The performances are spectacular, the kills are savage and visceral, the soundtrack/score was superb, and the story unfolding for the characters as Michael makes his way through Haddonfield toward his natural destination is a vivid enough assortment of threads as to make for a worthwhile tapestry. The sheer brutality of Michael's murders is almost enough to distract the viewer from the underlying theme of fear spreading through a community primed for terror and harboring a certain tension just beneath the surface for nearly half a century. This explodes in a predictable fashion as the residents of Haddonfield create the conditions wherein Michael is able to thrive and flourish, feeding--as he seems to--on the very anger and horror being amplified by the mob mentality spreading like wildfire throughout the movie.A bit of dialogue near the end of the movie manages to sum things up nicely. When Hawkins expresses his regret at having made this possible by not letting Michael die back in 1978, Laurie Strode corrects him and explains that this is her fault, that her fear of Michael's return has been allowed to spread and fester like an infection in the otherwise quaint community.I know that I am certainly looking forward to the release of Halloween Ends next October, and I truly hope a whole lot of you are as well.",Halloween Kills

It's got great effects, great kills, and will definitely please those that love to see unique deaths in slasher films.The story however, absolutely needed a revamp and reevaluation before it released- it's pretty choppy and it's pretty rough around the edges, the pacing is insanely fast.

Plus, I saw many reviews where ""fake critics"" were making complaints of how the town was acting and how Laurie Strode was not likeable. If these are what leads to bad reviews, then wow. Firstly, the town acts like you would expect in real life if MM was real. Everybody would be terrorized or would hit up every gun store to try and kill him. Everybody behaved like you would in real life. As for Laurie, the same goes. She acted just like a trauma victim who spent decades obsessed (keyword) with only killing MM. The only thing that I thought was off in the movie without spoiling it, is it shuffles back to the to give you a better backstory. All of which (including this movie) was done to help close out the story in the next and final film Halloween Dies. Go and watch it, and compare it to any of the other slasher films.

Also seeing many of the characters from the first Halloween, many of them played by the same actors after 43 years, was simply fun. This movie could be a treat for some fans of the original Halloween.",Halloween Kills
298,veritybingo,"Super corny, super scary.",6,21 October 2021,"This film, despite it's corny dialogue (mainly from Jamie Lee's character spouting cliched dramatic statements recalling the many awful 80's & 90's sequels & Anthony Michael Hall repeating ""Evil Dies Tonight"" over and over, like a blatant promo-slogan drop being flogged to death) is actually very well shot, paced, provides many scares and tense, unsettling moments.It also does not let you down in the gruesome department, and no character is safe here which is quite refreshing, as with many of these films you can usually guess who will survive to the end.Other characters are a bit more fleshed out, especially Big & Little John, who are definitely the Most Valuable Players is this outing.",Halloween Kills

It does not work anymore..hopefully the end (Halloween Ends) will be much better, if it really ends.",Halloween Kills
301,phobicsq,Come for the kills but will probably be bored with the rest,5,17 October 2021,"I wasn't the biggest enthusiast with Halloween 2018 especially since it was going to ignore everything that came after the first film. Nothing bothers me more in films than this nonsense but here we are. Overall, the 2018 film was okay even though the writing was a bit odd at times but there was some good stuff in it.With Halloween Kills (dumb name by the way) it picks off right after 2018 left off with Laurie going to the ER (yes, in the sequel she's going to the hospital just like in the original H2) while Myers survives the burning house and does a good fight with some firefighters (was very sad to see them go down, their firefighters!). Between these two story points, some other nonsense is created.The most annoying part about this film for me is that they shoved a backstory in the beginning of the film to ""flesh"" out Will Patton's character along with ""Loni's"" character who is the dad of the dumb boyfriend from 2018. Patton's character is the cop wo saved Myers from being killed by ""loomis and other cops) but you don't actually see it until later in the film, but the first several minutes of the film shows Patton and his partner chasing down Myers and a younger Loni being picked on by the ugliest kids I've ever seen.The backstory elements are stupid especially since they contradict stuff that happens in the FIRST Halloween especially since Haddonfield all of a sudden has a huge police force! One last bad thing about the film is it spends a god awful amount of time having Tommy (yes a new actor is playing Tommy, the boy who Laurie babysat in the 1978 film) go around getting people to form hunting parties for Myers and then gets the hospital all riled up to chase the other ""escapee"" throughout the hospital. This was the most annoying element of the film especially how it takes away from what is going on with Myers.There are some good things though, like the kills which have been elevated a bit. There are some original actors in the film which I hope you can spot, and Myers looks awesome.Sadly Curtis does nothing in the film and so if you were wanting to see her kick butt again you're out of luck.Overall, it's okay but like the original Halloween 2, it isn't as good as the one before it even though it ups the kills.",Halloween Kills
302,kuner-59029,Halloween - Dark Fate,3,14 October 2021,"These new Halloween films in many ways resemble the Terminator Dark Fate reboot. They bring back some original actors, they continue the story from the last good entry in the series (not quite here, because Halloween 3 was actually really fun), they even got John Carpenter out of retirement to write the score. But they entirely fail to capture what made the originals work. Rewatching the original Halloween, while tame by today's standards, it remains a very creatively filmed and atmospheric film. They used a lot of clever techniques to make that film scary. Michael Myers did not take center stage. He lurked in the shadows, and the way the shots were set up reflected this. As the audience, you were scanning the image on screen, looking for him.In these new movies, it's all about bombast. Photographing him against the fire, turning him into the Terminator, but without the intriguing sci fi plot.Which brings me to failing #2:
The writers are caught in a trap between not wanting him to just stalk random babysitters like in the past, and not being allowed to flesh out Michael's character, backstory or motivation, keeping him ""pure evil"", whatever that's supposed to mean. There's not enough subtext to make these films a reflection on good and evil, so the whole vagueness falls flat. There are also too many characters with too little to do.Laurie Strode's daughter and granddaughter could have been combined into one character, the husband is superfluous, and Jamie Lee Curtis channels her inner Cameron Mitchell by spending almost the entire movie in bed, repeating the same lines about Michael Myers over and over. ""He is evil."" ""Don't worry, you're safe now, the police will get him"" ""They have no idea what they're dealing with. He's PURE evil.""I don't envy the scriptwriters who had to regurgitate that drivel over and over again.Like in the last version, the movie overuses slow motion to the point where nothing is ever really scary anymore. The kills take too long, the buildup to them is rarely scary, and even the soundtrack, while good on its own, is not used as efficiently as in past entries.I can't believe I'm saying this, but these new Halloween films make me nostalgic for Rob Zombie's take.But really I wish they went with the concept for Halloween 3: An anthology of scary stories centered around Halloween.3 stars for nice photography, a good score and a few bloody kills to satisfy the gorehounds.",Halloween Kills
303,gameoveraus,"Not the worst in the franchise, but close & pointless.",4,23 October 2021,"This movie only serves one purpose, to have a stream of kills on screen in the halloween/Friday the 13th style vein.Michael is unmasked at one point so there is that, but other then an obviously messed up eye all you see is his aged hair.It doesn't wrap anything up, it doesn't set anything up, it just continues more of the same. Also showcases how retarded the townsfolk are when they think a fat short bald guy is Michael, even someone that encoutered when they were a child.I really think Jamie Lee Curtis's acting which btw was the only credible acting in the movie pretty much sums it up, she looked like WTH am i still doing this.",Halloween Kills
304,sinnfenian,I can only suspend belief so much...,4,17 October 2021,"All things considered, this is an effective addition to the Halloween series. There are plenty of solid kills and they finally fixed the mask to give it more of a terminator look which I really appreciate.The thing that bothered me the most is, in this day and age I think we need to get past the, ""why would they___"" tropes we ask during so many horror movies.For example - they get a posse to kill myers but instead of using a strength in numbers tactic, they all split up.Theres a scene where a black girl crawls out the window of a car with a gun. Myers appears, kills her boyfriend and when she appears again she's 20 yards away...wtf?Or a guy realizes that myers has returned to his home. Rather than call the posse he decides to enter the house alone...Or the gay couple who decides to split up and search their house.The biggest issue is the end. So, myers is in his old house fighting Jamie's daughter. He goes outside and is surrounded by the town folk. They beat him and shoot him until they think he's dead. Then they all hang out in front of her house where he should still be, right? Now there's cops and all that. So myers comes to life and starts killing people who are still right in front of her house where the rest of the town is literally no farther than 20 yards away and no one sees this. Somehow he manages to that, go into his own house that has town folk in and around it, and kill Jamie's daughter without being seen. So apparently he has some crazy ninja skills.That ending scene ruined the movie for me....worth a watch, but whatever.",Halloween Kills
305,penguin_holmes,Boredom Kills!!!,4,21 October 2021,"This movie is 50% screaming, 15% people running left and right aimlessly, 35% kills.Throughout the entire runtime of the movie, you do not feel any tension, neither do you feel any connection to any of the characters nor do you feel any sympathy when they die.Script was beyond comprehensively bad, it felt like it was written by an 8th grader who thought they were writing something Shakespearean deep.There is a line in the movie ""Evil Dies Tonight"", to me it felt like ""This Movie Needs to End Right Away"".I was constantly watching the time on when this movie was going to end, which is one of the many signs that the movie didn't capture my attention and was overstaying its welcome, plus mixed it with the ending of the movie, which was beyond horrible, it left quite a bad taste 4/10.",Halloween Kills
306,gressman07,H40,8,17 October 2021,"Halloween 2018 was good and all, but never really hit the spot. Probably an 8 there. I like the new no siblings alt take but it never quite felt truly connected to the first and more something to just take as expository truth.Personally this is more my style, but the honestly near if not equal or surpassing gore, which I'd say rivals even Zombies sequel in terms of gore and brutality, could turn off many.The mob characters feel largely shoe horned in, but they serve their purpose well enough. This honestly felt more like the truer sequel to the original, ignoring all the others, than H2018. While the first was needed to set things up, it was truly just an appetizer in retrospect, and this the main course.Love it's taking place right after and with its own hospital setting. In short, a worthy sequel and continuation, IMO the best sequel to the original, really tying in well via new flashbacks. Heavy on the gore, it still manages a few scenes of nail-biting suspense, often utilizing elongated silence. A few jump/fake out scares, but they are intermixed enough and used sparingly enough to mix things up just a bit.I don't think you could ever remake the original or the impact it has had, but this is an amazing sequel 40 years later for a more modern time. The intro music and several moments got surprisingly emotional, and I'll admit getting a bit teary eyed in the warm nostalgia of not only reliving but seeing the continuation of what was my go to Halloween movie in middle/high school (the original).",Halloween Kills

A mob of over 20 people and Michael kills every single one of them?? I like that they bring the old actors back, but this whole movie is a jumbled mess. The logic just doesn't make sense. Too many flashback to present moments with no transition. Many people die and there are comedic moments, but it doesn't save this movie.

I know probably forever these movies will be re-made, and I will say this isn't the worst one (Rob zombie versions were awful), but this isn't a good standard and hopefully there are no more for at least a while, although a third movie in this poor ""trilogy"" is coming.The 2018 movie was better than this, but still wasn't good.

317,Darvener,"Movie without any logic, atmosphere, and good performance of actors",1,25 October 2021,"After the successful movie 'Halloween' from 2018 which was directed by David Gordon Green returned this year to the next movie from the Halloween series 'Halloween Kills' which is directed by David Gordon Green too. When someone sees that the Halloween Kills is directed by the same director of the first one 'Halloween' from 2018, which was very successful as from worldwide gross, user reviews and critic reviews, he says to himself that it can be a good sequel, but the result is that this sequel is not good at all and it is only waste of time with this illogical, badly written, badly directed and badly filmed piece of trash.As I mentioned before this movie is the sequel of the 'Halloween' movie from 2018 and it is directed by the same person David Gordon Green who is most known for 'Halloween' (2018), 'George Washington' (2000), 'Halloween Kills' (2021) and 'Joe' (2013). The major problem of this movie is the director and screenplay, because there were the most mistakes and these two things ruined the whole experience of the Halloween series. The major problems are from the whole start until to the end of the movie. One of the major problems which are very visible is the performance of actors which are on a strong average. Rest of the major problems can be for someone just little details. Next major problem is that there is no horror atmosphere here. This is the reason why every tense situation feels plain without any soul and intensity of fear of a character who is in a difficult situation. From the side of the director there wasn't any emphasis on creating any horror atmosphere, this is just a headless movie about an immortal killer. When firemen arrived at the house of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), one fireman was walking on the floor and he soon fell down through the floor to the basement where Michael Myers was imprisoned by Laurie Strode. House was on fire and inside there was a very big amount of smoke from the fire. Michael Myers killed the one fireman in the basement, at this moment there was not very big amount of smoke, after short while there arrived second fireman who wanted to help to the first fireman so he held out his hand and when he held his hand there was by some magic summoned bigger amount of smoke which there wasn't 30 seconds before. The next problem is when some characters were shooting from any old gun, mostly older weapons or pistols, there sometimes wasn't any recoil or little blink when the character was shooting. One scene where Michael Myers was in the car and he slammed into the car's window and the window cracked, was created illogically only for the good feeling and because it looks good. When you think about it you will come to a conclusion that this situation makes no sense, because how can a car's window crack after a big slam from a person who has not almost any muscles on his hands. Some scenes where Michael Myers was killing someone were executed so badly that if you saw it in the 90's you would say to yourself ""Wow! This looks awesome!"" but these days you would say to yourself that it is ridiculous that someone can do these scenes so badly that it looks like it's from the 90's when we are clearly in 2021. A good example of a badly executed killing scene is the scene almost at the end where Michael Myers kills Big John. The shot where Michael Myers pushed into his eyes and the style of how the eyes were going out of the skull was very badly executed, this would be only a great execution of the scene for the 90's. When I think now about why there is no horror atmosphere I came to the conclusion that the reason is maybe because there are so many problems with the director that he ruined almost everything that could be good in this movie.Screenplay was written by three writers Scott Teems, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green. Scott Teems was writing a screenplay for the Halloween series for the first time and Danny McBride and David Gordon Green have written Halloween from 2018, so they knew what they were doing and with this knowledge they failed and created from Michael Myers a person who is an immortal killing machine without a brain. They have written a screenplay which contains only lines without any logic, bad emotions and behaviour of some characters in difficult and thrilling situations, bad dialogues, some characters without brains, etc. As I have said about the bad behaviour of some characters there was a very good situation to stick it out because it was so bad that it must be stuck out. The scene was that one boy was going on a grass and suddenly he sees that police man is lying on the floor and when he was yelling on him, he don't answered, he started to running to him and instead of calling immediately on 911 he started yelling 'Help!'. Normal people in these situations when someone is bleeding from the neck, they would call 911 immediately and then yell for help. Writers created from Michael Myers something that is not a human because when he was in a house which was on the fire and in which when there were firemen must have oxygen bombs so they don't suffocate and Myers do not must have the oxygen bomb and he don't suffocate too. This is very illogical and very sad that this very visible part does not occur to writers to do it in some other way. When Michael Myers went out of the house which was on fire the fireman was starting to spray water on him with the fire hose and it did not do anything to him. In normal situations it will pull the person on the ground but not Myers. When the firemen are going to kill Michael Myers they go after him illogically one by one and he with simple logic kills the firemen one by one. When one fireman with chainsaw was going after Myers. Chainsaw is visibly not any problem for Myers because he by some way overcomes in strength trained and very strong fireman and kills him with fireman's chainsaw. There is a very visible next problem: when Myers kills someone, he manages to arrange dead bodies to look interesting and thrilling without anyone noticing, when he is hunted by many people from town. Next the people who have guns are not able to shoot Michael Myers when he is standing on one spot. Almost at the end of the movie characters are starting to say foolish sentences which are overfilled with clichés.Actors fit their roles perfectly but not their performances which are on a very strong average and sometimes below average. In this movie there are no actors who have very good or only good performances.Director of cinematography was Michael Simmonds who is most known for 'Halloween' (2018), Nerve (2016), 'The Lunchbox' (2013) and ''White Girl (2016). There were some problems too with the camera but there are not so many problems than pros. The camera could be in some situations better but in the rest of the movie the camera was good, not very good just good. Problems with the camera were when in one scene could be captured emotions of characters there are just only captured glasses of some alcohol in hands of characters. Next problem was the angle of the camera. In some situations it could be better but this is not any very big problem which could ruin the movie experience.Halloween Kills is a movie without any logic, atmosphere, and good performance of the actors. This movie is a very bad sequel to 'Halloween' from 2018 without any logic, brain, atmosphere or any good performance by the actors. This movie is only a cash grab and trash with poor writing and directing.0%",Halloween Kills

319,simonkie,Halloween Kills delivers the thrills,8,17 October 2021,For the 2018 Halloween reboot I wrote how that movie could've been so much more as many things were left out but Halloween Kills made up for it in a big gruesome way.Halloween Kills not only delivered the kills but the thrills and a good backstory that was missing on the previous film. Questions about just how Myers was captured on Halloween night 1978 was finally revealed with a thrilling flashback to that fateful night. That is something that should've been in the first film.This film also brings the entire town into play as well as some familiar faces as they hunt for Michael Myers. There is good suspense reminiscent of the original 1978 film along with some very violent scenes as Michael Myers is more evil than ever before. Overall it's a step up from the previous film and an excellent lead way into the next Halloween movie.,Halloween Kills
320,Leungzy,Not as good as the 2018 prequel,6,19 October 2021,"I was a huge fan of the 2018 reboot and had high hopes for this this sequel but unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. I appreciate how they tried to bring in more characters and give a more full circled story but sometimes it felt like there was just a bit too much going on. The movie was missing something that I just can't quite put my finger on.I know horror movies characters always make bad decisions but sometimes the characters in this just made really really stupid decisions which almost cheapened the story a bit in my opinion.On a positive note I do feel the movie does Michael justice and doesn't feel like a cash grab compared to other horror reboots I've seen. I like how they circled back to characters and scenes from 1978.**Spoiler Alert**
I had forgotten that the movie makers had already agreed to make a third movie, so at the end of the film when it looks like Michael is about to meet his end, I thought that this would be the end of the movie.I actually would have been satisfied to see the series end here in that fashion as it's not a type of ending I've ever seen before in slasher movies and I really liked the idea.

321,danielj-521-351057,What a shame...,4,16 October 2021,"This sequel is a prime example of when too many ideas are put on paper that don't serve the purpose of the story but only to serve the genre to try and make money with too many typical jump scare scenes and repetitive slasher scenes that have no reason to be in the story.The movie should just simply have started with a direct continuation from its predecessor, with Jamie Lee Curtis in the car to the hospital and have a ""on the run"" style of story that would have lead well into Halloween ends that could have made nicely to focus on Curtis ""hunting down"" Michael Myers for revenge to tie off the ending of Halloween Kills.Of course keeping things simple and effective is not enough which has lead this movie to a very disconnected and ""trying to be a thriller/horror/slasher flick"" movie.The fact that Michael was shot soo many times, slashed, smacked in the head with bricks, stomped on the head, stabbed in the neck and even burned down from the previous film and is still alive is complete nonsense.He's not made out to be a supernatural and is in human form so he well would have been dead by now. The fact he keeps surviving made this a complete nonsense experience.You can also just tell that the ending of Halloween Kills was just thought of last minute to ""play off"" a good idea someone might've had in the office to keep the franchise going that had no logical effect and was just stupid.If you want a popcorn flick with no intellect that has a killer who happens to have 20 lives then this is your movie, but definitely not what I had expectedThe trailer was better than this movie.",Halloween Kills

This new trilogy is trying to be different from the many of Halloween sequels but I don't think it is. After this movie, it is clear that Michael isn't human...and may never be stopped.

Michael kills a bunch of people, so at least the movie lives up to its title.'Halloween Ends' will be released next year, and at this point, who cares? Michael Myers has already won. The body count over the last two movies is so comically high, he's probably already killed half the town of Haddonfield.

The film began with what I would consider to be a realistic and captivating flashback to 1978. In fact, I would argue that Halloween Kills is connected to the first movie more than the 2018 revival, proved by the plethora of returning characters. Props to John Carpenter & Co for what was another fantastic score. The movie was also ripe with some brutal, gnarly kills, so to quote to AC/DC, ""If you want blood, you got it!"" Easily one of the most violent movies I've seen on the big screen and I would say it comes close to rivaling the Rob Zombie movies in terms of brutalily in the franchise. Carnage Candy at its finest. Unfortunately, the middle of the film dragged a little bit, but keep in mind, this movie is mainly filler, leading up to the finale of the trilogy. It was more so about the deaths, as indicated by the title. Thankfully, the third act regained the momentum for an edge-of-your-seat climax. And WHOA! What an ending. Really makes me interested what direction they'll take the story in Halloween Ends. Overall, Halloween Kills is a good enough sequel, if you take into account that it mainly exists to set up the next movie.",Halloween Kills
331,tpcatoz-90650,It's a Halloween movie,6,21 October 2021,"For everyone giving this movie a 1 star review, what the heck did you expect from a Halloween movie? Sure the movie has some really dumb moments, but isn't that suppose to happen? It was a decent movie to kill some time, I won't rush to rewatch but it's not an awful movie. It's not the best Michael Myers movie but it's still a decent one despite some odd and dumb, really dumb moments.The only part that I absolutely didn't like and was unfathomable was the ending. You have about 15-20 people, maybe more, craving to kill Michael Myers and only two people brought pistols?? They know this guy isn't human, has been shot, stabbed, even freaking burned alive and they only beat him a few times and shoot him about 2-3 times and they stop? Cmon these people were gonna rip the limbs off the escaped convict who ended up killing himself.Also even after Michael kills Tommy and everyone, how the hell does he get back into the house without anyone seeing him? I get Horror movies, especially Michael Myers movies, have to bend reality a bit, but this movie just had a few too many of those moments where reality and physics were just completely ignored.In conclusion, if you're going to analyze everything in this film for deeper meaning and expect to come away with an experience, you will be disappointed. It's just a typical Halloween movie, nothing more and nothing less.",Halloween Kills
332,shannonsuxx,HALLOWEEN H20 is the true ending of Halloween.,6,17 October 2021,"If there's anything that really bugs me about the new revision of Laurie Strode, it's how self-obsessed her character is written and how she solely believes Michael is after her.Jamie Lee Curtis constantly going on about how he is after her really bugs me because there's no legitimate justification other than he attacked her once 40 years ago.At least with HALLOWEEN H20 in 1998 there was a legitimate connection because Laurie Strode was in fear for her life from her psychopathic brother who wanted his family dead.The kills in HALLOWEEN KILLS are entertaining, but the writing is an absolute mess. The film takes itself way too seriously and doesn't want to make a decision on whether Michael Myers is human or immortal. It also tries to take all these moralistic stances on social themes in side plots not related to any of the characters without earning any right to explore these themes in the first place.The entire film, the writing, and the direction feel so self-absorbed. I wish they just left the franchise back in 2002 with Halloween: Resurrection.",Halloween Kills
333,hillman_mcfc,It felt cheap.,6,18 October 2021,"So I really enjoyed the 2018 Halloween I thought we had turned a corner until I watched this..just another Halloween same old same old they basically took the script from Halloween 4 with the community rounding up, we've been here before..Myers goes on a rampage granted some of the kills are great but it's totally away from the OG of just lurking in the dark, he can now just appear anywhere in the space of 2 minutes. Another thing I'd like to add was how cheap it all felt, the acting was well below par. I'm hoping Green ha something special for the 3rd one to have any chance of saving this trilogy.",Halloween Kills

337,tariqma2002,Very very disappointing,1,3 November 2021,"A very provocative movie which is filled with many naive scenes that disappointed us in watching an interesting movie.. The content is a collection of murder scenes only without mystery , excitement or suspense because we were guessing the end of each scene before it happened as the provocative style of the director and author is exposed without coverage.. The director shows that innocent People are like a group of idiots , and Michael is sane (although in fact he is crazy and a patient in a mental health hospital).. But it is the commercial goal that hopes in an additional part of the film to get our money and then provoke us with events.. It is necessary to take into account the feelings of the viewer (I mean the customer) The ones who pay to burn their blood with something unreasonable .. the philosophy of the old woman in the hospital, does not excuse the author and director from criticism that they are losers.",Halloween Kills

The plot whilst in the hospital keeps it grounded and there are some good story beats around thisWhere the film falls apart is the last twenty minutes. Michael varies between being human and being an entity. He walks people down mostly but then starts teleporting all over the place.Also how ""transcendence"" which basically involve him being beaten to death; only to come alive and slaughter everyone didn't work for meBut worst of all, Michael is essentially just trying to get home to stare out of a window. Laurie who has been so crucial and paramount to the story through Michaels hunting of her is now completely inconsequential. She just got in the way. So her importance is now completely null and voidMaybe Halloween Ends will fix the gaping plot holes of this film but we shall seeAlso the final kill seems tacked on to just add a downbeat ending. It really misses the markSeemed to have potential but a very disappointing film.",Halloween Kills
342,jcallender121,Halloween without Michael.,4,17 October 2021,"Is someone having a bit of a laugh and a joke!. It looked like Michael, walked like Michael and killed like Michael but it wasn't the big Fella. Michael Myres doesn't position bodies in dramatic poses for effect and he certainly wouldn't put on records after the slaughtering. This looks and feels so much like a proper early Halloween film but it so isn't, for a start they've filled the whole town with the nitwits who bought all the toilet roll at the start of the Covid pandemic, stirred them up into a frenzy and got them to chant ""evil dies tonight"" every chance they get. This gets annoying really fast and cumulates in them chasing a little fat guy through the hospital to his death thinking he's Michael!!. I was groaning more than Pavarotti's pie shelf. The film tries too hard to look into the human soul with statements like ""we're the true monsters"", and ""evil grows in our fear"" getting spewed out left and right. Stop trying to be clever with Michael Myres, hes' a 7ft, indestructible unit with a knife, therapy groups and rosary beads will do you very little if any good if he takes a hold of you down a dark alley.

The kills are bloody, and gorey as I would expect from a Halloween film. There is a moment in the film that I was like ""how is everyone this stupid?""

There is so many problems with this movie that it was hard to enjoy. They decided to replace fear and tension with gore. I don't mind gore, but Halloween wasn't really about gore until now. There is a killer loose and the town isn't in lockdown? And they know it's MM. I never knew firefighters were trained in hand to hand combat? And that guy who sprayed MM with the hose was the best. MM was still trapped in the basement and that fire fighter could of never lifted him up. Why were there so many mad people in the hospital? Michael didn't kill that many people yet. And the police didn't do anything to calm it down? There's a hospital that lets you see dead naked bodies through windows? Someone breaks into your house and you don't get the f out? You grab a knife? You know of MM too. I don't have a problem with gay people, but that whole section was totally pointless. It should of been like when the old people got killed. Fast. Why would the crazy escaped guy go the hospital full of mad people? He was trying to escape but decides to go to a full hospital? And he was a magician to get into a lock and alarmed car. Grab a bad and fill it with rocks and stones and attack MM. WTF??? Then the worst part was the ending. 3 people go to Michael's house to ""kill"" him? They know he's a unstoppable killing machine. And the father goes in alone at first? I was cheering for Michael at this point. Then the other people trap Michael and beat and shoot and stab him until he's ""dead""???? Not one person said let's make sure he's dead? Especially Tommy and the mom? I personally would of cut his head off. I know that's morbid, but we are talking about MM here. Then of course Michael gets up and kills all of them. Hooray! A lot of stupid people died. And no of them ran? MM just got up from you ""killing"" him and so let's try to kill him again? This stupidity actually started with the end of the last movie. Laurie of all people knows Michael can't easily die or even die at all. So she just leaves him in a burning house? He wasn't even on fire yet. She actually thinks that would kill him? A person who's been through this for 40 years should sit there and watch him burn to a crisp and ashes.

How about taking on 12 firefighters in a circle like some Kill Bill style one at a time garbage. The dialogue is atrocious. JLC is a bit player.

359,HockeyFan13,What a Let Down. Bears Zero Resemblance to Halloween,3,29 October 2021,"The movie opens so promising with a well done flashback to that fateful night in 1978. There is even a reasonable facsimile of the great Donald Pleasance with a small cameo ""returning"" as Dr. Loomis.Then the movie picks up right where Halloween (2018) left off and everyone in the movie acts in the most absurd, asinine dumb manner possible.Then firemen of course walk through walls of flames to go into the interior of a house that is fully engulfed in flames, something they would never do.Then one of them falls through the floor. Of course Michael is alive which the unfortunate fireman who fell through the floor soon finds out as he is quickly dispatched.Then another fireman is going to reach down into a hole on a floor one of his partners fell through. You know where this goes. Michael ""thanks"" him by killing him and taking his halligan. Then Michael walks out of the wall of flames to confront the other 5 firemen who are standing around.They all see Michael, and.... wait for it..Line up like lambs to the slaughter, axes, halligans, and A ROTARY SAW to do bloody battle with the nefarious Michael Myers. They are all quickly dispatched as well.Then the story.... oh excuse me, what passes for a story starts. Michael essentially brutally murdering every single person he comes across because like the firemen at the beginning? They are the stupidest idiots on the planet. The only time anyone bans together in a group is when they mistake a guy with no hair, no clothes, about a foot and a half shorter and a hospital gown on as Michael fricking Myers and chase him until he kills himself while chanting ""evil dies tonight"".Just when you can't think people in this movie can't get any stupider? The gay couple who currently reside in the Myers house who by the way are the only people in the whole damn movie you will even care about find out that there is someone in the house ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT and they live in THE MYERS HOUSE
? Yeah, they don't call 911, they don't leave the house to get help.. no.... one of them grabs the smallest knife in the world to go investigate. Guess what? Once he is easily dispatched his partner just stands there waiting to be killed when he could have easily escaped.Let's not even talk about Michael killing the elderly couple walking passed at least 50 better weapons to GRAB THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT BULB OUT OF A FIXTURE and use that to stab someone.Then there is Laurie's granddaughter, who is in the running with stupidest person in the movie with the woman dressed as a nurse who gets killed by Bruce Lee.. Sorry Michael Myers when he kicks a car door so perfectly he makes her shoot herself in the face.. oh yeah back to Laurie's granddaughter who in the face of a guy who has plowed through at least 50 people by now thinks she can take him down with her 135 pound boyfriend who also cannot shoot a gun at a near stationary target from 3 feet away.The movie is brutal in every sense of the word. The killings are super gory, brutal and over the top stupid. There is no story to speak of and worst of it all? It isn't scary in the slightest.The original wasn't awesome because Michael stabbed an old man through the back into a kitchen butcher block with 17 knives. It was awesome because people watching it were crapping their pants because of the atmosphere Carpenter created with his amazing score coupled with tension as to where Michael would pop in and our of frames like an entity.This time he is omnipresent, everywhere all the time. There is nothing scary about this movie at all. Not one scene will make you feel like you're in the same world Carpenter created in 1978 other than the Shatner mask.Someone gets introduced? Dead. Someone from the past gets brought back? Dead. Dead Dead Dead and in the most over the top kill scenes that will either disgust you or make you laugh at the absurd nature of it all.Positives? The opening scene, and the score. Everything else is absolute trash. This isn't Friday the 13th. This is supposed to be Halloween. Someone obviously forgot that along the way.",Halloween Kills

361,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,Definitely lives up to the name.,6,13 October 2021,"This movie doesn't care who it kills or how many people, which I think was really awesome. And wow, thank goodness I didn't watch the trailer beforehand.This does a lot of what the past two Halloween sequels did, from Halloween II (1981) to Rob Zombie's Halloween II (2019): it picks up right where the past one left off, so much so that I'm convinced some parts were even filmed a few years back for the first film and were left on the cutting room floor. There are also flashback elements where they do really well in capturing the 1970s look, almost making you think you're watching a version from back then.As Halloween (2018) acts as a direct sequel to Halloween (1978), a forty-year-later sequel would definitely have a lot of 'splaining to do for an audience that did not necessarily see the first film. I'll say that while the last film did its thing here and there, this one spares no expense in doing as many callbacks as it possibly can. If you didn't watch Halloween (1978), after watching this one I don't even think you'll need to. Obviously you'll be rewarded for having seen it, but whatever ""story"" you may not have known will be understood by now, imagery and all. Perhaps even some new elements will surface from long ago. But yes, early on Halloween Kills wants to lend as a commentary to the films of the past, a bit to a fault I might add. It is way too exposition-heavy in this regard, and I could have done without a lot of it.This actually brings me back to Halloween (2018), which I would call my favorite of the bunch but it always kind of did something that irked me: although it ignores the older sequels, it plays as if Laurie Strode had seen those movies, and she is fully aware of The Shape beyond her only minimalistic interactions with him forty years back. I'm not saying killing a few people isn't a heinous act, but she always treated him as something more than she even witnessed for herself, and as long as those other sequels are supposed to be ignored I wasn't ever really accepting of that. She also always made it about her, as if Michael cared about pursuing her more than others... and besides her being the one who got away, it almost was again one of those things where I felt she was controlling a narrative that wouldn't exist if she didn't say anything about it. In a way their relationship actually reminds me of Wanda and Thanos in Endgame (""You took everything from me"" followed by ""I don't even know who you are""). I won't say whether Halloween Kills addressed or further frustrated my concerns about that, but it definitely exacerbated it enough that it made me bring up these thoughts again.What it does do, however, is this weird thing where people who aren't aware of the lore are so easily willing and accepting of the presented evil. Like you mention it in passing, and others are so willing to buy in so quickly and act on it. Like: ""You don't know Michael Myers? He is evil itself. Come help me kill him, once and for all! Evil dies tonight!"" And suddenly others are on board. Heck, few character interactions are really that great overall. Many characters reprise their roles, but if you didn't watch the 2018 film you wouldn't know a lot of the turmoil or trauma that some characters faced with one another, because they aren't really brought up much again. I think part of the problem is because some of our main characters in the last film fall to the wayside without really being made aware of it beforehand, and then side characters kind of hit the forefront and are a mainstay almost longer than expected. If the balance was shifted back, they probably would have written more of those moments back in. I get the message of this film though keeping that shift in mind, and I think that part actually worked well (when it wasn't stated in our faces so often that is).One of the only problems with the kills is that most characters could've avoided being killed so easily. Anyone who tries to attack him often only engages him one at a time, people will keep themselves inside when they know he is inside with them, characters are slow to respond to the cries of somebody nearby them, people who evade him won't continue going out of their way of him, and no one has ever heard of a double tap. I don't mean they would survive if they were a little more ahead of things, but I wish they were written as such as to make the kills themselves ""smarter"" as a result. The other thing, and this happened in the 2018 film as well, is as characters have already been hurt plenty by Myers to the point of death, they sure spend a lot of time not dying as if it seems like they only took their first minor blow at that point, and I'm wondering why they're not dead, unconscious, or unable to move at that point. It doesn't get me a good feel of when they're supposed to die, if that makes sense. This is me nitpicking, though. Many deaths are fantastic and they absolutely have their striking blow.Lastly, a lot of people shame Rob Zombie's Halloween for trying to humanize Michael Myers a lot (which I was fine with, personally). I wouldn't say this does this at any level, but it does give some characters a chance to try and explain him to themselves. When there isn't a Samuel Loomis around to just scream he's evil all of the time, the goal of this film being that they try and play offense and kill Michael means they have to really understand what it is they're up against, so you get conversations from eye witness accounts about what they believe he is or his intentions are, and again this worked for me.I chose to be critical here and there when talking about this film, and in many ways I am. The movie is most certainly entertaining, but it is not as strongly written as the 2018 sequel. It probably has one of the better ""hold your breath"" tense moments that I've seen in a Halloween film, and Michael Myers is ruthless as ever. It's the popcorn horror movie you want to see, and you definitely want to have seen the previous film before this. It really did feel like the middle movie of a trilogy as the whole film kind of felt like a 100-minute middle act, so I'll just say that it was mostly a fun watch and I look forward to see how HALLOWEEN ENDS next year (and I think I know how it does).",Halloween Kills

365,smithnumber,Michael Myers the indestructable pensioner,3,25 October 2021,"Every time a new Halloween movie comes out there's a press lead-up telling the world that it's the best in the series, a return the spirit of the original with Jamie Lee is back to jam it to Michael etc. And every time they deliver a poor horror movie that only exists to prop up a franchise that should have been killed off many years ago. This installment is no exception. For those who still care, Michael escapes from the burning building ending in the last episode - sorry, movie - to wreak havoc and kill off various middle-aged people in the most diverse town in America. Meanwhile, Jamie Lee is holed up in hospital telling us how indestructible he is with some waffle about each kill making him stronger. No-one in the production teams seems to remember that he started as a child in the first movie and grew into a man (so he is human) and should by now be about 75. But why let logic get in the way of some gruesome kills? And gruesome they are, so if you like that sort of thing then you won't be disappointed.However, actual scares are in short supply, as is logic The cast do what they have to do but it's interesting to note that while most of them are completely forgettable, Jamie Lee captivates every time she's on screen. I guess that's star power for you.All in all this franchise needs a good stake in the heart, but like Michael, it will come back for another ""shocking"" round with diminishing results. Jamie Lee's character is getting too old for all these shenanigans and you know what? I am too.",Halloween Kills
366,Michael_Arm,AWFUL Movie contender for a Razzie,2,17 October 2021,"This movie reminds me of the Geico Commercial ""Good Choices"" but with worse acting.This move is awful.I don't know how any of the actors could or would be impressed with the script enough to take a role in this flick even if you needed the $.David Gordon Green should never be allowed to direct or have anything to do with a Halloween movie again.And what was the deal with Big John and Little John?? Big John prepared himself to take on the intruder by taking his clothes off??!! Smh.... Just having characters named Big John and Little John should be a red flag.And what was the deal with the ""evil dies tonight"" chant??? Was that supposed to gave us the viewers chanting along with them?And what's the deal with the town of Haddonfield NOT HAVING A MICHAEL MYERS CONTINGENCY PLAN????",Halloween Kills
367,markdecarlo-98321,Lousy,5,23 October 2021,"Slashers are usually known to be pretty brain dead and there are some where you actively root for the bad guy to take out all the ill defined characters. Halloween is usually a little above that, but this is unfortunately an example of a brain dead slasher film. None of the characters talk or behave like human beings which makes it next to impossible to get invested in their fates and Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode spends the whole movie in a hospital bed delivering bad first year theatre student monologues about the nature of evil and how Michael has ""transcended.""",Halloween Kills
368,labeatkryeziu,Who approved this,1,17 October 2021,The movie is so bad because you cant expect the town with like 300 people to have a combined iq of 2.

371,acrotinger,Enjoyable but Flawed,5,19 October 2021,"I feel like I'm in the minority of fans of the series that didn't really like the 2018 sequel. The only elements in that film that worked for me was borrowed from previous films in the series.With that said, I found myself liking this movie even if some plot elements could have been dropped. I think the idea of mob mentality and the grip past trauma has on our lives is an interesting idea to explore, but the movie doesn't know how to handle it.I do agree with other reviewers that the flashback to '78 was unnecessary, while stylistically enjoyable. It didn't add much to the plot except Laurie has someone to sympathize with I guess? I seriously don't understand that moment in the hospital room when he tells her ""This isn't your fault."" Like, duh.While I do enjoy elements from pretty much every sequel, this series really could have been a stand alone film. The first is simplistic but writers seem to think the only way of expanding the story is by explaining why Micheal is evil. The first film already showed us that. He targeted the characters in the first movie just because, no other reason, no ulterior motive.I'll definitely check out the third one just to see Laurie put an end to Micheal, but the series needs to be done.",Halloween Kills

Well, this movie does have gore, but as for the rest. Eh.The story seems like it was written by some 15 year old boy. I get that it's like a homage to the original 80's version, but this movie is so bad. It's like a Netflix exclusive.Very bad acting, dialogue, direction. It's just bad. Oh, there's a part where they start shooting guns inside a car with rolled up windows with no ear plugs and they act like it's not a big deal. You would go deaf if you shoot a gun inside a car like that.It's an okay movie to watch for Halloween, but I'd rather watch the first one again.",Halloween Kills
375,BOOKSMART1,Halloween Boredom,4,27 October 2021,"The 2018 Halloween movie was a great story about trauma, taking Strode through redemption as she grappled with the trauma of being hunted by a madman serial killer and having all of her friends brutally murdered. But this 2021 movie fails to be about anything other than Myers killing people yet again. One of the things that makes this movie boring - and the opposite of what made the original so great - is the lack of suspense. The people who wants to kill Myers have no plan to kill him, they just like sitting ducks to him. If you want to enjoy brutal violence might find this movie enjoyable because it does have some great kills, but most of them are gratuitous at best and reminiscent of the Rob Zombie ""Halloween"" movies.",Halloween Kills

Unfortunately, they don't hold up too well by today's standards, but hey their classics. The rest? Terrible. As we already know, part 3 should not have been called Halloween. Good lord. The rest of the sequels sucked. Rob Zombies reimagining was ok, but I could have done without the horrendous back story with his mother. I would say the best out of any of the sequels was H2O. Had great suspense. Like Jaime Lee Curtis said' "" should've ended there"" but due to a clause in the contract with the the producer/ production company, they could never kill off Michael. She also had contract obligations to return for the beginning seen of ""Resurrection"" which she demanded her character be killed off. I would've wanted to be killed of as well. Halloween Kill's was more of a comedy in my book. And I thought the first one was terrible. Gee. Was I wrong. Laughed through out the whole film. Terrible script. Judy Greer's acting was horrendous. Judy is just not cut out for this kinda material. Jaime Lee Curtis is hardly in it. Please cut your hair..you look god damn old an awful. Basically, if you liked the first one, chances are you'll like this one. Definitely, not a treat, more like a trick. Enjoy!",Halloween Kills

Well, I must say, ALOT happens in this movie and it surprisingly turned out to be way better than the 1st one for me. Not just the kills, the scares or action was great, BUT there are so many storyline connections in here with the characters that do so great, that longtime fans of the original 1978 version will not be disappointed. And that's important! The film is kind of predictable, but who cares! It's not predictable in a stupid or bad way. I promise you, if you thought Myers was violent in all the previous Halloween movies, wait until you see this one.

Killing and staying alive, basically because he isn't human, he's a monster from hell most likely fed be fear and people's worst nightmares. At least that is how interpret and explain his persistence and survival. People seem to not love this one, saying there was no story? I mean this film actually paid a great deal to the past story paying tribute to several of the previous installments. In my opinion the only way to make a better Halloween movie would be to get back to focusing on more fear of the unknown, creating better Halloween like atmosphere and tense nail biting situations. Less quick kills more stress on the characters and viewers. Slow the whole thing down basically give everyone more time to ponder what lies ahead. Well that's my opinion of what I'd do if I was to make a Halloween film. Looking forward to the next one to see where they go from here.",Halloween Kills

She had literally no constructive part in the film except to give a spoiler alert to how the next film(yes there will be a next film as they didn't finish the story) is going to end.I only gave it a 2 Star rating for the fun day out I had with my son.Save your $30 and skip this garbage.",Halloween Kills

The kills were gory, and the chase scenes were stereotypical for a movie of this caliber. What I particularly enjoyed was the performance by Kyle Richards. Although she was used as simple filler due to housewives fame, her performance seemed natural for a person suffering from PTSD.I believe that she needs to quit her reality show and focus more on acting; especially horror. I think that she should collaborate with BlumHouse more often. There is a new movie coming out based on a Joe Hill novel that she would have been perfect for. Kyle you are too good for housewives. Perfect your acting skills, and come back to the screen. As a horror fan, I would greatly appreciate it.",Halloween Kills

403,JayDeeezy,Wow...what a nosedive,4,17 October 2021,"The scenarios in this movie made no sense...even for a slasher. I really liked the first reboot in 2018 - it took a fresh, relatively more realistic approach to Halloween. The whole chaotic feel to this movie felt completely needless and I found myself saying ""wtf?"" multiple times. I think they were trying to go for the idea that Michael somehow brought out the chaos and evil in everyone in the town but it was executed super poorly and it felt inorganic. Also, I found myself laughing at some of the death scenes - I haven't seen such silly, insulting decisions since the original 80s slashers. Real bummer...I looked forward to this sequel and found it a waste of time.

Up until then I thought 'this time it's going to be great' just to get disappointed. So I was done with the franchise until this movie. I saw the trailer and thought 'that seems promising' but they pranked me yet again.The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the whole movie is just bad. There's nothing scary unless you find blood scary. But the slasher scenes have been done so many times in other movies even non-slasher movies that they've become cliches. The writing and acting is do bad it's just annoying and predictable but what do you expect from Danny McBride, right?If you want to make a remake or modern day sequel of a classic movie make sure your director and writers are on par with the original movie otherwise it's just amateurs who want to play in the big league.",Halloween Kills

Every person that died in this movie died because they were complete idiots. This stupid display of filmmaking have every dumb horror movie cliché they could possibly come up with.

Like, what was the purpose of all that?And the pacing is just really strange and the writing is just really off.The movie struggles with what tone it wants to have and because of that the movie just isn't good enough.

And the body count is high as Michael rips them to shreds with generous amounts of blood.Not everything works as well as most new characters aren't well done, introductions are rushed and they often make stupid decisions, the big fight between Laurie and Michael was left to the next movie and this, while fun, adds little to the actual story. A filler episode, yeah, but still a worthy sequel imo.",Halloween Kills
413,martmare,Well it was something,6,27 October 2021,"First of all Michael's kills were great and brutal so they delivered well of that part.

We get it you don't have to say it so many times like come on.All acted well here but there wasnt really a main character you to cheer for sadly. Soundtrack was once again amazing.

They don't even think to run.,5,17 October 2021,"If a psychopathic killer who can take bullets and keep on killing were in my neighbourhood I'd be in the car and driving as fast and as far as possible never to return. In this movie not a single person thinks to do this. Instead they do things like get into hand-to-hand weapon fights. You'd think after he downs 2, 3 or more people without breaking a sweat, you'd run, olympic fast, not this horror movie jog we keep seeing. Or once he's down, crush his skull, remove the head, dismember the body, burn it in separate gasoline fires. Nope, he's laying down, must mean it's over.... oh wait it is not.The problem with this is that audiences have become more aware of these tropes and need better writing. It's really quite comedic watching Michael speed walk while people ""run"" from him.It really felt like this was a extra long setup for the final movie... which I thought the previous film could have been the last but I guess just like Michael Myers this franchise will never truly die.",Halloween Kills

This flick wants to expand the story beyond Laurie's perspective, and they bring characters from the first film into this story. This opens up the movie abit, and sometimes the focus seems to be all over the place. I will admit this sequel has better cinematography, mood, and atmosphere compared to Halloween 2018. I dont know how I feel about some of the endings choices. As the writers started to lean into what they were trying to avoid with all the previous sequels they chose to ignore. Im 50/50 on this.",Halloween Kills
418,tylerwoodrownichols,Worst in the entire franchise... and one of the worst in the genre.,1,19 October 2021,"I can understand not giving this movie 1 star like I do (but I am not alone), but any of the 10 star reviews are either astroturfing or are from people who have a hilariously low bar for what constitutes a ""perfect"" movie.Full disclosure, I paid to see the first ""reboot"" (LOL) on screen in 2018 and was... incredibly disappointed. What a terrible movie that was. But oh wow, that movie was Oscar-worthy compared to ""Halloween Kills"", which is also a stupid title.This time I did not make the mistake of paying again, so watched it for free at home, mainly out of morbid curiosity and a desire for background noise while working. Dear god, the 2018 edition was bad but this one is absolutely atrocious... every ingredient sucks. The writing is the worst part, by far. And the bad aspects just keep coming rapid fire. Why would anybody care about this 1978 character arc about some random cop non-character? Why does the other cop tell us he knew Michael as kids? The last thing he needs is more exposition. Things only get worse. For some reason, all the ""survivors"" of the original movie hang out on Halloween in a bar and reminisce about that night they almost got murdered? The best (worst?) is that the girl who got her throat slit in the 1978 movie somehow survived even though that makes no sense...Laurie is almost dead, and then her daughter, who would certainly be suffering from some form of PTSD, finds out Michael is alive and immediately goes into a rage to hunt him (LOL). She joins the other tertiary leftover characters from 1978 and they drive around hunting Michael (?). I wish I was joking, but this makes up most of the first half of the film.Oh yeah, and when he does rarely appear, Michael is also now a Mortal Kombat character and kills 3 firefighters in about 15 seconds with a table saw... it's just utterly absurd. He's supposed to be a slow creeping ""force of nature"" not an agile fighting game character. And no, there's not a sense of Evil Dead style campiness to any of this. The movie is a tonal nightmare but the Michael scenes are serious to the point of melodrama.The absolute nadir of the film is when Laurie, who has just come out of surgery, somehow ""snaps out of it"" by giving herself a shot of... something? She just knows how to find this miracle potion in the hospital and how to administer it without killing herself. Then the hospital fills with... a sea of scared people? Why would they go to the hospital and not, like, the police station or just leave town? It makes no sense and is incredibly frustrating. Then the hospital invaders think some random old guy with a disability is Michael (?) only for him to literally commit suicide by jumping out of the window (?). Let's just say it doesn't get better from there. Not at all. But I don't want to spoil the ending for anybody who enjoys this.Final remarks: There are tertiary (maybe quaternary?) characters who are either a gay couple (I'm gay, for the record) or an interracial couple... which just feels so cynically shoehorned in to tick some boxes. For the record, if the movie was good and these elements were included I really wouldn't care. I'm not any kind of conservative or culture warrior, but I see this stuff for what it is. It just adds insult to injury by fetishizing these minority groups in an otherwise morally, ethically, and artistically bankrupt piece of trash as a self-serving PR attempt to appear ""righteous"".Please, dear reader, do NOT pay to see this movie. It's worse than even 5, 6, or the Zombie remakes (yes, really). If you're new to the franchise, don't bother with this. Just watch Halloween (1978), Pt. 2, and then H20. If you want to watch the 4 thru 6 trilogy... OK. They're not great, but at least at their worst they're so bad they're funny... there is nothing funny about this. It's just really, really cringe.",Halloween Kills

421,Polotovar,They should have stuck with the 2018 version,5,26 October 2021,"I don't really know what to say. It started off fine and followed the intro with music, which I enjoyed, but then it started to be about nothing in my opinion. This movie just felt so empty to me. How can I put this. For example, if I look at the previous installment from 2018, that one had a plot in my opinion. Here, there is something going on, but it feels so empty, without a purpose. There's even a moment that I thought was pretty overdone. They're still putting the events of the original Halloween movie in here and I don't know, but I just didn't like it and my opinion is that they should have stuck with the 2018 movie and not made a sequel. The only good thing here in my opinion are the scenes with Michael murdering his victims. Those are really good. But the rest of the movie is a misery for me and in the end it is a mediocre movie that I don't recommend.",Halloween Kills

Halloween Kills blows them all out of the water. It starts stupid and doesn't let up. It just gets dumber and dumber as it goes along. It's basically a parody of itself by the time we get to the final act.Everything everyone says is dumb. Everything they do is dumb. Just a dumb, ugly movie with no style or reason to exist.

424,aaronjconroy,A very ok Halloween movie,6,17 October 2021,"Bit too brutal for me
Gore and graphic kills overdone for the sake of it, some new aspects we hadn't seen before like the town coming to together amid chaos to hunt Michael down (something touched on in 4)And also the concept that it's not about Laurie, that Michael just kills and heads back tk the Myers house, Laurie just happened to be in his path.The kills in this a very frequent and graphic. I didn't like this as reminded me too much of the Rob Zombie ones which had poor writing and unnecessarily over the top brutality.A lot of original characters and their actors are brought back but are almost all wiped out by Michael, frustrating as the viewer to see some of them not just survive him but have to be killed off. Ending was a cop out and made the charcaters come across stupid with their decisions and Michael got a free pass to make it to the next movie. He also brutalised certain charcaters way to much including kids and elderly which is really really unsettling to watchThere's a few flashback sequences that weren't in the original movies so can be a little confusing to to ep up with what is canon. I did like the soundtrack and seeing the returning charcaters but the film was just a bit too brutal for me with a poorly written final 20 mins that just annoyed me by the end.",Halloween Kills
425,jeremiahlhorton,"Better than the previous, not by much",7,15 October 2021,"This film was actually pretty scary. You have Michael, presumed dead, starting his typical massacre all over again, but this time he's leaving a HUGE trail of blood. The film is better than the previous, but not by much. The kills were great, some were very unnecessary, but it goes to show the carnage and there are no limits or boundaries set. Jamie Lee Curtis does well in her performance, but her character is wasted here. Everyone else Is on a rampage to end Michael Myers, who is seemed mortal, but something about this film feels they're going to make the same supernatural mistake made in previous sequels. I also questioned some of the characters' choices in STANDING THERE with clear paths to escape Michael's grasps giving in to shock and disbelief and being murdered on/off screen. It's a good rewatchable slasher film that makes you want more, but somehow that urge dies down as it becomes more and more ridiculous and completely over the top. Also, I am about tired of hearing ""Evil dies tonight"", when nothing is actually being done to stop it.",Halloween Kills
426,tildagravette,"""The More He Kills, The More He Transcends""",4,16 October 2021,"After the events of the last movie, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the hospital by her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Mattichik). Once there, Laurie is sedated and takes a back seat to most of the action as Karen and Allyson begin to piece together that Michael has survived the fire they set and has been continuing his rampage of terror around town.Halloween Kills offers little more than a series of bloody set pieces where Michael slices and dices his way through the town of Haddonfield. If you recall the scene in the last film where he went from house to house, aimlessly killing anyone he could find, that's basically what this movie is but with more brutality and gore. In the meantime, there's a go-nowhere subplot involving an inmate at the mental hospital with Michael and a crazed mob at the hospital.There are a few well done flashbacks to 1978 and John Carpenter's music score is solid, but unless you're interested in non-stop gore with little suspense, fear, or plot, this won't be your favorite entry in the Halloween franchise.",Halloween Kills

It has a solid plot (for a halloween film), it has some truly brutal kills and a solid ending.But the true faults lie in editing and pacing. The opening didnt do too much for me but it had an amazing lead up to the second act. But then it meanders in a hospital for way too long.Once the mob has formed in the hospital it does pick up again though.My main gripes lie with laurie though. She makes a truly dumb desicion that doesnt even lead anywhere. She was smart and all she did this film was act needlessly dumb.But i wont let this detract from what i loved. The kills, Michael and honestly the tention. Michael is truly scary in this film and that i did appreciate.It some bloody halloween fun.

429,thomasellery,There's some good bits in the mess,6,28 October 2021,"Halloween kills alright, the plot, the atmosphere, any cast member left!This movie twists and turns with my Halloween fandom. On the one hand we've got the original cast reunion and Season of the Witch mask nods and on the other we have a bunch of characters that willingly run towards their own murders.It's such a mish mash of ideas, plots and scenes that I can only really review this film by pointing out its good and bad points.The Good -The original Lindsey is back - with permission from Andy Cohen to leave the Real Housewives in Beverly Hills for a trip to Haddonfield and she surprised me by doing a really good job in the role, her 'Michael scene' was one of the best parts of the movie.The fresh flashbacks - back to THAT night in the 70's meaning we have Donald back via literally his doppelgänger and some good old fashioned original movie vibes.The winks - it's what the fans want to see. Little details playing homage to the sequels it ignores - I won't spoil the fun and let you find them.The gay characters - okay they should have just left the house and not split up to go find a bloody handed intruder, but they sat naturally as characters / part of suburbia. The gay wasn't toned down, but nor was it toned up. As a gay man myself I really appreciated the thought that was put into getting this right.Some of the kills - Michael is turbo charged and isn't messing about in this instalment, this gives us some good gore and inventive slayings, buuuut.....The Bad -Some of the kills - this is Halloween goes grindhouse, wiping out an entire fleet of fire fighters as a warm up seems, if you pardon the pun, 'overkill', even for Michael.The characters choices - the dumbest decisions I've seen, no wonder Michael isn't particularly stalking anyone, they're willingly throwing themselves at him, hunting him down, knowing anyone whose found him so far was killed in seconds. - on a side note I will say everyone did a good job on acting out as their characters though.The 'mob' sub plot - the internet exists, mobile phones exists, you even had their pictures on the tv news, you know what Michael looks like. The execution of a pretty poor 'torch bearing lynch mob' getting the wrong man idea just doesn't work on any level - just ask Ben Tramer about that.Laurie takes a break - she's never even in the same building in Michael, although I did like the daughter getting a bit tougher and taking more control and I guess she was pretty sedated in the original sequel.The ending - why didn't anybody H20 it and chop his head off?Over all if chunks of the film didn't seem like they let Rob Zombie have another go and the characters hadn't all lost common sense, then this could have been a great addition - there are plenty of good bits to keep you going to the end and I'm sure I'll still watch it every October, however those good bits do make you think - 'if only the whole movie was like that.'I'm hoping this was a 'filler' film because it had to be a three movie deal and the final (will it be though?) one go back to the first of the reboots standards.P. S. - you can easily turn this into a drinking game with the amount of times 'evil dies tonight' is said.",Halloween Kills
430,bobbyem-1,"""Kills"" is right - but not much more",5,19 October 2021,"So I liked the previous movie well enough but there where some pretty silly stuff in there. Like the psycho doctor and the pod-casters that clearly didn't know what a podcast was.That said the music was great, the kills where pretty effective.In part two there seems like the creators have heard the talk about Michael Myers not being as ""fun"" of a killer as Jason and really turned up the gore.At times it feels more like this movie is Michael Myers show reel for serial killer of the year awards, more than an actual movie.That isn't bad but the movie has no plot and just tries to find any excuse for having a scene where Myers kills some really useless person.They really turned up the stupid in this movie. Characters are pretty much suicidal, trying to fight Myers with something as little as a fruit knife at times...
It is a more entertaining movie than all the ghost-crap that is made in droves but still - could be much better.",Halloween Kills

You can even like some of the sequels, I mean just like them! But thankfully, after a year of lives only matter riots, and other riots, we get a movie that says mob violence actually doesn't solve anything. That's better than what Our Dear Leader 2021 has to say. As a movie, what the heck is wrong? I like it. The one dimensional character from the 70's, 80's is back and doing what he did back then. It wasn't the gibberish that Halloween 2 the 2nd was, and that was gruesomely watchable. It being Halloween 3 the 2nd it was much better than Halloween 2 the first. Are we really talking characters, because everyone can tell me the complete character profiles from the 1st, which was a great horror film. 'Hey, I like beer, I like getting nude.' characterization from the 1st movie done! Micheal was such a rich character. ""Ugh me kill."" Done. It was fun. This was fun. It's just a movie.

434,iceman-johnson,"I guess everyone's entitled to one good scare, huh?",3,20 October 2021,"I was really never a fan of the halloween movies, the first one, yeah, maybe the second. I felt it had run its course as a serious scary franchise as anything after was just garbage (im looking at you paul rudd and busta rhymes) There's only so much you can do with the story before it becomes stale and repetitive. But i alway give them a watch.This halloween movie brings back michael and friends jumping off from the last one when laurie and co have trapped michael in the basement of her house and setting it on fire.Is it scary and filled with tension, no
is it just a splatter fest with a terrible storyline ? Absolutely.This movie lives by its title and goes balls to the wall with kills.Remember when michael was super stealthy and only killed one or two people at a time?? Forget that, he's now neo from the matrix, taking on ten firemen alone and snuffing out gangs of fully grown adults at a time with ease. Remember when michael would hide in the shadows like a ninja? Pffft ,forget that, now michael just smashes the bathroom light if he's caught, now you cant see him, that's good enough i suppose,he is getting on a bit so i'll let him off.The plot of this film is so predictable you don't have to see it to know what's gonna happen and The people who star in this film are basically just meat and are only on screen to get butchered and i'm not gonna lie i quite enjoyed it.But a few things bugged me a little, like laurie, we get it, she was in the original and brought back for the fans but i still cant stand her. The movie is clearly aimed at teens so let the teens in the movie figure out how to kill michael it's a bit cringey having a baddass pensioner tagging along. Also the boyfriend with the big nostrils.. i felt very uncomfortable sitting there with his nostrils flaring up every so often it was very off putting. Apart from that it's alright
Like i said i was never really a fan of the halloween movies so not gonna dig into it and rip it apart but over the years i have watched pretty much seen all of them, i grew up around them being released and watched them on good ol pirate vhs and eventually in the cinema ....even the paul rudd and busta rhymes ones!..ughhhh... And tbh this is far better than almost all of them, you have stalker kills, straight up frenzy kills ,crazy townspeople doing dumb things so our psycho has lots to do and a bit of backstory for the fan base that doesn't stray far off from the original to keep them interested.There was always something happening in this and it kept the movie going even if most of it was stupid and at some points annoying. I mean come on, this movie isn't out to win any awards, it's a halloween film, it's meant to be ""scary"" and gory and overall fun, nobody cares if the lore isn't 100% or the cast are any good at acting. Ive seen alot of ""fans"" of the franchise getting mad and saying it was horrible and it doesn't do the original justice ....do i really have to remind you about the paul rudd ones and how bats**t they were?Overall this is a standard halloween movie.it's nothing special and will not go down in history as a classic. Its rewatchability is purely dependent on fans but for anybody else it's going to be forgotten and classed as another done to death horror film. Not bad for horror film but not brilliant either.",Halloween Kills

437,Cox-Rocker,Evil is reviewed tonight!,10,17 October 2021,"I saw Halloween Kills Friday, October 15th on the big screen. I also saw 2018 in theaters, and I loved it at first watch. Ever since then, this has been a highly anticipated watch and it did NOT disappoint. This was an ambitious, well written, and devastatingly brutal entry in the highly beloved Halloween franchise. This film mixes nostalgia of the original, new directions and ideas for the series, and Michael Myers at his most terrifying and ruthless potential to deliver an impactful watch for fans.As Halloween (2018) showcased the effect and trauma Michael Myers had on Laurie Strode and her family, Halloween Kills demonstrates the effect and trauma he has on the entire town. Similar to Halloween II (1981) Laurie is sidelined in a hospital as Michael Myers continues his slaughter-fest rampage across Haddonfield. The town bands together in hopes of tracking down the psycho to end his reign of terror for good.What really surprised me was how potent the writing was. You really feel the hold Michael has on everybody. The movie has a theme of showing how toxic mob mentality is and how Michael turned Haddonfield into animals, just like he is. There's some genuinely sad moments present throughout, one involving a mental patient that is truly upsetting to watch. The performances are strong too. They really fleshed out characters from the previous film. Cameroon, Hawkins, the Sheriff, it was nice seeing them get more screen time and it adds to the small town community effect of the film. They also brought back a lot of characters from the original such as Tommy, Lindsey, Lonnie, and Nurse Chambers. They were all a welcome return.Of course there's the whole reason we're here, the titan and horror legend himself, Michael Myers. This is one of the best iterations of the character we've seen. From beginning to end he is just savage. We get some of his best kills and some of the best gore in the franchise here. My favorite moment was in the beginning when he emerges out of Laurie's burning house like a demon straight from Hell and battles a whole crew of firefighters. It was a spine chilling moment and super exhilarating. Watching Michael in this definitely validates the title, Halloween Kills.This movie, like the previous one, heavily relies on the legacy of the original to boost the story but I think it worked well again. On top of the characters returning, there's a flashback scene towards the beginning of the movie that has to be one of the best sequences in the whole franchise. We get other references throughout the movie like quotes and little moments the mirrors others throughout the series. We even get more Silver Shamrock action which is huge brownie points from me.Halloween Kills was a definite treat to see on the big screen and I urge you to see it in a theater for your first viewing as opposed to streaming it on Peacock because you won't get the same effect. It's a great center piece to the modern Halloween trilogy and I'm immensely hyped for Halloween Ends, I really hope they stick the landing. The whole point of the modern string of Halloween movies is to show Michael is truly evil incarnate, and they nailed it. It's definitely among my top 6 maybe even top 5 favorites of the series. I can't get wait to own it on Blu-Ray.",Halloween Kills
438,MadMark96,Most anti climactic movie ever made.,4,25 October 2021,Don't think this was necessary at all. Feels like it should've just been part of the last one. It feels all over the place at times and only exists to build up the next movie. Doesn't add anything to the plot of the movies. The ending was extremely stupid even by horror movie standards. It was fun to see in the theaters with my buddy but I really doubt I'm ever gonna watch it again.,Halloween Kills

440,kobrakai-1,"Lives up to its title, but still a step down from the 2018 reboot.",7,15 October 2021,"Most of the reviews are pretty accurate on this one. There is tons of gore here, making this easily the most brutal film in the franchise (yes, even more so than Rob Zombie's Halloween II). Michael Myers is as sadistic and menacing as he's ever been, and if that's all you're looking for then you are bound to be happy with this movie. The pacing is fast and engaging, and there's even a few flashback scenes that are incredibly well put together, complete with a banger of a soundtrack that hearkens back quite a bit to the 1978 classic.On the flipside, the film clearly suffers from being a ""bridge"" to get us from Halloween 2018 to Halloween Ends next year. There's not much of a story to be had and Laurie takes a back seat in the film for Anthony Michael Hall's Tommy Doyle, who pulls a Halloween 4 and riles up a mob to hunt down Michael Myers. There's some social commentary to be had here about the damage a mob mentality can cause, but it just isn't balanced out all that well with the absolute gorefest this movie is. The ending also suffers from the fact that we already know a follow up film is in production, so it was bound to end on a cliffhanger. The problem is that said cliffhanger isn't just sudden, but it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense.It's still a film worth watching if you're a fan of the franchise, and it's certainly still better than most of the Halloween sequels, just don't expect it to top Halloween 2018.",Halloween Kills

(To be honest, Halloween 1 and 2 from Rob Zombie was ten times more gorier and brutal than this one) The way Myers looks with the burned mask is cool! He looks more frightening! Again, i am disappointed with the killings! The acting from some actors/actress was mediocre! The suspense was okay, the soundtrack was good, the cinematography was okay and some surprises! Overall an entertaining slasher movie but my opinion still remain that Rob Zombie's Halloween 1(especially this one) and 2 are better than this in matter of violence and gore! It is Michael freaking Myers, for freaking sake! If you make a movie about and with him, make it gorier and violent so he can really deserve his image of being a gruesome serial unstoppable killer! 7 stars from me!",Halloween Kills
443,WYLION-SOTIRISKING,WYLION - This was definitely a killer,7,7 November 2021,"When watching these films you need to ask yourself. Do you want more story or do you want it to be like the first?

444,hellostranger-32317,Absolutely horrible.,1,16 October 2021,"I'm a huge horror fan.And this is just the worst sequel. Ever.They're all about bringing in old characters for the ""nostalgic"" feel, just to instantly kill them off. There is no character development, no emotional connections to any of the new and older characters, they're just there for a body count for Michael.Laurie, Jamie Lee Curtis, is barely in the movie, and her daughter Karen, Judy Greer, takes on the role of being the heroine who hunts down Michael Myers.The movie is frustrating in many senses, but the main one being everyone in the film is educated on Michael Myers and his history, and yet, no one seems to take the history lesson that stabbing and shooting him NEVER works.So at the end when Karen thinks she has her big victory because the entire town shows up and surrounds him with knives and hockey sticks, it's more infuriating to the viewers watching and screaming at their televisions to just, ""chop off his head"" than it is to her when she just stabs him in the neck and calls it a day and then he ends up killing her and everyone around them.If you want a good suspenseful serial killer, give him realistic obstacles that he can get through regardless instead of doing something idiotic like stabbing him once and expecting him to be dead.",Halloween Kills
445,OwensDad1,Disappointed,7,18 October 2021,"My initial rating here is a 7. That be more for nostalgia than the actual film. I truly enjoyed the first hour plus but then, man, I don't know what went wrong. I love Michael Myers. I can sit and watch any & all of the films with enjoyment. They're certainly not all good and some, are truly bad. (I'm looking at you Halloween 6). This one left me feeling hollow, almost empty. I love Halloween (2018). I know it has its detractors but I really think it's the best sequel of the bunch by a mile. The ending was perfect. I had no idea how Michael was going to survive but knew he would. This one, I don't know how you justify his survival here. Shot, stabbed, beaten with bats, stabbed again, beaten again, shot again. Somehow he keeps getting up? He's able to get back into the house and kill Karen? The ending, really the last 20 or so minutes, were not good. I feel as though the filmmakers really ruined what had been a great retcon. I can't see where they go from here. If we get the cult bs or 'he's more than a human' garbage that we got in Halloween 6, I will be utterly disappointed and truly ticked off.",Halloween Kills

I enjoyed the gory kills. If you're a die hard Michael Myers fan, then you'll love this movie. The flashback scenes, the soundtrack, and the mob scene was great. My theater was packed on Friday night, and people gasped everytime there was a kill. It was such a great time! Definitely deserves a higher score. So I'm giving it a 9/10.",Halloween Kills
447,big_c_boss,Panderfest 2021,3,15 October 2021,"Firstly, The best thing about this movie was Dr. Loomis being brought back to the screen. Even though the voice impersonator was terrible.Now, On to a Halloween Sequel that makes Part 6 look like part 1.Everything from the lines, to the cameos, to the easter eggs are nothing but pandering. The Filmmaker's may say it's Homage, but in the end, they didn't even try. So much is senseless.For example, The Townspeople coming together to fight for their town. I'm sure it was meant to be inspirational, on some level, before they fail in everyway possible. But, it was insanely hamfisted, cheesy and laughable. In a Hands Across America way.This movie made me laugh more than a good stand up routine.Plus, there was a Flashback to 1978 and a subplot that did nothing.But, As always, it's good to see Michael doing what he does best, even though the story has really sucked in the past two movies.",Halloween Kills

Thanks Michael for taking care the problem of overpopulation killing the useless. You're just not understood.Anyway, you can't take it seriously. I enjoyed because I was with a friend and we laughed at the stupidity of the script, but the movie is just a terrible mess, even for a slasher.Watch it with friends and for laughs because is good comedy.",Halloween Kills

450,tikitim-76520,Not the best but not the worst.,7,16 October 2021,First off I can understand why some people gave it much lower ratings. The script wasn't the best and some of the acting wasn't that great. I also didn't really find it particularly scary though it did have some jump scare moments. What I did really enjoy the most was the '70s vibe it gave and was reminiscent of the original movie in some ways. I also really enjoyed seeing the original actors. I give it a seven more for the nostalgia aspect of it and it did have very good production values and great kills.,Halloween Kills
451,floydianever,NOT for the aficionados I warn you,4,18 October 2021,"The film quality almost captured the dark, shadowy feel of the first and the special effects to resurrect an old friend were beautiful (won't say who but you'll know). However after the first hour it wasn't like ANYTHING John Carpenter or the subsequent directors gave us in terms of FEAR, & typical Michael violence, this film turned into a watered down, cotton candied made for tv ""blood bubble bath"" complete with a ""the real monsters were we"" narration over the ending scenes by Jamie Lee Curtis who was barely in the film let alone ACTUALLY confronted Michael herself AT ALL.It's obvious this an attempt to reinvent the franchise for the new generation but everything that makes the old franchise great, the underlying dread & inherent fear of just the legend in which Laurie was the target because she was his sister have been reduced to just random killing of whoever gets in his way and the supernatural connection to Samhain eliminated.Sorry but Malak Akkad is the real murderer of the pearl of John Carpenters masterpiece and his own family's legacy.

455,jasonklingensmith,What 2018 should have been.,8,21 October 2021,"As a lifelong fan of this franchise, I was thoroughly disappointed by the 2018, for a number of reasons. I mean disappointed to the point, I considered skipping this movie entirely.The first 10-15 minutes of this movie were pure Halloween gold, and sucked me right in. The pacing was great, and I couldn't help but wish this was where they had begun 2018, instead of the ridiculous, and completely unrealistic opening they went with.While this movie wasn't without it's flaws, most of those flaws were the things I expect from a slasher anyway. Poorly written dialogue, to the point of being unintentionally hilarious at times. Characters making stupid decisions, and things like that.The few things I didn't like about this movie were the scenes involving Laurie and her daughter. I found myself getting annoyed every time they went back to them at the hospital. While Greer and Curtis are both phenomenal actresses, they were both terrible in this. That's likely due, at least in part, to poor writing.The scenes following Tommy Doyle, Lindsay, and company, were great. Seeing the original Sheriff Brackett return was great. I do think both the firefighter scene and the angry mob scene when Michael fights back both would have been more effective having not been seen. And it's a bit ridiculous that a skinny 17 year old girl was somehow able to put up a better fight than a dozen firefighters with axes.All in all though, this was was an enjoyable ride, with great pacing, and at un-did some of the ridiculousness of the 2018 film. If you're a Halloween fan, a Michael Myers fan, or a slasher fan, I recommend giving it a go.",Halloween Kills
456,geno-young,"Heavy on shock, light on scares. But it kinda works...",6,19 October 2021,"So I just got out of the theater and these are my thoughts upon first glance (I'm gonna watch it again on Peacock on Halloween). Overall there were parts that I felt were very well-done. It was mean-spirited, brutal, ugly and in-your-face for no reason, which I kinda like. But I didn't find it particularly scary. For me there are five types of horror movies: Scary with blood (Scream, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street, F13), Scary with no blood ('78 Halloween, original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) Not scary at all (Paranormal Activity), Torture Porn (RZ H1/H2, Saw) and what I call Jump-Scare-Porn (""It"" 2017 Remake/most modern horror).Upon first watch, this would fall into the Not Scary at all category minus about two or three scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love it and I think that there were some really powerful moments, but I think the only truly terrifying moments in the film were Lindsey's chase scene in the woods, the car scene and Lonnie, his son and the girl in the house towards the end. Sure, there were tense/anxious moments throughout, but for the most part as soon as I saw a character I could size-up whether they were gonna live or die with the exception of a small handful. Also, I personally thought the gore was a little over-the-top and Jason-esque and defied the decorum that most non-Zombie Halloween films had in regards to Michael's Kills. Sometimes less is more artistic (like '78), but I did like it though.I see a lot of remarks about the acting, personally I think the acting was compelling, but MANY of the characters were stupid, made unrealistic choices, wasted their ammo and essentially BEGGED for death. The mob was dumb (like most mobs), but they didn't bug me as much as they did other people. But for me it's worth noting that out of the hundreds of horror films I've seen, this is the first time that I've EVER walked out of the theater actually feeling bad for some of the characters. I think they did a really good job showing how generations had been destroyed by this Evil, and how a new generation has now been dealt the same fate times 100! I've never empathized with horror characters before now, so I give them a 10/10 in the area of character development/emotional content.I think a lot of people's problems stem from
their preconceptions of the franchise which keeps them from fully understanding what these films offer. I'm not going to lie, when I first saw 2018 I thought it was incredible. But over time I've noticed different things in it that I particularly don't care for. When I first saw it I said it was a 10/10, now for me it feels more like a solid 6.5/10. This film is the reverse, I see things I don't like now, but I just know they're gonna grow on me with time in reverse of the previous installment. I think this one's story wasn't as neat as 2018, but it's LIGHTYEARS more complex and compelling. I actually walked out with empathy towards that small town and particularly Allyson watching her boyfriend get destroyed in front of her. Instead of empathy for my favorite movie monster. That has NEVER, and I do mean, NEVER happen to me before.Lastly, I couldn't help but feel really, REALLY moved by seeing Dr. Loomis on screen again after so long. Even though it was prosthetic, it hit me just how much his elegance really added to the Halloween franchise. We've missed that, and for me it was touching to see after so long. In a movie full of tricks, THAT was the treat.If you've read this far, thanks. The rant's over. 😆6.8/10See you next Halloween...Michael. 🎃🔪",Halloween Kills
457,kperakis,Why???,3,25 October 2021,"Another fine example of a movie that need not have been produced. Halloween's moto was ""no blood"". Original thrills, nice twists, nice plot, and of course a magnificent sound track. Halloween Kills, kills everything but the soundtrack. The music is still nice. But this is as far as it goes. A needless splatter, which unfortunately after having poor Michael shot 5 times, stabbed even more across his body, and beaten with baseballs bats, crowbars etc. Etc., leaves promises for what probably will be yet another worse remake / title in the series. Would be better off watching the original title once more.",Halloween Kills

461,kardayathomas,A bad movie,4,15 October 2021,"I so wanted to like this movie, but it just didn't happen for me. I can not recommend this film. Essentially It's a horror movie that's not scary or very suspenseful. The story does have its moments but unfortunately it sucks more often than not.The stuff set in 1978 is for the most part pretty good, probably the best part about the movie. The acting is such that at times you can tell that the actors are trying their best but the sincerity is just not there, they obviously do not believe in the garbage written in the script.The ending is absolutely ridiculous, several of the townspeople gather around Michael Myers and go all out, attacking, shooting, stabbing and beating him down. Then he jumps up and kills them all... so stupid. They turned Myers into nothing more than one of the 80's rip offs of Halloween, and that being Jason Voorhees.In the 2018 film I liked that they tried to keep it a bit more grounded in reality. My only issue with that film was the stupid storyline that Michael's psychiatrist was the villain because of his obsession with trying to get him to speak. When I read the book Taking Shape it brought out that the psychiatrist scene was pretty much universally despised. I'm mentioning this because the ending for this film is that bad.And they bring back characters from the original just to throw them into the meat grinder of a High body count but a pointless story.That being said this is no where's as bad as Rob Zombie's Halloween 2, a painfully horrible movie to sit through and that movie nearly killed the franchise. I fear that if the next film sucks worst than Halloween Kills, than a franchise ender it might be and earning its name Halloween Ends.Halloween Kills a franchise.Halloween Ends a franchise.",Halloween Kills

After 20 mins it starts to descend into a seriously boring follow on and I do wonder what these writers are being paid for. Jamie Lee Curtis is hardly there and spends the whole film in a hospital room giving voice overs about Michael. There's too much camp comedy, you shouldn't laugh so much during a horror, it take away the intensity. The woman doctor and the male nurse dressed up.. doctor then dies by killing herself with her own gun, it's slap stick at this point, is this Scary Movie? Then the gay guys...ok, this is being shown in a way that the audience are laughing at stereotypes...big John, little John, sappy music and sappy photo... laugh laugh says the audience and ooops they're dead, the gays deserved it for being so, well, gay, suggests the narrative. And the mob after Michael that wasn't even Michael, a social commentary on mob mentally, i.e. Those that protest anything in real life are...wrong, 10 mins wasted just to get that point across, zzzzzz. Then the end where they're all after Michael, trying to throw nostalgia in your face that the old characters come together to kill him, how many times do they need to say ""evil dies tonight""? Really poor writing as a whole, points for the first 20 mins. Nice set up for the next one though; Jamie Lee Curtis sets out to kill Michael cause he killed her daughter, who'd have thought it...?",Halloween Kills

Sadly a lot of people have failed to understand what was being portrayed in this bridge (it is the mid part of a trilogy after all) and seemingly have no idea about 3 Act structure which these films are seemingly also performing as a whole as well as within their stories.I guess the low reviews are from people who just wanted 100 minutes of Stalk/Slash/Kill and they didnt understand the rest of the story so scored it low.You have to use your brains when watching this, the challenges of the police, families, the townspeople and how they are affected by everything that is going on around them. If you are here for 100 minutes of meaningless death then you wont figure out what is going on in front of you - sadly that actually backs up some of the social commentary that is made in this film.

While the motifs and franchise nods continue and increase, as does the hyper-violence, the emotional impact is much, much different in ""Kills.""A handful of cheese-dicky monologues, black comedy, fan service and callbacks, great set pieces, revenge, hysteria, potential sociopolitical subtext, and even a random scene of mental health-related heartbreak. This one will polarize fans, both casual and diehard genre freaks. But, what would you expect from a reimagining of an iconic, forty year old franchise, already skewed by a disjointed series of sequels? Don't take it too seriously.Halloween '78 and the original 1981 sequel are two of my all time favorite films. They will stand solid and adored, regardless of any of the films that followed.

I left the movie with the feel that this couldve been something more, something bigger than it is. I was still entertained as hell. The score, the effects and cinematography are great. The flashback sequences were great too. I got no complaints on the technical side.Some of my favorite kills in the entire series happened in this movie. They really nailed that aspect here. The characters that got killed, however, really lacked in the intelligence department. I am used to this trope through the years, but in this movie, i was struggling to ignore it.With the movie ending as it did, i am very excited for the final installment. Hope we can put a good ending to this entertaining ride. If you are a fan of the franchise, this is a must see. If not, dont expect that much.

Logic out the window Michael Myers now in his 60's still has the strength of 10 men, tired and contrived with a predictable set up for yet another sequel. I really wanted to like this movie as in films of this genre non of the survivors effectively dispatch Michael to his demise, no decapitation and chopping his hands off and putting them in cement.I know taste is subjective I'm saddened by the 9 and 10 star reviews Hollywood is clearly out of new ideas I actually liked the 2018 film and was happy if it actually ended there. This film lacked anything that even the worst Halloween sequels and terrible Rob Zombie remakes (taste is subjective). It lacks Style or imagination and none of the characters make sure Michael Myers is dead. Chop his hands off and his head of and bury them in wet cement.

Michael Myers is once again set loose upon the town of Haddonfield and leaves a trail of brutal violence along his way back to his childhood home.The madness of the night amplifies when vengeful town folk form together to hunt Myers down after news has broke out of his murder spree earlier that evening.The film has many amazing qualities that far outweigh the negative. I'm speaking particularly of the recreated flashback sequences to halloween night 1978. I felt like I was watching long lost footage of an alternate ending to the original film. It was delicious.The music score was scary and added strong elements of tension. I believe the music was far more effective this time around than the previous entry's.The actor portraying the shape is outstanding in his movements and the actor who portrayed the 1978 shape was just as impressive.The kills were very creative however my one biggest disappointment was in how graphic and disturbing they were portrayed. Violence of such a depiction makes me very uncomfortable, but thats just me. I really felt bad for the victims in this entry.The movie has elements of heart that Miss Judy Greer brings. We get a deeper exploration into her character and she really brings alot to the table this time around.The acting was very good and executed very passionately by some of it's cast. Even with the often atrocious dialogue they have to work with.If you're looking for a spooky night at the movies for this time of year, I definitely recommend checking this out.But be warned.

479,danstevon,Halloween Kills and Kills,7,16 October 2021,"It would seem even the Halloween franchise isn't able to avoid all the political correctness of 2021's woke generation.SPOILERS AHEAD!First of all, the original Halloween is possibly my favourite movie of all time. Halloween Kills actually gives me a bit more of that - flashbacks, and to be fair the scenes set on Halloween 1978 are excellent. Maybe they should've made the whole new trilogy set in 1978. The only problem would be Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously not 17 anymore. Hats off to the Loomis scenes (I guess they've used the deep fake stuff).The kills are pretty good, although I read we were promised a lot more and i think I only counted 4 that weren't in the trailer (and I'm not sure if the last one was really or imaginary - it definitely felt like it was added in the give us one final jump).Onto the things I didn't like.Tommy Doyle. I just didn't like the character. Lynsey on the other hand was pretty good but vanished halfway through the film. Jamie Leigh Curtis follows the current trend of trailers making you think the character has a massive part to play when in fact she's almost a narrator in the film, explaining stuff to try and drive the (very thin) story along.Some very implausible moments that even watch a horror film where you have to suspend belief are just silly and contrived. The police were virtually nowhere to be seen the whole film, while the townsfolk drive round with guns and bats...The storyline with big John and little John living in the Myers house seems forced to included diversity, a single mom with a child would've probably been a lot more terrifying, although for someone who is ""pure evil"" Michael seems to have a no kids die rule.The trouble with Halloween Kills is despite the fact there's a lunatic on the loose there doesn't seem to be any immediate danger... he just goes from house to house killing but it's filmed in a way you know what's coming 30 seconds before it happens.To make Halloween truly scary you have to go back and find the secret that John Carpenter found 40+ years ago, but I don't think that's possible. It'd be interesting to get someone who can do period films to make one set back in the 70's and rely on what you feel more than what you see.So, is Halloween Kills good? Yes. If you like the franchise and know what you're getting. If not then you'll probably be a bit confused what's going on.I did get a kick out of the nod to De Palma's Dressed To Kill that they threw in though.EDIT: watched it again last night with a friend who hadn't seen it.

Don't get me wrong... 2018 was competent and totally decent... I just wasn't knocked over by it.This movie however... is an animal unto itself. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. There's a dark, and gritty realism to these chapters that somehow give it a brand new flavor. If the last version was a hot sauce... this would be its hardcore, older, ghost pepper flavored cousin.It was gory, chaotic, and relentless. There were some side story arcs I totally wasn't expecting.

Every other character just acts in the most stupid way possible. I was prepared for this to be not so great but not prepared for the utter garbage I watched. There is so much going on with absolutely no scares no tension nothing. Honestly I'm afraid for Halloween Ends and not in an actively frightened way.,Halloween Kills
485,raphaelridwan,"Please stop making this movie, i have enough of this stupidity!!!!",1,15 October 2021,"All the characters in this movie are weak, stupid, no brainer, coward, and easily die. While the bad guy is very clever, very strong, very tough, very lucky, very skillfull, very fast (even though he never runs), very quiet, and can not die. Maybe michael's real name is clark kent.So stupid!!!",Halloween Kills
486,nathanhogan-58651,So many ways the film could have been better,1,17 October 2021,"Many others have pointed out the flaws and the overly gratuitous violence in this film so here I how I think changing some things could have made a better movie.1) Why introduce 2 additional missing convicts if you arent going to use them for anything? Dropping one off the hospital was pointless and took up a good half hour of movie time showing him being chased pointlessly, a better use would be for a switcheroo with one of them getting Michael's mask and then dying to the mob setting up a twist comeback.2) Kill off the daughter and granddaughter, Jamie Lee Curtis spent the movie going on and on about why Michael Kills, which is pointless he is just evil, when she should have been getting ready to kick some ass again. While her daughter is killed in the final scene it's too late to save the movie, this film needed him to kill off her family early on and then have us follow her coming to terms with their loss and planning her revenge.3) The violence was too random, the film needed more suspense and fear of violence rather then the hack and slash we got, in the older movies it was scarier to know he was nearby and hunting them then watching him catch them.4) The flashback scenes were pointless and confusing, they have written and rewritten the events of the original Halloween movie too many times, it's becoming too difficult to keep the story straight. In future attempts to reboot the franchise they should concentrate on the first two movies which make up the first Halloween night and take it from there.5) We needed more creative ways of the heroes trying to stop Michael, in the last film they did a few like running him over or burning him but we needed more of that variety in this one, drowning, freezing or even dropping him off the hospital instead of the poor random convict, any of those would have been better then people constantly stabbing or shooting michael and nothing happening.Just my few thoughts, either way the movie is 1/10.",Halloween Kills
487,mythicalsecreat,Worst movie ever,1,17 October 2021,"I think this franchise should stop embarrassing themselves, it's terrible from year to year obviously it's getting worst , terrible characters predictable performance icy on the cake is you get bored after 5mins this move is a no for me BIG no.",Halloween Kills
488,Joshumms,Same old same old,5,16 October 2021,"2018's Halloween was a big surprise for me, it had a modern style and some genuinely awesome kills with great offscreen deaths that were able to make up for the laughable story. The issue with the new one is that the kills aren't anymore impressive than the last one but the plot is even worse. The effect of seeing Myers in a modern setting has worn off in this movie and it just feels like filler that is leading up to the final entry. I wouldn't have a problem with this if the kills improved upon the last one. Additionally, the movie goes to new heights of silliness that makes Myers a little too comical and the pacing makes the movie boring at some points. The climax is super boring especially, it is very anticlimactic and feels rushed to finish the movie and then continue it in the last one. Overall I would say it's still fun to watch at times, the music is still excellent as always but it feels more like a basic slasher than 2018's Halloween.",Halloween Kills
489,dennisforbes,More believable as a spoof,2,17 October 2021,"If this were presented as a spoof of the genre, Flanderizing the absolute worst tendencies of the genre and the shallow, idiotic characters that exist in the universe, it would be more credible.Just horrendous. The original Halloween was such a simple exposition on the genre, yet somehow it has descended to this utter tripe.",Halloween Kills
490,crazyferret-03421,Micheal is back,7,16 October 2021,"Ok I know a lot of people are hating this. But this is one mama opinion. It was great and plan to watch it again. It was great seeing the actors and actresses from the 1978 original. Micheal Myers rivals Jason Vorhees in kill counts. And it's apparent he is no man, but pure evil. And continues his reign of terror in haddonfield. The prologue fills in a few gaps from the 1978 ending. And of course the so called demise in the 2017 Halloween. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as the resilient survivor Laurie Strode. As well as Nancy Stephens, Charles Cyphers, and Kyle Richards from the 1978 Original. We have to pretend Halloween 2 and the other sequels do not exist. And I want to even forget the Rob Zombie versions. Can I recommend Halloween kills? Yes. And now looking forward to
The next one. Just hope they don't fool us like they did with Friday the 13th part 4.",Halloween Kills
491,josephbarros-16407,The Empire Strikes Back In The Halloween Trilogy,9,15 October 2021,Critics have a history of not enjoying horror movies much like they dont like action movies. Fact is if I listened to critics then half of the movies that I like that they dont I wouldnt have seen. Halloween Kills is like the Empire Strikes Back in the trilogy in terms of the heroins Laurie and her daughter and granddaughter thinking they got rid of michael myers only for the killer to survive and go on a rampage of revenge. The mob mentality wanting to put a stop to the menacing force that thrives on brutality and murder. I enjoyed it and looking forward to Halloween Ends next year.,Halloween Kills
492,natepauley,Slasher Friendly,7,16 October 2021,"While it arguably doesn't meet the heights set by its predecessor; it nevertheless is a welcome adaption to its Michael Myers anthology.It serves a handful of gore and cinematic delight any fan would come to expect. However, the ""boogeyman"" emphasis is worn out, and I don't see how anyone would collectively make a decision to count the number of times ""evil dies tonight"" is dialogued, it's theme which is heavily overcompensated to which it, quite frankly, just becomes irritating.Curtis is also basically absent from the film, and beyond being a titular character in its franchise - doesn't necessarily negate why she is listed as the main character.However, it's still better than any of its retconned movies and sets the tone for what may be a third adaption all devotees will be excited for.",Halloween Kills

494,gabaod2,This isnt halloween this is a lifetime flim.. but worse,3,16 October 2021,"Man.. being a huge fan of the franchise since i was a wee little lad... this has to be the worst halloween film to include michael myers as we all know halloween 3 is the worst in the franchise. This has lost the main feel of what it means to be a halloween film. Including the basic sounds does not constitute this as a halloween film. Very sad day to see this as this series was really the best out of the main 80s horror series that have evolved. Did you not learn how friday the 13th sequels or nightmare on elm st sequels failed? Dont try to reinvent films from the 80s to 2020.. as the kids dont care about all the past films to bring this franchise to what its known for. You need to pay attention that the people who will care about this film are at least 35+ and thus make it appealing to them, bring it to a true slasher style not some new age this is boring with unappealing character development. Halloween only cares about 3-4 characters the rest we dont give one rats about so dont develop them. This will be categorized as another halloween 3 that failed to fulfill what it means to be michael myers film.",Halloween Kills
495,gabaod2,franchises need to learn what their audiences want,3,16 October 2021,"Why are all these franchises lately think they can reinvent the old to the younger generations thinking they will care about their future films??? To try and make Halloween in current day and style affairs is absurd just like Disney trying to reinvent Star Wars for the new generations. Anyone who was initially drawn in to any of these franchises from the late 70s and early 80s need to realize if youre going to keep expanding on the idea make it appeal to those who are in their 40-50s but remind them of their past from the 80s etc. Trying to recreate them in todays world to appeal to your initial following will never work. Come up with new ideas if you want to entice the 10-20 year olds, but if you want to expand on old ideas make it appealing to the older generations as any 15 year old who watches this wont give a hoot about the past 8+ films.",Halloween Kills

No tension, no atmosphere just badly directed murders. The opening sequence at the burning house and the finale look like youtube quality fan films. I like David Gordon Green, he's made lots of good stuff. Same with Danny McBride but, they suck at horror. They understand the surface level stuff with Halloween, the music, the head cocking after a kill but, its only surface level. The movie is like a cheap knock off. Please let this series die. Its been rubbish since the early 80's and this is a contender for the worst of the series.",Halloween Kills

500,Selaer_1989,Umm NO,2,20 October 2021,I am so glad I was able to watch this at home rather than paying to go watch in the theater . Fans have waited 2 years for a new Halloween movie and unfortunately this was such a disappointment. The movie is not real meaning plot but c'mon MM had this superpower to kill it was so not realistic in many ways . & the ending ?? Seriously 😒... The ending I am so disappointed 😔!I've seen much better .,Halloween Kills
501,SnekDok,i kept looking at the doorway....HOPING Michael was waiting there to kill me.,2,26 October 2021,"... alas he was not and I had to suffer this crapfrest.There are TWO great parts to this film, I have one star for each.Michael Meyers (and the actor that plays him)MusicThey make Meyers very brutal and really show his ""super naturalness"". The actor shows it well considering its all body movement and he's genuinely scary to see in front of you. The addition that MOST of the victims dont even bother to beg to live helps show how much everyone believes they're forked...or knifed.I doubt that lack of begging was intentional though because the writing is horrid. I can't decide whats worse, the acting or the writing. I don't really care like a lot of people seem to that Curtis spends most of the movie int he hospital... shes actually kinda cringey to watch in the recent films. But damn the main hooligan looking guy with a bat that yells ""evil dies tonight"" a million times out of place is so hard to watch. His lines are terrible, he delivers them terrible and none of it is even remotely engaging.The same trickles down to the mob of civilians, the acting all around is just atrocious. The scenes and lines are repetitive and make no sense, even for a horror flick.Feels like a bunch of ideas strung together and none of them play out or were thought out. Just filler to allow Michael to go around killing... which would be fine if they didnt try and make it mean something.Very disappointed as a franchise fan.",Halloween Kills
502,iagardner,Missed opportunity,4,21 October 2021,"Feel like they missed on this one. Story was horrible. Jamie was barely in the movie it felt like. I did enjoy how they tied some characters in from 1978 but ruined that pretty quickly. Highlight of the film was seeing Loomis. But even that scene didn't make sense really. The hospital scene was just silly. Really thought that short guy was Michael Meyers? Idk just horrible ending as well. I get that there's another one on the way, but 20 people pull up with weapons yet he finds a way..just lost all faith in green and McBride and I love these guys. Just felt like maybe they didn't need to make a second film? Acting was atrocious all around honestly. Editing seemed off, just felt rushed and empty with no plot all in one ball. Going to take a lot for me to watch the final installment. Doesn't help that Curtis came out already and said fans will hate the final film. Spoiler much? I could have told her it was going to be bad.",Halloween Kills
503,davegfrancis,Stinks but doesn't linger,5,15 October 2021,"Disappointing to say the least is the latest installment of the Halloween franchise. Myers to me was all about the presence and foreshadowing rather than the gore we've become accustomed to and again I feel this team of creators have missed the boat trying to capture it. The entire plot relies on the stupidity of people in order to make it nothing more than Michael returning to his childhood home and still we don't know his motivation and have a good explanation after so many years now! Couple that with an abysmal parallel story of another escaped mental patient and probably the most ridiculous hospital chase sequence put on film and you've got a movie that neither satisfies a franchise fan or delivers on the promise of making a truly memorable and or remarkable standout film within the many Halloween installments.The positives are few, the new mask is fantastic, the music is on point and some of the creative kills are interesting and well executed (pardon the pun). The negatives, the fight sequences are a bit lame, the narrative is tired and the character choices within it are beyond stupid. So few are those memorable moments of Michael stalking his prey, in fact the most successful sequence in the film is that very thing and yet the writers continually opted for the reverse, where he is being hunted, such an unfulfilling choice that does nothing more than erode the credibility of the characters. What is the likelihood multiple elderly men and women would go out to confront a masked mad man? Surely by now horror audiences need to be respected and the characters can't forever keep making such ludicrous and unrealistic choices.It all makes for a watchable film, but it is the height of mediocrity and fails the litmus test on any post screening scrutiny. The story is tired and the forever reincarnation of the character serves more now to sell masks and merchandise rather than create a true classic that rocks audiences to the back of their seat and leave them somewhat scarred with the memory of having watched something that'll stay with them for some time. See it with a friend, wear brown underpants and switch off your brain. Forgettable fun.",Halloween Kills

506,petdavies,Stop hating and remember,8,1 November 2021,"Come on all. Stop hating on this film. Have you ever seen a slasher before??? Almost all the characters are always stupid so there's nothing new there. We don't watch these films for a gripping storyline and to really invest in the characters apart from the antagonist. If characters in slasher films were sensible and rational then there'd be no kills.This film is pure entertainment from start to finish. The music is brilliant and the flashback scenes are great. Plus, hardly any stupid homages to the original which is a relief compared to the last one.It also really captures a great Halloween atmosphere with set pieces and lighting.Dr loomis's accent, dialogue and voice over is dreadful I will admit, and the title sequence is a bit naff with all the floating pumpkins! Stop trying so hard!No Halloween sequel or new timeline will ever live up to the 1978 original, but this instalment is very worthy. Classic slasher film with everything you'd expect from stupid characters, some crap dialogue and awesome kills. Of course it's not scary!! We all know Michael Myers by now and how sinister he is.Stop hoping for another 78 masterpiece, it's never going to happen. Just enjoy the franchise for what it's become. It was always going to end with slasher sequels. This film is on a par if not better than 1986's Jason Lives, and the fans loved that for its sheer brutality and stupidity. Remember folks, it's just another slasher film so enjoy and stop looking for a masterpiece.",Halloween Kills

There are crappy horror flicks, not so crappy horror flicks, and many genuinely good ones in which a modicum of thought was put into the screenplay. Halloween Kills is that genre of people doing stupid things horror flicks.No one thought of vaporizing Mike's head with a shotgun blast? What about hiring a samurai to neatly slice off Mike's head?

Not too bad.,8,15 October 2021,"The life insurance rates in Haddonfield gotta be crazy expensive.David Gordon Green consistently holds up to John Carpenter's original classic. This movie was a lot of fun. Paid good homage to the original without feeling too heavyhanded about it. It's a more brutal film than the previous installment. A bigger cast. Bigger body count. The Shape really gets to shine. My only gripe is with some of the performances. At times the delivery of dialogue felt a little B-Flickish. Towards the end I was rooting for Michael, as opposed to the ending of the previous film when I was rooting for Laurie. The social commentary here isn't too difficult to see, but it's believable. I wanted to see this in a theater, but I already saw Venom and Scream, and Dune is next week. That's enough of my money gone to Hollywood. I caught it on Peacock. Wish they'd release it in 4K.

Lot of phone swipes and watch checking going on in the viewing area. Not as good as the previous, and somewhere in the lower ranks of tropey dullery. The typical and expected Blumhouse woke cliche requirements only served to, well, get people to cheer for Micheal on many of the kills.

I don't like horror film but enjoy the thrill of the classic Halloween films. This had no thrill whatsoever, just complete stupidity to the point of being ridiculously and awkwardly funny. All the characters make the most idiotic decisions as if they've gone brain dead. It was just overly gory and felt it did not respect the character or basis of the ""Halloween"" 1978 idea, which is thrill, suspense, heart racing, holding your breath while you wonder where Michael Myers will come out from next.

526,jasp-official,Very disappointing-6.5,6,17 October 2021,Huge Halloween/horror movie fan. I waited 3 years for this movie and it completely fell flat on expectations. Great killings. Great visuals but at the end of the movie I left feeling very disappointed. This movie completely sets back everything Halloween 2018 did. They spent the whole movie as the town of haddonfield is looking for Michael Myers. When they encounter Michael the end result is very disappointing as I don't know if the writer knows what he's truly doing Michael. Halloween 2018 set up a clean timeline where Michael Myers is a serial killer who terrorized haddonfield 40 years ago. Halloween kills especially with the ending brings Michael back to the storylines of halloween5-6 with the curse. The director stated Michael Myers is isn't supernatural which after watching this movie is a complete lie. He didn't know how to properly execute the ending. Which left too many questions. He completely messes up his own timeline in the end and the Michael Myers character. I am no longer excited for Halloween ends.,Halloween Kills

It was so face-paced that there was zero time to breathe and zero suspense which is what made the original so great so this installment completely spit on its roots as a horror legend. The daughter became so unlikable by blaming Laurie for putting them in Michael's path and even her shot at redemption by trying to save the mental patient was lost because not even 2 seconds after someone pointed out what the witch-hunt was doing to them, they rushed into another scene. The trailer was very misleading about Laurie's role in the movie and they somehow tried to make Michael's doctor more pivotal to Michael's return, but it was like the director gave actors 2 seconds to deliver lines and move on.

Still all the good stuff make in my opinion for the best Halloween since the 1981 sequel.",Halloween Kills
530,benjinightingale,Just die,3,18 October 2021,You can feel it's over when you actually want Micheal to die this time . I literal groan escaped my mouth when he rose again. Can someone at least try something new.. you are going to get 2 people at the next film showing up to watch . It's done with now.,Halloween Kills
531,cejhinton,Eh,1,23 October 2021,Before watching this just close your eyes and picture a serial killer with white mask just mindlessly killing. For no reason just because. Then throw that with a mixture of a thoughtless plot and Bad acting and you got this movie. I can appreciate this movie series but just gets old.,Halloween Kills
532,james6677,Watching while i write this!,4,15 October 2021,"So starts out cool showing some backstory in case you didn't know. Then you watch Myers escape and proceed to become a junk story. He attacks an old couple in their home, which isn't unusual for him, however they never run or make any effort to fight AND THEN he shoves 5 knives into a dead body!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! The guys dead that was never his MO once dead he moves on without care.Later a women with a gun jumps out of a car to do what i thought was help friends, but she ran away with the gun just to come back AFTER they all died to die with them, i mean is this a joke? I started at 8/10 now down to 4/10 lets see if it gets better again.Tommy storyline has been amazing so far 6/10 up from 4.Another grewsome death which is not MM usual, they've moved on from spooky to gore too much these days in horror and its definitely not a good thing imo. 5/10.Another unnecessary grewsome death scene 4/10 again this is really ridiculous that all they do is add ""guts"" to every scene.I won't spoil the ending, but its not great. Will this end?",Halloween Kills

Much more gore-horror than spooky/scary. I particularly found it good to see Michael Meyers raise the kill count, but it was definitely short on the scares. That being said, I do think it one of the better Halloween movies.Not really a scary movie, but it's definitely got some good gore/body horror, and kills, but that's about where the good stuff ends. The writing, and acting, isn't that good. The dialog is rough to say the least and the plot isn't all that great, but still clearly sets up yet another Halloween movie.It's a good watch, not great. The true Halloween fans will probably hate it because it fails to deliver the atmosphere and scares of the OG films, but fans of gore will praise it for that. Watch it for yourself and hopefully you'll enjoy it, like we did.",Halloween Kills

It is not for children and it is so scary to comprehend.The entire 3rd Film keeps you on the edge of your seat and scare the living day light out of you.Michael Myers kills with no soul and this his most violent film yet.Very well made way scarier than the first film9/10.,Halloween Kills

He brought a powerhouse performance to Samuel Loomis every time he took on the role. RIP Donald Pleasence.",Halloween Kills

With that being said, the movie was definitely good and entertaining and is obviously a set up for the next one which I think will be even better.",Halloween Kills
537,nickgray-12862,Michael is more brutal than ever.,8,26 October 2021,Halloween kills is a funny entity. On one side you have Myers as the most insane killer I think he's ever been in any Halloween movie. On the other the film seems like its intentionally trying to up all the other slashers from previous years. Don't get me wrong I love the new incarnation but when did Myers start torturing his victims. He was always a quick killer never this super killer who took on 10 people without breaking a sweat. Overall an enjoyable night out and it sets everything up for the final confrontation next year. Personally I can't wait.,Halloween Kills
538,gazwally,The worst of the lot,1,6 November 2021,"Easily the worst Halloween film of them all, absolutely laughable especially the hospital riot scene it's utterly pathetic if ur in the uk you'll understand the term ""it's a straight to channel 5 movie""",Halloween Kills
539,Buttsludge,Tis the season,6,26 October 2021,"Some solid violence. One of the kills in particular struck me as kind of bad at fist, but then redeemed itself. When the man and woman are in the room flying the drone, their reaction to M. M. is just bizarre to me. And even worse is the way Michael starts slamming the man's head against the door frame.Shortly after though we're given my favorite scene of the whole film, where the woman who was impaled in the neck with a fluorescent tube light, with her last breaths, watches Michael stab knife after knife into the already dying man, with a stone cold demeanor. Never have I felt this depth of the heartlessness of Myers before.Dialogue felt a little rough in places. Most of the cast was great but there's characters that come across as just so unlikable mostly due to the script itself not their acting.Ramps up at the end with multiple twists but you can see them coming for a mile. Final cinematic shots pay off in the end to give it an above average rating.",Halloween Kills

I literally watched the original Halloween and then the direct sequel from 2018 before watching this latest sequel.I was not disappointed at all!

Halloween Kills! What more can you ask for?! This is Michael at his most brutal, he wants his house back and he'll kill anyone who stands in his way. Halloween Ends comes next year so im sure you can guess somewhat what happens but I promise you, you ain't seen Michael Myers until you've seen Halloween Kills.",Halloween Kills
542,samuraicopper,Remember Halloween?,2,16 October 2021,"I guess if you count gore as plot, you'll like it.So much self-referential garbage. For some reason, they squeeze in the three masks from Halloween 3, which have nothing to do with anything except the title.Everyone knows what Michael looks like, but they somehow think he's a 275 lb dude who they forced to his death. Is the point that the whole town is actually evil?Every ten minutes, a character has to remind other characters, and the exhausted audience who Michael Myers is. Anthony Michael Hall was better in Freddy Got Fingered, which is arguably better than Halloween Kills.The composition looks good, but doesn't save anyone from the relentless stupidity. The only bigger headache is knowing that there's another one on the way.",Halloween Kills

548,girlluver1,I am a die hard Halloween fan and no this is not a fake review,8,15 October 2021,"I will start off with the negative and move to the positive. The hospital sequence was kind of dumb and was likely used as filler. And there's another I will say sequence of scenes where there's comedic relief that's taken just too far. The pace was kind of ruined by it. Now I will go to the positive. First off body count; Michael Myers gives Jason a run for his money when it comes to body count in this one. I'm talking 30+ by his own hand and they are on screen. And for those who thought the gore was toned down and maybe a little pg-13 at times in the 2018 Halloween, he more than makes up for it here. It is on screen, very brutal, graphic and done with practical effects not cgi. Next jump scares; I'm an avid horror movie watcher and I've seen them all. Even ones banned in the US. Nothing can catch me off guard except a few times I actually found myself shocked and twitched slightly. To feel that adrenaline and fear again was so enlightening. I was grinning and shaking it my seat with joy. And there are some questions answered, for example how Michael is able to survive so much. My favorite will forever and always be the original from 1978 but this one has become an extremely close second. They are going to have to do a lot to try snd top this one for the third sequel. Again please take this from someone who is a die hard Michael Myers fan through snd through.",Halloween Kills

I couldn't wait for the next chapter in what I thought was going to be an amazing trilogy of films.Well... fast forward and my anticipation has turned into disappointment - MAJOR disappointment.This film lacked so much, it made little sense, it used kill count to make up for lack of depth and story. This may be the worst Halloween movie - by a mile - of them all.How this is directed by the same person and the one before is beyond me, it was amateur and frankly... absolutely rubbish!",Halloween Kills
550,goatrope67,Very disappointing,5,18 October 2021,Let me start by saying I only got 30 minutes in and was REALLY disappointed. The nostalgic twists were interesting but then fell flat.

552,declancampbell92,The hate is completely unwarranted,8,31 October 2021,"Reading through the reviews of this film on here is just unbelievable. The main criticism that I'm seeing is that the characters are supposedly dumb and they should've known he wouldn't stay down. It seems the majority of people who watch this film are incapable of putting themselves into the position of the characters in the movie. You can't just expect them to be really aware and understand how much it would take to kill Michael like we do. You need to understand that this movie takes place after only the first movie (1978) existed, where he only killed 3 people.. Over 40 years have passed in the storyline, he's a largely forgotten killer. Nobody knows of his supernatural ability to survive what no other man could, other than Laurie and the police chief. The film literally mentions this and it still somehow goes over peoples heads. With what the mob did to Michael, it was more than reasonable to think he was actually dead, considering any normal person would be, and if not they certainly wouldn't be getting up from it like he did. All these reviews are just saying ""huehue they're so dumb, how didn't they know not to chop of his head to make sure he's dead, or stab him in the head, etc."" Well, because they're ordinary people, not maniacs, and they're not aware they're inside a slasher movie..?This is a fun, enjoyable slasher. Peoples standards are far too high today and they like to think they're so clever poking holes in the plot, when in reality they're the dumb ones, completely incapable of understanding what the movie is going for and the message it's putting across. I've literally seen people upset that Laurie wasn't in it much and that she didn't kill Michael in this movie. This is the second part of a planned trilogy, were you all mad that Luke didn't kill Vader in the Empire Strikes Back too? Jesus Christ, some people. I think this film has just become victim of a sheepish, mob mentality (ironic considering this is a huge plot point in the film itself). The hate for this movie is so unwarranted, and is literally just created by peoples stupidity and pretentiousness. It became ""cool"" to hate on this movie because people see others doing it, when in reality its pretty well written for a slasher movie.",Halloween Kills

Characters sucked (wanted them all to die), pace was slow and predictable, the whole movie was just pretty pointless.

The plot was all over the place, just a bunch of scenes from different time lines bundled together.I didn't care about any of the characters and the one I did care about, Laurie, was hardly in the movie.Also if you haven't seen the previous movie (I did but it was ages ago) you don't understand half of what's happening. Should've called ""Halloween scenes: Michael goes places"" because that's all that happens. Michael goes to a house, Michael stands in the street, Michael goes to the forest,...
The whole movie is so extremely dull and unnecessary.Makes me sad because I looked forward to this.",Halloween Kills

This sequel had great kills and I enjoyed the callbacks to the original 1978. The movie brings back the characters of Tommy Doyle, Lindsey, and Marion (nurse of Dr Loomis) to confront Michael Myers. We even get an appearance of Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) in a flashback. While there were certain things I enjoyed about the film, the plot felt a little weak and doesn't advance the story. They tried to add an element of vigilante mob justice to the movie which didn't completely connect. Laurie Strode was pretty much sidelined in this film. She doesn't get to do much besides stay in the hospital.The movie was entertaining enough. Just turn your brain off and watch Michael Myers do his thing and enjoy !",Halloween Kills

This movie upgrades Micheal Myers into a unstoppable killing machine...
Lots of throwbacks and Easter eggs to the original movies and the fan service is everywhere.Some scenes work, others don't...
Remember it's a over the top slasher. The town wants revenge and hysteria ensues...
I do like how the movie slows down a bit to reflect on the horror of Michael's killing and the relatives impacted by the slaying.There are some good attempts at evil being an allegory of the whole towns response to Myers and how they become the very thing they fear. Its a little overdone, but I get what the writers meant!I enjoyed this flick. Its pacing is great, well lit snd shot... and left us on a cliffhanger...",Halloween Kills

You go to a slasher movie for one thing, fun gory kills and boy does this film deliver. I didn't care too much for the 2018 reboot although I really like that version of Michael Myers. Just a ruthless soulless killing machine and he doubles down in this new one. When he gets ahold of someone you can feel the strength and ruthlessness through the screen. People seem to think this movie should be some grand, deep, Shakespearean masterpiece or something. This is a movie with one goal. Killer is killing. People got to kill the killer. Simple. I love the retro look and music. If your looking for a fun gory SLASHER movie to go to this Halloween you should definitely check it out.",Halloween Kills

But for how long will this keep going on? How many more people should we watch Michael Kill? How many more times should we Watch people Shoot him, Stab Him, Burn him but somehow Michael ends up surviving and goes on to kill more people?

Filmmaker David Gordon Green (who re-unites on the screenplay with Scott Teems & Danny McBride) returns to the scene of the crime from HALLOWEEN (2018) where the attempted kill of Michael Myers by the long-suffering Laurie Strode (Curtis back in Mama Bear mode) fails to stick to the landing letting The Shape continue his bloody carnage of vengeance & homecoming, albeit amidst Haddonfield up-in-arms with a vigilante group let by Strode's former babysitting charge Tommy Doyle (Hall). While there are some impressively cool kills with so many annoying new characters to knock off, and a decent body count the film only suffers in very little for Curtis to do let alone have a moment with her sibling rivalry.

When the camera angles flip and your watching Mike walking confused through the empty house is an awesome new angle.

This is just unbelievable stupidity... however it got worse...Next, his dying partner doesn't say 'WTF did you shoot for!', or 'You just killed me,,,,, garggle..' He thanks his inept partner and says some other guff...By the time the film reveled in firefighters getting their faces smashed in I gave up and put this crap on FastForward, stopping every so often to check dialogue and the suspence.... even that turned out to be a time waster.There are masny thousands of films worth watching, this isn't one of them.",Halloween Kills
567,ShaanChaudhry,Big drop off in quality compared to last one,6,15 October 2021,"Obviously when you watch a film like Halloween you have to go into it with some suspension of disbelief. With that said, 2018's Halloween had a much stronger screenplay and was better shot in my opinion compared to Halloween Kills. I'm not quite sure what went wrong but story wise this was a little bit of a mess. Virtually nothing was accomplished and it felt like a big filler to keep the franchise going and to cash in as much as possible. It's sad because Halloween(2018) was so solid.Many instances of the dialogue reached cringeworthy levels. There was even a moment where my friend asked ""Do you think this is kind of stupid?"" The only redeeming qualities were some scenes when death seemed imminent and you didn't quite know where Michael was going to come from or how it will transpire. I felt the first half of the movie was much stronger than the second half in terms of story.Another quality I liked was the retro film style in some of the scenes. I enjoyed the look of it and how it was shot but most of these shots were in the beginning of the movie. I felt 2018's Halloween had a more strict and serious tone whereas this seemed much more dumbed down and silly.I recommend this for popcorn entertainment value but you need to lower your standards even for this style of a movie or you will be disappointed.",Halloween Kills

What is the basic formula for your basic slasher film. If you're looking for anything else you're not going to find it.Now Halloween Kills is not without its issues. The second act in the hospital does seem a bit disjointed, like they were two different Scripts written and they were both cut together randomly and handed to the director to shoot. But overall it doesn't really take away much. The finale is pure visceral overkill...quite rewarding. The opening and set up is effective and I love seeing Donald Pleasance again even though I know it really isn't him.If you want to enjoy this film, like many like it, stop looking for something you're not going to find.

571,rfloom,"Some elements are good, some straight up humorous",4,18 October 2021,"I thought this film had some great kills and definitely stood out when it comes to Halloween films by going down the route of the town forming a mob to hunt Michael. Every time Michael was on screen I was enjoying myself. It's the middle of and when it's one continuous story, usually the middle chapter isn't the best (Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 are stand alone stories, so this is more comparable to say The Two Towers arguably being the weakest LOTR film, even tho that was still great, just compared to the beginning and end though). The thing about Halloween movies is they only work because the people are so damn stupid. Like some really laughable parts of the film were the beginning... in such a short time period, young Hawkins showed us how he's the worst cop of all time. He shot at Michael and of course missed terribly and then didn't even follow him the direction he went... and then in the house he shot his partner that Michael was strangling instead of getting closer to Michael and just shooting him that way. People either stand so far away they can't shoot him (everyone is just terrible with a gun) or they get so close that he's able to just reach out and grab them. The second time is the black woman dressed as a nurse shooting at him, and at this point it was like they were parodying horror films. I mean her shots were so off it wasn't even funny, but was.I can see how people might be rolling their eyes at the ending. I sort of was. I mean he's just invincible. I think they're going the supernatural route that like Halloween 6 went... but David Gordon Green still says he isn't supernatural... I don't know. I mean I feel like the only way to actually kill him is to chop his head off like Laurie thought she did in H20. All I know is I'm definitely seeing Halloween Ends as I'm very curious how they'll wrap this up. Apparently there's a 4 year time jump between Kills and Ends so it'll catch up to the current year it's releasing in (as if that matters). I'm guessing both Laurie and Michael die in it, and Allyson lives. Or maybe Allyson is given the opportunity to end Michael but has to sacrifice Laurie too to do so or something like that... might make for an interesting finale. It seems like the only recurring characters left are Laurie, Allyson, Lindsey and Hawkins.",Halloween Kills

So its a beautiful warning and especially the ending was so gripping with michael being the blank canvas of the rage of the town ppl.Jamie lee curtis gave a passionate perfromance again - i hope she ll have more scenes in different settings in the next film, though.Michael mayers is a great villain and became so much scarier with this film.",Halloween Kills

The only ""memorable"" part of this horrible film was ""Big John, Lil John"" lmao. The screenplay was maybe the worst of 2021. David Gordon Green is an above average filmmaker and his direction & camera movements are incredibly laughable. The worst part might be the performances though. Everyone plays it so straight when Green is obviously making a Halloween parody film. Jamie Lee Curtis misses the first half of it and even when she's in the film she is not very good. I don't know what keeps bringing her back to this franchise other than money. The characters they brought back from the original 1978 version are all horrible actors. I honestly believe Green wants to kill this franchise, no pun intended. Not quite the worst film of 2021 (Candyman) but it comes super close. I really hope after this money grab of a trilogy wraps up they finally do away with Michael Myers, he is no longer scary and Green knows that, which is why he made a comedy film with a loved psychopathic slasher character.

The movie is predictable and contains typical horror, stupid characters, continuity with original without change at least at first. Some characters need more characterization. The mob mentality I like but has its problems. The fact that it looks like the entire town in the hospital becomes a violent mob is hard to believe, but at the same time if there is a horror at this level and you feel you can stop it I can get behind a mob mentality which brings me to the good.The movie has a different element that I like. The mob while flawed is a great piece often depicted with great art. Anthony Micheal Hall plays a believable version of Tommy Doyle. The strides are all believable. And the ending plays great homage to both original Halloween, this Halloween and Psycho, while it keeps to its roots and has a truly shocking one last scare ending as you would almost think Anthony Micheal Hall was the one last scare which is he not.",Halloween Kills

Unfortunately, it can not hold up to the standards it previously set. Fans will be happy to know that this movie does not let up on the gore and action, but will be disappointed in the fact that this movie is essentially filler. The good: Micheal is just as evil as ever. He has no mercy and the whole town is at risk. The 70's sequences. That one sad scene that takes place at the hospital (you will know what I'm talking about once you see it). Jamie Lee Curtis is great. Full of nostalgia. The bad:The script was almost painful. The dialogues between characters and their monologues were cringe worthy. I wish they had maybe read it over more and realized how much repetitive dialogue there was and how some of the lines would not deliver well. The amount of time you will hear ""evil dies tonight"" may have you wanting to rip your hair out. The characters make the dumbest decisions. This troupe is a joke for horror movies, but this was beyond extreme. Yes people in horror movies make stupid decisions, but the frequency of them in this movie is laughable. Huge fan of the genre, yet I have not scene a movie that has such stupid characters who are not very likable.

The kills we're angrier, more violent & creative than in the previous film. - the fluorescent light bulb was a particular favorite & kudos for how one of the gay guys trying to be a bad ass & fight instead of being a stereotypical cliche. I'll admit the mob mentality stuff went a little over the top but that's probably exactly what would happen given how middle aged white people enjoy creating chaos & killing people in giant mobs in this country.I liked how they brought back the surviving characters from the previous films, it was fun to guess which ones would make it. I was surprised that Lindsay Wallace ended up being the only survivor from the group, I wonder if she will be brought back for the final installment so that Michael has no other survivors left to kill except Laurie.And even though I was expecting Karen to be killed it was still a bummer to see her go! But I think that needed to happen to drop a little napalm to the flames for the final movie, Laurie is gonna be on a rampage like never before when she finds out & the final showdown between Michael, Laurie & Allyson - whom I'm guessing will be the only one left standing- is going to be beyond epic, I can't wait to see how it ends.",Halloween Kills

And it even managed to surprise a little, but damn it, what a boring movie this is!I'll start with the cons. The first thing I want to say is, the stretched timekeeping. 15-20 minutes of the film can be safely thrown out, nothing much will change. Scenes when viewing which you do not want to sleep in the tape are catastraphically few. Most of the timekeeping is given over to stupid carnage or meaningless dialogues.Now the pros. I was very pleased that the movie was trying (albeit fleetingly) to convey the meaning. For such a genre, even an UNSUCCESSFUL attempt to tell about something with meaning is already cool. And this message is to show how much hatred and obsession with revenge can obscure people's eyes, so much so that they unwittingly become monsters that the monster has spawned. Such a social experiment from Michael Myers, which lasted 40 years.6.8.",Halloween Kills

These movies just put you right into that spooky holiday mode. That being said, although I enjoy all kinds of scary movies and I enjoyed the comeback of the 2018 Halloween movie, this one I just couldn't deal with - the dialogue is painfully cliché and Anthony Michael Hall is the over the top overbearing ""tough guy"" this franchise never needed. The deaths were epic and are the main reason I gave this movie a 4 instead of a 1 - the special effects work was incredible BUT that was overshadowed by the awful writing and incredibly ineffective vigilante bafoonery that was their attempts to ""end"" Michael Myers. I realize most scary movies aren't exactly brimming with quality dialogue but this one was so bad you couldn't ignore it.

594,mpiten-891-86828,'Halloween Kills...' with Boredom,2,16 October 2021,"At this point we all know Michael Myers is indestructible, but this film feels the need to prove it, not just through a final mob confrontation with the Shatner-masked maniac. But worse, it feels the need to drive this point home incessantly through long-winded soliloquies and one-sided discussions about how true evil can't be killed, that we perpetuate it through our fear and violent tendencies, blah blah blah.I've never seen a so-called horror film spend more time gabbing about its big baddie, with even a nod to the capital riots when a near-riot breaks out in a hospital flooding with Myers' victims. So heavy-handed and eye-roll-inducing is this pointless subplot about mistaken identity that it completely throws off the rhythm we'd expect in a slasher film - but the filmmakers never skillfully set that rhythm at the start anyway.The script is so shoddy that we're expected to fully recall the finale of the 2018 'Halloween,' the last film to feature Jamie Lee Curtis, and be somewhat lost if we CAN'T recall the events of that film. But even that is muffed by showing flashbacks to the plot of the 1978 film with new characters supposedly present during that film who will be reprised by older, modern-day versions of the characters. The exposition is clumsy, baffling, and amateurish when the plot begins at a ""Talent Show"" at a bar held Halloween night. Survivors of the first film take the spotlight when Anthony Michael Hall begins telling the scary story of Michael Myers, mobilizing when they find the mask-wearing butcher-knife enthusiast is killing again.What follows includes a bunch of soon-to-be victims who keep howling that ""Evil Dies Tonight"" among other laughable chants and a plot to end the evil once and for all. Most egregious, however, is Laurie Strode's bite-sized role as a survivor who froths about Myers' inherent evil and functions as a Greek Chorus that is wholly unnecessary. Was Jamie Lee Curtis on a tight time schedule during filming? Because her laughable lines give her little to do besides yell at her family members to not chase after Michael.Do yourself a favor and wait for it on Hulu or Netflix, or better yet, ignore it altogether and rewatch the 1978 John Carpenter original - this latest iteration is laughable, disappointing, and amateurish. Can Michael Myers be stopped? Only if you skip this film.",Halloween Kills
595,Ceronomus,Wasted Potential for teh perfect franchise finale,6,22 October 2021,"The original Halloween was a genre-defining film. Despite being low budget it really kicked things into gear, essentially created the slasher genre and, 40 years later, people are still watching it.It spawned enough sequels to have several time-lines, with each group of sequels ignoring the others - as well as a single, stand-alone film that doesn't deal with Michael Myers.Halloween has, quite simply put, become iconic.The decision to make these latest films (Halloween, Halloween Kills, and Halloween Dies) left me with a bit of trepidation but, the first of the new films was really well done and paid wonderful homage to the original. So, I went into Halloween Kills with some seriously high expectations.For most of the movie, they were exceeded. After 40 years of Halloween being the story of Laurie Strode, it became the story of Tommy Doyle - and that of Haddonfield. This set everything on its head and made for a truly fresh story (something you just don't see in Halloween movies). The story sets up a truly perfect ending for the entire franchise as Tommy Doyle and the people of Haddonfield go into the night to hunt down and kill Michael Myers.It is truly rare that a series has a perfect ending...and this movie hit that benchmark. Unfortunately, they are making one more movie and so they threw away that phenomenal moment in favor of grabbing more cash.If you watch Halloween Kills, after reading this, you will know EXACTLY what moment I'm speaking of when it gets there. Do yourself a favor, when that moment comes, just turn off the movie and walk away. It will NEVER get any better, only more cliched.",Halloween Kills

I gave it a 5 because the Halloween movies (original) are excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis is as always, great. But why so much gore? Why the odd casting choices for some of the characters? Overall, I did like this movie, but have to go with a 5 because of the gore and some of the odd, kind of weird story line (e.g. The mass hysteria of the townsfolk) and casting choices. I think most people will enjoy the movie for the most part, but comparing it to 2018, this one is not nearly as good.",Halloween Kills
597,jac-44480,More Satisfying than 2018 version,7,23 October 2021,"Halloween Kills (2021) is tonally different than its predecessor ""Halloween"" (2018). The 2018 installment, despite being critically acclaimed, left me feeling unsatisfied and underwhelmed. Halloween Kills (2021), being poorly received by critics, is somewhat ironic since it had the opposite effect on me. While not a masterpiece, and certainly not on par with the original Halloween (1978), I walked away feeling a sense of fulfillment. The 2021 film excels in certain areas that its 2018 predecessor did not. Lets examine.First, the tone of the 2021 film is much darker. This film does a better job of setting the overall mood and atmosphere. We hear Carpenter's latest revised score, which is excellent, playing frequently throughout this movie, along with occasional chimes and whistles that we last heard in Carpenter's original 1978 film. This is a major improvement over past sequels, and was sorely missing in the 2018 film. The 2021 film avoids the comedy of the 2018 film that detracted from its scariness, sans one sequence. We also avoid the overwhelming MeToo Movement politics in this installment.Second, if 2018 was a Laurie-centric film, 2021 is a Michael-centric film. In a good way I might add. We spend far more time following Michael around on the streets of Haddonfield, stalking and lurking behind bushes at night, and murdering one hapless victim after another. After an impressive opening sequence of scenes set in 1978, this film gets straight to the point and wastes little time getting Michael Myers back on the streets of Haddonfield at his best. The kill count is massive in this film compared to prior installments, and the death scenes are of high quality, but also extremely graphic and gory, a major departure from past installments. Rather than cutting away immediately after the kill, the film spends time basking in the gore so the viewers are sure to see every molecule of brain matter and blood possible, while Michael admires his work before moving onto the next victim.Laurie Strode took a back-seat in this film, largely confined to a hospital bed at Haddonfield Memorial, and did not interact with Michael Myers. This was a positive decision by the writers. While Laurie's 2018 performance was stage-stealing, it somewhat limited the scope of where the story could go. 2021's installment rightly goes a different direction and instead focuses on the secondary characters from the original 1978 film. Most notably Tommy Doyle, Lindsey Wallace, and Lonnie Elam, who were child-victims in 1978. Tommy Doyle's character (played by Anthony Michael Hall) is the lead protagonist in this film, and while serviceable, is a rather weak lead. The 1978 survivors team up with the 2018 survivors lead by Allyson (Andy Matichak) and her mother Karen (Judy Greer). Thankfully, Judy Greer, who was largely wasted in the 2018 film, is given far greater screen time and more to do in this film and excels at her role.What was so bad about this film? Well, there are a few things. The firefighter scene early in the film was about the most absurd, unrealistic, and campy scene in the history of Halloween sequels. Not to be outdone, the final scene involving Michael easily dispatching of a lynch mob of 30 people is equally ridiculous. I get it that Michael is portrayed as inhuman, but these two scenes turn him into something of a Kill Bill character who can dispatch dozens of people while being untouched. The other issues with this film include the campy overbearing dialogue throughout. People do not talk like that in real life.Overall, this is a good sequel in the Halloween franchise and excels at things its predecessor failed at, but is by no means a masterpiece or anywhere close to Carpenter's original 1978 film. Since the critics dislike this film, but like the 2018 film, I have a feeling that the 2021 film will age better with time, while the 2018 film is stuck in its ""era"" and will not age well, much like how H20 aged poorly being stuck in the Scream era 90's.",Halloween Kills
598,nathanchasewomack,A movie that will be a classic in 20 years....Best film of 2021?,8,17 October 2021,"I had low expectations for this film, as I, having grown up with the original movie having defined a genre that still runs runs full steam today.I won't bother with you with meaningless personal comments. Everyone with a keyboard and internet access is a Roger Ebert these days. You know the old saying ""Opinions are like...."", IMDB is living proof.Halloween Kills is finally the worthy and.needed sequel to the OG original. And just like the original it has redefined the genre. The easter eggs are everywhere, you will need 3-4 viewings to spot them all. Every film in the franchise is represented here. Even Halloween III, Season of the Witch, an overlooked suspense mystery that people wrote off because there was no Michael Myers. And therein lies the mistake after the first film. Hint: 1978's film was not about Michael Myers. That name & story is irrelevant. Hence he is listed in the credits as The Shape. The white mask, the shadows & dim-lighting, the sound of breathing, the unmasking of the killer after the opening murder...that horror lives everywhere, yes even in our small close knit communities where we leave our doors unlocked (then) and sleep safely in our beds with windows opening and curtains billowing and the more it is hidden the more it grows and the more chaos it can cause. Which leads us to Halloween KillsEvil, hatred, anger, rage...and racism have been hiding in the shadows festering for decades with it's blank, faceless identity, much like a KKK hood is white and is without an identity, for far too long and it is back....bigger and badder and more destructive than ever. Almost like what is happening here and now in America and many other parts of the globe. Anger and hatred and racism and violence is now on a global scale. Personally, I have no problem with giving the film 10 stars. In a couple years we will see how right on the money this insta-classic slice of grand guignol was...just like it's elder brother.This film will grow into something so much more that what 90% of the viewers saw. This is The Last House On the Left...Evil Dead...The Texas Chainsaw Massacre were & then became years down the road.

However, in all honesty, after viewing, I could not have been more disappointed. To me, the entire movie was a mess, jumping from one scene to another and I found it extremely difficult to get into and failed to become entwined into the story. In truth, I found it to be simply, one huge headache. I never thought I would say that a slasher movie has far too many slashes but this one sure does! The constant kills took away from the suspense and tension of the movie and I found the dialogue/acting to be rather shocking.

One of my favorite scenes was definitely his reintroduction with the burning house. The mayhem he caused both on and off screen was definitely gripping and I found myself legitimately worried at times. Also even though she's not in it as much as we would've wanted, Jamie Lee Curtis still brings it as Laurie. I also respect the fact that she doesn't just walk off her injuries like most movies would've done, which shows they cared about the consistencyThat being said, the movie kinda just falls flat. There's too much going on here than there really should be in a Halloween movie, which the previous installment clearly understood the simplicity of. When it's The Shape on a killing spree with the characters fighting tooth and nail to stop him, it works. When it's a preachy cautionary tale about mob mentality, this isn't the best movie to do so. Like.... IT'S MICHAEL MYERS! This is the dude who got stabbed, shot, and burned and just walked it off like it was nothing! If anything you absolutely want everything you can throw at him!Side note, I'm glad they didn't play up to too many stereotypes when it came to the gay couple, but wow were they cartoony at timesBut I think the thing that really makes this movie fall short is the ending. I'm fine with key characters dying, especially since this is a horror movie, but they felt so shoehorned in at the end just to be shocking. Tommy, the kid Laurie had to jump hurdle to save years ago, buh bye. Leigh Brackett, the sheriff who lost his daughter to this blood thirsty monster, see ya later. Karen, the next generation of the fight against Michael Myers who seemed like might actually be the one to finish the job, definitely don't need this oneAnd I know it's scarier if Michael truly can't be killed, but when the alternative is whatever the hell that explanation was at the end, I think it's not only unsatisfying but also unexplainably confusing. Like it used to be ""you can't kill the boogeyman"" and that was good enough. Then it became ""If he can be killed, I'll find a way"" which I also think works as long as you can get that payoff at some point. But now that's been retconned to what I can only assume is ""There's no stopping him. I guess we're screwed."" In my eyes that just writes you into a corner, and if there's no payoff there's no reason to go watch the next one because you know there's no resolutionThis movie could've been amazing, and served as a true and faithful follow up to both Halloween and it's sequel Halloween, but it just wasted the opportunity to have a well flowing and complete story. To me it would've been more satisfying if they would've just ended with Michael dead and done for. But now it's just gonna go down as the biggest wasted opportunity since the Star Wars sequels. The movie was a fun time every so often, but it was all ruined by an unsatisfying conclusion. You can't kill the boogeyman, but you can kill a franchise.",Halloween Kills

This one was more artistic in a dark way, lots of close up shots and great cinematography.Halloween Kills matches the tone of the original Halloween perfectly. There was more of a seriousness and reality to the characters in this one. Many character flaws are exposed, which is risky but serves the story well. There is also more context given to why Michael Myers is so hard to kill.

Halloween Kills should have been a slam dunk by being a direct follow up to the 2018 film and I thought they would go the Halloween 2 route by just upping the body count.And up the body count they certainly did. But none of it is satisfying as they tried to tell a story with meaning about mob mentality. Except it was so poorly acted and the pacing all over the place that none of what they were going for thematically works and all the fun is sucked out of the film as a result. There were many times where I thought the movie was intentionally trying to be a meta joke as it really upped the horror movie cliche of characters making stupid decisions to the point where the audience I was with was laughing. This isn't Friday the 13th, the Halloween franchise always tried to be a legit horror series and this one unfortunately is not scary in the least bit.This isn't the worst Halloween film ever made. Halloween Resurrection and both Rob Zombie films are below this. But that'a honestly the best thing I can say about it and I don't know how they can make the third one enjoyable after delivering this junk.",Halloween Kills
607,calemiller-75547,It killed alright....,8,16 October 2021,I'm not sure why there's some poor reviews?? Look there's always the complaints of Michael having a low body count. Well he sure got his in this one. I mean I saw the previews and it still delivered to me. Sure there are a couple of issues like how is Hawkins even alive after a throat slit. Multiple stab wounds and oh yeah he got RAN OVER BY A CAR AFTER. That really is the biggest one to me. That and the Doc loomis bit. Now look I loved Loomis he was the best part of the Halloween franchise after the first movie. But Gesh I'm not sure what they tried to do it obviously looked like him so I guess they used some kinda technically but the voice was ehh pretty off. I like all the back story though of that night as well as other tie ins. I was a big advocate of them picking up after the original. Second movie because to me that movie was so good as well and at first I thought they were going there. Overall the beginning of this thing and the end of this thing were really good. Middle at times it keeps you entertained while at others it kinda slows things down. It's not a 10 like the original and I'm debating back and forth if it's even as good as the last one but you have to remember this is part 2 of 3 in this movie series so some spots have to be left desired. I think it overall did a great job and people need to stop with the bad reviews on this thing. It's at the least an 8/10.,Halloween Kills

I was pulled into Halloween Kills from the beginning. I have to say, though *SPOILERS*
somethings were left unresolved, which could only mean one thing : they'll be explained in the next movie.------SPOILERS----
What happened to Lindsay?Maybe I missed something from the previous movie, but why was Judy G's character wearing a Christmas sweater?Aside from it being entertaining, I would have liked to see more Jamie Lee Curtis.This movie was more PC, which was different than the other films.And there was so many killings, it was great!",Halloween Kills
611,brosmkbros,Just destroyed its former glory,2,18 October 2021,"This movie is the greatest let down in 2021. I prefer the 2018 one ,its way better. In this I can't find micheal but a guy who is trying to imitate jason. There is no plot but its nothing new. Acting is cheesy and just horrible. Other ridiculous factor is Michael's plot armor, jesus its just ridiculous. There so many kills though but for what?!?? There are ridiculously stupid kills too that adds up to this failure. This is not the worst halloween movie like everyone says cuz there is rob zombies one ,thats the worst halloween movie in my opinion .",Halloween Kills
612,Andystar77,"Evil Ends Tonight, Well....",5,16 October 2021,"To begin with this sequel and the third one ( that will be released in 2022) never supposed to happen, but since Halloween 2018 was a big hit they returned to the same circle ( Michael Myers never dies) the 2018 was supposed to be the end of this misery franchise.As for this film at first it's okay then it's started to be so annoying for example for one point u watch Michael killing a lot of people as he was Jet Lee , Van Damme thing (the scene was soooo ridiculous) and they repeated it at the end of the film.Another thing They brought back many of the original characters and killed most of them. Like Marion: who's killed in 20 years later!!!! Tommy the little kid that Laurie babysit him in the original movie !!!Also there were a lot of deaths scene a lot a lot a lot !!! Most them weren't necessary . But the most b###s### was killing Karen i mean what's the point of it and in a very ridiculous way (the killing scene is almost identical to the shower scene in psycho and Sarah Michelle Gellar death scene in i know what you did last summer).Even the final idea they gave it to us about Michael that he never dies because he lives on fear : is actually stolen from a nightmare on elm street, so my biggest question what's new what was the director thinking of!!!This film is just for deaths and who a physo slaughters his victims (and now in the time we are in world it's the last thing we want to see)
Bad bad and bad sequel with the worst ending u can imagine.",Halloween Kills
613,exceladeogun,"Clever deaths for a slasher film, horrible screenplay",6,24 October 2021,"Gets this high a score because of the way the deaths were done.I guess the aim was to see how many deaths they could cram into the movie, but the screenplay was wonky at best, I guess they're relying on tying everything up in the upcoming sequel.",Halloween Kills
614,fadelman,Worthwhile middle section of the trilogy!,9,18 October 2021,"I have to say that the only reason I subscribed to the Peacock app was to see HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021) at the same time it appeared in theaters (I'm still not ready to set foot in a movie theater because of Covid, even though I'm probably being nothing but a big baby). I'm very glad that I did. This is a slam-bang horror flick that doesn't skimp on the bloody kills and gives everyone a chance to shine, but if you are expecting Jamie Lee Curtis to face-off against Michael Myers here, you are going to be bitterly disappointed. Even though all the sequels to the original HALLOWEEN (1978) have been ""de-canonized"" (their description, not mine), you'll have loads of fun trying to recognize the sly references to nearly all the sequels that director David Gordon Green sprinkles throughout the film. The film picks up immediately after HALLOWEEN (2018) ends, after we watch Cameron Elam (Dylan Arnold), the son of original film's Lonnie Elam (played here by Robert Longstreet), finds a still-alive Officer Hawkins (Will Patton, who was stabbed in the neck in the first film), which results in a 14-minute flashback to the events in Haddonfield on Halloween Night, 1978. We see a young Tommy Doyle nearly getting killed by Michael Myers, when a young Officer Hawkins (Thomas Mann) and his partner unknowingly save him and then enter the old Myers home, where his partner is grabbed by Michael Myers. Officer Hawkins draws his weapon and tries to shoot Myers, but he accidentally shoots his partner in the neck, killing him. The police then surround the Myers home when Michael comes walking out of it, all their guns drawn. We are then back in the present, with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) being transported to Haddonfield General Hospital by ambulance after being stabbed in the stomach by Michael. She is accompanied by her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) when they hear fire trucks approaching Laurie's burning home. Laurie yells out, ""Let it burn!"", knowing that Michael Myers is trapped inside. We then see some graphic operating footage as doctors open up Laurie's stomach and fix her injuries, while the Haddonfield Fire Dept. Tries to put out the fire in her home. When one of the firemen falls through the floor into Laurie's basement, where Michael is trapped, Michael graphically kills him with the fireman's own sharp tool, escaping from the basement and killing all the firemen outside (and inside) in very graphic manners (it's a complete bloody massacre). Laurie is then put in a hospital room to recuperate, where she is joined by a recuperating Officer Hawkins. Laurie tells Hawkins that Michael is dead (she doesn't know he escaped from her burning home) and Hawkins tells Laurie that he's glad he is dead, as it was him who allowed him to live back in 1978. Another flashback shows us Dr. Loomis (played by someone to look like Donald Pleasence) is about to shoot Michael Myers in the head back in 1978, but Officer Hawkins stops him from doing it. Up to this day, Hawkins blames himself for all the deaths committed by Michael, if he only let Loomis finish Michael off. After the slaughter of the firefighters, an adult Tommy Doyle (a fantastic Anthony Michael Hall) rallies all the citizens of Haddonfield to hunt down and kill Michael Myers, forming a vigilante group to search for the killer. That's all I'm going to give away, but if you are a fan of John Carpenter's original film, you are going to find a lot to enjoy here. The blood flows freely and the gore goes way beyond what is acceptable in most other horror films with an R-Rating, but the MPA (formerly the MPAA) seems to give these films a pass when it comes to gore and extreme violence. You will see the grown up children of Haddonfield, now adults in their 40's & 50's, getting killed by Michael in various gory manners, including a knife in the eye, eyes being poked out with Michael's fingers, a scalp being torn off (poor Nancy Stephens, who returns from the 1978 original) and various stabbings using Michael's favorite weapon, the large butcher knife (there's a stabbing in the armpit that's very hard to watch). What's particularly memorable about the film is that everyone in the film is given a chance to shine. Even though Jamie Lee never leaves the hospital in this film (shades of HALLOWEEN II (1981) or even encounters Michael here (that will be the premise of the final film in the trilogy, HALLOWEEN ENDS, scheduled for an October 2022 release), she still registers as Laurie, a no-nonsense broad who doesn't suffer fools gladly. Both Judy Greer and Andi Matichak also give career defining moments, as does Anthony Michael Hall, who promises Laurie ""Evil dies tonight"". The sequence towards the end of the film where a group of citizens, led by Tommy, surround Michael Myers and begin shooting and battering him across the head and back with baseball bats (""Old Huckleberry"" puts in an appearance) and two-by-fours is a thing of brutal beauty, but when they think he is dead, only for him to get up and kill everyone, proves that evil is something that cannot be killed so easily, if at all. The death of Cameron by Michael in front of Allyson is probably the most brutal kill in the film, as Michael knows that Allyson has feelings for Cameron, so he kills him slowly and painfully, Cameron groaning while Michael slowly approaches toward Allyson down the stairs, stopping to grab Cameron's head and twist it 180° in a sickening ""snap!"", proving that Michael has no humanity left in his body. The more he kills the stronger he gets. I know some people are going to complain that Laurie never even sees Michael in this film, but they art missing the point. The whole town of Haddonfield is tired of living in fear and wants Michael dead. The film ends with Laurie picking up a bloody butcher knife and saying to Officer Hawkins that it is up to her to kill Michael, even if it means her death. I guess we will have to wait until the final chapter in the trilogy to see what happens, but I think Officer Hawkins will also have a say in the matter. I have to also mention that there are a few actors here that also deserve mentions because of their roles. That would be Michael McDonald as ""Little John"" and Scott MacArthur as ""Big John"" two gay men who are now living in the refurbished Myers home. Their performances raise the film a few notches above most horror films, as does Ross Bacon as escaped mental patient ""Tivoli"", who has come to Haddonfield General Hospital to give himself up, only to be chased by a gang of vigilantes, who think he is Michael Myers, through the hospital, which results in him committing suicide by jumping out a hospital window. It should also be noted that Ross Bacon died before the film was released. Originally slated to be released in October 2020, it was delayed by a year due to theaters in the U. S. being shut down by the Covid-19 Pandemic. A worthwhile watch for all HALLOWEEN lovers. You know who you are.",Halloween Kills

I was impressed with bringing back the old cast + the magic they used to recreate Dr. Loomis (hint, it's a combo of a lookalike with a voice actor overdubbed - no archive footage, no CGI - the execution was brilliant.)I found some of the acting over the top and things being said cheesy. (I laughed at another critics review where he referred to JLC's monologue as ""bloviating"" - I am so going to use this word going forward). I wanted to like Tommy Doyle's character but I found him annoying and off-putting. Like with Candyman, I am being especially hard on this movie as it was delayed quite a bit due to covid - there was ample time to try this on test audiences and re-cut the movie a bit. Another thing that was irksome for me is that Michael Myers is now almost 70, and the damage he undergoes in the movie is too unbelievable. Like so much more than previous movies. On the plus side, loved Judy Greer and Andi Matichak's performances. Everyone else, meh. (Except for pseudo-Loomis).TLDR - I wanted to love it, but couldn't.

""He's turning us to monsters"". It was too much. That means they added to much to Michael Myers charachter. The idea was good, really well.It would've been really good if they kept that part out, where people (like allways) go mad. And kept it real to the original Halloween story.

But why did you go hunting from the beginning??And then Lauries daughter stab him in the back, but lets survive for what?

Halloween Kills has some really fun moments and I liked the classic horror movie way of building tension with the score and editing.The problem is there's just so many stupid moments and plot holes that make it hard to not be annoyed.For a movie where everyone talks about how much they want to kill Michael, the effort to actually finish the job is terrible. Michaels survived a fire, being shot countless times, knives galore in his chest, yet Laurie's daughter thinks a little knife to the back will do it.Then everyone's chasing the other mental patient through the hospital thinking it's Michael, he commits suicide and Tommy says 'how do we know it's not Michael?' Well maybe because Michaels twice the size of this guy and you'd never catch him running away from a bunch of people in a hospital.The icing on the cake is the ending. So the Myers house has bodies all over it, police, people and ambulances outside, and somehow Karen is able to just wander upstairs where Michael has conveniently teleported to to kill her and setup the next movie.There's a lot of fun moments, but it's hard not to leave the theatre being wound up by how stupid some of the plot is.",Halloween Kills

633,liberalareblowhacks,Expectations were certainly met...,2,16 October 2021,"Yeah, my expectations were met, but definitely not in a positive way. It's very easy to go on a long, raging rant about this movie (and movies in general nowadays), but for the sake of my own sanity, I'll keep it on the briefer side. SPOILERS AHEADThis film is a mess. Scenes lack cohesion, the plot is flimsy and paper thin, and the characters are tired and boring. In between the long sequence of shallow jump scares that is this asinine film are scenes of gratuitous gore and ridiculous dialogue that sets the film in rapid decline from the moment it starts. We all remember the dark, brooding, anxiety-ridden ambience that the first film mastered so skillfully. Even the sequels in the original storyline had their moments of well-crafted terror, although not done nearly as well as in the original film. Those days are long over with. If Michael Myers was ever an action star, this would be his starring role. He doesn't stalk, follow, sneak up on people before mercilessly disposing of them. He comes out guns-a-blazing, taking on crowds of victims at the same time like he's auditioning for a martial arts flick or something. Many of the scenes are obnoxious and loud, which leaves no chance for setting a quiet, unsettling atmosphere to draw the viewer in. Jamie Lee Curtis spent 95% of the movie lying in bed or stumbling around the hospital corridors, which was probably a good idea after all, as she definitely didn't miss anything interesting with the plot. Some old names from the original film have returned, although they become forgettable within 15 seconds of appearing onscreen. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the only part I truly enjoyed was watching a computer-generated Dr. Sam Loomis appearance. As much as I miss Donald Pleasance, thank God it wasn't really him in the movie, as he's too classy of an actor and is far superior to involving himself in garbage like this. The characters in this crapfest were so forgettable and dull that watching Michael kill them was a pleasure. I only wish Michael killed the entire production team as well, as this entry in the series is embarrassing at best.I could go on, but why bother? Why torment you with the step-by-step details? The movie lacks a strong plot, has no character development, and is just a competition to see how much blood and gore can get tossed around onscreen. I know the phrase is overused, but truly stay home and save your money. You'll be able to watch this garbage for free at some point. If you're looking for something to do and this film is your only option, then make like the escaped mental patient in the movie, find a high ledge, and have yourself a nice jump. It's a lot quicker than subjecting yourself to almost two hours of this modern-day, uncreative crapfest. No surprise here. It's 2021 and movies these days are catering to a moron audience. Movies don't have to put in effort and try anymore. Characters don't need to be intriguing or developed. Just make sure to put a bunch of jump scares, gore, and explosions into your film and you'll be fine. I hope to sweet God that the next film truly is the last. Please put this poor, pathetic franchise to rest already. We can't take it anymore!",Halloween Kills
634,maracean,Overachiever,2,1 November 2021,"This movie is in all the places at once, but in my opinion doesn't achieve it's propose. I've waited this movie for three years but I was so disappointed in the end. What was interesting about the first film directed by Green was the psychological value, the values in the family and the bonds created by it's members - was nice to see Laurie, a PTSD victim and her drinking addiction, Karen and her decision to run from her mother to build a better future for her child and Allyson and her need to be connected with her grandmother. This movie has nothing to do with this. Jamie Lee Curtis, has like 5 shots in the hospital and her plot line is irrelevant to this story. Also Allyson and Karen are not relevant to this story. It's about Michael and this full on rage killing spree. It remained me of the Rob Zombie remakes, so gory, without any substance with superficial written characters, without any resemblance with the first movie. I was also disappointed by the new characters driven into the story, the children from the 1978 and any minor character in the original movie. Why not bring them and killed them mercilessly throughout the movie? The only part in the movie I've enjoyed were the conversations and the plot around the couple living in the old Myers house. I think their lines gave us some comical relief. As a conclusion, don't watch this movie, it cheap and it's struggling to much to be reminiscent to the 1978 original. Carpenter did such an accomplishment with the original music in terms of everything (name it: storyline, music, the camera technology used) and created a film which is one of the fist pioneers on the slasher genre, that inspired other creators such as Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham. I also appreciated the music but was written and performed by the master himself - John Carpenter.",Halloween Kills

There are so many useless scenes and unnecessary... just dumb crap. I don't know how to describe it. It's almost laughable. The writing feels like a Disney channel movie made rated r. All the ""Yayyy evil dies tonight!"" Chanting and the super bad acting. Don't get me started on the scene where the other inmate kills himself. What is the point?

639,gabrielgarbagni,Complete Nonsense,5,21 October 2021,"In this movie, nothing works. Not a single thing. I went to the cinema expecting a classic horror flick and I came out frustrated and bored for what I had just experienced.The story simply isn't there. There's no evolution, no progression to the characters, who constantly make the most absurd choices and totally die by their own fault.Michael Myers is the most convoluted character ever. His actions don't have a purpose other than being there for the sake of theoretically ""surprising the public"". At this point, he is basically invincible, for no reason.The cast is completely Wasted, especially Jamie Lee Curtis who only appears in two or three scenes inside a hospital.Everything is cliché and predictable, which is a shame considering the potential of Halloween as a franchise. In the end, it's just one big missed opportunity.",Halloween Kills
640,kozakiew,Disappointed,2,21 October 2021,"I enjoyed the previous installment in this franchise. And I hope they were going to continue with that tone. This movie was not bad, just a horrible slasher film that was very hard to watch. And even the description of the movie about Laurie leaving a mob to kill Michael? Did I miss that scene? Anyway, if you want to see creative ways for a special effects staff to kill people this is the movie for you. Otherwise pass.",Halloween Kills
641,Number1Animeguy,"It's mindless schlock, don't watch for anything else",4,16 October 2021,"It's better than Halloween 2018 because Halloween 2018 sucks. Its side characters are better as it stays with them for more than 5 min. It has fewer random kills of one-note characters and doing so made the plot focus on the ones it already has. Meaning it doesn't keep introducing new one-note characters for them to be killed off 5 mins later as Halloween 2018 does. But also I was right about a lot of things and this confirmed them.He wasn't after Laurie just like I said in my review of Halloween 2018. It proved the doctor in Halloween 2018 was a plot device only for instigating the plot. That he's random. This is my full critique of the randomness of Michael.In the first film. Michael's older sister was 17 teen years old and all the other girls in the film are that age.He picks the same night of the year he killed his older sister.Michael stalks the girls the whole movie, he doesn't randomly kill people. He picks the girl that has a little boy with her and does nothing to him, the boy is maybe a symbolic representation of himself in his mind.He takes his older sister's tombstone and puts one of the girls under it and what I meant when I say under it is that it stands above her not that it's on top of her, very
symbolic.Also, John carpenter hates Halloween 2 because he was forced to write it. This was the plan.Michael Myers lacks deeper motivation, he's not random he just likes killing certain people for the sake of it. It doesn't devalue the horror.The problem with Halloween kills is that most of the characters are defined by victimhood created from the first film.It really has no plot.But the characters are not as bad tonally as Halloween 2018 because the tone is lighter because this movie is just schlock.It's just a gorefest, you do care about the characters a little bit more than Halloween 2018 so there's more tension but just like the other one, the build-up is too fast. It builds up to nothing as the ending is not a real conclusion and it has very little suspense overall.The first Halloween is mostly build-up, it had a small cast, a consistent tone, and atmosphere, high tension, and suspense. The small cast stopped the story from losing tension, the story was able to hold on to it until it needed to be released. Meaning kills were not happening all the time because the cast was so small.Halloween 2018 does have more atmosphere than Halloween kills but can't build it up because of all the tone shifts.Halloween kills spends too much time in flashbacks and talking about itself.There is plot armor as the mother saves the daughter at the last min and a gang of people with ball bats and guns knocked Michael down for a bit but only when the mother is around, then he kills them.He kills a large group of firemen armed with saws and axes without a problem.Got to save the mother's shock kill until the end, this movie doesn't reward the victims in any way. He kills them well.Also, if a guy is choking another guy out and you have a gun just put the gun to the other guy who is choking him out head and shoot him. Also don't shoot stuff you can't see.This happens in this movie when the characters try to shoot something, they shoot nothing, themselves, and the person they're trying to save.The Flashbacks are dumb and pointless but do give a little backdrop to a character I didn't care about in the other one.Laurie feels human in this movie because she is not a massive ball of Paranoia and anxiety-like the last one. H20 did this better.If a character is in an extreme state of mind, normal people will not be able to relate unless they are or were in that state. You should build up to such a state so we can relate to it better because we see how it was built up. Out of screen build-up is not build-up.People liked Halloween 2018 because of the hype which was unfounded and with less hype they hate on this one which is just trying to be mindless schlock.As a movie, it's mindless gore and even Halloween 4 does comment on mob mentality so it does nothing new. Also, the reason I think Halloween kills comments on mob mentality is that the writers have no idea how to bring the main characters to Michael without him targeting them. It's a way to keep him random.Michael targets his victims. Just like with the doctor in the last one they did it to bring the characters together and instigate the plot. They just can't have Michael stalk the characters. Him stalking the characters slowly overtime in the first film is how it built most of its tension.Halloween kills suffers from a lack of focus like H18. In the first 20 min, it has more characters than most of the other films have as a whole. It kills off most of them fast and then starts focusing on some but it has no real direction. These new movies need a general aim or purpose. The lead characters from the other movies gave Michael direction and as villains are the drivers of plot it also gave the story a direction to go. The randomness needs to stop.It's a 4 or 5 out of 10.",Halloween Kills
642,Tye-J,"Halloween filler, no killer",5,26 October 2021,"After the great Halloween reboot 2018 I had great expectations from Halloween Kills, and the trailer looked fantastic, and very brutal.And I knew that the kills will be violent, but the Halloween movies are not about visible splatter and gore. They need to be good horror films with a very high level of suspense.Unfortunately, Halloween Kills lacks of a story told in more than half a sentence and for most of the time any suspense. Instead, you get another senseless brutal killing. Plus, Jamie Lee Curtis role was very limited.Visually it was okay, the soundtrack was good. But that's not enough.I hope Halloween Ends will bring back the suspense and reduce the sometimes unnecessary gore a bit and we will get a great conclusion. This was more of a filler and reminds me of older Halloween episodes like Part V. A bit disappointed!",Halloween Kills

But this movie was terrible. They killed off good characters in the very beginning, we only saw Lindsay in the beginning and she was in the hospital for the rest, Laurie was in the hospital the whole movie and this movie was just boring.

648,tdavidson-60822,Kinda Meh...,5,15 October 2021,It's 100 mins of setting up the final showdown between Laurie and Michael which won't happen til part 3. It was nice to see just about everyone of the original actors back from the 78 classic but that's about the only thing that was cool about this movie.,Halloween Kills
649,saolivaresm,Every act has its consequence,7,18 October 2021,"The Halloween sequel of 2018, fulfills what it promised in the logic of both its title and the transition of which Halloween Kills is part.I start by saying that, although the opinions of the critics are not helping it, the reality is that Halloween Kills is a correct movie that has a message beyond what everyone intends. In this sequel and in an intelligent way the film shows you that every act has a consequence and that the film is in charge of making it clear to you at all times.The justification of the title of the film really honors it, the account rises for the good of Michael and is unleashed by occupying his faithful friend and taking lives as a hobby on another day at the office. Blood, gore and knives is the feast we find throughout the entire footage and truly for Slasher lovers it will be the greatest ecstasy they can experience.Now the most important thing that the film contributes is the intelligence of its scriptwriters in providing us with a transition film with a fairly clear message and that the story and the acts are in charge of showing at all times that nothing is free, even for Myers himself. . That work is very well executed in the actions of the people of Haddonfield, which incidentally delivers a consistent social critique of the mass despair that can be seen from time to time out there. That is the great point and how effective it turns out to be in this sequel what is raised.A great point to highlight is the use of the survivors of 78 and that they are present not as a cameo but as a real participation within the film. To this we add the incorporation of new and interesting characters such as Little Joe and Big Joe. It's always nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis being Laurie. The participation of him in the background seems totally correct and coherent. What the film seeks to tell did not need Laurie in the foreground.A more than correct sequel, a successful transition film, which meets what it seeks to deliver and where to link what will be its final film. We have everything we look for in a Halloween and Myers movie, it is the twelfth installment and that Halloween Kills does not forget.",Halloween Kills

652,tbiegalski-1,Critics missed the point,10,23 October 2021,"Maybe not all critics missed the point but a lot did. Yes this film could be considered ""a mess"". It's certainly chaotic and very frenetic. But that's kinda the point. Myers has thrown the town into chaos and turned its citizens into monsters. And that's half of what it is about - how good people do horrible things when they stop exercising rational thought and act on emotion only (just look at Facebook). They ignore details and do terrible things in the name of self righteousness. I absolutely loved that.The other half is just the kills. I mean, this is a slasher movie, and one of the best. Unlike the previous film it doesn't focus on character development, or Laurie's relationships with her family (although that is there a little). It focuses on a monster and how he turns others into monsters. And it's extremely atmospheric and scary and the newly added music is awesome. I liked it better than it's predecessor. Of course I am a genre fan. If you are looking for drama or character development look elsewhere. It was never supposed to be about that. It's as close to perfect as a slasher film can get.",Halloween Kills
653,tylerkirks08,Carnage and laughs,6,16 October 2021,"This movie is a mixed bag. Very strong intro, brutal kills, great flashbacks and atmosphere. The writing and subplots left much to be desired. A bit too much humor thrown in without balanced tension and suspense. The final 20 minutes of Halloween 2018 were superb, and this follow-up did not reach those heights. This installment, which in my opinion is vastly better than most entries (5, H20, Resurrection, remakes, Curse of) does not reach upper echelon of the cannon with it's plot being all over the place, an overdone hospital non-Myers mob chase, and too many theater laughs. I hope they go back to the drawing board and search for that elusive Carpenter-suspense. All in all 6/10.

I would also like to point out that it wasn't as gory as some say. I've seen some gore in movies and this is half way there, which is perfect balance. Film makers did a great job on this one.

To be frank, this film doesn't have a story. The whole thing is just inconsequential filler only there to set up the final film. Legit the only plot point that actually impacts the continuous story or central characters happens right at the end, nothing before that actually matters.This is my problem with so many preplanned franchises and cinematic universes.

So disappointed because I had been looking forward to it for months.I love horror movies, Halloween the original is a classic. I enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis reprising her role in the 2018 one. That one was pretty good, so I was interested in seeing how they would continue the story. Especially bringing back other original cast members.Luckily I had Peacock, if I had paid for this hot garbage I'd be furious. This was basically a set up for a third installment. Nothing happens... just people making the most ridiculous choices leading to their death. The whole town knows Michael Meyers is out killing people, so some decide to go after him. With Dumb weapons like a baseball bat. Others hear him in their house and instead of going out the door, they go upstairs to fight him. It's almost like they watched Scream and followed the slasher movie formula to the letter.There is also a dumb side story of an escaped murderer, who is mistaken for Michael Meyers, though he looks nothing like him and doesn't wear a mask!Finally we get to the terrible anticlimactic ending. Which couldn't get more unrealistic and stupid if it tried. All so they can tee us up for a third movie.Oh and Jamie Lee Curtis, the star of the movie, is in it for about 5 minutes. She basically spends the entire movie recovering in the hospital.",Halloween Kills
663,seattlebruin,Why is Danny McBride making Halloween movies?,1,17 October 2021,"I saw the original when it came out. It astonishes me that David Gordon Green and Danny McBride profess to love the original and do nothing whatsoever to capture even an inkling of its essence. Gross, stupid, incompetent execution, and a big middle finger to the aforementioned two for saying they love the original and for delivering a bad slasher movie. Like all the sequels they get worse with each successive one. 2018 was ok, this was terrible. I shudder to think what the third will be with these two at the helm.Imagine if the story just ended, as John Carpenter intended, with Loomis looking over the balcony and he was gone and we all had to wonder forever what happened to the boogeyman instead of having it sullied over and over with these putrid sequels.",Halloween Kills

Considering how decent the last one was this one just retroactively ruins the ending of 'Halloween 2018'.We basically have two different movies mashed together for the first hour and twenty minutes of run time that converges together in some mega cringe 'how many people can we kill as fast as possible to make the movie have a lot of deaths' at the end.The first half hour to forty minutes of the movie is ""ok"" aside from the completely unnessesary cameo from Kyle Richards (she cannot act and disappears half way into the movie thankfully). There is one kill that is actually so dumb and out of left field I burst out laughing because it really is just one of the dumbest kills ever put into a movie (woman dressed up as a nurse, you'll know when it happens)After the semi decent first part of the movie we waste the entire middle portion of the movie in a hospital where literally nothing plot relevent happens and it just seems to hang there for forever. I actually had to pause the movie at several parts because of this and almost didn't finish it because it just goes on FAR too long, it's not interesting, it's not fun and it's not enjoyable.The last ten or twenty minutes are again decent but it's just quick kill after quick kill for no reason. Like if you saw 'It 2' where they bully Pennywise to death it's very similar in tone and super cringe. It's quite jarring and at no point aside from Micheal Myers and Laurie appearing does it feel like a Halloween movie, You could sub in literally any faceless person in Myers' role and it wouldn't have made a difference.Honestly I wasn't expecting much just some fun mindless entertainment but I didn't get any outside of the Micheal McDonald cameo.It seems with the ending they're planning on another unnessesary sequel which if they decide to fine but please get someone else to direct and write the story they're severely lacking in suspense, cool kills and likable characters you want to root for.",Halloween Kills

The suspense comes and goes. The acting is exactly what you have come to expect.I honestly cannot say whether or not it's ""good""; That is completely subjective. It's another movie in the Halloween franchise. You know the drill. If this is your brand of Halloween candy, you will enjoy yourself for the duration.

The acting is AWFUL and the cheesy one liners...whoever wrote those into the script should be hunted down and killed by Michael Myers themselves lol.For a franchise that if thought about really well could actually be a really decent new brand of horror...instead it's just the same old same old.Incredibly disappointed, but I guess I wasn't expecting much anyway!

It has plenty of good gore and kills, and is rather entertaining. I will say though, the characters are very dumb, and the story is kind of a filler.Overall, a below average horror flick, but if you're just looking for a dumb slasher, this is the movie for you.",Halloween Kills

The dialogue is horrific, the acting is horrific and the story is horrific.Good horror are movies like the original Halloween, Jeepers Creepers, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Childs Play and original films like that. When you try to remake/reboot those films.. they're supposed to have the same vibe. But they don't they're just all syfy movies that don't work or make sense. The stupidity in Halloween Kills is too much.. yes other horror films have dumb characters but the characters in Halloween Kills takes it to the next level.""What do you expect from a horror film?"" Uhh... hello? I'm expecting proper writing, dialogue, good acting, and a promising story. It's Halloween... not some random syfy film... yes I'm expecting it to be at least worth watching like 2018!

In between the kill scenes are segments that feel like a Lifetime movie and an awful angry mob sub-plot, including its unlikable leader, that makes up a large portion of the film.This continues in the tired, played out tradition of immortal star boogeyman kills a bunch of shallow, ridiculously dim, and often unlikable characters that ruined the genre in the 80s (though movie studios pushed it because they had a steady, mostly teenager boy, fan base who'd pay to see that formulaic crap as they cheered on the boogeyman). The genre, including the original Halloween, was better in the 70s when it was about some mystery and mood, there were a few gruesome ones like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but they stood out as almost their own thing as it wasn't just one star killer. The slasher genre was inspired by an Italian horror-mystery genre called ""giallo"" and highly recommend watching the top recommended films in that genre, or just rewatching the original Halloween, rather than wasting time on awful, formulaic movies like this.The two positives are that some of the scenes are well done visually and the soundtrack.",Halloween Kills

I would it would be my third favorite in the entire halloween saga after the original and the 2018 version.The movie starts out with Officer Hawkins reflecting back on him and his partner hunting Michael Myers on Halloween in 1978.After confronting Michael, Hawkins accidentally kills his partner and is guilty ridden about preventing Dr. Loomis from killing Michael.The movie then flash forwards to the original cast (now middle aged and older) at a bar. Tommy Doyle tells the chilling tale of
what happened that Halloween night in 1978. They then hear on the news that Myers is out again, and has committed several
homicides.The rest of the movie is Michael murder stomping people in Haddonfield on Halloween night, 2018. Michael's return to Haddonfield
divides the town, with those wanting the police to deal with him and with those wanting to kill of Myers themselves.Edit: I like how the haters are crying about JLC not being the premise of the film. The film is about MICHAEL MYERS, not Laurie Strode, Sam Loomis, Sheriff Hawkins or any other character. Besides I like how MM really just thinks of Laurie as an afterthought in this series. It's makes him creepier knowing that he picks his victims at random.The ending was pretty cool and I look forward to seeing Halloween ends in 2022.",Halloween Kills

If you are a slasher film groupie and shout 'hell yeah!' at any gore you see on screen, fill yer boots as they say.If you have any working cells that allow you to consider basic logic, maybe not a film for you. A movie so frustrating in its laziness. So inept in its scenarios that it leaves you open mouth that functioning adults made this. No horror cliche is missed, not one person in the whole story has any basic sense. Not horror-sense of hyper awareness... just sense. So they become fodder for the gore king. Characterisation isn't simply telling us who they are one by one. That's child story book levels. From the decision to walk towards a car face on with Mr Myers at the wheel, to filling a bag with bricks as a weapon (how does she even lift that?)and then the oddness of everyone being so slow to react at any point... then to make a pretty idiotic decisions. It's an editing mess even aside from the plot and characterisation.For anyone to consider any form of double tap? Lazy lazy lazy.

Three.They must have all just come up with visual ideas, agreed and then forgot to make a consistent story.I'm glad Tommy died. He was a stupid character. But every character was stupid in this film.'40 years ago a mad man escaped from a mental hospital. It was the night before Halloween three teenage girls were walking home from Haddonfield High, they had sightings of a ghost like figure creeping through town. A man in a white mask. Or was it more than a man. It was watching them. Before the night was over three people were murdered..... Etc etc'
Now that is either badly written or the lines were read wrong because that makes the events of the original happen on Halloween Eve. I need to read the script to see which.Also Tommy crouching over the body of the other escaped mental patient.'he's always worn a mask. How do we know its not him?'

Moustapha Akkad's name finally in the same font and just finally something that came as close to the original 1978 horror as ive ever seen. The opening scene even plays homage to the 1978 opening scene where Michaels parents come home and they just all freeze and stare at
him. Now if they just did this for the first orginal sequal other then Rob Zombies garbage then we might be onto something. There is a Reason why all the sequels have gotten worse and worse since the original. When you try to add complexity to a simplex movie and try to understand the reasoning why Michale Myers Never dies then you have just destroyed any hopes of this movie being anywhere close to more then 1 star. When you have the nerd from
Breakfast club in a horror sequal screaming Evil dies tonight, Im sorry but this then became a comedy which is the reason why David Gordon Green should of stayed. He has no right to direct, produce or be involved in any Halloween sequels. If there is anybody out there that saw this move and thought that this was in any ""Shape"" Good, Scary, or thought provoking then you never really understood or knew why the original was a classic. You are probably a Millennial with no sense of simplicity, true terror, thematic horror, cinematic eye pleasing scenes. This movie was pretty much a bunch of clips thrown together to ensure that it made its release for October which is the only thing this garage did right. Jamie Lee
Curtis has just got to stop being in the sequels and stop embarrassing herself. If you watch her in the original and then watch her non sense performances of her past two performances she has completely forgot what Halloween stands for and why we remember every line she said.I cant even begin to tell you one line she said as trust me you dont want too. This is a mess and the only thing it Kills is two hours of my life that i want back. Seriously dont go or see this movie if you are a true Halloween 1978 fan and understand why you cant ever try to Kill Michael Myers but please stop these sequels as that is what Kills me and David Gordon Green you dont get horror or know what it means to be a director that knows what he is doing.

He just too damn, hmm, smart? No.. fast? No... anyway, he just can't be caught!As the review title suggests, several scenes in the movie are just plain dumb, for instance, the 'big John, little John' scene. John has just witnessed his partner being murdered, and now stands behind Michael in the room. Rather than fleeing, he just stands there and says a ridiculous line 'Michael, you've come home'. Michael turns around, walk to him slow, and kills him - still, no attempt to flee.'WTF' moments such as this are amply peppered throughout the movie.Then, as the town folk realise Michael is killing them off, the chant 'evil dies tonight' begins. This continues ad nauseam.The final stretch of the movies sees the moronic locals corner Michael, and shoot and stab him to death - yay.Enter Laurie, Michael is pure evil, ya hear'... Michael gets up and kills all 30 or so locals without breaking a sweat, and goes back to his stroll.We then close out the movie with Michael suddenly killing Laurie's daughter, which just seemed to be out of place - as if they forgot she was supposed to die somewhere in the movie and forgot about it, so it's just kind of 'jammed in' at the end.The seemingly constant stupidity of the everyone in this film made this movie almost unbearable, perhaps Michael is doing us a favour by killing them all off.",Halloween Kills

Things just happen, subplots aren't executed cleverly enough for the audience to feel any tension, and it adds too little to the lore of The Shadow.To be fair, it does justice to the title: Michael kills a lot of people and has some gore techniques that were kinda absent from the previous 2018 film. But that's as far as a positive I can give this movie though.This is the second chapter of a new trilogy. Ok.

Halloween Kills is not a Aliens or Terminator 2 its poor for its lack of imagination and if it had nothing to do with the Halloween franchise would just of been another slasher movie with an robot killing machine but in saying that the idea was good to expand the original film but after that poor with a good original idea but it then fell into what do 25 to 35 year olds want to see

Jamie Lee Curtis also falls short in the scenes that she is even in. Jamie's lines seem to be somewhat disingenuous and not delivered well and that goes for Tommy, Karen and other characters. Another major flaw includes the tone of this film, it feels like down right satire sometimes from the deaths to the mob mentality and trite chanting. Also, can the writers decide if Michael can or cannot die? He got beat to death by the mob and then at the last second he automatically resurrects because the writers need a sequel.

I imagine that if you liked that movie, you'll probably like this one as well. I'm sure you're familiar with the drill. Michael Myers kills a bunch of people, the end.Here is my problem with this movie. For things to happen as they do, every single character in this movie must do the dumbest thing possible. People are literally throwing themselves into Michael Myers' path to be murdered when they could easily avoid it. People go off, alone, in a house to go looking for him. They never have a chance. When they have the opportunity to call for backup, they don't. When they have a gun that they can use to shoot him, they don't even try to get a good shot and just shoot wildly. Even when they are like two feet away, they can't hit him. They are worse shots than the stormtroopers from Star Wars. Even when they do have an opportunity to take him out, they totally blunder it by letting up and by getting in close to fight, one by one. This movie even goes back in time to come up with new scenes showing people making the dumbest choices possible. Michael Myers just keeps going about his business, and all of these people go out of their way to get murdered by him. Everyone in this town is a moron.

735,dylanlbasham,A slight letdown after the last film.,6,16 October 2021,"Halloween Kills feels like a filler episode of a soap opera television show. I enjoyed the last installment and went into this one hoping to do the same. However, this film seems too distracted with strung out moments and horrible character decisions. The ending seemed to try to add something to the lore, but even then it didn't know exactly what it wanted to add. Either way, it was far too late into the film. I'm interested to see how the next one turns out because it seems they saved all the good moments for that one. There were some positives though. Allison's character is going down a path that I'm interested in seeing in the next film. Plus the kills in this film are amazing, but given the title I'd expect that. Halloween Kills is certainly a mess, but at least you're getting Michael Myers doing what he does best.",Halloween Kills

This movoe delivers everything you could possibly want from a Halloween movie while elevating it in familiar directions while also breaking new ground.The flashbacks in this movie are worth the price of admission alone. Going back into the 78' movie is a stroke of genius and something no other entry has dared to do before. It pays off in later moments in the movie too.David Gordon Green and company must be commended for not just rehashing old ground completely. Sure there are moments of yeah i have seen this before and yet he manages to make some interesting choices. Taking chances that Michael Myers hasnt done before.This is brutal and gory in equal measure and gives you everything you would want!Ignore the critics, this is made for fans by fans and Halloween Kills it...really really wel!!!",Halloween Kills

I've seen the original script and I would've prefer that but some parts in the movie would have been a good addition to the plot.Some characters offers no point in the story. I wonder why they even brought them back.,Halloween Kills
741,aaronsherrod,Did what it wanted to do.,7,19 October 2021,"This film is a respectable 2nd film of trilogy. Great acting (for the most part), great kills, great practical effects, and some enjoyable characters. Yes, the writing could be better (Specifically in the 2nd act) but the 1st and 3rd act really make the movie work, and actually become one of the better films of the franchise. Micheal Myers is the greatest horror slasher of all time, and this movie solidified that in my opinion.",Halloween Kills
742,brianjamez,Adds nothing of value. Doesn't make a lot of sense.,1,16 October 2021,"A score of 1 seems a bit severe, but I got absolutely nothing from watching this movie. The acting was weirdly bad, the incompetence of everyone was comedic (one character dies by accidentally shooting themself in the face). Jamie Lee Curtis is billed as the lead character but she's in a hospital bed the entire movie. We're so far into the franchise that they don't bother with suspense anymore. We don't see glimpses of Michael in the background. Instead we just zoom in on him and put him front and center.This entire movie was made for nostalgia purposes. So half the movie is like ""I'm Steve Jones, the guy who you saw in Halloween 3. And that's Susan Smith from part 5. Remember?"" And the plot seems to be that this old geriatric nobodies are going to kill Myers with baseball bats and hockey sticks, despite the fact that we've seem him take hundreds of bullets and burn in fire and still be fine.And the lesson seems to be that we can't kill Michael because he lives in us. Or something similarly vague, thrown out as a narration toward the end. This is proven by a bizarre hospital scene where people act like zombies from 28 Days Later. They're running around, smashing windows and falling down stairs trying to kill someone who clearly isn't Michael Myers.A few other things that were stupid:1. They do another Myers face reveal and he's just some old guy with a goatee. Are you telling me that this immortal evil force trims his beard in his spare time?2. Haddenfield is an unusual mix of rednecks, black people, and flaming homosexuals. Kind of an odd composition for a small town in Illinois.3. People still do that thing where people are being killed and they just stand there a few feet away going ""No! Please no! Stop!""Several people left the theater before the movie was over. The little kid behind me said ""It wasn't even scary"" while we were walking out. I would have to agree. At least the trailer for Black Phone was awesome.",Halloween Kills
743,nizarsalim,Halloween Goes Down. But there are Some Good Sides.,6,26 October 2021,"Halloween 2018 is a lot better than Halloween Kills. But this does not mean that the latter is so bad. Halloween Kills has positive sides, its atmosphere, tense moments, soundtrack, brutality and violence, the performances of the cast (especially those who play Michael, Allyson, and Karen), the references to the original movie, Halloween 1978 (and even other Halloween movies which are not connected to this movie now), and the 105 minutes runtime, which is quick, strict to the point, and not boring at all. I almost felt that they were only 10 minutes in the theatre.But when it comes to the flaws, Halloween Kills has a lot of flaws. First, the person who watches the movie can notice the low production values when it comes to the direction, screenplay, and cinematography. It can also be noticed that there is a huge downgrade when we want to compare it to Halloween 2018. Second, the movie brings the idea that Michael is not a normal human being. He is ""something supernatural"". To be honest, I do not like this idea at all, and from my own point of view, this is one of the main reasons why this movie got a lower rating than Halloween 2018. It would have been better if they kept the realistic side like the 2018 movie. The ending would have been a lot better if Michael, after being brutally attacked by the mob and Karen, was caught and imprisoned again. Third, Laurie and officer Hawkins do not have any major and effective roles in this movie because all they do is that they are in the hospital because of what happens in the 2018 movie. They do not have any confrontation with Michael. Forth, the person who watches Halloween Kills can feel that if Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills were one movie which is 211 minutes long (106 minutes for Halloween 2018 and 105 minutes for Halloween Kills), it would have been a lot better because it can be felt that Halloween Kills is more to be a direct continuation to Halloween 2018, not a sequel. Fifth, and finally, when Michael apparently killed Karen and the film ended, I got so surprised and almost thought that there is a trick (that there is a continuation after some credits) because the point where the film ends is not suitable to its events. It leaves the person so confused and so many questions unanswered. So when it comes to the score, I give Halloween Kills 6 out of 10.",Halloween Kills
744,cortlanhylkema,It's different for a slasher,7,7 November 2021,"In my opinion Halloween Kills was really surprisingly good. Most slashers are blan and boring, there is almost never a story, and it's just mostly killing. I feel like they put a lot more effort in this movie like the characters, story, score, and gore also kills. Like when they get the town to get together to kill Michael. I don't think I would ever be so sad by a slasher. That man that escaped the mental hospital it was gut wrenching and sad it also made us root for the characters. The twist at the end after they think they killed Michael was dark and twisted and I did not see it coming and it got me excited for the next Halloween.",Halloween Kills

Well, this entire movie was that. Everything from the scene cuts being harsh and abrupt, to the main characters delivering the films exposition like a cannon ball to the face. But if you were to cut the movie down to only Michael's brutal kills, I'd rewatch it. At least that part of the story makes sense compared to the writing and motivations of every single character in this movie.Want a drinking game that will put you in the hospital? Take a shot every time someone says ""40 years ago"" or ""evil dies tonight.""4/10 only because Michael was done well.",Halloween Kills

750,christianroedmeier,ONE OF THE BEST HALLOWEEN SEQUELS,9,15 October 2021,I enjoyed this movie alot. I enjoyed that it tried to be different from Halloween (2018) so it didn't just feel like the same movie . Obviously it takes place where the last left off but it feels like it takes a different direction and actually tries to explore its characters even if it foes kill alot of them off. Including returning characters from the original. Aside from the brutality of this movie which is far exceeding of any of the other movies including even Rob zombies halloween. My favorite section of the movie is the flash back scenes. It feels like they knew how to recreate the original. The feeling of the filming. The look of Michael. The characters new and old. DR FREAKING LOOMIS comes back for a small role by a very outstanding look alike. I wont spoil much more but if you liked the original 78 halloween and Halloween 2018 then this movie will meet your expectations.,Halloween Kills
751,joey_lowey,Halloween killed,5,23 October 2021,"My love for the first Halloween film stems from a very early age, it was the idea of a man that's pure evil, something animal like that just acted on impulse really fascinated me.So when the remake was announced after the Zombie era I was excited. The first film was enjoyable especially for the fans of the original I think.So I was going into the second with high hopes and the first hour wasn't a disappointment, the flash backs, the detail from the first film and seeing Dr Loomis was amazing but I'm afraid after that it went down hill from there.....but fast.I think logic went out of the window, so many flaws and not enough time to explain them. The gore and jumps were there but surely there has to be some reason behind it and for me the direction was a complex irrational mess. Sometimes just keep it simple, it's the elusiveness of Micheal we love.Well the ending honestly made me contemplating not watching Halloween Ends as it was that bad but as a fan I won't be able to help myself but its left me not looking forward to it.To conclude it was a wonderful start but unfortunately ruined by too much in your face horror and a illogical storyline. For me what makes Micheal the most horrifying character of all time is his evil we don't see which makes our imagination manifest.",Halloween Kills

I was very disappointed to say the least. There were too many characters added to the mix that were absolutely unnecessary. The focus of the movie wasn't on Jamie Lee Curtis, or Judy Greer. (The two ""main"" characters of the movie). They barely had any lines and the lines that they had were just repeated throughout the movie, and frankly the lines made them both annoying . JAMIE LEE CURTIS DOESNT SEE MICHAEL THE ENTIRE MOVIE. The entire plot of the movie was random individuals with very minimal relation to Michael (abruptly added to the plot with an out of no where opening scene) dying to his hand. No character development anywhere in regards to important characters. Nothing learned. I wish I skipped this movie and just watched the final (better be the final) movie that comes out in a couple of years. Save your money!!! The only important part of this movie was SPOILER ALERT HEAVILY: the last minute of the movie when Judy Greer dies. I'd want to die off if I were Judy too because of how lousy this film was. The only reason why I gave this movie a 4 was because yes it is a decent slasher film even though it's just random people dying. But dammit I want it to add to the main plot.",Halloween Kills

Really looking forward to the finale next year...With new characters coming in, and some old characters resurfacing, plenty of shocks and keeps you gripped from beginning til the end!Go see the movie and make your own mind up...

757,presleytuck,Absolute Garbage,1,22 October 2021,"I don't understand how this franchise has lasted this long. It needs to end because this movie is horrible. Nothing about this movie makes sense. Their is no story at all. It's simply a blood bath with filler in between each kill. Seriously, Michael just goes around killing random people in ridiculous ways, and the rest of the movie is made up of senseless garbage around the town. Somehow Michael Myers doesn't die. This dude is invincible! He can be stabbed 10 times, shot 5 times, and beaten senseless, but don't worry, he'll get up and keep killing everyone in his way! It gets to the point of being funny that he doesn't die. And can someone tell me why he kills everyone? Is he mad at the world or what? It's just a ridiculous movie and a ridiculous franchise.

But as the wait came closer and closer, what was once a pleasure as a Halloween fan now became a bore. But that's not to say that this film isn't good. The opening to the mid-end came strong but as the ending approached, my hype for this movie dramatically decreased. You'd think that characters that are brought back would have a certain purpose but just serves a cannon fodder for the next movie. In my opinion, the ending felt rushed and was not thought thoroughly. Other than that, Kills perhaps stands as one of my top favorite Halloween movies, and is the good this long overdue franchise has to offer. I'd also consider watching '78 and 2018 first before watching Kills unless you know every detail of its predecessor.",Halloween Kills
760,ModernDayRenaissanceMan,Michael Myers = John Wick and the Equalizer,6,16 October 2021,"I have been anticipating watching Halloween Kills for a few months now and I was excited that it was about to come out just in time for Halloween. Even better, I got to see it in the comfort of my own home with Peacock. Boy, was I disappointed. Yes, it was entertaining like most of the Halloween movies but I expected better.The movie goes back and forth from different time frames to try to tell the history of how the legend of Michael Myers started. The problem with that is that they have changed up the story from all the previous movies made that leaves you in some sort of confusion. Why couldn't they have just kept it the same? Remember, we as viewers must forget that H20 ever happened and Jamie Lee Curtis never had a son in Josh Hartnett. Ok, I'm not going to get into all that convoluted mess.Michael storms out of the fires of the burning home ready to battle as if he was a hybrid, better version of John Wick and the Equalizer. He's moving more agile and taking on all comers simultaneously. I did NOT enjoy that. The man is supposed to be in his 60s for crying out loud! It was exaggerated and didn't blend well with how he usually does his kills. Anthony Michael Hall goes around carrying a bat as if that's going to do anything to Myers knowing how much of an unstoppable force he is. The healthcare workers are running around like Trump supporters storming the Capital trying to kill the escapee from the insane asylum thinking it's Michael. They portray the police officers to be these gullible people that have had no training whatsoever and no control of the situation.I will give the movie credit in the gore factor. It turned it up a notch compared to previous films. The story telling aspect was solid too when it was in its present tense. I will not believe for one second that Michael will have difficulty battling a teenaged girl that weighs no more than 100 lbs.; compared to all the other obstacles he's faced. For some odd reason he's unable to kill the granddaughter. The daughter lures Michael to the mob that's ready to end him on site. Apparently they haven't been paying attention the last 40 years or else they would know that it will take a lot more than that to kill him. A few gun shots and hits with a piece of lumber are love taps for this immortal beast. Why can't they just dismember him and cut off his head!? If he comes back from that then I don't know what else can be done. Jamie Lee Curtis seems to sit this one out (she's hurt and had surgery) to get prepared for, yeah, you guessed it, Halloween Ends coming out in 2022. Will I watch it? Most likely. Will I be disappointed, again? Probably, but this is what happens when you've grown up on such a classic horror movie franchise. It's a good watch but there's just so many things they could've done different to give it a more realistic, sinister feel. I gave it an overall rating of 6 = C.",Halloween Kills
761,joshuapiasky,Good but not great,5,25 October 2021,"It was good but not as subtle as the 2018 continuation. If the intention was to have Halloween to come off more b-monster movie then retro slasher flick, it stuck the landing. It was more visceral, which was fun. The tempo was beefed up, less plot, faster pace. Overall it was fun to watch and ranks up there in the series.

The movie, while I would say is just better than average has the overall feeling of being a Segway between Halloween 2018 to the inevitable sequel that we have come to expect. Leaving the unfortunate feeling of being a filler movie with no real direction.If you're a fan of B-Movie slashers and films with high production I can see you enjoying this film.

Though the kills were great, the story seemed to be all over the place trying it's best to include short lived characters. It felt heavy and honestly could've been the shortest Halloween film and done just fine. I do like the killer mob mentality as community thinking is real and dangerous.This installment brings Halloween 3 into continuity with the Shamrock masks yet H3 only references the original Halloween as if it were a movie in it's own universe. So look, if this is an intended sequel to the first Halloween, the silver shamrock mask reference was great buuuuut there couldn't have been much sense in writing that into the script. 7/10.",Halloween Kills
768,tincknelltyler,Disappointing sequel,5,18 October 2021,"After such a promising reboot of the series in 2018, the sequel Halloween Kills just never picked up where its predecessor left off. The plot, if you can say there is one, split into so many pointless and contrived directions with no fulfilling resolution.First, the positive. Michael Myers is a killing machine. The pinnacle of the film is Michael's slaying of an elderly couple early on: its merciless, sadistic, and gut-wrenching. You fear Michael and what he can do next. Unfortunately, much of the atmosphere and mystique surrounding the Shape as he stalks his prey in previous installments is missing from this film.What the first movie did so well is missing altogether in Halloween Kills. The connection between Michael and Laurie is only briefly glanced over in the closing moments, as Jamie Lee Curtis is regulated almost entirely to a hospital bed. Rather than developing the relationship with the Strode women, we get side characters, who we have little reason to care about, serving themselves up as Michael's next victims; their series of stupid decisions test the audience's patience and intelligence.Halloween Kills feels like a film made because a trilogy was ordered by the studio. The only purpose it served was to bring gory kills and act as a stepping stone to a meaningful plot in Halloween Ends. Hopefully, the series returns to form in 2022.",Halloween Kills

771,JasonDrake8,Evil Dies Tonight,5,22 October 2021,"You could start a drinking game with the phrase above. Overused and exaggerated like the film itself. I was a big fan of 2018. I liked how it explored Laurie's trauma and what Michael means to her in the modern day.Kills derails and focuses on the town's reaction to Myers. While I liked the ""let's go after him"" mentality, it was very over-the-top and came off silly. It was especially disheartening to see that Tommy's actor was replaced yet they were able to bring back Lindsey's actress. Why not have her lead the mob then?I also found it hard to believe that 40 years later the town still talks about Myers. A kid in 2018 said it perfectly when he was comparing a few deaths to the tragedies his generation experiences today. It's understandable why Laurie can't move on, but the entire town? That felt very forced.There is a good movie in here somewhere. I think a lot of the problems come from the hospital where Laurie is sidelined and does absolutely nothing in the film. Then the focus shifts to Tommy who again is not the original actor.The kills themselves were decent but we're not that scary. My favorite scene was Myers vs the firefighters. It was well done and intense.I'm not sure how I feel about Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills

I had to rate this a 5/10 because of several issues I found with the film, and the feeling you get when you leave the cinema and aren't excited about what you just watched. That was me.I'm giving it a 5 because there was some plusses. Really good gore scenes (made me cringe at least), excellent atmosphere, good music, and a good usage of flashback scenes.The negatives I have are: Ridiculous amounts of clichés, bad acting, predictable plot, a bit over the top of comedy (most people in the theatre were laughing rather than ooos and ahhs), and really almost no serious plot to begin with.1.

We all or most of you know what a cliche is, and the feeling you have when one is said. It's a cringe sensation and these are several examples... eg. ""Whose there?"", ""Evil dies tonight!"", ""Is somebody there?"", ""Is someone in our house?"" so on and so fourth.2. Acting issues
Whenever you watch a film you can always tell something is off with the acting, or at least myself when I pay close attention to it. Most of the actors seemed very forced throughout the movie. My biggest pet peeve for some reason was Tommy. He gathers all of these people together to kill evil. He uses a signature baseball bat which was only used at the very end of the film. Also, he gets an entire town riled up and chases a mental hospital patient almost all the way up to the top floor. Keep in mind Karen has been screaming her lungs out saying it's not him, but that does nothing. The patient is scared to death and isn't even Michael Meyers, and the poor guy jumps off to his death to avoid the mob. Then when the guy is splattered on the ground, that's when Tommy realizes ""Oh my gosh, this isn't Michael Meyers!"" Then it goes to ""We've become the enemy we've sworn to destroy"" cliché. In my opinion the chase was a completely unnecessary element, and just was frustrating to even watch.3. Excessive comedic aspectNot really much to say here. I thoroughly enjoyed the it's and bits of laughs, but felt way too hip in certain parts for me to take the movie seriously. I loved the Big john/little john bits because I laughed my ass off, but then the extra killing didn't mix well with it.4. PlotSimply nothing to go home about. Laurie is in the hospital most of the film. The hospital scenes were excessively drawn out and the emotional aspects weren't believable. The plot was basically get the townspeople together to kill evil, and the sub plots are just fillers.5. ConclusionI rarely write reviews, but had to on this one. I was very hyped for it, but the 2018 Halloween blew this one out of the water. It's not a movie that will be memorable by my onw personal standards. It had it's pros, but mainly cons. I wouldn't recommend this to someone whose very serious about horror films, but if it's a Saturday night and nothing else is playing, and want a decent scary flick with some funny elements and gore, then go for it.",Halloween Kills

I think if this project had of been in better hands two things would have happened.1) The writers and the director would have had a better understanding of the original, and thus would have been more capable of expanding the thematic elements that worked so well for the original. And by extension have allowed it to remain a classic 40 years after the fact.2) It would not suffer from the chronic mistake of having a story that is both somehow completely none existant and yet increadably converluted. I truly don't know how they did that, but they succeeded to do both.Unfortunately this film had neither and they made the mistake the passive viewer may make.

I feel like some of the scenes were just there to make the movie go on. Some scenes felt really dull and felt rushed. I felt like the angles and shots of some of the scenes were a little weird and weren't as cinematic. There was this one scene where a insane patient was being chased down by a mob of people, and the people thought the insane patient was Michael, the scene went through a very awkward and weird slow motion shot of him falling that just felt cringy to watch. This movie felt more like a Michael bay movie than anything. It wasn't Creepy. But here's some good things about it, Michael Myers was a lot stronger. I thought Michael, being stronger made him more intimidating. There was this awesome scene where Michael Myers was standing in a bathroom and a man opened a door and Michael Myers quickly smashed the light in the bathroom, causing it to turn off as a cool jump scare. I thought that was awesome. I really liked the idea of people going after Michael instead of him going after them. I feel like it could of been excuted better tho.

792,shaymusgallagher,"This is a ""bridge"" movie...one that does not stand on its own.",6,15 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is a ""bridge"" movie - we get the aftermath of Halloween 2018, but they're also setting up things for Halloween Ends. So it doesn't feel like this movie stands alone or has a distinct identity, in a way that say, Halloween II (1981) does. It's not an encapsulated story that's neat and tidy, and that's probably the biggest thing working against it. You just walk away from it like it's missing 5-10 pages from the screenplay. Plus a Halloween movie where Laurie and Michael have no scenes together...how rewarding can that be?The things that worked (at least for me) are the score, the connectivity to the 1978 film, and Michael's look and presence. I don't hear many people complaining about the mask...for a change. The kills are superfluous, but it's all right there in the title, so you can't be surprised. I'll refrain from commenting on the 1978 stuff. But I really appreciate the inclusion of Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis. Although if you paid any attention to the trailer, he was in it for a second, so no chance of being wowed by that cameo.What didn't work for me was how they shoehorned the H1 characters into a ""support group"" at the bar. Maybe Tommy and Lindsey would have kept in touch, but Marion? I don't think so. Plus the way she went out was super lame. They could have at least given her an opportunity to shoot Michael in the arm. But she would have needed additional ""Chambers"". Ba dum tsss. And poor Sheriff Bracket! They didn't even get any scenes with Laurie. The mob stuff was boring to me, but I think we can all agree that seeing Anthony Michael Hall die onscreen is always a good thing.It was OK. Not profound and it didn't add anything new. But not a total sh**fest either. It will inevitably stay in the 6.0s on iMDB and that's probably accurate.",Halloween Kills

The performances of the cast is amazing, although seeing Jamie for only 15 minutes in the entire movie was a letdown. This movie is amazing for viewers wanting to see the blood and gore that is Micheal Myers, but for fans that rely on the story, it sadly does nothing to elevate it.",Halloween Kills

Tommy Doyle's (Anthony Michael Hall- why??) vigilante justice mission was cringeworthy.The only time I felt tension was when Lindsay Wallace (Kyle Richards) faced Michael.

797,terrywatt69,"Worse than Halloween 2018, which I was only lukewarm about...",3,16 October 2021,"Longtime fan of the series, literally going back to 1978. Hallloween Kills...what a disjointed, unsatisfying, self-reverential, overlong, needlessly gory mess. Let's see...Jamie Lee Curtis is probably in the movie for all of twenty minutes - a couple minutes here, a couple minutes there, mostly confined to a hospital bed - and the Laurie Strode character doesn't encounter Michael Myers once in this installment. Will Patton returns from Halloween 2018, and also has about twenty minutes of screen time, virtually all of which is delivered from a hospital bed next to Laurie's. There's a lot of dialogue spouted by various characters about how mythical and unstoppable Myers is. There are plenty of kills, with a blood and guts factor that exceeds even the worst of the gorefest Zombie entries into the franchise. Unfortunately, Halloween Kills suffers from an excess of characters and subplots, so most of these kills involve victims the viewer hasn't had enough time to invest an emotional attachment to, thus who cares when they get murdered? I counted no less than 5 executive producers, three screenwriters and three people working on the musical score in the opening credits. Probably a case of too many chefs ruining the stew, But Halloween Kills along with Halloween 2018 certainly prove that having Jamie Lee Curtis attached to the franchise guarantees nothing in terms of a semi-decent flick. I spent the last thirty minutes yawning and rolling my eyes, waiting for the movie to end. Three stars mostly for the obligatory fan service in bringing back some of the lesser characters from the 1978 flick in grown-up roles, along with some flashbacks to 1978 involving the police capture of Myers on Halloween night 1978. Even if I cobbled together the parts of Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills that I liked, I still couldn't composite together a flick I enjoyed as much as, say, Halloween 4 1988. So how could I rate Halloween Kills any higher than I possibly did? Even with Halloween 2018, as bad as that one was, I didn't spend the last half hour of that flick bored and eagerly awaiting the movie to end.",Halloween Kills
798,Glib_Smed,Wanted to walk out,1,7 October 2021,"I caught this at a preview and, if there weren't people I knew at the screening, I would have gotten up and walked out. Sure, you can say films like 5 & 6 are worse, but at least they were trying to do something. This film has no story. It plays it safe by merely being Michael doing this and Michael doing that. Oh, look at how cool we shot him against the fire! Lets throw in Laurie saying the same piece of dialogue 50 times for no real reason other than because we got Jamie Lee Curtis in the house! I mean, the film is simply something piecemealed together with its priority being to avoid any and all fan backlash. Yes, the mask is good. Yes, lots of Easter eggs for The Fans to feel pride over catching. Hurray for fan service! But as a film. Ugh. So many close ups I was thinking to get a seat in the back row in the hope of preventing the headache I was getting. And what's with all the tripe attempts at humanization? I laughed at the horrible acting of the mom rushing into the hospital to find out about her son. And who goes to a slasher movie to see something like that? Well, maybe if it was handled by a better director it would be worth something. But the very worst thing is the gore and the killings. They are nearly all total cop outs. In a slasher film, the kill is the spectacle. It's an important part of the package. The kills in this were like some kind of PG crap made to seem like R. Like when a kid was killed. Only, you don't see the kid killed. You just see Michael holding a mask and are told it was a kid's mask. As for all the 10 star reviews, I guess they're just part of the PR budget. Give the movie a month and it'll be down to the 5.5~6 range (buoyed that high only by the undiscriminating diehards).",Halloween Kills
799,gak5,Halloween Kills (2021) (My Thoughts & Non-Spoiler Review,10,16 October 2021,"I saw this highly anticipated sequel to Halloween (2018) last night and wasn't a bit disappointed. This movie shows in vivid detail why Michael Myers and his story have remained scary, mysterious, and intriguing to moviegoers for all of these decades. If I can sum up this movie, I'd first say that it's pretty much a ""love letter"" to all fans of the original Halloween (1978 film) with its use of flashback scenes illustrating moments not captured in the original Halloween. And I must say, the director, David Gordon Green and his talented film crew did a phenomenal job with turning back the clock and giving those scenes the exact look, creepiness, and authenticity that were needed to make you- the audience feel as though you were actually watching additional scenes not shown in Halloween (1978). Because of those flashback scenes, the movie has a more intimate take on how Michael has terrorized the small town of Haddonfield for all these years. So when the townspeople of Haddonfield receive news of the murders he committed earlier that night (Halloween 2018), the town goes into a state of panic. This movie does a really good job of making this spread of fear seem real and believable with its use of prominent actors joined along with a great magnitude of extras cast as the rest of the people of Haddonfield. That alone made the movie feel like more than your typical slasher film. Though her role was not as prominent as it was in Halloween (2018) Jamie Lee Curtis still did a decent job as Laurie Strode in this movie. She showed an elevated level of courage and deliberate urgency to kill Michael Myers and destroy ""evil"" once and for all while recovering from her injuries from earlier that night (Halloween 2018) in the hospital. As far as ""The Boogeyman"" himself, James Jude Courtney portrayed Michael Myers in the most disturbing, yet mythological way he's ever been portrayed. I would dare say that he is the scariest and best of all the actors who've ever played ""The Shape"" to this day. It wasn't just his look in full costume, but the way he moved and walked. He appeared to walk as though he was an unstoppable force more so than just a mortal man. It was really creepy and cool at the same time to see that onscreen. And as the title of the movie indicates, Halloween Kills! And boy, did it! Lol Well, Michael Myers does anyways! Lol What made this movie unique was that it was definitely a slasher film, but a slasher film with substance. A LOT of people died, but the gore and brutality of their deaths weren't just for the sake of shock value or mindless violence. They all were connected to the overall story in some way. The kills were slow, brutal, and shot in a somewhat realistic way which made them that much more disturbing. And the way Michael killed pretty much all of his victims was shown on screen with no camera cuts. It left nothing for the imagination. All deaths were shown in their entirety. 😱 Lol
So, this movie was great and it ends with a cliffhanger to keep you, the viewer curious and anxious to see how it all ends in the final installment to David Gordon Greens trilogy in Halloween Ends (2022).",Halloween Kills

I have to say, it was awesome to see so many cool practical effects. Round of applause on that front.The Shape was as intimidating and terrifying as I wanted him to be-until he wasn't. The unmasking of Michael Myers was a HUGE mistake. When will people learn that fear is such a personal thing and to not know what's behind the mask is a powerful tool. Halloween Kills shows much too much of Michael Myers-and frankly, he looked like a balding corporate moron from what I saw. Not scary at all. It completely took the magic away for me. Please, next time, do us a favor and do not show any distinguishing features.My other complaint was the scriptwriting. The dialogue was overwritten and cringy.

804,HDDeer,A Convoluted and Pointless But Entertaining Sequel,5,15 October 2021,"The pacing in this movie was bananas after the first 20 minutes, and obviously thats to be expected considering it takes place in the same night, but holy there was absolutely no breathing room.For the most part it was enjoyable, but this movie tries to shove all the other survivors in your face in a convoluted way, having old characters being related to characters from the first film with absolutely no mention to them.They try to get us to care about 15 different people and that just doesnt work, it reminds me a lot of TASM when they tried to shove peters parents in there along with everyone else and it just was too much. I had no emotions when any of the new characters had died, and that was due to the pacing, you cant just find ways to shoehorn characters in every way possible and expect the film to work. JLC took a backseat as a co-star of sorts in this film and it made it kind of boring, when you arent invested in certain characters how are we supposed to care when they die?Obviously theres going to be random deaths all over the place because its Michael Myers, but for majority of the film we focused way too much on tommy and co. And it felt like a load of filler contentIn terms of story progression, this movie did nothing outside of 5 minutes of dialog between laurie and the cop that may have slightly moved it along, but that couldve been done in a finale. Judy greers death was the only one that kinda got me, but again, in a movie that tries to make you care about 80 characters, its going to feel meaningless, and i dont feel impacted the same as i wouldve if she died in the first film.In terms of Michael surviving endless amounts of punishment, im fine with it, IF ITS WRITTEN WELL.But when there's 30 different people standing around, the firefighter scene, and the group scene at the end, it really irks me as a viewer that itll take michael about 30 seconds to kill 4 people, but what is everyone else doing? There were at least ten firefighters with weapons, but yet it seemed like they would fight 1on1, same when the group started to die, people would die without help. Like bro, there was about 20 of you standing there, jump on him.Its easy for viewers for to suspend their realism when watching a film like this, but at the very least only keep it to a 4v1, so its moderately realistic, not a 30v1Allison also aged a ridiculous amount in the matter of one hour, im not sure if these movies were filmed back to back, but dear god did it ever distract me. Makeup.Positives: Danny McBride put his mark on the movie and it was fantastic. The killings were enjoyable of course, and for the most part they were shot well. A lot of them were definitely good in terms of setting up a depressing environment, i.e, lauries neighbors, Camerons death, the patient jumping from the window. Good stuff.Overall though, this movie just felt like it wanted to show us Michael killing a bunch of people with nothing actually being added to any sort flow from the first one, at no point did i feel like Michael was going to die, and maybe that suffers from the 3rd one already being announced prior, and as much as i love a good slasher, i still think there needs to be purpose, and a story to follow, i did not feel that with this one.5.5/10.",Halloween Kills

It's extremly gory and takes an interesting approach to the traditional slasher formular when the townsfolk decide to turn the tables by hunting Michael instead of waiting for him to murder them all. There's also a nice little subplot, that shows how monstrous people can become when blinded by hatred and fear. The film also has some funny moments that will make people chuckle when they are not being grossed out by Michael's bloodthirsty rampage. We even get some nice background story from Michael's past that will make you wonder just exactly what made Michael the monster he is.

There's flashbacks at least trying to explain what happened so I wasn't fully in the dark. Everyone in this movie is immensely stupid and this is reflected in both their actions and their dialogue. They all try to kill Myers with a cheese knife or a paperclip, getting as close to him as possible and letting him escape for no good reason but forced suspense.So obviously, everyone gets killed. This was okay with me as I had no connection to these characters at all. In between the killing, the movie tries to act like more than it is, hitting us with ""profound"" messages like ""maybe we were the monsters all along"". It feels silly, laughable and most of all unnecessary. The impact is especially low when a crowd kills an innocent man and everyone just forgets about it seconds later, shrugging it off as a little mistake.The gore is fun but the kills are pretty uncreative. Everyone just gets knifed endlessly, surviving a hundred stab wounds just to gargle dramatically.All in all I enjoyed my popcorn more than the movie. 9/10 popcorn. 4/10 movie.",Halloween Kills
810,jisoldi,Please stop sequeling a Classic,2,16 October 2021,This was one of those movies where I ended up 30 minutes into it having it on in the background for noise. IMO the original 1978 picture was one of the best horror movies ever put on film. The constant tries to sequel this and remake it just come up short save for the Rob zombie directed version of 2007 which was done in traditional Rob zombie gore. 2 stars for this only for the flashbacks to Haddonfield in 1978 and giving Donald Pleseance the homage respect he deserved.,Halloween Kills
811,tinari75,Disappointing at best,1,23 October 2021,This is one of my favorite movie series of all time. I'd have to say that this was the worst one yet. The suspense of Michael chasing and pursuing his victims was just not there in this one. It wasn't really scary and left me feeling like I just wasted money. Jamie Lee Curtis was laughable as an old lady who thought she was a badass. The writing just wasn't there in this one. Hopefully the next one is better; but at this point I'll wait to Redbox it.,Halloween Kills
812,philipdustson,Pretty Good! (Pretty Flawed!!),6,20 October 2021,"'Halloween Kills' is a pretty darn good follow up to David Gordon Green's 2018 take on 'The Shape'. But it's definitely not a perfect film.Pros:
* The performances are top notch! Like the 2018 pic, the three female leads (Curtis, Greer & Matichak) continue to convey a realistic, traumatized tone towards the brutality. Conversely, Anthony Michael Hall chews the scenery in a most hammy fashion; he's great too!* The Kills!!! Oh man!!!! This entry is BRUTAL in it's depiction of violence!! I'm a gore-hound so I was loving it, but the squeamish have been warned!Cons:
* The dialogue is VERY ham-fisted, on occasion. The script, overall, is pretty incoherent* Pic does go into 'idiot plot' mode a little too often (characters splitting up when they should be staying together & wandering off alone)Overall:
David Gordon Green directs the hell out of this movie.I like the 'indie'/mumble-core/character driven dramedy elements he brings to this franchise; a unique fresh, slant DGG brings not only to the 'Halloween' franchise, but to the slasher genre as a whole.Over all, I was pretty darned satisfied and I look forward to the third & final installment in Green's Trilogy.",Halloween Kills
813,karelynnb,Absolutely ridiculously atrocious,1,14 October 2021,"No jump scares, just a poor excuse for pointless gore.... Michael Myers is (of course) completely indestructible even though he must be 60+ ... Makes no sense at all...",Halloween Kills
814,Cinemattix,This movie is HILARIOUS,1,17 October 2021,"The acting is so bad it feels like rehearsals, the weird shots and angles, the ridiculous cuts, the IDIOTIC dialogue, and whatever the hell Tommy is; this has to be a high school production.",Halloween Kills
815,romey20115,Ho hum,3,16 October 2021,Worth a watch just because it's a new flick in the franchise but all I really came away with is that the characters in this 2021 update are just as dumb as all the characters in every movie since the 1978 original.,Halloween Kills
816,kjetil-bjornstad,"Bad storyline, too much jabbering and feels low budget...",1,15 October 2021,"This feels like a low budget movie.... There is too much chatter and timeline swapping.. Sorry to say this feels nothing like any other Halloween movies that's been done recently.Some scenes he is ''there'' in the car driving, but you can't see him.. and the ''doctor outside the bar suddenly sees him..
There is just too much focus on the people in this movie, heavily focused.And Michael seems to have a minor part in this movie....
Feels very documentary, and on it's last legs, also feels like this is the final movie EVER going to be made.",Halloween Kills

818,doghouse-48273,Spectacular,3,10 October 2021,HK is beyond anything fan's could have wished for.We witness a MM so focused on his mission of killing that it easy to forget he's psychotic.His quarry of victims (and there are many) are no match for 40 years of built up rage.Superbly written with a well paced story that is plausible pitting strong character's against an overwhelming & determined evil.,Halloween Kills
819,lodekepollet,It's what you'd expect,7,22 October 2021,"I don't know why other people are so negative about this movie, it's a follow-up from the 2018 one and its basically the same: a slasher movie with a basic story in it. Idk what people expected when they went but it definitely shouldn't have been an amazing oscar worthy story.Its a fun movie with mindless killing, who cares.",Halloween Kills
820,kawecx,TERRIBLE!!!!!,1,16 October 2021,"This is not Michael Myers at alll!!!! He would not kill random people. Myers is drawn to Laurie and anyone who gets in his way to get to Laurie will die but with all these random killings it doesn't make any sense. So why the 3 stars? Because the Halloween theme song is the best and at least it's through out the movie. I am beyond disappointed! I turned it off. Too many characters and just too much going on. PLEASE if you have kids, do NOT show them this one. Halloween 1 and 2 and even 20 years later is better!!!!!!!!!",Halloween Kills
821,hannah-24827,"Waited three years, so excited, bit dissapointed.",5,16 October 2021,"I've been anxiously waiting for three years for this movie. I was hoping it would be brutal, sneaky and smart. I've only seen it once so far but I spent so much of this film yelling at the screen because the characters were being idiotic. ""Just leave the house"". ""Don't waste all your bullets when you're far away and not aiming"". ""When you have him down, blow his brains out, cut his head off, then his arms and legs"". Sadly, no one does anything intelligent so it's another scary movie where you spend the whole movie screaming at the screen for the writing and actors to be better/smarter. I hope I like it more on second viewing. The score was good. Michael was creepy. It just wasn't as brutal and smart as I hoped it would be. Aside from the bad writing and responses to terrifying, life and death situations, it was good.i hope halloween ends is smarter and more realistic.",Halloween Kills
822,croccylc,Terrible ending,6,17 October 2021,"It's a well shot movie but The ending is terrible it's not even a pay-off its bad taste, even for this franchise. Could've been an 8 if John carpenter was still involved.",Halloween Kills
823,sillet_l,Absolutely amazing nonestop from start to finish!!,10,18 October 2021,HALLOWEEN KILLS is so tense and gory from start to the finish. Michael myers kills are soo creative in this and some are intense especially camerons death that kill has to be the best but also the most harsh. Definitely one of the best Halloween movies.,Halloween Kills
824,paraboland,Perfect build-up movie for the finale,10,23 October 2021,You see the time lines of which order these movies are suppose to take place. And I loved of this one made sure us super fans caught all the easter eggs for #2-6. Can't wait for the last one.,Halloween Kills
825,ktru-63566,I would've walked out,4,17 October 2021,"If I wasn't with people that really wanted to see this movie
Couple cool, inventive kills and an underlining story that makes our societal issues come to lightBut other that that, just the same from a mindless slasher film that gives you a lot of ""huhs"" and ""whys""",Halloween Kills
826,Small-Movie-Critc1999,I liked it a lot..... But,6,1 November 2021,"I'm not lying here by saying I expected less but the title was very literal he kills a lot of people and fantastically Gory ways, The thing I wanted to see the most was Micheal Myers being very intimidating again and I'm happy to say this movie delivers in that department he really made feel like Myers was an unstoppable force who has no mercy whatsoever but the movie lacks in some department that bring it down for me like the people of Haddonfield don't get me wrong I like the fact that this movie brings Haddonfield into the movie with character I like that but the decisions they make are so stupid especially when they think that this small dude from the mental institution is Micheal and chases him around the hospital to the point where the poor guy had to commit suicide was incredibly stupid and the chant ""Evil Dies Tonight"" gets bashed into your brain so you won't forget it and more stuff like that hurt the film tremendously but I will give it 6/10 because this is a bridge film for the next film coming next year it will probably look better when all three are in the collection only time will tell.",Halloween Kills
827,scalzittirosy,Dumbest one yet,1,18 October 2021,"I went into not expecting too much, after all is a horror movie that's been alive for 40 years. This one could have been so much better. They must have got drunk or tired when writing this one. The hospital scenes were beyond ridiculous. A mob of people attacking Michael and nobody thinks to chop his head off and put and end to this nonsense???",Halloween Kills
828,galaxylincoln,Intense,8,16 October 2021,This movie was intense they perfected suspense and kept you on the edge of your seat. A little disappointed about the ending I was kind of hoping this was gonna be the last one and that the Boogeyman can be killed but can't always get what you want.,Halloween Kills
829,gorgeousgeorges,One of the weakest Halloween sequel,3,16 October 2021,"I feel like everytime a decent Halloween is made, the next one stinks. Being a 90s baby, my first Halloween movie was H20 which I loved. Then, Resurrection was meh. Then, Rob Zombie first Halloween was OK. The second one was really bad. The same thing is happening here. Halloween Kills feels rushed. The story is pretty non existant. Its just Michael going on a kill spree. You could tell me thats pretty much what this series is about but I like when there is a little background, a story to build up a movie. I liked Halloween 6 for this reason. Its not well critically acclaimed but I like the build up in the movie. This new installment in the Halloween franchise could be my least favorite.",Halloween Kills
830,ScaredofFrogs,Well worth my $13 ticket!,7,17 October 2021,"I usually try to stay away from saying this, but I genuinely don't understand where all the low reviews are coming from. This film exceeds in everything a fun slasher should be and more! An amazing score, good audio mixing, direction, camerawork, cinematography, lots of fan service and solid acting. The storyline is rather straight forward, but it does what it's supposed to and even fleshed out a lot of its characters that actually makes them feel like genuine people once they get killed. Yes, the film could've gone with a few less subplots and I didn't like some aspects of the flashbacks, but it manages to keep it's continuity good enough throughout. Just like 2018's Halloween this easily surpass all other Halloween sequels we've gotten throughout the years and I can't wait for Halloween Ends! 7/10.",Halloween Kills
831,drs-09434,What a colossal let down,4,20 October 2021,"I mean come on. This was just hollywood doing what it does. Drive a franchise into the ground. They have zero imagination.

It's just mindless killing the story was bad and slow. What makes me mad is the fact that he's still alive. I know he's strong and all but 8 armed firefighters and around 30 townspeople with guns... there's just no way. This series needs to end.",Halloween Kills
834,Ollie1315,HALLOWEEN KILLS IS EPIC!!!,9,15 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is an epic movie. It was a great sequel from the movie: Halloween (2018). I loved the plot and the story line. I also loved how they brought the main characters from the original Halloween (1978) movie to reunite and hunt Michael Myres down. It's filled with blood-thirsty scenes and kept you on the edge of ur seat from start to finish. Out of all of the Halloween movies, this is one of the best. Can't wait for Halloween Ends... October 2022.I rate this movie: 9/10 - highly recommend!!",Halloween Kills
835,mrandmrshalloween-97506,Uneven but watchable,6,15 October 2021,"As Lifelong Halloween fan I'll give the fairest review I can. It's a messy uneven film in places. The script is just bad , the story was sacrificed for sake of kills and it shows. That being said the kills are exquisite. When fans want to see Michael kill we want gruesome kills. We get it by the gallons in this film. The logic bumps are what frequently take you out of the moment. A significant portion of the cast are not even used to good effect. This needed more time to cook. However it's still worth watching I just won't be rushing out to see it twice.",Halloween Kills
836,jelgertje,Loved it!,10,23 October 2021,"It was a great watch.I admit the plot is somewhat special but overall a really enjoyable Halloween movie.Don't listen to the ""critics"" that hate this movie because they were expecting something like the original. That time has passed.Michael has become pure evil and will remain that way for the rest of the franchise.Great film!",Halloween Kills
837,chasewil,"Okay,worth a watch",6,20 October 2021,"6.0 is a perfect rating .It's worth a watch but I wouldn't call it good,just okayThis movie lacks the suspense Halloween (2018) had and Jamie Lee is basically 3rd or 4th lead in this movie with not a lot going on and not a lot of screen time .It's very obviously it's a filler movie for Halloween ends and I'm fine with that.",Halloween Kills
838,grosselli,"Michael Myers is scary, again.",10,15 October 2021,"Having anticipated this movie for the past 3 years, I was not at all disappointed. It picked up where 2018 left off. I direct continuation. This movie could easily be tacked on to the last as one long full movie and there would be no problem, at all.The movie, obviously, takes place in 2018 with flashbacks from 1978 and even a small one from part 2 (which we were led to believe, never happened...or at least not the brother/sister aspect).It was great seeing a lot of the cast from the original and even adding to the original story. I liked the Easter eggs planted and the use of Silver Shamrock masks which also brings about another theory... but that's not for this review.The story has already been set in 2018. Most of the character development and scenarios have ready been established for this movie to be an all out slaughter-fest. Michael's rampage through Haddonfield, in this movie, reminded me of what I found so terrifying about him all those years ago when I first saw the original movie.I definitely think this movie is great as a follow up to 2018, and am still anticipating Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills
839,mopandgo,Terrible,1,20 October 2021,This movie the actors are all over the place. The fact Curtis stays in the hospital the whole movie. Also that a town with everyone having a gun can't kill this guy and wrap it up. It's just stupid. The first movie was way better. Why is it that with most trilogies the second movie in between always sucks?,Halloween Kills
840,mnmoore-45585,"Why, why, why!?!?",1,18 October 2021,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!I thought Rob Zombie's remakes were horrible and that no one could mess up this franchise more... I was wrong. As a huge fan of the original and most of the movies that followed, Halloween Kills was extremely disappointing.The over the top acting, dialogue that was apparently written by a 12 year old and all around cheesiness made this almost unbearable to sit through. I found myself laughing at serious parts because the dialogue was so bad. Towards the end when the ""crime stopping townsfolk"" decide to get revenge, I was rooting for Michael. Thankfully he came out on top and put an end to the terrible acting of the entire cast.I had heard bad things about this after opening night but decided to watch it anyways because you can't always rely on reviews... I should have listened.This was so poorly done and such a huge disappointment.",Halloween Kills
841,trentbrinkman,Much better than I expected,8,16 October 2021,"Where do I begin? The kills are amazing, even better than the first movie. Michael has never seemed more threatening and unstoppable than he does now. Even though Laurie takes a backseat in this movie, it's justified seeing as the next movie will be most likely be entirely centered around her. It even makes sense as they pushed the ""Michael isn't necessarily obsessed with Laurie, he wants to go home"" idea. The comedic relief was actually very good. The music was incredible as usual. A lot of Myers just killing people too, what more could you want from a filler sequel?",Halloween Kills
842,TimWalker426,Halloween Kills (Itself),5,18 October 2021,"Truthfully and to be blunt, this movie just wasn't good. The acting was awful in 90% of scenes. The kills were cool, but you could see the same thing in a Dead By Daylight Kill Compilation on YouTube. It added next to nothing to the plot and was entirely too reliant on overly gratuitous kills. Granted, the flashback scenes were excellent, as well as adding a near identical Dr. Loomis lookalike. Even though these scenes were good, they were overshadowed by the awful acting in them. This movie might be worth the watch if you've invested time into all 49 other unnecessary Halloween sequels. Other than that, pass.",Halloween Kills

846,amazrama,Satisfactory but that's not what everyone wanted,7,17 October 2021,"The kills are an art to us and MM and it was acknowledged heavily in the screenplay. The way every kill was decorated, and specially the one with boyfriend where he straight up stops in midst just to give it a 'twist' was so so appetizingHowever the initial fire fight sequence, some foolish jabs and unnecessarily twisting to pave way for 3rd was indeed disappointingNow coming from a guy born in 90s, Halloween (2018) paved way for my interest and hence viewers like me will find it satisfactory but not greatOn the other hand, the true fans following whole franchise are not going to be amused by Easter eggs here and there and hence this sequel is indeed a one which divides fandom and is not for everyone, and some credit must be given to marketing team which spoiled the suspense of movie in a way by announcing it to be a part of trilogyBut plot aside, screenplay and background was by far one of the best features of this flick and if OST do binds you, I would suggest to watch this in chilling, loud atmosphere such as Theatre to enjoy it to the fullestCrux: You just can't pass by making a satisfactory sequel to a movie which deserves a worthy one.",Halloween Kills

Love love the original and enjoy most of the sequels & even yes the Rob Zombie ones. I at least can sit through them all. I can't even imagine sitting through this one again. The dialogue, the acting, though it's not really the actors fault the writing is terrible. Of course you have to suspend logic somewhat during horror flicks but in the scene where a burned Michael Myers is surrounded by several townspeople, beaten, shot multiple times, knife shoved in upper back while he's face down stands back up & starts slicing again. Tell me someone, why would anyone watch that & then attempt to harm or kill him with a baseball bat?? One of many scenes where you have to suspend belief so far it just becomes ridiculous. Too many townspeople facing him & getting slaughtered. Just how low budget was this movie anyway?? I actually laughed during the scene where Laurie & Officer Hawkins are discussing Michael in the hospital room they apparently share. Gory, not scary in the least & blatantly ridiculous. So disappointed!!!",Halloween Kills

849,Spartanical,WTAF?! What a letdown...,5,17 October 2021,"The last one was so good (as far as Halloween movies go). It was at least mostly sensible (apart from the dad if I remember correctly). But as soon as this one ended I went straight here to IMDB to see if the writers had been changed, thinking maybe a Wonder Woman scenario had taken place. Nope. Apparently, like George Lucas, it's time to take away John Carpenter's pen.This was a collection of some of the most nonsensical choices and circumstance you could dream up. It's like no one in this entire movie besides Jamie Lee Curtis had any comprehension of what a survival instinct is.EVERYONE in this movie makes the dumbest choices; but even if they make the right ones, the writing takes all reason and logic out of the execution. For instance, one guy has a baseball bat and goes to hit a homerun on Michael's head, but instead of making the swing like everyone else would (including even a 3 year old on a piñata), from about 3-4 feet away, the guy lunges towards a knife-wielding Michael until he's about a foot away and then tries to complete his swing from there. And this was supposed to be the guy who knew how to kick some butt. Brilliant.I feel like I could literally have a career in Hollywood as an Arbitrator of Reality, presuming of course anyone in Hollywood would be interested in reality checks or truth. But if they hired me, in my most humble opinion (lol), the quality of action/horror movies would go up and through the roof almost overnight. I would have a zero-tolerance policy on this kind of laughable BS. I would just go from script to script cleaning up the ridiculousness. But alas...",Halloween Kills

That being said, I'm not a huge Halloween fan, and didn't come in with high expectations. But this movie, delivered as a pretty good horror-action movie.

Scarface is a 10, this movie is a 5 at the very best.This movie is a typical 80's slasher movie and I would assume that is just what the director was aiming for while making this movie.Because there's hardly any plot whatsoever, most of the acting is mediocre, the dialogue is laughable, there's no character development whatsoever, the story sucks and so on.So your basically left with Myers just walking around slashing people left and right with a knife (for the most part)...Cool but not cool enough to give this movie any more than 5 stars.

Now we are all expected to believe an entire town searching for this man all live in sound bubbles that only expands to no further than whatever they can touch. Gun shot in a busy city can be heard blocks away but this dead city with no one around besides random huge groups of people never hear anyone scream or shoot. Wherever micheal is no one exists but him and the victim. Like the town is vacant.. simply ridiculous. Worse one yet.,Halloween Kills

It was a welcome change to see such a large cast although having Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the hospital the whole time a was somewhat of a let down, hopefully she'll be back in fighting form in the next one. The final scenes were great though I can't understand why they always stop attacking him too soon and let him recover. I guess that's just the way it works. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one.",Halloween Kills
871,kingkosher,Not bad at all!,7,14 October 2021,This is a good movie if you're a halloween fan. It's got a lot of really great stuff for the regular horror fan but if you're really into slasher films this is also quite a good movie.The movie starts out where it left off with the previous film and goes from there. The violence from Michael is kind of intense but the kills deliver if you're into that sorta thing. I had my worries going into the movie I had seen it all in the trailers and man oh man it's got more.Without spoiling the film if you want to see a tense slasher film and see returning characters and a very brutal Michael Myers (I would argue more brutal than the Rob Zombie version of Myers) as well as hear the wonderful score from John Carpenter and his son.It also has a nod to Halloween 3 for fans of the OG movies.7/10 a good movie to munch popcorn to on a chilly October night.,Halloween Kills
872,bagelbiterboio,Not an awful entry... I recommend though,7,18 October 2021,There was a lot of great parts about this movie. Most of the kills were absolutely brutal and a blast to see! Many scenes had me giddy and impressed. The crazy gore was another fact that only added to my enjoyment. Myers looks good too and the actor does an amazing job playing him which makes him my favorite part of the movie easily. Both mask he is seen wearing look very good. Speaking of I believed the way they did the flashback scenes were very good. I even enjoyed some of the sub-par acting as I found it very funny. But getting into the flaws bad acting is still bad acting. The plot was pretty lazy with a hole or a few and has some weird decisions. Things with characters being awful are really goofy. There is a lot of people too some a lot better than others and many with very short lives but it gives some very sequences and does impact the plot in a way. The mob mentality thing was pretty impactful at times but I feel some moments don't use it to it's best at all. If your looking for something really scary too I wouldn't say this one will be great for you not that it's not scary at all there are a couple scenes with a decent scare factor but all and all it's pretty tame in that department. I could probably talk about more but it's early so in all I highly recommend this movie if your looking for fun. This movie with all its problems is a blast to watch. Though I do recommend that when watching to turn off you brain a little. It makes it a lot more fun.,Halloween Kills
873,lamarre2012,Really enjoyed this but ultimately disappointed,7,16 October 2021,I love that this sequel truly feels like a continuation of the last movie. There are some pretty brutal kills and some great ideas. I was disappointed that this movie feels like the middle movie in a trilogy. I'm pretty sure it is but the ending feels unsatisfying. Maybe if they get to do the 3rd movie watching all 3 in a row will feel like a complete story.,Halloween Kills

JLC actually did some great action scenes.The new main characters in this movie sucked. They couldn't act. I am highly disappointed that JLC was barely in this movie and fans got duped from the trailer thinking that she would be kicking Michael's ass.There were a lot of scenes where the characters acted completely stupid, but what can you expect from a slasher movie right?I only watched this because I am an fan of the series.

880,jbel14,My actual score would be a 7 but...,10,18 October 2021,"Being a fan of the franchise to me does not mean being a fanatic, so the extra three points are added in principle to do my small part in offsetting all the irrational 1/10's. I never understood the knee jerk reaction to anything people have an issue with in a movie. It makes them look childish and stupid.Anyways back to my actual score, I'd personally dock:
-1 point for the often cringey dialog, mostly brought about by a returning character from the original (you'll know who)
-1 point for the allegorically verbose middle section which not only sapped the pacing, but nearly derailed the whole movie. I get what they were trying to do, but it was executed far too on-the-nose and made it a drag to watch, especially on subsequent viewings.-1 point for the montage style of the opening and ending kill sequences. It was a stylistic decision that didn't real enhance anything besides the body count (hence in keeping with the title).",Halloween Kills

885,canadian_eh_uk,A hot mess,2,27 October 2021,This movie completely lost sight of why people love the original Halloween. This drivel was completely lacking in suspense. They turned the movie into a slasher gore movie as they must have thought they were making a Friday the 13th movie. The amount of deaths was absurd. They had far too many characters. The overacting of some (I'm looking at you Anthony Michael Hall) tainted the better quality of actors who were woefully underutilized (Judy Greer/Jamie Lee Curtis). And Michael Myers used to be almost robotic in his killing - he wouldn't have gathered bodies and staged them! Good grief. Did the writers not watch the original?? This movie could have been decent with (1) 1/10 of the deaths (2) 1/3 of the characters and (3) more suspense and less gore.What a disappointment!,Halloween Kills

888,russellp20012001,1978 Halloween is my all time favorite movie. This is an honest review!!,6,17 October 2021,"As I mentioned in my subject line, the original Halloween is my favorite movie.Halloween Kills:The first 15 minutes of the movie I thought was absolutely brilliant. The movie flashes back to 1978 right after Dr. Loomis shoots Michael out the window and he disappears. There is a police search for Michael and I thought the whole scene was fantastic.If the film continued in this brilliance it could have been close to the original. That being said, we are given a lot of nostalgia. Many original characters from the original Halloween. Most played by the original actors. The town bans together chanting Evil Dies tonight. Unfortunately , it is so corny it is almost painful to watch.There is now a full search for Michael. ( Just my opinion......why didn't everyone go the original Myers house to search for him? Where else would he possibly go? )Not much more to the plot other then a full hunt. The ending was done well and does leave on a cliffhanger.( My issues: One of the reasons I think Halloween is the greatest horror movie of all time is because of it's simplicity. However, the simplicity is also very complex. A 6 year old boy kills his sister, waits patiently for 15 years, escapes the mental asylum, and has a full constructed plan, almost like he could see the future .) In the original Halloween 2, Dr. Loomis goes into detail about Samhain. Burning animals to see elements of the future. The way Michael was watching everyone. Laurie dropping off the key, then Tommy at school, Laurie in class, In Laurie's backyard, etc...... Michael steals his sister's gravestone. Why??? It all plays out to his plan for Laurie. Laurie makes her way over to Lyndsey's house. Finds Annie on the bed displayed with the gravestone. Linda is in the cupboard. Bob is hanging from the ceiling. It all seems to go to perfection. How the hell did Michael know Laurie would go there?Back to Halloween Kills. There is really no suspense. You see Michael way too much. Horror in my opinion is really about suspense. Not seeing the killer but wondering where he is. Watching Michael butcher these people is not scary. It is almost laughable. Stabbing a dead guy in the back with 6 knives makes no sense.Overall, I give the movie 6 out of 10.The positives, great flashbacks, great music, and great nostalgia.The negatives. Too much cheese, no suspense, and very little plot.An entertaining film and I really hope Halloween Ends is done with more justice!!!",Halloween Kills
889,robmackenzie1985,Great.,10,16 October 2021,Ignore all the bad reviews. Great sequil to the new franchise.80s theme combined with the newer bits. Kill count is best ive seen. Id say this is on par with any slasher. Id watch again.,Halloween Kills
890,SCY385-1,Unnecessary Cash Grabbing Sequel....But I'm Happy For Jamie Lee Curtis,5,16 October 2021,"I cannot be considered the biggest Halloween fan and I think all the sequels have diluted the power of the first film. That being said I was somewhat impressed with the 2018 film because it was a bit deeper than its predecessors. Curtis's portrayal of a mentally scarred and damaged Laurie Strode hit home for me as a person who was the victim of a violent crime myself. The film satisfied on levels that the other films hadn't even touched in such a semi-realistic way. Frankly I was more than satisfied with the ending because it wrapped things up rather nicely as far as I was concerned. Unfortunately Halloween Kills makes the same mistake the previous sequels made. It becomes a film about killing alone and that's a shame because I felt that it could have satisfied the slasher fans and people who like a little story. Michael Myers is a one man killing machine and if that's the only thing people want to see then those people will be more than satisfied. The film is very gory but not particularly scary which it should have been. As a matter of fact the only scene that scared me was at the very end of the film. What could have been an absolutely terrifying film is simply gory and loud. The film is also a setup for the next film which I hope capitalizes better on the terror aspects that could exist if they explore them. I am glad Curtis is getting a chance to capitalize off of a character she has embodied since she was a young woman. I just hope that the next film uses her character to its fullest potential because this film really doesn't do that and I understand that there are some practical reasons for that. Still for those who love the legend of Michael Myers this film shows him as a deeply mentally ill person who can't and won't be stopped. He's a monstrous, uncontrollable and frightening image that we are incapable of understanding. He only shows the audience violence, cruelty and the consequences of a chaotic, psychotic and broken mind. He literally is The Boogeyman.",Halloween Kills
891,jthamez,Go Michael!!!,1,17 October 2021,"The characters of this movie are so incompetent that they all deserve to banish under Michael's hand.

901,ellieroyce,Frustrating!!!,4,3 November 2021,"So, the kills in this film are great, full of gore which is just what you want when you sit down to watch one of the Halloween films.However, I just couldn't help to feel absolute frustration the whole way through. Continuous senseless decisions by the characters which in the end just made me laugh. I mean, for example, they knew Michael Myers was at large so they let the DRIVER get out of the car (leaving the rest of them stranded because apparently none of them could switch seats and drive off) to tell some children to go home. Then the passenger proceeds to shoot the windows open????? So that Michael can easily get into the car and kill them???? And then the doctor girlfriend who is the last one standing decides to just randomly shoot at the car and get that close to him that he can make her shoot herself by kicking the car door into her arm. It made me put my head into my hands.Another example, Lonnie is driving around with his son and his sons girlfriend to find and attack Michael Myers. Then realises (once he's arrived) that he shouldn't of brought his son and Allyson (Lauries granddaughter) to where they think Michael is. So he proceeds to leave them in a car on their own while he goes in and attempts to kill Michael?? Obviously he dies, SHOCK, so his son and Allyson go in to find him on their own. Allyson finds a male couple dead on the floor so knowing Michael is in the house and could creep up at any point, she sits beside them and slowly takes out the knifes stabbed into their bodies (even though she has a gun ready) and leaves her boyfriend on his own for a while to obviously be attacked by Michael. The funny part is Allyson has been driving around looking for Michael and her Mum knows this but decides to stay at the hospital knowing her daughter is potentially in danger, however she does come to the rescue eventually which leads me to my last example...Allysons mum (Karen Nelson) stabs him in the back with a pitchfork, yep, great, stamps on his head, perfect.. then leaves him. Why is no one attempting to cut this mans head off!!!! I know they want another film so they need to keep him alive but please I need someone to atleast try!! Why do they leave him on the floor and then turn their backs?? Nothing frustrates me more than that. If fire can't kill him I don't think a stamp to the head is going to do any good.Anyway, gory film but a very frustrating one, I like when he creeps up on people and they have no way of escaping his wrath. What I don't like is when they have the opportunity to kill or get away and they just.. don't? I mean this guy never runs so you could do a light jog and you'd lose him. 4/10.",Halloween Kills

The characters weren't just unsuspecting, they were frustratingly stupid (more so than most horror movies). The fact that every character thinks they can fight Michael is really annoying. The deputy's story arch added nothing of value. The attempts at humor were cringey at best and it was impossible to relate to any of the characters.

I get it was made knowing that the third installment was still coming, but to say this works as a stand alone movie (and a good one at that) is just wrong. The atmosphere was spot on in some scenes, and the cinematography and casting were well done. But those things only work if there's a story to tell, and here there wasn't.The kills were fine. The story was nonexistent. And the twists (were there any?) were forgettable.

If the goal was to imitate a poorly acted 80s slash-em-up (honestly that's what most Halloween movies were), then mission accomplished.

This movie makes its predecessor look like a masterpiece. You can feel them stretching to make a trilogy in which they have a beginning and (hopefully) an end in mind, but no middle. This movie as a whole feels uninspired. Without giving anything away, this movie boils down to Michael killing civilians for 100 minutes and very little else. Yes, that is a big part of every slasher flick, but what I mean is: there is very little tension, style, subtlety, and atmosphere on display; things I always look for in a Halloween movie and horror movies in general. If I didn't already know they had a trilogy planned, my first thought would be this movie was made just so the studio could retain the rights, because in every department it feels like they are just going through the motions with this one.

It looks likes one, sounds like one, but feels off, awkward, corny and manufactured. You get the score, the mask, familiar characters... you get new concepts like ""maybe this time he could take off his mask?"", or ""maybe this time the whole city goes after him?""... but at the end of the day, we would have been fine with Micheal Myers staying dead in that hospital back in 1981.",Halloween Kills

There are no moments here that make you feel like your watching Michael Myers stealthily moving his way through the streets of a small town, this was Superman killing 8 to 10 strong healthy men with axes and partner saws minutes after being stabbed, shot, and set on fire..... and then a bunch of goofball townspeople going after him with baseball bats. Constantly making one awful decision after another.It was hard to keep track of how many times someone fires a gun errantly allowing Mike to get the upper hand.They brought back actors and characters in absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical manners. So your telling me a nurse who had absolutely no connection to a couple kids whose babysitter was attacked by Michael Myers now hangs out with them every Halloween? Was her life that significantly impacted by what was basically a carjacking that she sought ought 2 ten year olds and forged a lifelong friendship with them?The problem I have with modern horror movies is they take themselves way too seriously. Theres room for that, don't get me wrong. The Exorcist is still the scariest movie of all time in my eyes. But 80's slashers are not meant to be taken so seriously. RZ's Halloween, Halloween 2, and Halloween 2018, and Halloween Kills are just not fun movies. They're meant to make you uncomfortable taking your garbage out to the alley at night, or look in your back seat when you get in the car, not to make you hate humanity.Theres not a likable character in this movie. Not one.The more I think about it, the more I want to lower my rating, but technically it was well done, the acting was fine(not including Kyle Richards, who was like a bad soap opera actress). The mask looked cool, their were certain moments of striking imagery, but only one moment felt like I was watching the Michael Myers I knew and loved. The special effects were cringeyat times.The movie was silly, unrealistic but at the same time takes itself way too seriously. Its not fun, scary, or entertaining.",Halloween Kills
915,TRIDENT1745,A misleading attempt at a modern slasher,4,28 October 2021,"If you've heard this movie is poor, you've heard right.Halloween kills does not live up to its predecessor, Halloween.Although there is plenty of gore, the film lacks in plot, it lacks in characterisation, it lacks in consistency. It lacks in general integrity. Not too mention too many plot holes to count.I certainly would not watch it again.",Halloween Kills

917,brucefinch,Just a mess...,2,1 November 2021,"I've followed the Halloween franchise on and off from day one. Saw the original in 1978 and liked it so much I stole the poster outside the cinema. (Still have it). (""The trick is to stay alive"" - so cool)Have seen many of the sequels but they lost me a little in the middle there. Then 2018's version got good enough reviews to entice me back. It was pretty good and I thought 'they've breathed life back into the series'.Maybe I should listened to my gut when I saw Danny McBride's name attached to Halloween Kills. He's pretty hit and miss in my experience. This was a miss...
It was lots of other things. Well cast, well shot, with an instantly recognisable John Carpenter soundtrack. What could go wrong? It was also silly, chaotic, irrational and bloodthirsty. None of those things matter a darn if the movie is entertaining. Alas... It was far from entertaining. My wife called it 'dumb'. And, as much as I wanted to like it, I found it tedious. I yawned. A lot.Ultimately, it felt like it was nothing more than... a mess.",Halloween Kills

Spoilers Ahead,1,24 October 2021,"I know with these horror movies you're supposed to check your brain at the door, but come on man !!!!!!First of all, Michael survives a house on fire and kills 11 firefighters. Eight of them all at once. These are firefighters with axes and saws and Michael takes them all out. Come on man !!!!!!!Then Michael survives being on top of a car, with two armed women. One of them runs out of bullets, while the other one somehow is far away from the car and shoots at the driver's seat but does not hit Michael at all? Only to accidentally shoot herself? Come on man!!!!And finally, Michael surrounded by about 20 townspeople on all four sides. Most all have bats or sticks. A couple of them have guns. They all beat on him, One guy puts about four or five bullets in him. Judy Greer puts a big butcher knife into his back while he is laying on the ground. This is shortly after being stabbed in the gut several times plus having a pitchfork in his back. Then they all turn their back on him and he grabs the knife from his backand takes out 20 people. They all don't dogpile on him, they come at him one by one.Come on man !!!!!To give Halloween Kills a little credit, it does have some good kills. It has some good Easter Eggs and call backs to the original Halloween 1 and 2.Oh well I'll just wait for their next cash grab movie, Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills

The kills, greusome and what you would expect from a guy locked up for 40 years thinking about murdering an entire town.The opening scene was perfect. The score phenomenal. The ending? Eh why would everyone hunting Michael down not bludgeon him until his face was caved in? A town that hell bent on ridding the evil Michael brings to the earth wouldnt have paused SO MANY times. And if they would it's a town full of morons. Characters attack and throw away their weapons or pause too long to the point it's more annoying than suspenseful.",Halloween Kills

Because directors have to make one more movie on him. Some scenes were too made up, like the one where Michael kicks the door of the car and the girl shots herself, that I laughed so hard, because that was something we see in Bollywood movies but now its there in Hollywood too.Disclaimer : DONT WATCH IT.",Halloween Kills
923,jonafx,Even worse than the last one,2,15 October 2021,"This film lacks everything that made the original great.

924,bencobb-26230,Why?,1,26 October 2021,"Why? Yes. I know the answer. They produced this embarrassment to milk a little bit more cash out of a true classic. I rated this movie a ""1"" only because zero isn't an option. ""Halloween"" spawned and defined a generation of slasher flicks that tried (and usually failed) to live up to its own expectations. I'm highly disappointed that John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis even participated in this ridiculous exhibition that wasn't even clever enough to be a parody of a classic horror movie. If you have never seen any of the ""Halloween"" movies, watch the original. Then watch the episode of the Netflix's ""The Movies That Made Us"" that to gain further appreciation of what Carpenter and company accomplished back in 1978. Then move on with your life.",Halloween Kills

928,regantwd,Incredible and gory bridge between the beginning and the end.,10,15 October 2021,"SPOILER FREE HALLOWEEN KILLS REVIEW:That was genuinely the most brutal Halloween movie out of the entire franchise in my opinion (wasn't as depressing as rob zombie ones tho).If you're going into this movie expecting an all round ending to the story you should think differently as most of the fans know there is a movie titled Halloween Ends coming out next October.With this in mind I wasn't sure what to expect but this really was the best bridge between the start and the end that I could have possibly imagined there would be.Anyone who is saying this movie accomplished nothing for the overall story...wtf are you talking about?? It builds on future stars and brings a more beautiful and sentimental outlook on the stars of the past while looking forward to the next and perhaps final film in the entire series.This was absolutely amazing, brutal kills mostly all on screen (one of the biggest complaints of the last was that they were mostly off screen).10/10 (my personal opinion is this is one of the best movies in the entire series).",Halloween Kills
929,Stollie69,Shockingly bad,1,15 October 2021,"Honestly feel dumber for watching this. Wasn't even a half decent slasher film. Acting makes no sense, plot makes no sense. Fail on every count.Only thing that was halfway decent was some of the gore.",Halloween Kills
930,lfgceco,Good entertainment,8,25 October 2021,"The movie is good entertainment.The producers and director actually made a great attempt on humanising the characters. They show what would be a very likely response from common people in a small town facing a force of nature that is plain evil.Most of us wouldn't react as Bruce Willis or Sigourney weaver to a traumatic event.Most of us would never need to face, thank God, a complete psycho that is actually closer to a force of nature than to a human being.And that's a good paid homage to the Halloween movies and the genre it founded in 1978.These movies are not to be realistic. These movies are not a confirmation bias for your self-assumed IQ score. These movies are suppose to stress you, horror you and then release you from those feelings when you get out of the screen feeling that your life is not as bad as you thought. This movie is for simple and plain entertainment. Just don't overthink and enjoy.",Halloween Kills
931,drobb-04904,Never watch this...,1,26 October 2021,"If you're a true Halloween fan, never watch this movie. Terrible plot, bad acting, unbelievably stupid. It couldn't have been done worse, IMO. It is definitely bottom 2 or 3 of all Halloween movies.",Halloween Kills

I'm a huge horror fan and particularly slasher movies, but Halloween for me has always been eh... it just seems so repetitive, you know? Michael just always comes back, so I was expecting it to be the usual boring stuff. But I was actually so pleasantly surprised. The flashbacks to the 70s were so good and so beautifully shot. All I can really say is go see it, it's honestly probably either my favorite or second favorite out of the entire Halloween franchise. Michael is also extremely brutal in this one. He reminded me a lot of how Jason Voorhees acts.",Halloween Kills
934,jonrose-88106,"Finally, they got one of these damn movies right!",7,16 October 2021,"Huge fan with a deep nerdy knowledge of all these entries. Hated the 2018 entry. The doctor Sartain twist/character was stupid and completely ruined the movie for me. I was left thinking that these idiots can't get one of these movies right anymore. The dumb entries were piling up since H20. Rob Zombie UGH!!!!This one was different. Different good. A credit to DGG for having the guts to add Loomis in the flashbacks. A huge risk that to me made the movie. And to have MM lurking in the original mask in these flashbacks was an unexpected treat. It was satisfying as a life long fan. The perfect homage combined with a backstory never seen before. Glad that this wasn't revealed in the trailers which did reveal more than it should.Tommy Doyle's character was strong as well. Good casting to get AMH for this. Tommy grew up from a scared kid to a man's man leading the Haddonfield pack. His dialogue in his referral to MM was a bit of a homage to Loomis in the way he built up MMs character to something beyond a human being. Which from watching the movie, he clearly is. Too bad Tommy didn't last longer, and into Halloween Ends.My biggest issue, and this shocks me to say it, is John Carpenters score. To me it was subpar. The score did not flow with some very key scenes. Example MM chasing LW through the park. There was no music here which was weird and almost like they forgot to add it in. Weakest effort in Carpenters career surprisingly.Overall it was satisfying with minimal complaints. Better editing than 2018, with lots of kills. Good characters (made sure that no character was safe). Good story and homage to previous movies. It's clear that Strode and Hawkins will be at the forefront again after being on the backburner in this one. I'd like to see a completely original Halloween Ends. They paid more than enough fan service now. Let's see if DGG can make something completely original of his own.",Halloween Kills

Ya ever heard of a FRONT DOOR? Get the hell out the kitchen! What you shouldn't do if someone is trying to kill you was done in this horrible film .

944,bppsnwht,Why can't films stick the landing?,5,22 October 2021,"A truly brutal and cruel entry in the Halloween franchise, Halloween Kills is really trying to do too much, and needlessly. Okay, bring back characters from the first film and offer them up as potential victims of Michael Myers, I'll go with that. Even though why would that nurse Marion Chambers want to hang out with a bunch of Michael Myers survivors, especially if in this reboot Halloween II never happened? And why not, Halloween II was great and could have easily fit into this reboot storyline. Next, focus on mob rule in the wake of the January 6th attack on the capitol, okay. But that part of the story gets tired really fast with the mob scene at the hospital, which really had nothing to do with Michael in the end. Then take Laurie Strode out of the story for the most part, except for her recovering in the hospital and making speeches, I think not. Jamie Lee Curtis may not like horror movies, but she's the backbone of this series and she gets short shrift in this one. Another oddity, apparently Michael took martial arts lessons because he was able to kill a dozen or so firemen, even though most were armed, and then does the same to a mob at the end which is completely nonsensical. And I hope there is a director's cut coming because the end of this version of the movie absolutely sucked. I won't go into it to avoid any spoilers, but was that last kill even real, and if so, what disrespect to that character. And here's a thought for Laurie Strode. If you're traumatized by Michael and constantly living in fear of him returning, maybe don't stay in Haddonfield? How about a move to Hawaii, work on a farm or something, and put an ocean between you and the Shape? It's not like Michael could get plane tickets! But there is apparently a third film in this reboot trilogy, so I hope that one does a better job of closing out the story because Halloween Kills was a mess and left me cold.",Halloween Kills

With that being said this was a highly entertaining entry into the franchise. The kills are absolutely amazing and there are plenty of jump scares throughout. Of course the film is silly, it's supposed to be. Michael Myers is the man you can't kill after all.

949,msmi-41284,Kill your time watching something better,2,27 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is the second entry in a trilogy of Halloween that takes the 1978 movie as their starting point and pretends that all previous sequels don't exist. That bit of artistic amnesia is certainly warranted, as pretty much every sequel that followed the original movie only served to cheapen what is generally considered a horror classic. Halloween (2018), the first movie in the trilogy, was definitely guilty of raided the closest of the original. There's a tense opening credit sequence featuring a pumpkin, John Carpenter's iconic film score, copious throwback scenes and a convincing performance by Jamie Lee Curtis. Most importantly, that movie had an interesting story to tell. Specifically, what impact did Michael have on Laurie Strode's life from that point on, and how did Laurie's reaction to that trauma affect her family?Picking up immediately after the action of the previous movie, Halloween Kills shows Laurie heading to the hospital while firetrucks head in the opposite direction. Twelve movies into the Halloween franchise, we all know that Michael will survive certain death yet again. What we don't expect is for this sequel to squander all of the goodwill earned from the previous movie. Since Laurie is confined to a hospital for the entire run length of the movie, filmmakers David Gordon Green and Danny McBride fill out the story with a collection of flashbacks and various residents of Haddonfield, Illinois. The flashbacks don't add anything to the story except to turn the younger version of Officer Hawkins into The Shakiest Gun in Haddonfield. The townies are an interesting bunch, curiously well drawn for a slasher movie. Frustratingly, all of them eventually become cannon fodder for Michael Myers and his endless supply of kitchen knives.The last movie in the trilogy, Halloween Ends, is due to arrive next year. That movie will undoubtedly feature the last confrontation between Laurie and Michael. Until then, Halloween Kills passes the time, existing only as the equivalent of cinematic padding between episode one and episode three. Aside from one surprising death at the very end of the movie, Halloween Kills is inconsequential, irrelevant and completely superfluous. If you wish to save yourself 1:45, scroll down past the included YouTube video where I reveal the name of the character who dies. You can make use of the time you've saved by rewatching the original.

957,mattstorm-12206,Strange direction to go in.,3,17 October 2021,"The Pros:
Soundtrack - kind of a given, tho many times the music's suggesting we're watching something much cooler than we are.Some of the kills - while I found most kills to be pretty pointless some were good.Michael...sorta - I don't like the direction they took him in but I grew up in the slasher hay day and in this current time where everything I liked is now ""bad"" there's a bit of satisfaction to this icon from my era immersed in modern ""woke"" society tearing it to bits.The Cons:
Fan Service - Wow, basically character from the '78 or '18 film now have some prominent past connection or end up somewhere in the thick of things. Then it's the constant reusing of lines from before, basically flat out copying scenes/ideas from other films. Loomis wasn't the worst CGI face ever but it was still weird and just to say ""Did Michael kill again?""The plot/s - The end of the last film gets ret-conned cuz of course, so he's loose and moves into an idea lifted from the drunks in pt4 where townfolk go hunt Michael, not bad in theory but how they do it is so cartoonish, most the extras aren't good actors and the dialogue's so silly even the seasoned actors have you laughing.The ""fake-out"" - This plot line with a mental patient was so obvious from the start. I understand how nuts people get when they're scared but it just had me rolling my eyes.Characters - I've seen many complain about JLC absence but honestly she's a wrinkled old Grandma, why does anyone think there should be some action packed showdown with her? Many characters were brought from the original who were just there to be there, no one was memorable.The Finale - The physical aspect of it was just a goofy over the top action scene and what they did with Michael was just too out there. The original/'18 film walked a fine line between Michael being a man or something more, say goodbye to that.I could write so much more cons but overall this film just does nothing other than say ""hey remember this guy or girl, line or scene?"" ""Did we check off all our diversity boxes, set up a sequel, OK then, it's a wrap"".",Halloween Kills
958,joshparker-12551,Surprising,10,2 October 2021,"With a title like Halloween Kills, not many would probably think of this as anything more than a gore-fest to thrown on during a Halloween party.Surprisingly, Halloween Kills has an emotionally deep story and tells it well. It's not the cheesy slasher film of the 1980s were the acting is hit or miss and the gore gags are notably cheap. Halloween Kills is intense, brutal and realistic. The characters are strong and likable, and when they're vulnerable you're scared for them. The connection to the 70s and the events unfolding here are stunning, and even if you didn't like Halloween 2018 you will appreciate it more after watching this sequel.It's a second part in a planned trilogy, so don't go expecting a fully resolved plot. This is a thrilling, emotional, suspenseful, surprisingly scary and realistically violent second chapter.I had a suspicion I'd like Halloween Kills, but I didn't expect to love it or enjoy it as much as I have, and I can't wait until more showings open up so I can see it or watch it on Peacock at my leisure.When I think of the original Halloween, its simplicity is what makes it work. I was memorably upset when news of Halloween Kills broke and it was about how violent and bloody it is. For all the kills and gore it has, and it has a lot (way more than what's shown in the trailers) I was surprised how well done it is and the seriousness of it.Pacing is good, Carpenter returns to give us a top-notch score, and I actually want this movie to succeed at the box office. Hard work and smart film making in a slasher movie... who would've thought?Definitely go watch it when it comes out on the 15th.",Halloween Kills
959,nross-46744,A jumbled mess,6,20 October 2021,"Going into this movie... I had high expectations. Based off of the trailers alone, it looked like it was going to be a thrilling movie. But it was a jumbled mess. Almost all of the suspense of the first movie was erased. The scenes felt like they were just horribly edited together. Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode was basically sidelined the entire movie. Every sequence in the hospital was flippin' useless and added nothing to the movie. The suicide of this random guy who literally had no lines and just was there was pointless and to me felt like it was added to raise the kill count. But to every negative, there is a positive. One of my favorite scenes of this movie was when Michael Myers killed Marion Chambers and the parents of that funny kid that Vicky was babysitting in the 2018 Halloween. It was very well done and I actually thought it was kinda funny when Michael kicked the door open and caused the mom to shoot herself in the face. Also, I thought that it added great shock value to kill off Karen right at the end of the movie. I am curious to see how everything plays out in Halloween Ends and hopefully, the film is better than this one.",Halloween Kills

965,spd613,Wasn't as bad as some make it out to be,6,19 October 2021,"I mean, you know when you walk into the theater what you're getting, a slasher movie from a long running franchise. There isn't too many ways they can take the plot. If the writers did re invent the wheel people would complain about that too. By no means was it one of the best Michael Myers movies I've seen. I will say it had its share of unnecessary characters and cheesy lines. I went to see the movie to be entertained and I was. My 14 year old son who went with me to see it wasn't impressed and he is a horror movie buff like I am. I liked it enough that I will watch the next one when it comes out next October. I will ask for more Curtis this next one if possible. There is no Halloween without Michael or Laurie and they kinda cheated her by leaving her in the hospital bed most of the movie.",Halloween Kills
966,darkneal,Best Halloween since H2O.,9,6 November 2021,"Im a huge fan of 70s/80s horror icons and this is a massive improvement on the 2018 movie. There's more focus on Michael, and what propels him and some interesting new theories into why he is. The focus is moved away from the annoying Strode family, yes they're still a part of the overall story but there's more attention to what happens around Michael's killing sprees, it's not just the main stars who are affected in this movie. This is important in expanding the universe around the character, it helps makes his actions more real. They are having realtime consequence. Consequently the film feels more like lots of little Halloween stories within the overall strode arc. Of which i approve!Halloween has never really dealt with that before but they handle michael with respect, without hurting the mythos. This is vital. Yes, there's an annoying subtplot about what humanity is capable of outside of pure evil like Michael, it's an important point to make but it's handled a bit ham-fisted here.Michael is far more brutal here, he doesnt just stab and move on, he seems to enjoy the killing, hes not so cold. Im not saying this is a better version of him, in fact it isnt quite him. But its done again without hurting the mythos. (Unlike the Rob Zombie versions)Overall the most fun and most most respectful Halloween movie in a long time. Watch it with friends, have a drink and a laugh or a scream and just enjoy the journey.",Halloween Kills
967,e_mick87,Michael Transcends,9,24 October 2021,"In this sequel Michael transcends with fury following Halloween 2018. I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel, the nods to the original Halloween and the reintroduction to characters from the original film (such as the child Laurie saved from Michael Myers in the original film, who is also played by the same actress) encourage emotional investment from the viewer and a nostalgic connection to the film. It got me thinking about the frightful legacy of Michael Myers on the town of Haddonfield and these characters. The film wasn't predictable, I wasn't sure where it was going to go. Also, the opening cinematography and the 'Halloween-ey' scenes are so autumnal, they alone will have you wanting to rewatch every year. I feel privileged to be able to go to a cinema in 2021 and and be thrilled by Jamie Lee Curtis still doing this after all these years. It's a very memorable moment.",Halloween Kills

It's not worth your time. Surely has some blood scenes making you scared but that's not just not feel right in the end. It's just the blood and way he kills makes it. While movie is garbage.

The only character that doesn't seem brain dead is Laurie Strode, but she is in the hospital the entire time. This movie played like one of the non-sense sequels where there was no real story and just senseless killings. We all hoped that after the 2018 film, we were in for a continuation of the story, but very quickly realize that is not the case. The film was even stylized as if we were made in the '80s. Let's hope that Halloween Ends can give us a real story and put an end to Michael Myers.",Halloween Kills
972,buttkrieg,Halloween Dies,5,19 October 2021,"The beginning of this movie is so impressive. After a brief tie-in scene for the previous movie, we get a perfectly shot flashback sequence to the original 78 Halloween night. The score, the portrayal of the Shape, the corny 70s style acting, all wonderful. Post title sequence... So completely pointless. Even being released during the Halloween season, it feels out of place without purpose or direction. The explicit gore that better fit the Rob Zombie version is well executed here but doesn't save the movie. The plot is non-existent, the movie seemingly made only to retcon the original story and fill the gap between Halloween 2018 and the expected finale of this contractually obligated trilogy. Jamie Lee Curtis really does nothing other than poorly act her way through horrific injuries, Judy Greer and whoever plays her daughter phone it in as her replacement as the Halloween franchise Sarah Connor, and the movie drags on with a vigilante mob sub-plot. The sub-plot not only fails to relay any kind of noticeable or convincing social commentary that it appears to be aiming for, but it ends so flatly and anti-climactic, that it ends up making me question if I'd be willing to ever sit through this again down the road. It wastes all its time and potential on meandering dialogue and shouting hordes of townfolk. There is not one scary scene, there are no good characters, the movie goes nowhere and it does not do the franchise justice.",Halloween Kills

976,loqjaw,Halloween Kills completely killed my passion for Halloween,2,15 October 2021,"I loved the 2018 film. The new direction it took. The post-traumatic theme. The way they managed to make Michael actually scary again. I truly loved that return to form, and was really excited for this instalment.What I was delivered though was a seriously unscary, badly written and frankly rather boring mess, complete with absolutely terrible dialog and strangely backwards caricatures for 2021 (""Little John?"" ""Big John?""). Also where was he going? The hospital? His house? Where exactly? In a straight line?What used to make Michael so scary was the way he would silently stalk you in the shadows, and you would only see a very quick glimpse of him before he kills and slinks back into the darkness. But here we have him at his most Terminator-like yet, loudly bashing his way through and so having him constantly on screen like this seems to really take away from that creepy effect he had going on.I can't believe I'm seeing any good praise for this film. It's my least favourite one yet (even worse than the RZ ones) and I feel it's completely missed the mark on what makes a decent Halloween film work.JLC has said that the final instalment, Halloween Ends (yeah, right!) will make fans angry. Well to echo what Mark Kermode said, I hope it makes me angry, because this one just bored me.",Halloween Kills

This one though, not so much.It takes its social commentary real serious (too serious I'd say), but is also weirdly graphic and sadistic in its violence. An example is the climax of the ""mob rule"" scene is strangely exploitative of its main victim.The film seems fight against its DNA and ends up being incongruous and frankly a bit too dumb considering that there's so much talent at work here .",Halloween Kills

So, according to this new timeline, Michael killed one person when he was 6, then goes to a hospital for 15 years. He escapes for a few days, the events(most of them) of the first movie occur, then he is captured, and goes back to the hospital for 40 years, before escaping once again. By doing this, Carpenter is giving all of us a big middle finger for having wasted our time and money watching all the other sequels, just to say, hey, let's presume only the first movie exists. They change the ending of the first movie, by having him get captured, instead of getting away. Then, they want to blame Loomis for bringing Michael back to Haddonfield. Totally ignoring the events of the first movie, where Mike drove himself to Haddonfield. I liked the masks from H3 showing up. That was a nice easter egg. I want to say more, but i don't want to give anything away. The last thing i will say is that i was rooting for Michael, the whole movie.",Halloween Kills

Carpenter's Halloween is maybe 15% violence, with hardly any blood shown, and the rest of it is storyline, character work, great dialogue, camera work, Michael stalking, tormenting and teasing his victims...I mean the only part that came close to Carpenter's work was Michael hanging his corpses from the swing set, which was the only part of the movie where I wasn't bored to tears. There is no build up. No suspense. Even in H20 the kills were spaced out and done using already established set pieces, and involved characters you cared about, not a random gay couple or a random elderly couple that you only spend ten seconds with. Michael was so methodical, and chillingly patient(didn't speak a word for fifteen years), and took his time to traumatize his victims before killing them in the original film. In this one he is a roid monkey, a robot designed for destruction, and the original Myers at least had some
humanity in him. Enough for him to have some fun and wear a sheet on his head for Lynda. Ever since Rob Zombie made Myers out to be a ruthless PCP loaded animal, instead of a patient, intelligent, methodical killer, people have followed suit but it just isn't frightening to see anymore. It almost was comical watching Michael kill people in Kills as if he's killing roaches-one girl even accidentally shoots herself. And I laughed at a person dying. In a horror film. Also, Jamie Lee is stuck in a hospital for the whole time so I can only hope Michael actually comes to the hospital in the third entry and they have a badass fight, but even then, we would be missing out on what made Myers so great. His ability to slowly drive his victims into pure terror, stalk them, and force them to have to outwit him. But this film? This is just to shed as much blood as possible.

Including one scene that almost made me tear up a bit. Overall, it's a great addition to the series and I'd put it in the top three of all-time Halloween movies with Halloween one being first and Halloween 2 being second.

First off, let me say no film in this series is academy award winning material, even the immortal 1978 classic. These are slasher films, pure and simple. Some are done with more class and style than others. Halloween Kills, in my opinion, delivers on the title's promise while giving us stylistic flashbacks that are expertly done, down to placement of furniture in the Myers house. Granted, it does try to hammer in some modern day problems and cultural issues, but that's just a part of any movie. Michael is an unstoppable force. He does survive numerous stabbings, shootings, etc,which has received a lot of complaints. But has he not also survived being shot six times in the original? That was never explained either. This is also not really a standalone movie, but rather more of a part 2 to the 2018 film, so it's not going to feel complete. This is merely a template for the trilogy closer next year. I thought this movie gave us social commentary which was eerily relevant to recent events in America, yet managed to give us the atmosphere, chills, and unrelenting bloody carnage we've come to know and love. Not to mention the continuity in the wounds and damage Michael takes in the new films. Keep in mind, the man was burned to a crisp in Halloween II, survived, and still has HAIR AND NO BURN DAMAGE in Halloween 5. At least this film had the foresight to acknowledge past films and care just a little. So for all the people giving this film 1 star, it's not for everybody, but it still puts more effort that any of those later sequels, which were complete and obvious cash grabs! Go in expecting a bloody good time, and that's what you'll get. Expect Gone with the Wind,....maybe just go see Gone with the Wind.",Halloween Kills
996,tylermiller1203,A film that believes in quantity over quality,3,16 October 2021,"If you want to watch the film I recommend streaming it. There are horror junkies out there that enjoy bad horror films and this one will definitely be a treat for you. However, if you're like me and enjoy smart well written horror films, consider this one to be skipped. This film has a lot of problems in it. It illogical, incoherent, and inconsistent. The characters are paper thin in a series where we had well developed characters the two years prior. The characters were laughably stupid. Intentionally throwing themselves in danger when they obviously have the disadvantage. I laughed so hard when two characters realized Michael was in their house, so they locked the front door and searched for him with a butter knife. And 20 minutes later our protagonists go through the same door which is miraculously unlocked. Every character tries to deliver this emotional scene where they have to be the one to kill Michael Myers. The kills in this film were so laughable that you could run a laugh track to it and it wouldn't feel put of place. Michael Myers is a human that is somehow invincible now. I liked the previous films that subtly suggested it rather than show Myers take multiple gunshots, stabs, and beatings and somehow manage to kill 20 armed men with a kitchen knife. There are so many new characters in this film that have been shoehorned in for nostalgia and diversity that i could barely keep track. And they try to do so much that we never get an opportunity to care for them when they die. The pacing is all over the place as result. Barely able to deliver on the moments that count. I also have other issues with the ha doing of Michael Myers as they pray him as a sadistic killer that tortures corpses after death. The Myers i knew didn't have emotion and would have never found enjoyment mutilating corpses. This is done for the gore in the film which there is loads of. The film seems to belive that they can't scare you with Myers being Myers but by an overabundance of gore. And somehow Myers is able to teleport out of bathroom and around houses in the blink of an eye. This has been seen in other films as well but the way it was executed here was laughable.",Halloween Kills

The exact genius of the idea of rebooting the sequel is what has ruined it. When you cut out the old sequels, you cut out all of the chaos and endless Halloweens of Michael returning and causing trauma to Haddonfield.They cut out a huge portion of WHY Michael is so feared. The old sequels showed us he truly is unstoppable.So If he only killed for one night in 1978 and then returned 40 years later, why does everyone have such a deep fear of him after all that time?

Can't have it. Questionable character decisions? Nah, that makes this movie garbage. Semi-annoying characters? No way, that's not Halloween.Halloween Kills is a fun movie. And it's a pretty good Halloween movie. I felt the progression of Michael as he seemingly gets more aggressive was a good decision. It didn't go over the top in my opinion, but there were sequences where I was on the edge of my seat, just wondering what he was gonna do. The sequence with Lonnie, Cameron and Allyson in the Myers house was a really good Halloween moment. Seeing Allyson almost beg Michael not to kill Cameron was suspenseful. Michael taking on the town was cool. The moment between him and Tommy before Tommy's death was really good. You really felt the ""bogeyman"" moment between them. That was a special Halloween moment for me.There were things in the movie that were questionable. The hospital sequence with the escaped ward patient was a little odd, but I really don't think it was as bad as many are making it out to be. It slowed the film down a bit, but is far and away a smaller misstep than the whole ""Sartain"" moment in 2018. Yes, some of the dialogue is cheesy and overused. But again, I give it a pass for the same reason I give the dialogue in 1978 a pass. It doesn't really take away from the story for me.The kills were cool and well done. James Jude Courtney is THE BEST Michael since Nick Castle. I could feel his rage and anger, but in a subtle way and that is hard to pull off. The lighting, mood and aesthetic is great. Better than the 2018 film. The mask is great as well.The score is perfect. Not much more to say on that. Carpenter killed it again. The Halloween theme kicking in when Michael chases Karen was incredible. Biggest score moment for me.The flashback is insanely good. Like better than anyone could have expected. And it added to the overall story of this movie as well. The decision to have Loomis try and kill Michael and Hawkins stop him was good writing. That is a great way to tie this universe together in a seamless way. I felt like it was 1978 again in that flashback. They nailed that. And once again, the original score being used in that flashback was a great decision by Carpenter.One of the biggest credits I will give to this movie is how they made Michael feel like such a threat. In a lot of the original sequels, Michael just didn't feel like that. In this movie, they brought back some of the force of nature to his character. You feel as though you're screwed if you're even within 100 yards of him. Michael is scary in this film, and that is a big part of why it works for me. He's pure evil, and this movie does a good job of portraying that. I also liked the suspense they created around that though. Stalking Lindsey in the swamp was a great scene.Halloween 2018 was slow, this movie was fast and I have a feeling Halloween Ends will be a little slower too. I do like that they gave us this one film just showing us why we should be very afraid of Michael. What he's TRULY capable of. He's not just a guy who killed 3 teenagers 40 years ago. He's a monster.I say all that to say this, everyone needs to stop expecting any Halloween sequel to be Shawshank Redemption. It's just not going to be. There is gonna be some campiness, some bad dialogue and questionable character decisions. There has been in every Halloween movie ever made, yes even including the original. This Halloween movie was fun and has me excited to see how we end this story.You may disagree, and that's fine. But I don't think you're ever going to find what you're looking for. In all previous timelines, the story goes down a horrible road and the movies get almost unwatchable at times. Michael's backstory is completely explained and there it goes, the mystique of Michael is gone. This new timeline is respecting his character in that regard and for that I'm certainly appreciative. I have no problem believing this is Michael from 1978. And we just didn't get that in the original sequels.Overall, this movie made a couple of decisions I wouldn't have made, and there were a couple of missteps. But this was a fun movie and a worthy addition to the franchise in my opinion.",Halloween Kills

I just hope that when Halloween Dies comes out it will redeem itself. This movie was a huge let down!!!!Michael was a beast though!

As an actor I'm very proud to say many friends/actors made it into the films so far. Even friend Will Patton continues to not disappoint. But sadly, the taint of Danny McBride like the blood that flows like a river leaves nothing more than shock instead of fear. Shock what was an incredible franchise (yes, it's had it's ups and downs) has been reduced to nothing more than a setup for a welcomed end especially with McBride writing and producing.

The characters aren't likable no matter how much they try to make them , and I think that's what they were going for. If you like the same old horror trope of characters making stupid choices that makes no sense you'll dig this. I'm aware they were trying to go for a social commentary of mob mentality backfiring but it's far too over the top.The second escaped convict little side story was so not needed and fairly predictable once we see the mugshots of two escaped convicts.Was there really any reason to bring Tommy Doyle and Deputy Hawkins back into this with such anticlimactic endings?Laurie is fairly sidelined in this movie and that's not necessarily a negative because the daughter and granddaughter are pretty effective here. Michael Myers himself is solid as well.I thought the movie was very mediocre but I'd still recommend it to people who love the franchise. I'd probably rank it 8th out of the 12 movies in the franchise.Pros
Michael Myers is effective and menacing.Flashback scene to the best character in the franchise imo Dr Loomis was cool.Laurie's daughter and granddaughter are decent characters.The unmasking was coolConsReally dumb and unlikable characters.Ineffective use of characters such as Tommy , Lindsay , and Hawkins.The other escaped convict red herringPredictable ending5/10.",Halloween Kills

1034,usermediajames,An excellent Slasher film just like it's two predecessors,10,24 October 2021,"Halloween 1978 and Halloween 2018 are both amazing and Halloween Kills is a great continuation of the series. The current Halloween films (which have stuck to the tone and feel made by creator John Carpenter) are very scary and atmospheric films that are enjoyable for both the story they tell (about an unstoppable ghost-like man terrorizing the town of Haddonfield and the ordinary residents who try to survive against him) and how said story is told (through great performances, focused writing and a superstitious lore presented by a combination of factual moments and personal character speculation). Combined with an amazing score by (again) the great John Carpenter and various entertaining and unique kills brought to life with convincing effects, and you have the makings of a classic horror series. Halloween Kills continues this tradition in every way, but it also goes all-out in the fact that it's a Slasher film; that it's a new entry in the quintessential Slasher film series and that it should take this opportunity all the way. If you loved Halloween (1978) and Halloween (2018) you will absolutely enjoy Halloween Kills, it's a bit of a unique blend of the last two that also brings it's own elements to the formula; and I loved it in all it's horror goodness.",Halloween Kills

Michael Myers is one of the brightest aspects of this film. However, if you want suspense and edge of your seat type-moments, then it's a big let down. There's only 1-3 jumpscares and barely anything to be scared of. Also, the story is really messy. It has no narrative and doesn't know what it's doing. It feels as if a Spin off movie at times because this is not the final Michael Myers-Halloween film. Another bright spot would be this film fixing lost questions people may have had from previous Halloween movies. They answer how they captured Michael Myers in 1978 where they did not do so in ""1978 Halloween"" nor ""2018 Halloween"". Also, the characters that were misused in the previous film was better used here.Besides that, this film is really bad and disappointing.

They take Laurie to the hospital to recover from her stab wound from the previous film, and a mob forms to hunt Michael. One of the other escaped patients wanders in and they chase him, ignoring the people yelling that it isn't him. They trap him and he cowers in fear, and they don't realize it's not him. Michael Myers doesn't quiver in fear, he causes it. Then, when he jumps out the window killing him self they stop and think about if they're the monsters... as if that isn't so cliché it hurts.

Now some very likable Characthers met their untimely demise in the wake of the killing spree. But all in all David Gordon Green and Danny McBride deliver the suspense and most importantly the ""KILLS""I personally cannot wait to see how the series twists and turns to the inevitable sequel Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills

Even though you definitely get some, this movie is not designed to be ""crowd pleaser,"" if I may say. Rather, it is a carefully dragged out sequel that sets up what will be the third of these sequels. I knew this with ease at about the midway mark. Although I was gonna give it a 6, I respect that a casually drawn out second movie, almost always means the best gets saved for last!

But unfortunately Halloween Kills does not live up to the hype.***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS, BUT NO MAJOR SPOILERS REGARDING KAREN OR ALLYSON. **You probably already know that Tommy, Lindsay, Brackett, and Marian Chambers are all back. That's the good news. The bad news is (mild spoiler) most of these characters are only here to be killed off.If you want to see Michael Myers brutally butcher random victims (like in Rob Zombie's version), then there's a whole lot in this movie that you will like.If you want something original, forget it! This movie borrows heavily from Halloween 2 (the hospital scene) and Halloween 4 (a mob looking to kill Michael and killing the wrong one). There's a mob scene that reminds me of the end of 'Joker.' That's the ONLY thing remotely new in this movie, which is the main problem with this new trilogy....there really is nothing new to add to the Michael Myers/Laurie Strode saga that hasn't been done already in the original sequels, the Rob Zombie remake, the Zombie remake sequel, and Halloween 2018. There literally is NO more story to tell, so Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills simply rehash plot points from the original sequels.If you're looking for ANY KIND of a happy ending, there isn't one. This movie is not a good movie in and of itself, but a decent transition into Halloween Ends in 2022.I will give this 4/10 stars.One star for characters returning from John Carpenter's Halloween.One star for brutal kills and genuine suspense.One star for brilliant 1978 flashback scenes.That's it!HUGE letdown, and by the way (mild spoiler) Laurie Strode does NOTHING in this movie. Laurie is literally in the hospital the WHOLE movie with lots of good 'evil dies tonight' talk but no action.Not as good as Halloween 4 and 6 or 2018, and not even in the same league as Halloween 2 (1981), a far superior sequel.",Halloween Kills

I think it was little better.The movie is not perfect and the story doesnt really go somewhere. It just showing that micheal didnt die and how he escape the end trap of 2018.The acting was good. The suspence and nostalgia was there. There's some part that was very effective. And the music and ambiance remind me alot of the old one.Now the effect were really good. The gore was very present and I think this is the most violent and brutal halloween movie that I've seen. And the 1978 added part were really cool. Loomis was really well done. He looked like donald pleasence for the short time that we see him, and I didnt notice anything wrong with his face, in the theater at least.If you like old slasher film not just for the story but the gore,ambiance and mood of the movie. I think you will like it. But it is not like the 2018 version. It take alot of ideas from the old ones and make it very different in some ways but very entertaining.Overall I had a good times and some kills were really graphics, well executed, but It not for everybody.",Halloween Kills

The more they redo it and sequel it the more disappointing the finished product becomes. The build up and hype to this movie was pretty intense so needless to say my expectations of it were pretty let down. It was a little sloppy and all over the place. The build-up and tense environment you long ago found in horror movies has since dissolved and it's instead just right in for the kill. Which doesn't leave you feeling as involved as you were watching an original done many years back. Just like ""Scream"" was such a disappointment back in 2011. Because it like many other movies succeeded so well due to it being a product of it's time. There is no creativity anymore, no new concepts, scripts, franchises, it's now all about just pulling pieces of cinematic achievements in history back up to modernize them and ultimately butcher them. I wasn't impressed. Sorry.",Halloween Kills

Jamie as always puts on a good performance despite not being in most of this movie and that house fire scene that was shown in the trailer is amazing. I like the little flashbacks that show how Michael was caught by the police and I like the idea of everyone in town teaming uo against Michael, Michael is the best part of the movie wiith his graphic and gory kills(Which are amazing) and his status as a unstoppable force be reinforced. Thats the good now to the bad.Most of these characters just exist to die. I found their dialog very repetitive and boring, the decisions characters make are stupid as well. Half the movie is taken up by that hospital scene where a lot of people chase a random guy they think is Michael just so he can jump out a window and die. The old characters returning is something I would enjoy if the actors put on good performances but sadly the performces come out as lackluster and flat. The repetitive dialog between Tommy and the towns folk gets old quick when they repeat statements or chant for too long.Overall I was very hype for this movie but I was really dissapointed. The only thing this movie adds to the series is showing how much of a monster Michael Myers is and that Karen mayne dies but other than that this movie is just plain filler.",Halloween Kills

I've always thought it was the weakest franchise when it comes to the big ones in the genre. Saw Halloween Kills opening night in the theater and have watched it at home as well. I think it's easily the best Halloween film to date outside of the original. And even then, I'll be watching this instead of Halloween 1978 on Halloween night from now on. This movie showed Michael as the true threat that he is, the OST is amazing, the film has gorgeous cinematography and practical effects. The story was engaging and contained tons of Easter eggs for long time fans of the franchise. Honestly can't wrap my head around why some people really dislike this movie. It's cliché to say it but Halloween Kills really is an Empire Strikes Back type of middle film. It's 100% Michael Myers' movie. An absolute masterpiece for me.

Opening scenes, and fire scene (from a firefighter) impressive. Strong scene, a little shorter than I would have liked. Then its starts to fall off. I did enjoy the flash backs showing back story of Hawkins. Then he spends the whole movie in a bed. Laurie same. Utilizing characters from the franchise was a nice change, but they lacked any real depth. The mob mentality was a nice throwback to halloween 4, but only when it came to the street fight. The hospital scene did not build on the story but took away from what could have been a great movie. Its nice to see the franchise as I love Halloween and Myers.

My favorite is Halloween, followed by part 2, Halloween H20 and the remake by Rob Zombie, in that order. Rob Z. Version gave you a little bit of some insight on who Michael was before he transitioned into the monstrous killing machine he become. Never the less, I like how the writers integrated the victims and victims family members that survived from the original Halloween movie and the other victims from sequels thereafter. The attempt to link all the sequences together and bring Michael long nightmare reign over haddonfield to an end was nice. I am curious as to why no one has never tried to take Michael's head(walking dead >kill the brain) or the destroy his home he always returned to(where would he go if the house is gone?) and also what ever happened to laurie's son from Halloween H20 - hhhmmm? Well anyway at some point this reign has to end. After all Jamie Lee Curtis is not getting any younger. Now that Michael may have possibly killed Laurie's daughter and we still don't know where her son is(Halloween H20). What's next for the Halloween series? I would love to hear from John Carpenter on this?",Halloween Kills

Part 3 didn't have a thing to do with Parts 1 and 2, and the remaining billion ""sequels"" put me to sleep. Those involved with the series decided a reboot was needed, so we began all over again. Which leads us to this mess.""Halloween Kills"" supposedly continues right from the night ""he came home."" And it makes absolutely no sense. If you're into a movie strictly for gore, this one might be for you. If you like a little story, forget it. Laurie Strode (Michaels' sister?) is in the hospital nursing a knife wound she got from her last encounter with Michael. Now, because of loudmouthed Tommy Doyle (survivor of the 1978 film) has the entire town of Haddonfield up in arms, everyone is out to kill Michael. Tommy's going to do it with a....wait for it...BASEBALL BAT! Michael's survived numerous electrocutions, gun shots, stabbings, even a beheading, but he's gonna stop him with a bat!

I did have to laugh at Tommy going after a man who's been shot, stabbed, set on fire and on and on, with a baseball bat, yeah, that'll get the job done.

1078,charlesmsommer,Feels like fanfiction.,3,15 October 2021,"I hate this movie.Michael Myers isn't even the focus of the movie, and when he is, these scenes feel like the weakest since part IV. It has plenty of gore and the gore is alright, I'd even say it's impressive, but Halloween is not about the gore! It never has been! The first (and only good) movie had almost 0 gore due to its low budget, and made Michael Myers scary through the build up to the kill, which there is almost none of in this movie.They got the physicality of Michael Myers wrong, he's far too brutal for Michael Myers, and the editing does him no favors either. The reason the original works is because most of the kills are one, uninterrupted shot.And that's my next thing, you can really feel that this is not a John Carpenter movie. Especially during the flashback before the title card, it just feels off. The way it's shot, the way it's edited, the dialogue, all of it essentially feels like a fan film.This is fanfiction. If it weren't for the large cast, the gore, and Jamie Lee Curtis, this would feel like a student film.About Jamie lee Curtis, she is asleep for half of the movie! She never even interacts with Michael Myers in this film which maybe wouldn't be a bad thing if it didn't cut back to her every 2 minutes!This movie fails because the cast is TOO big. Michael Myers has never faced off against a large group of people, he's not supposed to. He picks people off. And there's nothing that makes him less scary than seeing him getting beat up by a bunch of randoms, even if he comes back to life and kills them a few moments later.I paid for peacock premium to watch this, and what a waste of $5. Watch the original and pretend that the story ends there.",Halloween Kills
1079,coasteraddict-16796,I really wanted to like this movie,3,27 October 2021,"Let me just start out by saying the 2018 Halloween was pretty great. I expected something similar with this one, and unfortunately walked away feeling very disappointed.The trailer looked promising. It led viewers to believe that Laurie would be going after Michael, but instead she stays in a hospital room and does nothing for the entire movie. However, this is hardly the only problem.Normally, when watching a horror movie, I can excuse one or two dumb decisions by characters. But in this movie, literally EVERY character is so incredibly stupid that I think I lost braincells watching it. Whenever a character has the opportunity to either stop Michael from killing or run away, they NEVER take it. Not to mention that god-awful plot with the escaped mental patient that led to some philosophical BS about people becoming ""monsters"" just because of Michael's presence. This is the 12th movie in a franchise, why is it trying to spread a message like this? What does it think it is?Also: the ""Evil must die"" chant was cringeworthy. The gimmick of this movie seemed to be that Michael would be taken down but real talk, who actually expected that? Not only that, but killing Tommy Doyle, a character that has been around since the original, in such a ridiculous way is truly a frustrating plot point. And to top it all off, Laurie's daughter also dies at the end, because why not?This movie is such a mess. What were the writers thinking???? This franchise should have ended with H20.",Halloween Kills

1092,viktorrasse,VERY disappointing! Had tickets to two screenings. Refunded the ticket for the 2nd show.,2,15 October 2021,"The.1978 movie is a classic. The 1981 sequel watchable. Every iteration since until the 2018 alt-universe movie were horrible (and I'm not even touching the two Rob Zombie atrocities). The 2018 movie, which pretended (like we all wanted to) that none of the other sequels existed, and took the story into a new and amazing direction. It left us wanting more.Then this movie came out.I was excited to see that so many of the actors from the original movie would make an appearance (including an amazing job re-creating Dr. Loomis - the only reason I gave this film 2 stars). The beginning of the film seemed to make the wait worthwhile. Then the opening credits stopped. And with them, any evidence of good writing. The flashbacks made it seem like the editor had a series of ""Oh - wait. We should have also said x"" moments. Instead of a linear film, we are in 2021. Then 1978, Now 2018. Back to 1978. And so on.And the film got preachy. Like so many sequels that have been handed over to writers & directors who don't understand what made the originals great, this one became a South Park episode, with Judy Greer providing the voiceover monologue of how WE were the monsters. Forgetting entirely that the thing that ""worked"" in the original is that the Shape was fearsome because we didn't know what it is, what its motivations are, etc. This time, time the writers / director made all of us the monster, and psychoanalyzed why we are that way.But then, to make it an even sloppier mess, the same holier-than-thou character who just decried mobs and mob justice . . . USES A MOB in an attempt to defeat Michael.I actually bought tickets to two showings today (Yes - I'm that much a fan of the original, and very much liked the 2018 sequel). After the ending of the first screening, I got a refund on the ticket for the second showing and used the money to buy a small bottle of booze.

I'm a big fan of the Halloween series, so going into the theater I was most definitely influenced by my established love of the franchise. With that out of the way: I loved this movie. Is it perfect? No. Some moments, like when the bodies of the nurse man and doctor lady are found in the playground, make absolutely no sense. Michael had already left that area across a bridge without setting up those bodies. The social commentary feels a bit forced in: where was this other inmate in Haddonfield in the last movie? Some parts were unintentionally (I think) hilarious, like when Michael kept stabbing the old guy in the back with all those knives. And why, out of all the characters, did Lyndsey survive? Really? But, this movie is so completely entertaining, fun, and rewarding that it completely makes up for its shortcomings. The opening flashback sequence is amazing, perfectly recreating the feel of the older Halloween movies. The kills are great, and so is Michael. The music is awesome. The ending is pretty awesome. Overall, I had such a great time with this movie that I feel I have to give it a high score. It's not nearly perfect, but I still think it's great.",Halloween Kills

I enjoy the ongoing story between Laurie and Michael. Personally, even though I am not the most avid horror movie fan, Michael is my favorite character in the genre. If you were looking for just carnage in this movie, you got it for the most part. With that said, the movie's plot felt like just a bridge to the next rendition. This movie alone could have been cut down to 30ish minutes and used as an opening sequence to the final movie. The use of Laurie in this movie was also disappointing, considering she is the main character in the storyline. She is what feels to be a side character in the action and is just plain rude to many people she interacts with. I would give the movie 5 stars, but since they killed Karen, it gets a bonus star just for jokes.",Halloween Kills

If I could give it 0 stars I would!! Halloween kills makes Bigfoot the lost tapes look like a piece of brilliant film-making up there with the greats such as creep 1 and 2 and troll hunter 35.Halloween kills manages to destroy an absolutely beloved character of the Halloween franchise, Tommy Doyle. I dont know what kenny powers was thinking when he decided to make tommy the biggest f!@*#() moron in the entire movie, he legit acted like he was on steroids the entire time. Danny McBride, also known for voicing Bomb in Angry Birds 2 The Movie, somehow managed to make tommy SO DUMB, it made Bobo the sasquatcher hunter from finding bigfoot look like a genius only rivaled by stephen hawking (rip). Tommy for me will always be known as the tommy performed by the great paul rudd. Also the black feller who played the mayor was suprisingly good, nice change of pace from previous movies.With all that being said, this by far has been my favorite Halloween movie to come out thus far and I look forward to seeing how Kenny Powers (Voice of Honey Mustard in Sausage Party) wraps up the trilogy.Review by M45A.",Halloween Kills
1105,hrkxpy,Another stain on a classic beloved horror franchise. REWATCH the originals instead.,2,31 October 2021,"Anyone who loves and appreciates what made Halloween a classic must watch in the top ten best ever horror franchises, would never write such a tone deaf offshoot. This is almost as bad as the last offering from the same Director.The problem lies with the misguided direction that tries to complicate the simple storyline that have made the originals stand the test of time. NONE of the remakes from Rob Zombie onwards have come even close to capturing the brilliance of the first two films in the franchise. The key to their brilliance is found in the three main characters: Loomis, Michael and Lorie. Michael's stoic mysterious persona is defined by Loomis and Lorie's fearful descriptions of a soulless killer that is pure evil.The pacing adds to the suspense in the first two original films from the 1970's through the sequels in the 80's (minus the atrocity that was the Witches part three). Halloween Kills lost out on Loomis, sadly, due to his passing but wasted Jamie Lee Curtis. The hospital setting in the original Part Two was empty of visitors overnight which created the perfect atmosphere in the second OG film. There is no excuse for filling the hospital in Halloween Kills with a silly mob and not using Lorie facing off with Michael at any point in this film. Halloween films are no place for political statements. So unnecessary. The mob scenes were ridiculous and took viewers out of the suspense expected in horror films as did many of the circus like scenes found throughout (the bar, the gay duo and their cringey lines, the hospital mob, etc).The Michael Matrix like action scenes where he kills multiple people (TWICE) added to the clown like circus the film became with the cheesy dialogue and pointless filler scenes and characters. As a writer who went to film school, this film was incredibly disappointing. Where are they finding writers and directors these days? It seems like they really don't care. The formula that made the originals great does NOT need to be changed. It was brilliant in its simplicity. We want suspenseful pacing. We want Lorie vs Michael or iterations of that with a few old characters (NOT every Joe Schmoe he ran into in every film). Lazy writing. The gay couple was too comedic as was the Tommy gang. Why were the scenes not set up dark and foreboding? Please hire better writers or let me do it. This film and the last few in this franchise are an insult to the greatness that is Michael Myers and the originals. What a shame.",Halloween Kills

So it is annoying to read so many people giving this movie bad reviews because of it being ""unbelievable""! That's the whole BLOODY point!! Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the story and reference to flashbacks was very easy to follow and the flashbacks didn't disrupt the flow of the film.

The movie was hard to follow, even as someone who has seen the 2018 prequel a few times. There were so many unnecessary added new characters that only served to oddly break up the narrative and add to the awkward of the pacing of the film.

1122,futureboymaddog,This Franchise Died Tonight,1,18 October 2021,"In HALLOWEEN KILLS, co-writer/director David Gordon Green takes on Michael Myers as a living (or is he living?) embodiment of chaos, a sort of destroyer of worlds where the more he kills, the stronger he becomes.And one has to ask the question:Why are they trying to both humanize Michael as a man-child who snapped and has an endless bloodlust but also mythologize Michael as something other than human?It opens with Cameron discovering Officer Hawkins, after having his throat partially cut by the insane doctor caring for Michael, who declares that he has to kill Michael. Then we flash back to Halloween night in Haddonfield in 1978, the night of the original film, and Michael is still on the loose despite being shot several times by Dr. Loomis as he saves Laurie Strode and the two children she's babysitting, Tommy and Lindsay. A young Hawkins is with his partner searching the ancestral Myers house and his partner is accosted by Myers, but instead of shooting Myers, Hawkins accidentally shoots his partner and stops an impressive CG reconstruction of Donald Pleasance executing Michael before he's taken into custody. We then move to Laurie Strode, her daughter Karen and granddaughter Allyson speeding away from Laurie's burning compound as fire trucks approach while Laurie screams in vain to ""Let him burn!""Then we cut to a talent show at the Haddonfield bar where adult Tommy, adult Lindsay and now septuagenarian nurse Marion are drinking and celebrating together their survival of that night 40 years prior when they're all alerted to Laurie being in the hospital after her showdown with Michael. Meanwhile, the first responders at Laurie's place are all killed just because they're there. The news of this spreads through the town and Tommy, Lindsay, and Marion decide that they need a vigilante mob to hunt down Michael and kill him due to the the ineffectual and incompetent town police. Within a matter of seconds the town shifts its focus from concern or mourning for Michael's victims to a murderous and bloodthirsty mob ready to kill anyone they believe is Michael Myers. And of course, Michael continues to cut a bloody swath across Haddonfield for... no particular reason.This film has a number of problems, but one of the cardinal sins is that, after the first 20 minutes or so, you're starting to actively root for Michael because the townsfolk of Haddonfield are so grotesquely and laughably stupid in every decision they make that you honestly might end up thinking, ""Well, the species just got stronger.""The other cardinal sin is that, while Jamie Lee Curtis is in the film, she spends almost the entire film in a hospital bed, having philosophical discussions with Will Patton's Officer Hawkins about who or what is to blame for Michael Myers and how he has apparently fully transcended humanity and become some sort of sheer force of nature or an embodiment of Haddonfield's sins or fear or ... something. It's very unclear what the film is trying to say, but that becomes less important as Laurie has nothing to do with the actual on-screen action, and sidelining her is just a very bad idea. In fact, the real horror of this film is the hospital bill Laurie is going to receive after she's undergone surgery, gets out of her recovery bed and is reinjured while she includes herself in the vigilante mob running amok in the hospital.It also continues Michael's enhanced flair for the theatrical as more and more bodies are posed post-mortem with bodies being carefully placed on merry-go-rounds or posed the same way they appear in a photograph together. I give you that Michael, in the 1978 original, did take the headstone of Judith Myers and place it on a bed and posed the body of Annie Brackett beneath it, but he's going all out here as he shoves lamps inside decapitated heads and switches heads on headless corpses.The film also seems to embrace Michael Myers in the era of Trump, as there's a very uncomfortable middle act centered around an angry, murderous mob fomented by the very idea that there is evil in their midst. This dredged up, intentionally or otherwise, some similarities to the Jan. 6th insurrection.Obviously with any horror sequel, and anyone who saw SCREAM 2 can attest based on Randy's discussion on the rules of horror sequels, the kills are far more elaborate but instead of there being some humor or suspense to the kills, the brutality is increased a hundredfold. There is an early scene where Michael enters the home of an elderly couple and, after stabbing one of them through the throat with a broken fluorescent light tube, the victim is forced to lay there dying while Michael uses what must be every knife in the house to kill the victim's husband. And at that point, I was asking myself, ""Is this supposed to be fun?""Because it's not. With the exception of one just absolutely ridiculous kill, none of the kills are fun or clever; they're just extremely brutal and ugly. Green clearly wants to have his cake and eat it too as he wants to give the gorehounds something to enjoy watching but also wants to bludgeon the audience into submission with each new kill as if to ask, ""You must be scared by now, RIGHT?""But there's the rub: HALLOWEEN KILLS is never scary. We don't know enough about the characters that die to care about them in the first place; they're literally just fodder for Michael's various methods of murder and if we don't care about them, we don't fear for them. The opening slaughter of the firefighters and EMTs is just there to set the table for how many more bodies we're likely to see by the film's end.It's also never entertaining. It's okay for a slasher film to have fun with the cleverness of its kills or the witticisms of the characters, but no one's funny, and none of the kills really have any kind of entertainment value. I look at another recent big-studio horror film like James Wan's MALIGNANT, and I see a director who has a very specific vision of what he wants the film to be, and he's not looking to really scare the audience as much as entertain the living hell out of them. Yes, MALIGNANT is ridiculous in its central conceit, but it's gleefully and gloriously ridiculous. Wan understood that he couldn't let the audience take things too seriously because of the turn that comes in the third act, and here, Green seems to want to make both an 80's throwback slasher and a modern horror with something to say about society and violence and fear and it's clear very early on that he's bitten off much more than he can chew.Another major problem is that this film is very obviously filler between parts one and three of this trilogy. The ending is so ridiculous and wrong-headed that it feels like the climax is supposed to now be a multigenerational revenge story, but it's clear that of the three generations represented in the Strode family, only one is going to survive all the way to the end of the next film.When I originally heard that Green's trilogy was intended to be the only canonical sequels to the 1978 original, ignoring all the stuff that came later, it felt like part of that was a good idea, but the other parts weren't. All the ""curse"" garbage makes about as much sense as anything else in most of the sequels, but then there was Steve Miner's H20: HALLOWEEN 20 YEARS LATER, which, while being very much a post-SCREAM horror film, is the first film to excise all the other sequels with the exception of HALLOWEEN II where we learn that Laurie is actually Michael's sister. It's also the first to deal with Laurie's PTSD, where she's trying to get on with her life, but thanks to not just one but two times she had to deal with Michael trying to kill her, she's now a functioning alcoholic and kind of a terrible parent. This is indeed where the series should have ended, but of course it didn't because the real villain is the box office and if a horror film does well enough, it's going to have a sequel. Believe me: I'm not being harsh to Green's efforts just because I stan what I think is the only really good sequel to the original, but that film works better as a showcase for Curtis and the culmination of Laurie's arc.The only real benefit of Green's canonical sequels is that we still have Curtis in the newer ""Grambo"" style of horror hero, but unlike H20, the family drama in this series seems to function only as a way to set up a new final girl rather than having Laurie Strode, scarred and weary, still complete her arc as the only one who can end Michael Myers.HALLOWEEN KILLS falls short in every category. It's not smart, it's not clever, it's not fun and most importantly, it's not scary.",Halloween Kills

At the 30 minute minute mark I realised there was essentially no plot. It was just an utterly nonsensical continuation of the climactic scene from the previous movie (which was actually decent).The characters, dialogue, plot progression, acting etc. Were so bad it was genuinely comical. The whole theatre was laughing at times. It could have been salvaged if it leaned into how comically bad it was and went more of a Scary Movie / parody route.I honestly don't even consider this a movie. It felt like watching a random assortment of deleted scenes from the last film. Some of the scenes were jaw-droppingly stupid. It jumps from random locations to random characters with random dialogue. It was actually amazing to witness such poor film making on display, just coasting off the fame of a classic.Lastly, to anyone even considering this film being more than 1 star.

1126,DrollDame,Halloween Obsessed & Sorely Disappointed,5,24 October 2021,"Let me preface by explaining that I saw the '78 original in '79 when I was four years old and spent my lifetime obsessed with Michael Myers as a result. I was really impressed with the 2018 follow up to the original and had been anticipating this one ever since. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed in this one. The acting was decent, but the writing was really, really bad. Every kill came as a direct result of a what must've been a severely mentally challenged character doing the exact opposite thing any sane human being with a mediocre intellect, would do. And many of them were survivors of previous Myers attacks. There were several tag lines from the original thrown in, which provoked cringes instead of nostalgia.If you're a fan of the franchise, you're gonna watch it no matter what. My aim is to warn you that this may have been the worst of all the sequels, and we all know that's not an easy feat. So, please, watch it impaired so you can at least get a good laugh in.

1137,EvanparkerT,Carnage Candy!,8,15 October 2021,"The heck with the critics, if you love the Halloween franchise you will enjoy this film. This movie didn't have not one dull moment, great acting especially from JLC, Andi Matichak, and Judy Greer, awesome character moments, and brutal kills. This film feels more align with the original than 2018.",Halloween Kills
1138,sherip1,"Awful, just awful!",3,30 October 2021,"I really liked the last movie, where the 3 generations of Stroad women supposedly outsmarted Michael and did him in. Now this gory, sickening sequel, where he deals with everyone who survived his past attacks, along with basically everyone else in town. I really wished I hadn't watched it. I feel a little nauseous. If you are thinking of watching it to see Jamie Lee in action, don't waste your time.",Halloween Kills
1139,spikeycool22,This movie is the embodiment of evil!,8,15 October 2021,As a huge Halloween and slasher movie fan I am this movie really did it for me. There were moments where I was on the edge of my seat and so scared of what was to come. The kills were done well and handled with a lot of tension. There were a few minor details that I would've changed but that doesn't ruin the movie. Lastly the ending was well done and left me shocked and wanting to watch Halloween Ends right away. If you are a slasher fan and a Halloween fan then you have to give this movie a shot. Very well done!,Halloween Kills
1140,metal_god9,Dissappointing story telling,4,16 October 2021,"I don't know what happened to film making, especially in the horror genre, but this movie feels more like a trailer for what seems like endless sequels than a complete story. There was an opportunity for a really interesting story here. That being the town folk (and previous victims) rallying to rid the Frankenstein's monster. But they go the route of Frankenstein without making the Frankenstein's monster innocent in any way.The build up to the finale was intriguing but the payoff was not at all satisfying or believable. There were at least 30 people around Michael once he was cornered and some how he managed to get the upper hand (seemingly to serve the purpose of another installment of this franchise). That and several characters from the original were brought back and dispensed unceremoniously (especially the finale sequence were main characters are apparently killed within seconds with no reverence). What a waste.The world of cinema doesn't need more sequels, it needs the satisfaction it was promised with the story building before it was taken from the audience in a ploy to make more money.",Halloween Kills
1141,madurijr-558-835920,Evil dies tonight and so does this trash bag,5,16 October 2021,I did enjoy it because Michael is a legend however the dialogue was comedic and some really confusing scenes. The talent show at the bar where the dude tells a boogeyman story while the bar cheers is great. The mob at the hospital chasing the troll who escaped and mistakenly identifying as Michael was also top notch. The flash back scenes were awful too.,Halloween Kills
1142,shinigamibeer,Finally a good Halloween movie,8,17 October 2021,"Going back to what Halloween was about, Michael Myers killing in a movie that doesn't waste too much time with a story that no one really cares about that much, it's one of the goriest film from Halloween, so if you want to see a movie about Michael Myers brutally killing people in an atmospheric Halloween setting this is the great movie to watch with your friends, But if you want a deeper and long story about the characters and Michael you'll be disappointed,Jaime Lee Curtis isn't that much in this movie because of what happens in the movie before this it makes sense and honestly I don't find the story that deep or interesting to invest so much time in and I bet most people don't either.The director toned down the (intentional) humor in this movie too compared to the previous one, that is a great decision since it doesn't make sense to watch a horror movie with a lot of jokes in it, it will just make it a lot harder to enjoy since horror and comedy is a subjective topic for everyone.The new characters in this movies happens to make some silly decision that doesn't make sense, it didn't bother me since I've seen people do worse in real life and having dumb and smart characters makes a great setting for a slasher movie. I like the more serious tone from the first movie though but again it didn't bother me.This movie take it back to what halloween used to be and I feel like when they try to make something beyond that it looses some of that visceral feel that I got from the first two films. So I appreciate that they dyled that back a little. But I can understand that for some fans they might find this movie disappointing specially the people that enjoyed the 2018 film.",Halloween Kills

You can't expect a seasoned audience to suspend their belief this much.For example a group is attacked in a car, one person gets out of said car with a gun. Michael gets in and starts doing his thing for a couple of minutes to the other people inside. Then when he finishes inside the car, the scene cuts to the person with the gun who's now walking towards the car and shooting from 30 meters away... they could have had him point blank.A mother also sees her dead child through a window in passing in a hospital, the child is completely uncovered on a steel slab for anyone to see passing the room, it makes no sense.Many moments like these really ruined the positives for me and took me out of the movie.

It's something that I'd see 2 but not more. It livid up to the disgusting and horrible deaths to what Michael is known for. With a twist of ""everyday objects"" of the ""Now generation"" instead of his beginning weapon of to me at least one single type of knife, with the ""newer"" weapons being used to now kill his victims with.

There is no doubt that the 2018 Halloween was a rare gem with high expectations. However, this movie is much deeper than initially first expected and exceeded those expectations. The background of Michael and the events that first took place when he murdered his sister are re-examined and I felt I gained a perspective that I never had before. That perspective being what makes Michael...well...Michael. This movie shows he is not an immortal but instead a psychotic, animalistic man. I enjoyed the portrayal of him. This is by far the most violent Halloween movie I can recall. There are plenty of jump thrills mixed with comedic undertones that keep you wanting more. Great addition to one of, if not the best, all time horror movie franchises.",Halloween Kills

The social commentary of the mob mentality of the folks of Haddonfield, was their feeble attempt to connect the film to the acts of January 6th. The recreation of Dr. Loomis was so poor, it was embarrassing. And the use of Jamie Lee Curtis who got first billing, was laughable at best. Other than that, it was swell.",Halloween Kills

Terrible script, some questionable acting, it started so well and got more and more ridiculous. Every character is a total horror cliche, annoyingly bad decisions, no realism or suspense whatsoever like the last film.The scenes of ""chaos"" in the hospital were so unnatural, people shuffling about. Tommy randomly going off on his own, but didn't actually go anywhere. And it's just gratuitously violent, not like the original which had no blood. This is just a gorefest and we've seen it all before.What a shame. No-one will want to see Halloween Ends after this one.",Halloween Kills

If I wanted to see 100 people killed in what quickly became boring ridiculous nonsense fight scenes, I would have watched a Friday the 13th or Kung-fu movie. Dumb plot, horrible script. Written for those that like non-stop kill scenes, but not what one would expect from the Halloween franchise. Completely changed how Michael behaved in first and last film.

That being said, I will say thats what makes Halloween kills perfect in my eyes. I could pick at it but why? It gave me everything a horror/slasher/blood soaked can give you. Even a little corny cheesiness is ok in small doses. Flashback scenes is what brought this movie to perfect status. I was very impressed by the attention to detail and Dr. Loomis returning in what looked like a possible cgi or awesome lookalike. I liked the reintroduction of the old characters returning and enjoyed seeing what they are like

I wouldn't even say it was Remake good.I wish they would have kept the supernatural element out of it.Yes, Michael has always been more than just a guy in a mask, the original definitively made that clear, but one of the major reasons 4-6 are so bad is the overindulgence into the supernatural, which is something, unfortunately, the third act of Kills starts to do.The movie goes from 'evil ends tonight', to Michael is an ideal/force of nature who's just there to corrupt Haddonfield, to finally, 'he's not a man or an ideal at all, and is just evil incarnate and he can't be killed because the more he kills, the more powerful he becomes'.Basically, they took the worst parts of 4, 5, and 6 and rolled them all into this movie.I'm not even going to go into the mess that was the last 5 minutes or so. The ending was very clearly reshoots that were never in the original script. Almost like they never finished before COVID, forgot what they were doing, then filmed the ending right before they released it.It's a shame, 2018 was arguably one of the better movies in the franchise, and it got this follow-up.

1166,BeeTree123,Shows moments of brilliance but lacking overall,6,15 October 2021,"I thought Halloween (2018) did a great job at reviving the story of Michael Myers. It did an excellent job at introducing new characters while balancing the characters from the original all while building suspense.Going into this movie knowing that this movie is part of a trilogy, I was curious how it was going to keep me interested, regardless, I was super excited for this film!Halloween Kills does a phenomenal job at utilizing flashbacks to create backstory for the characters. The flashbacks are done so well, it genuinely feels like 1978. The effects and camera grain are done so subtly to help sell the effect.The gore in this film was raised to a whole new level! I thought it was well done! With ""kills"" in the title, set the bar high for itself and it did not disappoint! Killings were very gruesome and helped remind the audience how ruthless Michael is!Where Halloween Kills excels in creating backstory for characters, it fails in advancing the story in the present day. Laurie Strode and and Officer Hawkins are confined to the hospital, this would be okay if they used this plot point to build other characters like Laurie's daughter, granddaughter or Tommy. Instead, half of the movie follows Tommy and the rest of the town's vigilantes in effort to fill time and provide more killings (the latter I am okay with) but no real connection between Tommy and the audience is established, simply relying on the 1978 version to connect the audience.Using one of the escaped mental patients as a diversion was just simply a time filler. If the attempt was to show how civilians taking matters into their own hands gets innocent people killed, this could have been much better, or not even at all.While I'm sure the final film in this trilogy will be a memorable one, this particular film, could be easily skipped over. This film should have helped build up the next film, whetting the appetite of the audience. I can't say this film did that. There is no cliffhanger and the only attempt at building towards the next movie is rapid film cuts to Laurie as her daughter is being killed.",Halloween Kills
1167,chrismiller-10436,Waste of talent,2,16 October 2021,Boring. I lost interest pretty quickly but kept watching as my wife seemed to be into the movie. Her comment after it was over... boring. So much talent and I'm assuming money spent and it could have been so much better in so many ways. Was it supposed to be camp? Serious? Fun? It didn't do a good job with anything other than some gore. Zzzzzzzz. Some decent kills I guess. Waste of time and money.,Halloween Kills
1168,chasemerck,Don't read the negatives,8,23 October 2021,If you're like me and love the original but then loved Rob Zombies adaptation because it really showed how people describe Myers then this movie is for you!

1172,SarahAliciaFox,This movie was so unbelievably bad..,2,15 October 2021,"I had very low expectations after the 2018 garbage movie but some how this one still managed to be even worse than I thought it would be.The movie itself is so incredibly pointless, poor writing, unbelievably cliché, fails to not make the same mistakes the bad Halloweens have made in the past and EVERY single character in this movie is an actual idiot and I mean even worse than you have seen in any other movie.First there's a flashback of the original events from the first movie where Myers has a cop strangled in his hands standing behind him is a hostage shield position as the other cop comes in like an idiot and shoots the cop by accident in the neck and lets Myers get away.. Then there's a group of about 15 firefighters with axes and a cement saw in front of Michael and what do they do? Stand there with a fire truck hose spraying him with water until he slowly walks up to them and kills the one spraying him and he just stands there and lets him, another few effortlessly attack him while he kills them at the same time then the guy with the cement saw just lets him push it back on himself and the rest apparently got massacred too when it shows their bodies later on.Next we have Myers go into an older couple's home, he kills the husband then the wife (who happens to have a kitchen knife by the way) can't unlock the door and instead of going to the left or right door way, she just stands there crying and lets him walk up to her and stab her in the neck without even using the knife at all in her hand.After that we have a car of 4 people, a male and female couple, Marion from (Halloween 1, 2 and H20) and Lyndsey from (Halloween 1) Lyndsey gets out to tell some kids on a kid's park to go home while Myers is on the car grabbing the 2 women in the car each side by their hair while Marion shoots about 5 times at nothing wasting bullets then when she actually has a shot, surprise surprise the gun clicks and he kills her and the dude then the female of the couple comes back shooting at the car recklessly completely missing every shot like a blind person with a gun and goes up to the car like an idiot again and Myers opens the door on her hand so she accidentally shoots herself. Then he goes after Lyndsey who could literally just keep running and he'd never catch up with her but decides to randomly stop and hide in some grass..Then everyone in the hospital turns into a riot mob to kill Myers and they go after one of the escaped patients from the previous film thinking he is Myers even though Myers face was plastered on the news so this makes no sense. He then kills himself.Finally the stupid mob goes to hunt Myers and they actually manage to lead him to a trap where Karen takes his mask and lures him to a road where they all get out their cars and trucks, I'd say around 20+ people surround him with guns, bats, knives ect. So yeah this is where he definitely dies right? Nope. They beat him up a bit, shoot his torso a few times, Karen stabs him in the back of the shoulder then walks off then wow look at that he gets up and I'm not joking, he kills every single one of them.... Yep. He kills 20+ people with bats, guns and knives that's how dumb this movie is....How do you have 10 Halloween movies previous and still make the worst god damn characters, clichés, writing and logic in all the movies combined? Like how? What are they smoking when making these dumb scenes? Oh and the legendary character Laurie Strode is just sat in a hospital bed the whole movie like some side character.I used to think Jamie Lee Curtis had the greatest ideas for Halloween after she came up with the great and satisfying end to the original franchise, Halloween H20 which obviously was ruined by Resurrection and even she herself was annoyed at and understandably wanted to be done with Halloween and move on. However, then she agrees to this mess of a reboot and thinks it's a good idea. Like what? How do you go from one extreme to the next..All I can think when watching 2018 and this one is, are the people involved in this movie high or something when making it? Is so awful and it couldn't be any further from a 'Halloween' movie if it tried. This is not the Halloween I grew up with and came to love, it's a garbage failure of a reboot attempt made for clueless young people today to snag in some profit. Halloween is not some massive body count gore feast either like this trash.I love how they say they wanted Myers to be less supernatural yet still he's still getting back up fit and fine after being pitch forked though his entire back and shot about 7 times.. Yeah what happened to that? They don't even know what they're doing with this franchise it's like they're making it up as they go along.If I had to rate it I'd give it 2/10 the same as the 2018 movie. Nothing memorable, plot holes throughout, messy pointless plot, awful characters, bottom of the barrel writing and would put it as low as Resurrection and 2018.",Halloween Kills
1173,stphbrn-91215,The Horror of Collective Trauma,9,15 October 2021,"This movie is heavily character-focused, showing how the violence of Michael Meyers effects the community of Haddonfield, which I feel like we really don't see much of in movies focused on spree killers.For the high body count, the director allowed the audience to empathize with the victims shortly before their death, mainly by showing their interactions with friends/loved-ones. Which also serves as a key source of the terror this movies brings, as Michael takes particular delight in murdering people in front of the ones they love. It's genuinely disturbing and the deaths are extremely violent. Micheal Meyers is the Boogeyman of Haddonfield, as evidenced by the people who survived him, as this movies focuses more on the others who made it through that night with Laurie 40 years ago. We see what they are like, can discern how the trauma shaped them into who they are now. And, sadly, we can sense the Boogeyman, the Shape, getting closer once more, pulling them back into his orbit. We see not only their trauma, but witness some of their children's trauma as a new generation is subjected to the same terror that has haunted their parents.Seeing the grief and fear grip the community, infecting them into becoming a mob, was well-done. You really empathize with these people and their losses and fear, even as you watch them fall victim to it.The music is, once again, fantastic, and the performances are on point. While the movie does end on a cliffhanger that verges on sequel-bait, the director has been open that this is a trilogy, so I don't look too harshly on that choice.This is a frightening movie, brutal not just in violence, but in the grief experienced by those who have their lives butchered by a killer returning home.",Halloween Kills
1174,abraaognunes,"Haloween kills, it kills in every way....",6,27 October 2021,The soundtrack by John Carpenter and the gore scenes are the highlight of the film. Michael Myers is still scary but the script and characters devoid of intelligence make the narrative difficult to bear.,Halloween Kills
1175,houstonssolution-62266,An uncompromising sequel from David Gordon Green,9,18 October 2021,"I wonder how a series that's had twelve entries can still find new ways to use the killer with the ""blank pale emotionless face"" Michael Myers. I've watched this series kill off Laurie Strode twice, I've watched Michael stopped by Paul Rudd with a pipe, I've watched Michael transported to the Hellbilly world of Rob Zombie, and even after all that, Halloween Kills gave me something unique in the theater. While I've seen Michael brutalize the citizens of Haddonfield, while I've seen the town fight back, and while I've seen Laurie in a hospital, I've never seen it quite like this. Kills picks up right where the last film left off. Michael, left burning in Laurie's fortress of solitude, the three generations of Strode riding off to safety, and Michael finally defeated. Well, obviously that didn't happen. Like terminal sickness, Michael continues to find a way to continue to spread fear throughout the sleepy town.Halloween Kills is light on plot and heavy on brutality, mood, and carnage. The trilogy isn't going to advance much from DGG's Halloween to Halloween Ends. The film almost feels like the embodiment of a death curse that Dave from the previous film laid upon the town. ""What, a couple people getting killed by one guy with a knife is not that big of a deal."" Kills offers up Michael as a true force of nature that he's always been compared to. From house to house, street to street, tragedy follows behind him, and that pain can truly be felt from the town and their frustration of another tragedy after the wounds began to heal from four decades prior. The entry is about pain and mood, and not on story advancement. In many ways Kills never feels like a pleasant experience, and while some may be annoyed by much of the fan service, some of it definitely feels like its version of levity for the fans that the film is forcing to suffer a bit.That suffering comes with really gorgeous camera work. Some of this can be seen in the previous film, like the use of close-ups and colored lights to set the tone and mood, but Green is on full display here with some experimentation. The shadow work with watching young Ronnie Elam run from the danger, to the way Green forces the close-up of the brutality while balancing getting gratuitous with its gore. While there's a tremendous amount of kills through the film (hence the name), that doesn't mean the crew got lazy with them. Each one is memorable and most are rather unique without getting contrived. Green's lack of experience with the slasher genre (this trilogy being his only experience) brought a fresh eye to the tired genre. I've never seen a slasher movie quite like this, in structure or in the overall 'look' of it. As familiar as I am with the genre, Kills caught me off guard. I really loved Green's previous effort, but it felt like a necessary callback to the first film, with a bit of his flair added in. Now it feels like the confidence is in full force and Green is making a statement with this film. While the first film was an homage to Carpenter and the first film, this feels like Green and writer Danny McBride having a go at playing in the violent sequel sandbox.I do think these kills will take precedence over the emotional aspect of the film. While Friday the 13th acted as a demo reel for special effects at times, Kills has more to offer than just that. While remaining as vague as possible, there's one sequence that may contain one of the most emotional moments of the series, and it's not even about an established character. It's just cruel and mean-spirited, but serves a purpose to the thematic element of the story. While that theme can be shoved in the audience's face at times, this isn't just a shallow film without any sort of purpose, it has a core message at heart, but uses the vehicle of a bloody slasher as a means to an end. Very similar to how this was the concept for the previous film to discuss grief and trauma as an hereditary trait. The audience is shown the mob violence, the pain of a community after a natural disaster or a violent act, and the film gets to the heart of that issue at many times. It's not subtle, not at all, but it avoids feeling violence for violence sake, but it's why the main character isn't a central set of characters, but the town of Haddonfield as a whole.If I had one real criticism of the film, it's that dialogue of the film. There's quite a few 'trailer lines' sprinkled throughout the film, and moments of trying to recreate the Dr. Loomis monologues, but no one in this film is Donald Pleasance. A few moments of fan service may have went a little too far for me, like mentioning Ben Tramer (a character that's more of a meme than a character at this point), or recreating some moments with nothing to really add or change. There's definitely some off moments, and maybe even a couple that can really take someone out of the final film. But, as I sat there in the theater with my mom, someone who had seen the original film, and in turn got me into the franchise at a young age with the same film, it really made me come to the realization that this film is the embodiment of our two generations. This franchise has spanned long enough for that change I mentioned above, and this film was almost a bridge to the eras of horror we came to know, which really made many of those moments feel nitpicky and really unimportant for what this film really represented when it was all said and done, and many of those small issues were able to find peace within my mind.""Death has come to your little town, sheriff. You can either ignore it or you help me to stop it.""Donald Pleasence has been dead and gone for twenty-six years, but his words from the very first Halloween still carry the sort of truth throughout the series. Even after his death in 1995, the 1998 film Halloween: Twenty Year Later, still had a voice over actor reprise the famous ""the devil's eye"" speech to begin the film, there was seemingly no reluctance to give the character its vital importance for Rob Zombie's interpretation of the series. Even in David Gordan Green's first film Halloween, Dr. Loomis was given a new voice over for the events months after the 1978 tragedy. Throughout the marketing buzz for Green's follow up film, the famous flashback to Halloween 1978 has floated around, and the obvious question of how will they carry on Loomis in a respectful way, and the moment I heard his voice and saw that trenchcoat, the small nitpicks I had during the flashback sequences during the first few scenes instantly washed away. I felt like I finally came home.",Halloween Kills

Really? He has survived gun shots, fires, electrocution, and a million other things - but you are going to take him down with a bat - uhhh.... ok. Secondly, isn't he supposed to be after Laurie? Watch out folks - spoiler coming... she never even sees him face to face in this movie! How do you write a script where your star and main protagonist never leaves a hospital? And to follow up on that - Michael never even tries to find her. That's what EVERY movie has been about! I will watch the next and last one, and I'd watch 100 more if they made them - but wow... the bad reviews are not wrong.

1189,fallingfornever5,Great kills overshadowed by bad script,5,18 October 2021,"Before going into anything I always assume that everything is going to be a 4, 5, 10 star rating (depending on the scale) and that all things are going to be A+ products. To me, it allows for a slightly more optimistic perspective than assuming everything is going to disappoint and will have work its way up to prove me wrong. With that said, I was expecting ""Halloween Kills"" to have a 6/4, 8/5, and 16/10.I was beyond excited for this film, as Michael Myers has always been my favorite slasher. I saw the original on Laserdisc as a kid, and remember being terrified the whole drive home. The normal look of Haddonfield resembled my own neighborhood, and I always thought that if their town could match mine, then the boogeyman could exist too.Before I go into what I liked and disliked about ""Halloween Kills"" I'll say that I loved 2018's Halloween. I think it was focused, self-aware, and a movie that believed in what it was trying to do - give the fans something they've wanted for a long time. I think ""Halloween Kills"" tries to do that, but in a less original, and far less subtle way.I'm not going to give a rundown of what happens in the movie, because if you're reading this then odds are you watched it already and may be looking to see what others thought both comparatively and contrastingly to your own opinion.To start off, I want to focus on the thing the movie does best, the kills. In horror movies, the inclusion of comedy is something that needs to be placed very meticulously, it can make or break scenes and the entire atmosphere of the film. There are a few kills that are off the wall enough to have a comedy edge to them, but they work. The cartoonish way that some of the characters meet their fate at the hands of Myers are so original and unique that you can't help but smile or laugh (in a good way). Without a doubt, the brutality of the film is its strongest point, and to me, it's easy to see why gorehounds would love this movie. It's the type of excessive gore that you see in ambitious indie and extreme foreign horror films, or exploitation films from the 70s, but not what you'd get in a mainstream, Hollywood movie. To me, it's easy to see that this is where the screenwriters' set their focus, and the death toll seems to be the only true consistency we get in the film (that's positive at least).I think where this film really fails, however, is that it's its own worst enemy. The screenplay seems to focus so much on wanting to please the fans who were mad about 2018's lack of onscreen violence, that they put almost all of their focus on that. The other thing that it felt like, to me at least, is that the filmmakers wanted to be accepted so badly by the fans that they directly reused shots from older movies, took plot points and setups from older movies, and tried to give everyone Loomis like catchphrases and pieces of dialogue. It reminded me of an hour and 40 minute long film version of the Steve Buscemi ""How do you do, fellow kids?"" gif. So many of the things done in this film go against everything you learn as a screenwriter. We're taught, screenplay 101: ""Show, don't tell."" I don't want every character telling me, ""40 years ago, Michael killed my daughter"", ""40 years ago, I survived Michael Myers"", ""The Boogeyman is real, and after 40 years he's come home."" This movie makes it a point to remind us of the events of the first movie, to where it feels like something about that day is mentioned in almost every dialog exchange. On top of that, the dialog, in general, is cringeworthy. The way people talk in this movie is no where near how people talk in real life. If I came face to face with a serial killer that I survived 40 years prior, and lived with the effects of the trauma all that time, the last thing I'd do is snap off some witty one liner before attempting to hurt him. Tommy's character repeats everything he says for dramatic effect, and when Brackett says his, ""Everyone's entitled to one good scare"" line I dropped my head, in my hands. The constant one-liners and unnatural dialog was the killing point of the movie for me, or one of the at least.There are times, however, where the nods work, but it's only when they're subtle. In the flashback, we hear about Loomis shooting him, but even if you missed that line, they show the broken window and spouting in the Myers house, so we know it's at least towards or after the end of the original Halloween. We have the Silver Shamrock masks nodding to Halloween 3, and the pitchfork which is a nod to Halloween 5. To me, those are things I want to see as a fan, not hear ""I wasn't at the scene because I had to tell my wife he killed our daughter and desecrated her body."" Again, show don't tell.One of the most interesting points of the movie for me, was the mob of citizens ready to kill Michael. But, even with that, I was kind of disappointed. We're shown Tommy rallying the troops, and creating small militias throughout the town, but yet no one from those groups sees Michael. There was an opportunity to show us how dangerous Michael was by having him be spotted by the militia and killing them (rather than slowly stabbing an old man 5 times in the back), or to show how dangerous the militia was by having them destroy and burn a building because they chased someone in that they thought was him. The pandemonium of the mob mindset could have been explored much deeper, and sent the town into shambles much more than it did.I know I said I wasn't going to go over everything that happened in the film because I don't wanna dumb down anything for potential readers, but in this part I will touch on some scene specific points.One of the biggest issues I had with this movie, comes from a single scene. I've read several reviews that felt the same way I did about other aspects of the movie, but no one touched on this. I had a huge problem with the hospital scene involving the mentally ill patient. I hate that the man is set up in the beginning on the news broadcast, then shown escaping the car, and then never seen again until the hospital. That is a complete waste of a character, especially one that could have been utilized better. We live in a time of social media. Imagine if people in Haddonfield had taken videos of him wondering the street, or hiding from people, or hell, imagine if they would have included a scene of one of the militia groups getting killed by Michael, and then later someone got a photo of the mentally ill man walking by the scene and it was posted online. There could have been a huge setup and a much more believable one, before he walked into the hospital. Instead, he stumbles in, everyone assumes he's Michael, and they attack. What we get is easily the most tense, organic, emotional scene in the film. Throughout, we see Karen trying to reason with her mother and daughter, but neither listen, and here she tries to protect an innocent man, but again no one listens. The tension builds and builds as the man becomes trapped like an animal, before jumping from a window to take his own life. It's a guy wrenching scene, but it's topped off with what I felt like was an attempt at badly timed comedy. When he hits the ground, the volume changes, emphasizing the thud and reaction of the crowd, and then we see his body. His brains are scattered and his finger and eye twitch. To me, that specific part of the scene felt like it was done in bad taste. ""Let's give the audience some more carnage."" I would have rather have seen the rioters faces change, the close up shots of the sheriff and Karen, and then a zoomed in shot of his eye as it fluttered for a few seconds and then went still. I think it would have been a much more powerful ending than the exploitative gore we were given. Hell, they could have followed it up with the side shot of his exploded head that we also got. It may just be me, but I again, I feel like an organic scene was ruined by that lack of subtlety.The last point I'd like to make, is that the movie doesn't really feel like it pushed the series along. If I could compare it to anything, in that regard, I'd compare it to ""The Last Jedi."" We watched a movie where the point of the movie was simply to act as filler between the first part of the trilogy, and the third. Like ""The Last Jedi"" this is how ""Halloween Kills"" felt, in my opinion. There were several opportunities that characters had to put Myers down for good, but they didn't finish the job, because they couldn't...it's the second film, you can't kill him until the third - duh! And so, it ends just like 2018's with the ignorance of our main protagonists assuming he's been killed, only to rise from the ashes, and kill again.Overall, I wasn't a fan of the movie. I went in expecting to love it, but find myself logging it just above my least favorite entries in the series. If you're a young person looking to watch a movie overloaded with cool kills, while not having to process substance, this is a good movie for you. If you want something that really drives the series forward, with interesting and intelligent characters, interactions, and dialog exchanges, I think you'll find yourself disappointed. The atmosphere, the look and feel of the flashbacks, and the unique kills are really this films bread and butter. But things like the unnatural interactions, and choices that the characters make, along with everyone having to have a catch phrase, one-liner, or epic ""hero"" speech really drags the movie down. Like I said before, this movie is its own worst enemy.(A very generous) 5/10.",Halloween Kills

1197,tvdk-73830,A pleasant surprise,9,2 November 2021,"I thoroughly enjoyed Halloween Kills, which was a surprise as I am among those fans who did not really like Halloween 2018. I was annoyed by that film's effort to erase the sequels... Not the fact that it ignored them (fair enough), but simply that the writers felt the need to explicitly overwrite them. This raised more questions than it answered, and jerked the viewer out of the fantasy. It left us wondering why Laurie could not cope better with what (according to Halloween 2018) was an isolated trauma, and why the Laurie/Michael relationship was still apparently so significant without the familial connection. In short, instead of the strain of attempting to erase the sequels, it would have been better not to engage at all and let fans come up with their own theories.In short, I went in with low expectations for Halloween Kills. But without giving away too many spoilers, the homage to the original was much more effective this time around, while they did something fresh that in making Haddonfield itself a character of sorts. This helped to give the legacy of Michael Myers a 'bigger' significance, without deviating too far from a slasher movie's bread and butter. For me, the mob scenes allowed for some compelling social commentary, and also harked back to crowd scenes in Halloween 2. I can now better appreciate that Halloween 2018 was really a set up piece for the coming film(s).I am sure that, regardless of the mixed reviews, every fan of the 1978 film cannot help but feel at least somewhat excited by the return of so many familiar faces.

I even reserved judgment on the new movies when they removed the sister angle, but after being disappointed by the first of the new series, I held out hope that the second would turn a corner. Little did I know it could get worse. I can only assume that the people involved have never seen the original Halloween. They are more concerned about body count and gore than the suspense that has always been the trademark of the series. They couldn't decide if Michael was a methodical, emotionless, empty killer, like the original, or a Dahmer like serial killer that had to pose his victims for some weird gratification. In Rob Zombie's remakes he managed to make Michael more violent without losing the core of who he was. This movie is clearly a bi-polar Michael that is confusing at best. Then we have the angry mob.

1215,nikosgkarabis,A Perfect follow up of the 2018 movie!🎃,10,3 November 2021,"I Couldn't think of a better continuation of the 2018 movie. The characters are very good, the plot is simple and the scares are infinite...
There are certainly some problems, that kinda ruin the atmosphere such as the ferocious dialogue, that at some points is laughable! But other than that I didn't spot any big problems. You know it's just a Halloween movie and if you become judgemental about it you will not appreciate the gore, the scares and the blood.Michael is savage in this one! I mean I knew that the movie was gonna be brutal, but I couldn't imagine how freaking violent and it was. The characters are nicely created, and they are believable as the adult versions of the 1978 survivors.Something kind of annoying, is the fact that they repeat over and over again the phrase ""it's been 40 years..."" or ""Evil dies tonight"", but if you overome that too its fine and good for you!I certainly had some problems with it, but I overcame them and I can enjoy it as the best continuation possible of the 2018 movie!I just cannot understand why some people try so hard to find the problems and drawbacks of a movie just because they want to look like a professiona critic. That way you are not going to enjoy ANY movie!!! Just sit down drink some Coke have a lot of popcorn and enjoy that awesome sequel of that amazing franchise!Be aware that there is no sex or nudity in this one!There is a lot of F word!",Halloween Kills
1216,vetteface,Annoying Mess,2,2 November 2021,"We are huge fans of the original Halloween, and watch it every year Halloween night. The sequels before the 2018 film were meh, they went from an atmospheric, creepy vibe to true slasher schlock. Then the 2018 film came out, with the intention of letting us pretend all those sequels never happened and that Michael was captured back in 1978 and kept locked up for 40 years. Fine by me, suspension of disbelief is easy. We very much enjoyed the 2018 movie, even though it did enter the slasher realm, but not to a crazy extent.Then we saw this travesty. We did enjoy the original flashback to how they captured MM. It explained nicely how he seemed to just ""turn off"" after his murderous outburst, and how he has been dormant the past 40 years. And it was very cool seeing the original characters who survived the original movie. But then stupidity took over. So many characters introduced who you KNEW were going to die in the next couple of minutes. The crowd mentality at the hospital was especially annoying, but accurate in how scared people grasp on to anything that gives them a chance to kill the thing they think they fear. But what really got me was how freaking annoying the granddaughter was. She thinks that she can kill Michael, when trained adults with weapons couldn't do it. If she had waited with her grandmother like she was supposed to, her boyfriend and his father wouldn't have been killed.Also, when the group surrounds Michael and seemingly beats him to death... really??? They know he's been shot and stabbed before, and it didn't kill him. Maybe try, oh I don't know, dismembering him?? Then taking the pieces to distant spots and cremating them to dust??? But that would be too easy. I have a feeling the next (hopefully last) movie will have a duel to the death for Laurie and Micheal. And then let it RIP.",Halloween Kills

1219,rowenmarshall,Good but...,8,23 October 2021,"This movie does a lot of things right, the score, the kills, and references to the original. It was also very refreshing to see the Halloween III costumes appear in this movie. The most enjoyable parts of this movie was when Michael was on screen. His kills are definitely the highlight of this movie. It is a complete step up from the original Halloween, and Halloween 2018. This movie can even rival the gore from Rob Zombies Halloween. The things that I did not enjoy about this movie, was that there were a bit too many flashbacks, and most of the hospital scenes were kind of boring. It's a shame that Laurie Strode wasn't in this movie more but it makes sense, as the movie says, it not all about Laurie, it's all about Michael. Although this is supposed to be Michaels movie, there was too much of the angry town mob. If they cut back on their scenes in the hospital or if there was more to make me care about their anger, I could probably consider this movie an 8.5.TLDR: Enjoyable movie, does what its supposed to.

The scenes from Halloween night 1978 we're so well done.I love 70s and 80s classic horrors, and new interpretations of any classic horror are never going to be the same or have the same ambience and feel.

Despite some weak points the movie was fast paced, the kills are brutal and really shows how much he loves killing. He decorates the body's for show, he wants you to see what he has done.

Call it 'horror intuition'.'Kills' has nowhere to go, apart from after the money, so it uncomfortably flits from 1978's best bits, to shortly after 2018's Halloween, with zero story, hoping to find something to fill the gaps with. It spends the first 20 minutes repeating other films and trying to bring back 'legacy characters' nobody cared about. It appears to struggle for sets, and coherence.Why were we watching a scene in a karaoke bar for so long at the start, why was 'mankind' running aimlessly/savagely around a hospital for endless insane scenes of people running up and down corridors and stairs with such hammy hysteria, why did everyone think the little bald guy was Michael Myers anyway, why did they keep repeating the 'standing at the window' lore in every scene, who the hell thought of the stupid car group death scene, why did Jamie Lee Curtis bother?

Halloween Kills is a simple, direct, and fun sequel. There is not much else to say. It follows the classic slasher movie template but feels like so much more. The directing and cinematography are damn good, much better than a usual slasher. The score is beyond amazing with the classic Halloween theme and adds a lovely modern twist. It captivates and sets in an overwhelming sense of dread and doom that compliment what is happening on screen to a near perfect degree. If you are not a fan of slasher films you will not like this. As with the first one, it does the usual horror/slasher movie character trope. Down right stupid characters who all act on impulse, none of which are really Good people. A very tactical choice with the purpose of making characters unlikable. Everyone dies and that's the point. If you felt too much for a character and they die, you aren't gonna have as good of a time. You are supposed to kinda root for the killer. You aren't gonna hold this or Scream up to the Godfather, Shawshank, Fight Club, Life is Beautiful. It doesn't need to be.

1237,orioles2491,Bad Plot,6,17 October 2021,"First thing, people need to remember that the timeline in this movie only includes the original (1978) and then the one from 2018. None of the other nine movies are related whatsoever. So this is the third movie in this rebooted timeline, not the 12th.I actually enjoyed the flashbacks to the night from 1978, it filled in the gap of how Michael got caught after disappearing when Loomis shot him.Generally, it was much more gory, probably the most kills in any of the movies. Some dumb kills (thinking of the doctor who shoots herself when the car door hits her), but nothing too wild.My issue was the plot and the sub-plots. Everything with the two guys who now live in the Myers house was ridiculous (someone breaks into your house and you take a cheese knife with you to go after him?). People believing that a 5'-5"" 200 pound man could possibly be Michael Myers (who is like 6'-2"") was very frustrating to watch. Then they tried to make us feel bad for Michael with the whole ""he's not looking out the window, he's looking at his reflection in the window"" thing. Then he one-on-one kills like 20 people in the middle of the street, which is about 200 feet away from the Myers house where all of the police are, and nobody hears anything. And the mother, who is one of the main characters, gets killed in the final five seconds of the movie? Didn't make any sense other than them trying to continue the parallels between the granddaughter and Laurie Strode. They basically only brought Will Patton's character back because they wanted to have him included in the flashbacks, and him being dead wouldn't have really worked. But Laurie and he had no roles in this movie at all.Overall, the first half of the movie was very promising. Started to lose me in the second half when it got all ""typical slasher film."" Wasn't really all that scary, which is what the original 70's and 80's films did best.Anthony Michael Hall's character was a waste. Like you know what Michael is capable of, but he tries to go after him by himself with a bat? And then Laurie tells him to do it again in the hospital? Of all people, she would know that one man going after Michael with a bat would not end well.Hoping that the final movie in this timeline does the series some justice.",Halloween Kills
1238,frozen_dawn,Second Chapter: The Michael Myers Show,7,21 October 2021,"*** Intro: It's my first review on this site and I'm doing it mostly because of how mixed the reviews are. I never read them, especially before I watch a movie, to not be spoiled in any way nor influenced by others' point of view. Based what I see now, in order to get thumbs up here one has to say this movie sucks. If it's your case save some time and don't read this. I really enjoyed it... Despite its significant flaws. It will be a very long one as I want to explain as clearly as I can why I loved it.*** This sequel and the first movie: Halloween Kills has even made me enjoyed the first movie of this trilogy a lot more. At first in that one I thought Michael was too easy to defeat by the Strode girls. Now I clearly see the creator doesn't consider this trio of movies as 3 unique ""entities"" on their own but following the same guideline, but rather like one very long unique movie in 3 chapters. The first one (Movie) puts the pieces into place: The characters, the backbone of David Gordon Green's take on the Halloween's story, it shows how the heroes can fight and compete with the monster. It gives them a small victory. The second chapter of this one story, this movie, is the monster coming back stronger than ever! Really! I don't think Michael has ever looked so dominant, brutal, powerful, destructive and unstoppable. All that while keeping a part of his stalker side, which I love. This movie is about Michael and putting him over the more they could. He really is THE main character of this one. Halloween kills is right as Myers kills pretty much everyone we see on screen that is not in the hospital nor named Allyson. So this one is really more of a pure slasher.*** The flaws of Halloween Kills: First, what I have to guess causes a lot of fans to be disappointed with this movie, is the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis remains on the sidelines the whole time. If I wouldn't now see this as a one unique and long movie but rather 3 movies on their own coming together like most franchises do, I would be angry about that too. But here they needed to get Laurie out of the picture while they were making Michael come back stronger than ever. They also keep their (Let's hope so) epic confrontation for the very end. And they did it while actually being realistic. In most movies the hero would have gotten back up and fight after being stabbed in the stomach by a godlike powerful monster.By far the biggest fail in this movie, is how they didn't manage to create and bring in interesting, enjoyable ""second role"" protagonists to fight Michael while they kept Laurie for the third act. The closest thing to an interesting hero in this one is Allyson. She shows how much she's got ""b*lls"", and has all the reasons to want to get back at Michael, yet is very held back in this movie. Other than her, I really don't care about ANY character. Not even Tommy Doyle, who is THE weakest link of this whole thing. It's crazy that what should be an important character, one I would have cheered for as a huge Halloween fan, I wasn't annoyed at all when Michael kills him, and even satisfied actually! That's not at all how it should have gone. And they did try to make it appear like this big moment, yet I'm sure very little people were sad to see Tommy Doyle, the kid who survived Michael's wrath 40 years earlier, killed by that same person.He is supposed to be the leader of the group, yet controls absolutely nothing. He is a knucklehead who is way over his head the whole damn time. Plus for someone who has witnessed first hand the devastation and terror of Michael Myers, unbelievable that they made him go to war with him with a baseball bat!!! And no such thing as a plan. Other than screaming ""Evil dies tonight"", yeah, and saying they all have to stick together, yet everyone goes their own way in very small groups or alone. Also since in this story Michael has been captive for 40 years, he wasn't on the loose. Tommy with the trauma he went through, would have seen everything about him and so, would know what he looks like. He would have been aware that crazy guy they all chased in the hospital wasn't Myers. With the Tommy Doyle character, they had all the ingredients needed to have their perfect ""Plan B"" main good guy to fight Michael until Laurie takes over for the final fight every fan wants to see. But they missed by a landslide. So who are fans going to cheer and care for if no hero in a movie is appealing to them? I'm sure many were rooting for Michael in this one because of it, no matter how cruel he is. That is THE one major downfall of this sequel. Everything about him is wrong. This reminds me of the mistake made in Halloween 5, where they stupidly killed off the beloved Rachel, so there again the main hero was taken out of the equation, and they miserably failed to pass it on to someone the fans would care about. In that case they went with the super annoying Tina.Also there is one of Michael's murders I'm not a fan of and that's the older man who finds Myers in his and his wife Sondra's bathroom. I don't like that Michaels pulls him and carries him over to finish him off on the table, possibly for his wife to see it and by hitting him with a couple of knifes even after he was most probably already dead. I don't like it because in my eyes, it makes Michael look like he enjoys doing his terrible deed. One of the parts that makes him so evil, is actually how cold and totally emotionless he always seems, even while killing people. In that case, while it's at the same time the worst term to use, it kind of ""humanizes"" him as far as his motivation is concerned.Finally the way the people act when they gang up on Myers thanks to Karen's trap with the mask. It was very well put together but unfortunately the end result is lacking. Michael has struck fear in that town's population for decades. His story is mystical and he is known to have unhuman power and ability to withstand what would kill anyone. Don't stop once he is down, after a few baseball bat and wood plank strikes and even 3-4 bullets. Break his freaking legs, arms, beat him down until he is in pieces, slice him up with a chainsaw, burn him, shoot him again whatever. Why only 2 of them had guns?Then you have other lesser or more common flaws, including ones we see in every movie like the incompetence and inability of secondary cops to be of any use or shoot the bad guy and actually hitting him, even when he's 2 feet away from them, the dumb doctor shooting herself in the neck because she came in too close and Michael kicked the car door at her lol, the I think Sheriff, the chubby black guy who is totally useless in this movie (Aside from telling Karen Michael is alive) and can't deal with civilians in the hospital and prevent a public execution, the cop who lets kids roaming around alone in the streets after telling them a murdered is around, Lonnie bringing his son where he expects to confront a monster (Like he himself says) and I could go on. But those are all things I can live with in a horror movie, or any type of movie for that matter.*** Some things I enjoyed: On the other hand, I liked or loved the well-played nostalgia part with the going back to 1978, past actors from the series, and seeing Loomis got a surprised ""What the f....!!?"" out of me! I loved seeing Michael with still a bit of his stalking ways that they left behind in most of the past movies after the first one, the fact we hear him breathing in/through his mask when he is looking for Lindsey. And the final scene with Karen and young Michael in the window is very beautifully made, even somewhat poetic.*** The third and final part: This will all lead to the third movie, or in this case 3rd chapter of this one story: THE showdown between Michael and Laurie. Everything is set. But I strongly believe it will be more... ""emotional"" (??), story oriented and much less of a slasher than H. Kills. The end of the movie, in what many seem to think is some sort of dream but IMO is totally true, Michael by killing Karen now leaves it all in the hands of Laurie and will make her the hunter instead of the prey. (And there can't be 2 TRUE heroes in such a story) Especially that in this version, Michael wants to go back home, not chase his sister. This reminds me of the approach taken in the end of the H20 sequel (Which I personally deeply loved and thought it was THE perfect ending to the franchise) where Jamie L. C. stops running from him and instead starts going after him. It will lead to an encounter between a p*ssed off Laurie on the hunt Vs a Michael Myers that was pushed as really unstoppable.I'm now really curious and eager to see how it will play out in the end. Jamie Lee Curtis said in an interview that the third one will probably surprise many people... While it's still just her opinion, and maybe to make fans talk about it, I wonder why she's saying that. In this movie she talks about basically sacrificing herself in order to stop Michael. Like if she dies, he will die or stop too. Is it what they will go for? Michael winning, I don't think they'd go there. But maybe Laurie sacrificing herself in order to kill Myers too. Or killing him then dying too from the battle. I'm also curious about what will be the role of Hawkins (Played by good actor Will Patton) as they really make it obvious he dearly wants to kill Michael to redeem himself. Will he come and help Laurie win? Finish the job if the serial killer slays his sister but is weakened from it? (So this time he didn't let Michael get away). Less likely, but he does nothing and just remains in the hospital? I also ponder about what will Allyson's role be in there? Only the one protected by Laurie or more of an active role? (Like she should have been in the second part). If you've read all of this, thank you for your attention!",Halloween Kills
1239,millanaj,Could've been better,4,13 October 2021,Man I really wanted to like this movie being a huge Halloween fan myself but it just so bad that I almost fell asleep.. even considered walking out of the movie.

1240,yvfukgqcj,Great slasher action. Good suspense. Shallow story development.,8,18 October 2021,"*SPOILERS*Is the story awesome? No. However, the slasher action scenes are amazing. The movie includes classic kill styles of Michael while also offering some unique, fresh action from new perspectives. The suspense in the scenes where Michael hunts are far better than most slasher horror. Those scenes are longer and actually build tension instead of the movie featuring a lot of quick kills and a few tense scenes only with the protagonist.There a lot of people giving Halloween Kills bad reviews and I understand their perspective. The movie tries to tell an epic story with far too many unneeded characters, and thus scenes, and that resulted in a very sporadic story unfolding. I agree the movie can't decide what it wants to be and which story it wants to focus on.While the attempt to pay homage to the original Halloween resulted into some great, welcomed scenes. The bar scene when Tommy Doyle is introduced along with other characters from the original gave me goose bumps. But the story focuses too much time on Tommy running around repeating the same lines and having no character growth. I mean, the guy had a seriously messed up Halloween night thanks to Michael Myers as a child. Yet, the only emotion Tommy seems to feel is a need for revenge? Tommy's character deserved so much more depth. The lack of that for his character hurts what could have been an instant classic horror movie.The movie attempts to use Tommy as the catalyst of the story instead of Lori. The problem is the audience doesn't want that and the story never tries to change our minds. While fans of the original Halloween are interested to know more about a grownup Tommy we are let down with the one dimensional character. Anyone coming into Halloween Kills as their introduction to the series expecting to enjoy the movie as a stand-alone will have trouble doing so despite the many awesome scenes.The story needed to either develop Tommy's character better or not feature him as much. Halloween Kills could have focused on Lori and her family as the main catalyst, but the story couldn't pick between them or Tommy.When Lori and Tommy are finally in the same scene together, the vibe between her and the little boy she once almost gave her life to protect felt like they were total strangers without any bond. That's where the story falls apart beyond repair.Imagine if the movie focused on the bond Lori and Tommy could have developed over all those years and/or why it didn't develop. Imagine if Tommy's desire to stay with and protect Lori was that character's focus instead of running around seeking others to help him (in the name of the town) for his revenge. Imagine if Tommy used the words Boogie Man and not (killing the) evil.The original Halloween set Tommy up calling, and believing Michael to be, the boogie man. Yes, a grownup saying Boogie Man could easily come off as funny and not scary. But with the proper character development, Tommy saying Boogie Man to Lori would hold so much history and emotion between the two characters. It wouldn't be two grownups saying Boogie Man. Instead, it makes him feel like a helpless, scared kid. Boogie Man would cause Lori to be that shy, too afraid to even talk to boys teenager, forced into a position of having to break out of her shell to save Tommy and herself. In Halloween Kills both have physically grownup and this time Lori is hurt and unable to fight. This could have caused the roles of the characters to swap. This is a natural way to shift the story to Tommy as the protagonist (or at least a co-protagonist).Imagine those raw emotions and history between Lori and Tommy used to drive the Halloween Kills narrative along with the movie's existing great individual scenes with Michael. The unstoppable Michael Myers on a collision course with the two grownups who's lives the Boogie Man ruined. Lori's and Tommy's lives stuck mentally and emotionally in that Halloween night all those years ago. Neither able to move on until the night in which Halloween Kills takes place.The recent Halloween movie that this is continuation of did a good job of showing Lori stuck in that night. That movie reinforced that her character feels the burden of being the hero, despite fear. It showed that she could only grow as a character in one direction-Preparation for when she will have to fight Michael again. She couldn't move on until that happened.It's too bad Tommy's character wasn't given that type of depth and a clear event that had to happen before he could move on. That event could involve revenge and the death (or perceived death) of the Boogie Man, but the story fails because it didn't make Tommy the protector of Lori first.Instead, Tommy is easily killed in the end without most of the audience caring, or even fully knowing why they should care, about Tommy. If nothing else, could Tommy have not died saving Lori (or even her daughter)?I know this is a slasher horror movie. All the depth and story I mention above could/should never be dwelled on in this type of movie. But very little time spent building a little depth and a reason to care within the correct flow of Halloween Kills is the difference between this movie being only a good, fun slasher movie and not reaching the quality of the original.I'm giving this an 8 rating because it is far better than most slasher and other types of horror movies produced these days. The cinematography is beautiful. The direction is well above average, The direction is at it's best when crafting the pace and tension of the scenes involving Michael Myers. The music could not have been any better. The music builds on the sounds of the original Halloween movie without forcing a drastic change in sound due to current technology differences. There is really a lot to love about Halloween Kills.",Halloween Kills

Characters are so unlikeable and completely demented and mentally challenged, but not as nearly moronic as the writers of this movie.I started writing a long review explaining each stupidity of this mess, but then I got so angry that I just deleted it.I hate this movie more than I ever hated any movie ever, when you watch it you'll know why...
Kids have a vidid imagination, and I am 100% sure that a grouo of teenagers would have written a way better story and dialogue, tge writers werent treating the audience as dumb, it's they themselves who are so mind bogglingly dumb that they can't even recognise how untalented and bad they are, I hope this movie goes down in history as one of the most hated things ever.",Halloween Kills

1244,acggneh,What a horrible mess,1,16 October 2021,"It started out mediocre and devolved quickly into a hot mess - a coloring book painted by a blind person. There were no likable characters. I was rooting for Michael Myers. My heart broke watching Jamie Lee Curtis spouting the worst dialogue I have heard in a long time, and was actually hoping she would fall to Michael Myers. There is a special place in horror movie hell for David Gordon Green, Danny McBride, and Scott Teems - if there is a God, he/she will never let these a-holes make another movie again.",Halloween Kills
1245,thejaredquaglieri,Comedy horror at its finest,2,15 October 2021,"The funniest Halloween since Resurrection, the Pineapple Express gang delivers another knee-slapper. Elderly people (people that the movie insists are important) helplessly deliver embarassing dialogue like ""he's turning us into animals!"" and the movie clumsily tries to fit the entire script to the original 1978 film in here. And what's worse, these Frankensteins will not leave poor dead Donald Pleasance alone. He'll be in these movies forever now.It's baffling to me that this is technically connected to a John Carpenter film. You remember him, he was a filmmaker.

1256,saraaseeri,Outstanding,10,16 October 2021,An amazing job has been done in this movie. Loved how they developed the character of Michael. The strongest that no one can defeat.

From the kills to the story to the twists and turns it was definitely a slasher film that had all the jolts and scares of any great horror film. Watch it in the dark, at night with no distractions and I guarantee you'll be on the edge of your seat. Watching buddy may be necessary...",Halloween Kills

This movie brings the badass, merciless Michael Myers and we can finally see how immortal he really is. The ending was shocking, the kills were fantastic and let's not forget the mask! The mask brought so much fear and intimidation to replicate Michael's ferocity. I have small complaints but nonetheless a FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE! James Jude Courtney was incredible and I can't wait to see him in Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills
1260,bzsjgcv,Man....this was such an incredible letdown of a movie,1,16 October 2021,"I don't normally write movie reviews, but this really really reaaaaaally bothered me. This is by far one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. The acting is subpar at best, and the movie no longer Carries the suspense and terror of the old films. The flashbacks an character involving from those invoked in the old films is forced and unnatural. Randomly chasing an inmate to shocked suicide who doesn't fit the frame, height or character of Michael, little John standing just waiting to die.... I could go on and on but I won't. They could have kept this.",Halloween Kills
1261,akjunkmail,28 vs 14,4,16 October 2021,Body count is 28 which is one body every few minutes average. Compared to 2018 it's literally double the kills with half of the story compared with 2018. Surprised they hyped this up so much. It's gory to an extent but not as bad as one would think. It's a filler movie between Halloween 2018 and Halloween Ends.Gotta appreciate them calling back to the original. Bloodshed doesn't make a movie good though. I think the biggest flaw is that there's so many chances and coming so close to killing Micheal that it's frustrating to somehow say he keeps getting away. Will watch the next one just out of curiosity.4/10 and hopefully better next time.,Halloween Kills
1262,jameskendall-26102,An excellent addition to the franchise,9,17 October 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie. I rarely enjoy sequels to most movies but I have to admit this was really good. Compared to all the cheesy sequels they made after the original sequel, the exception being H20, they really did a great job. I found the acting to be decent and the storyline very good. I also appreciated the little bits of humor sprinkled throughout it. To those who seem to have jumped on the bandwagon where tearing everything aprt for no reason seems cool, you're not fooling anyone, you either just don't appreciate slasher films for what they are or you simple have no taste in horror films.

1268,treongill,SO close to being good.,6,26 October 2021,"What I mean by the title, is that this movie had some great moments. The overall story of it all is incredibly lacking though. There are a few different character arcs going on, but they aren't strong enough for you to actually care for the individuals. When the inevitable happens, you don't really have a feeling of sorrow or despair for the characters themselves. The kills, as the movie title suggests, mentions, are great in themselves though. Those are what save this movie, the actions of Michael.",Halloween Kills

I'd seen kids with a camcorder make a better film. It was so bad I couldn't believe Jamie Lee Curtis had anything to do with it. What else died in this movie? Anthony Michael Hall's career. This brief attempt at resuscitation proved its too far gone.Shame, should have left well enough alone.",Halloween Kills

I truly felt the consideration and care that was taken in creating this. Directors had fans on the brain and they delivered. I got goosebumps, chills, and even jumped. Almost shed a tear when Loomis showed up. They took us back in time and I appreciated that.

Why did Laurie's teenage granddaughter look nearly as old as her mother Karen? I kept mixing up mother and daughter. That's all I could think about the entire film. Also who casted Anthony Michael Hall in this? He was terrible. He should focus on doing weird science 2 since he wants to star in terrible movies... honestly it couldn't be worse than this.

Michael's character and story is such an amalgamation of the horror genre that his universe has the ability to evolve in many different ways and I'm personally intrigued to see where they go with this new perspective of the Halloween universe. As long as John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis are involved, I see no duds on the horizon (knock on wood, hoping I didn't jinx the whole franchise)",Halloween Kills

Everyone's all up on their little high horse - remember, the original ""Halloween"" was panned by everyone when it was first released back in 1978. Seriously - google it. I'll wait. No one really 'got it' at the time.As a longtime fan of the series and genre, ""Halloween Kills"" is by far the best Halloween sequel ever made. Sure, it's got its problems, but we're not talking about an Oscar contender here. It's the 2nd chapter of a planned trilogy. Not everything is going to be revealed or make sense. Bottom line, Michael is great, the kills are great and the movie is a ton of fun! If you're a fan - you're gonna love it. It's even better the 2nd time around (thank you Peacock).",Halloween Kills

Spoilers, regardless if he is shot stabbed or beaten by a mob Michael cannot be killed unless he is stabbed in the back by a pitchfork then and only then will he stop killing but only do we find out that he cannot actually be killed because he feeds off fear and cannot actually die. This movie was the epitome of all the Halloween movies and extremely stupid and not worth your time or movie theater money. And somehow when his mask is actually taken off you do not see his face but you can see that he clearly has a trimmed beard and buzzed head so somehow he has the time to see a barber in the middle of all of his Halloween killings.",Halloween Kills
1297,jbabitch,Micheal Myers Is BACK!!!,10,18 October 2021,"This movie is possibly one of the goriest Halloween movies out there, having many characters (Including main characters) die by Micheal Myers. The ending is a big twist, having Myers die, then come back to life with the power of all the people he's killed. The movie cinematography is simply beautiful, having every shot keeping you on your feet and wanting to keep watching, while at the same time, maybe even cover your eyes. The actors and actresses display emotions like it's easy for them, having the film feel ever so real with constant emotions being pushed in your face. The jump-scares are great! They didn't scare me, but everyone in the theater and my friend jumped out of their seat! There are many disturbing scenes in this movie, having a man they thought was Myers being chased down until he has nowhere to go, so in the end he jumps of the building to end his own life. The head explodes and gore is shown very realistically. Myers also shows a side of him we have never seen before, with him killing large amounts of people in this film. He really lets loose in this film. All in all, me and my friend loved this film, and deserves a ten out of ten for me!",Halloween Kills

1299,alexmontico,Nothing Special,6,16 October 2021,"""Halloween Kills"" provides a decent addition to the Halloween series while also raising some issues that may deem it to be a downgrade from the 2018 installment. The movie started off well, but failed to keep the plot moving forward. The middle act felt drawn out, leading to a rushed finale that left the audience slightly disappointed.The film itself is pretty good. Michael Myers takes on the actions of a slasher (which may be good or bad depending on your previous opinions of Michael's killing style). His typical way of killing, being a quiet stalker that builds up suspense before the kill, is overshadowed in the film. The film surely lives up to its title. The kills, while being more fast-paced then what the typical ""Halloween"" viewer is accustomed to, are handled quite well in the film.The film is all around decent and is worth a watch if you enjoyed the 2018 ""Halloween"" film. If you prefer the old persona and killing customs of the past Michael, you may find yourself disappointed with the direction the film takes.",Halloween Kills

It definitely feels like a middle movie, and that's okay because IT IS. Bloody as hell, scary, and has some killer flashback scenes and brings some familiar faces back which was really fun.",Halloween Kills
1307,bernardoguzmanjr,stunning,9,15 October 2021,When you think of Halloween in terms of horror you always think of Michael Myers well in this movie Michael is the star. This is his movie and oh boy the kills are immense and powerful and in the end heartbreaking. The performance that surprised me was Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace she put up a big time fight and was not scared. Her sequence in the woods was not only terrifying but downright scary. The cast was excellent as Anthony Michael Hall was the heart and emotion of the film. But for me Judy Greer was sensational and once again has proven how she is grossly underrated as an actress. The one issue for me was the script it felt like it was meandering in certain places but was alright. The flashbacks were fun but the mob mentality was a miscue. But at the end of the day Halloween kills delivered. The gore was brutal but we all knew that. Hopefully ends wraps everything neatly. Hopefully.,Halloween Kills

I miss leaving some things up to our imagination. Nonetheless, for a horror film being released in 2021, it was a lot of fun, from start to finish. Was the dialogue lacking? Sure. But who cares?! It's a slasher icon and we're here to see Myers do his thing! He is brutal and down right sadistic with some of his kills.

Will Patton are wasted in essentially cameo appearances, and Anthony Michael Hall runs around chewing scenery to little effect.Honestly, the trailers for ""The Black Phone"" and the reboot of ""Scream"" each had more scares than this entire film.",Halloween Kills

However, this new Halloween Kills along with the 2018 Halloween they both SUCK & I mean it was absolutely terrible. First off the actors are just bad their acting is super amateur overly theatrical lol 😂 it's just terrible cast. I don't like the fact that they tried to add a lil comedy in this horror it's freaking Halloween for crying out loud it's supposed to be terrifying not funny!! Then they made Myers seem super accessible. I get that they were trying to kill the guy but they should've directed it in a different light. This wasn't executed the way it needed to be. Where's Rob Zombie at?!!! Please come and direct because if Halloween ends is being directed by the same guy I'm more than likely not going to watch and that'll be a first for me. In conclusion all in all 2018 Halloween and 2021 Halloween are terrible 😞 very dissatisfied I feel cheated. IT SUUUCCCCCKKED!!!!!!!",Halloween Kills

To start off this movie is the worst Halloween movie of them all. The acting is terrible with many cringe worthy one liners. The music in this film is beyond bad, often times ruining moments. This film lacks any authenticity of the original movie and is nothing but a money grab using the name. The director should be ashamed of himself for putting out this trash. I can't think of a single positive regarding this movie. Overall dissapointed and an insult to the Halloween franchise.

And John Carpenter you know we all love you as well but what in the heck did you do to our original Halloween score. That was the most awful thing I have ever heard in my life. Do not mess with our original score. Whoever had anything to do with the making of this movie should be ashamed and embarrassed. Us fans have waited forever for this and how disappointed we all are.

Way too much gore for this franchise, and dumb storylines that don't make any sense (and the inclusion of a mental patient for no real reason/purpose...just some dumb side plot). Michael's kills were always simple, straightforward. His kills in this movie are just overkill and too much. The only role Jamie Lee Curtis has is laying in a bed and being a pain in the ass to everyone, including her daughter. The writing is mediocre, as is the storyline..particularly the end scene. During the movie, you felt like a backstory of some sort was going to be told, but it never is. Tommy, Lindsey and Dr. Loomis's nurse make short appearances, although they are non-sensical. The whole storyline makes no sense; it starts out at different times and flashes to other times. It's hard to follow. It was pretty much a mess.",Halloween Kills

This film is a parody just like the most recent The Predator.This film destroys a series and iconic character. Everything that last film built up crumbles here.

1335,jayquillofficial,Halloween Kills - Delivers on the Name,8,16 October 2021,"I don't understand all the flack this film is catching. In my personal opinion this film does a good job of honouring the original Halloween. Continued RIGHT from the newest sequel and managed to add more depth and elements to the characters and storyline.SPOILERS-ish: Halloween Kills managed to create one of the best and creative cinematic killing sprees from a horror icon to date. Michael sets the tone immediately in this one by dismantling an entire fire department team and clearly Michael is tired of the games. Showing his more aggressive side in this film IMO was a positive thing. They also re-enforced the brute strength of Michael and the undefeatable aura once again. The little details of each one of the kills and the fact they took time to make it seem more calculated from Michael allows for the viewers to get a sense of his naturally high IQ when it comes to getting the job done. Each kill was quite unique and majority of them delivered on a more brutal adult slasher feel. Blood, Gore and a moment where each character realizes they are doomed. I'm looking forward to the continuation of the series heading into Halloween Ends! Great work to the entire team. Ignore the hate, you guys did an excellent job continuing Michael's slasher legacy.",Halloween Kills

1340,jordancawman,"These movies need to stop, now.",4,16 October 2021,"I just got finished watching every Halloween movie, from the very beginning. There was a couple bad ones in there, including Halloween Resurrection which was just dreadful. I actually really enjoyed the 2007 Rob Zombie remake, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie, and had some wonderful cast (including the child Michael who was amazing). The Halloween 2 (2009) was awful. It went off into some nonsense about a white horse, and the new child then had to portray Michael was just way too sweet and kind to be Michael Myers. The movie was all over the place, but still more true to Michael Myers then this one. I'm sorry but I thought this was just stupid. It went off on way to many sub plots. I couldn't build any emotional connection with any characters because there was just too many of them. This to me, was some sort of a horror comedy. They had to much humor throughout the movie, and scenes that didn't even make sense. The man standing in Michael Myers old home saying ""you've came home Michael"" and then just standing there waiting to be murdered. Michael Myers taking out an entire fire department and mob of angry people? It was laughable. I don't have high hopes for the next one, but do hope this ends soon.

Michael Myers did not survive through the decades playing solely in the field of good taste. And thankfully!The attempts of 1988, 1989 and even 1995 were somehow remarkable, whether because of the attempt itself, or because of the complete confusion, or because of the lovely presence of Donald Pleasence.In any case, these were the films that developed all of Michael Myers' relentlessness and explored the abstraction of the concept of ""evil"". Without Jamie Lee Curtis and without John Carpenter, these trashy attempts have kept Michael Myers alive and can't just be ""cleaned up"" now as if we didn't have fun with this mess.",Halloween Kills

This sequel, however, is frustratingly inconsistent, with each scene seeming to be spliced out of a different film. The dialogue is wooden and woefully expository (just in case it wasn't clear to the viewer, one character actually murmurs the central theme near the end-a theme, I might add, that was better portrayed in a Twilight Zone episode half a century ago). Beloved characters from the original are sidelined. Great swaths of dead time occur between kills. The kills, when they do occur, are suitably gooey but dull.

In fact, it was so corny that it felt like the writers were INTENTIONALLY trying to make the movie as bad as possible. It almost felt like an SNL skit.There was no heart in this movie. The plot was awful. The hospital scene with everybody running around like chickens with their heads cut off was beyond absurd.Everything about it seemed forced. How long did it take the directors/producers to film this movie? It seemed as if they put as LITTLE EFFORT into doing this as humanly possible. I am appalled and insulted.

1346,lschnittger,"Disappointment for fans of the Halloween franchise since '78. Second worst film in the Michael Myers series, ahead of Halloween Resurrection.",4,16 October 2021,"Where It Missed -Taking place on the same night as the last film (which was a great film), the plot in Halloween Kills was very muddled, with most of the film seeming very unnecessary to the overall story, and often feeling cheesy. It was nice seeing old characters brought back, but perhaps too many characters were involved to provide meaningful screen time and contributions to the story. The dialogue for many of these characters felt unnatural and poorly written, even comical at times with too much comical relief in this film, overall.The ending had a great climax as it let audiences feel hopeful in a new revelation for Michael's abilities and evil nature, only to disappoint using the same old story (from Halloween 6) and same explanation from other slasher films (Jason, Freddy Krueger).What It Got Right -This film did a good job displaying that nostalgic feeling from the first film in 1978, bringing back characters and actors from the original story, including ""The Shape"" actor, Nick Castle, and a surprise cameo with another fan favorite from the first Halloween.Along with nostalgia, the kills are probably the best part of Halloween Kills. There was plenty of gore and solid slays from horror's most famous slasher. This film did a good job of capturing the gruesome nature of Michael Myers.Overall, Director David Gordon Green delivered a poor story and tried too hard to appeal to all audiences, adding an unnecessary underlying theme and message to the story, pandering to its audience. Halloween fans should forget this film and hope for redemption with Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills

1366,Past_movie_reviews,"""Evil dies tonight!"" Turns out the movie was the evil, not Michael Myers",2,17 October 2021,"What a confusing mess of a Halloween movie. With plot lines and characters that go nowhere and contribute nothing to the overall story, kills that are sometimes well executed and gory but are unfortunately too drawn out and basic that quickly become boring, and an ending that left me scratching my head in disbelief... this movie was nothing more than another beaten dead horse of a horror movie franchise, bleeding for nostalgia bait and misplaced hype that also suffers heavily from genre cliches and really desperate pandering that would only appeal to the ""softly acquainted"" Halloween fans.The interpretation, from my perspective, is that the real curse on Haddonfield was not in fact Michael Myers at all, but rather an invisible wave of infectious stupidity that seems to have effected nearly every single character in this film. These characters are some of the most brash, impulsive, and downright oblivious groups of people I've seen in a horror movie. Except when they should be impulsive or brash. In those scenario's they stand around and barely do anything!This movie rides purely off it's connection to the first Halloween film (the 1978 version) and I think this is what hurts it the most as the many scenes with flashbacks don't really add anything and actually only exist to muck up the over simplistic plot. I'm not saying this movie needed to be anything super new and crazy to be enjoyable, but it takes away all of the potential set up by the last Halloween film that cliff hanger-ed into this installment and treats it like a side note instead of something that literally just took place in the timeline.This movie is the low point in the new Halloween series timeline of films in terms of story telling and in my opinion, a big waste of potential replaced with a tired retread that takes the new sequel franchise one step forward and two steps back. Not worth the ticket price, but if you're curious enough, just remember...you have been warned.",Halloween Kills
1367,desjarlaits,The boogeyman lives forever,9,17 October 2021,"This is my frist review. Let me tell you I have been anticipating this film since 2018! Halloween kills is a follow up to Halloween 2018 and it wastes no time showing Michael in action. The film starts with John Carpenters 1978 Halloween film and we get to see a proper introduction to Michael and how he gets incarcerated, which could've been Halloween 2018s beginning. David Gordon Green doesn't hold back with the kills in this film. The kills are brutal and beautiful. The hospital scene shows us the psychological emotions of the film where another patient that escaped with Michael shows that he was in the same psychiatric ward as Michael and he can feel emotional while Michael feels nothing. Michael clearly is the embodiment of evil and kills anything that moves. Big John and little John is the best comic relief I have seen in any slasher film I have ever seen. If you like brutal kills and a great straight forward film than Halloween kills is for you. Til next time Halloween Ends.",Halloween Kills
1368,sonovoj,Very disappointing film,2,18 October 2021,"What can I say? Terrible editing that made me feel like I have severe ADHD.Barely touched on main characters.I'll stick to the older ones. They've butchered two of these films now. Halloween 2 remake, back in like 2010 was Sooo bad.",Halloween Kills
1369,mrw-47793,"Plenty of flaws, but this movie is a very fun watch",7,17 October 2021,"I've been seeing a lot of mixed feelings towards this movie. Let me make it clear that this is not a 1/10 movie and it is not a 10/10 movie. A 10/10 means there are little to no flaws and a 1/10 means there is absolutely nothing of value. Neither of these statements are true. A big complaint I keep seeing is dialogue. I will admit there are some cringe worthy things here and I agree that ""Evil dies tonight!"" Was said way to much, but this isn't like the Star Wars prequels. The script isn't the best, but I don't understand how this is as bad as some say it is. Most of the characters are standard fair for a horror movie, mediocre acting (with some exceptions) and people that act like actual people, just not terribly interesting people. I also get the lack of plot argument, but this film is more about the experience of watching Hadenfield tear itself apart in fear. I think the movie does a commendable (if not the best) job at this. I understood why people went to hunt Michael. They wanted to destroy the evil that has plagued them for 40 years, and this mob mentality ended up doing more harm than good. As the movie shows, they ended up feeding the evil they swore to destroy, specifically when they caused the mental patient to die. ""Nobody is innocent."" This movie does have its share of bad decisions, particularly with no one going for the damn head when they have the chance. However this is nothing outrageous compared to other horror films (see the entirety of the Friday the 13th franchise). I feel the film did a good job with Michael in particular, though I could've used a bit more stalking from The Shape. He is pure evil and everyone is wondering why he is that way. I don't think this needs to be answered, but of course people in Hadenfield would come up with theories about him, that's how legends work. The film is positively brutal and most importantly entertaining. I think people sometimes forget that the most important thing for a film is that it's entertaining. This movie is fun to watch and had me engaged in the slaughter all the way through, though I do understand that that's not as entertaining for everyone as it is for me personally. I think this movie can fluctuate between a 6 or 7 out of 10, but I had a good enough experience that I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and rate it a 7/10. Is it as good as Halloween 2018? No, but I think it does a good job at being fun and has me excited to see Laurie on the warpath (and finally out of the hospital) in the next one.",Halloween Kills
1370,kgwzpzdz,One you will need to watch twice,7,17 October 2021,"My honest thought is that this movie ranks at a 6.5 but I decided to round up.This is a movie you will probably need to watch twice to really determine how you feel about it. I went to the theater opening night and watched it again on streaming, and the second time I watched it, some of my questions were answered and I noticed things I missed that made things make more sense.However, this movie does still have some flaws and I'll address those here.1) Many characters make dumb decisions, and I understand the idea of some of them just being paralyzed by fear, but, for instance, the old black lady who literally UNLOCKS EVERY LOCK ON THE DOOR but still picks up a knife like she's going to fight Michael off just to get stabbed with the light bulb is dumb. You took the time to unlock the door, run! And the one gay guy who just stands there and lets Michael come to him from across the room and kill him is equally dumb. Or the lady in the car randomly firing the revolver at everything that moves. There's other instances of just stupid character decisions throughout.2) Dialogue. This is a big complaint many people have. The dialogue is a bit over the top is some spots and it would have been better for nothing to be said at all and allow the audience to draw the connection instead of spelling it out. And yes ""Evil dies tonight"" is said quite a bit. That and characters constantly remind each other it's been 40 years since the babysitter murders.3) The unmasking of Michael. Although we never see a clear or definitive profile of Michael, I still felt a bit uncomfortable with how much we were able to draw about Michael's appearance. Yes, I know we see his face in the original for a time, but it would make sense to me to keep it concealed perhaps until Ends since it's been 40 years since the last time the audience has seen his face. Part of Michael's fear factor is the anonymity.4) The ending was a bit of a rushed mess. I'm hoping Ends helps clean this up and make sense of it, because from what I understand, this ending was different than what was originally planned.Now for some positives:1) Michael looks FANTASTIC in this movie. Visually, he looks terrifying and imposing and some of the lighting work they did for tight shots with the masked face was superb.2) Kills were great. They were brutal, but honestly if you've seen Saw II or anything later, that's more gory than this movie.3) The first 10 minutes of the movie are also fantastic. It looks great, has tension and captures the tone of the original film very well. The Michael depicted is a more brutish than in the original though.This movie is a bit of a mixed bag for me honestly. The last installment was better, but think the next one might help clean this up and make it make more sense. There were some dumb character decisions and dialogue, but the plot and trajectory of Michael feel cleaner and more sensical than in the previous timelines with the brother/sister dynamic and Thorn. This movie establishes that Michael wasn't even drawn back to Laurie, it was the doctor from the 2018 movie that was obsessed with them meeting again. As it stands, Michael kills because he likes to kill. And that by itself is reason enough, which is horrifying. This film isn't as scary as I felt the last one was at times, but it's much more story driven and feels like it will need and additional chapter to be completed.",Halloween Kills
1371,jtblack-40643,Rushed,5,17 October 2021,"This franchise is my favorite of all time. From the first in '78, to this one minus the Rib Zombie ones, and part 3. Loved to see Charles Cyphers ""Lee Brackett"" make a showing, the original Lindsey Wallace, Tommy Doyle not the original, but never the less it was nice to see. Dr. Loomis lookalike was great. This movie seemed really rushed, like they couldn't wait to end it. Not nearly as good as the original, definitely a 1 timer. Sorry John Carpenter you're my favorite, but this kinda let me down. Wouldn't loved to see Big Ben Meeker in this one, along with Jamie ""Danielle Harris""LLoyd.",Halloween Kills

If I were able to sue the producer for wasting my time, I surely would as this movie stank like a tramps urine soaked underpants. Thankfully, my butler was close at hand so I took out my frustration by punching him square on the jaw. The director didn't appear to know if he wanted to grace us with a comedy, a drama or a gore fest and failed miserably on all counts. If you value some semblance of acting, suspense, storyline or decent horror style deaths, I'd give this joke of a 'movie' a miss and take your side piece out for a bucket of chicken followed by a back scuttle before returning home.

Then at the end of kills, he gets back up and is the pure evil indestructible Michael I grew up with...not a man but something much more sinister and harder to kill!Great fun and even a laugh or two mixed with sheer terror and horror delight.Any true fan of the Halloween series will surely love this addition to the franchise.Can't wait for Halloween Ends!!",Halloween Kills

He just left her and started chasing Karen. Michael has beef with the strode family it does not make sense for him to leave her alone, don't you think he would kill her then leave to chase Karen? Also she let Karen strode go in the Myers house, they should know its a possessed house because Michael used to live there, and I think if Allyson loved her mom she would at least ask where she was going and she would at least go with her or tell her NOT to go upstairs alone.",Halloween Kills

I will agree that Michael Myers is definitely more brutal with killing people, and the lack of jump scares was disappointing. But just like the other movies, it is always mentioned how Michael Myers isn't a man. This movie definitely drives home that he never dies because of the fear the people of Haddonfield have. That is what keeps him alive. I would definitely watch it again like I do with the other Halloween movies. I can't wait when Halloween Ends comes out next year.",Halloween Kills

NONE of them have ever been exposed to gun violence, ESPECIALLY being set in 2018. Also, HOW DID THEY CONFUSE THIS DANNY DEVITO LOOKING MAN FOR MICHAEL MYERS???? The cherry on top of this tragic highway accident of a movie is that Michael Myers opens a car door and SUDDENLY THIS LADY SHOOTS HERSELF IN THE FACE?????

Writer and director David Gordon Green successfully adds new information to the film's canon, further mystifying Michael Myers as a force of nature, ""the devil's eyes.""

1382,mcgarrhdave,Honest opinion as to why I love this movie.,8,18 October 2021,"After watching and reading reviews I felt obligated to share my honest opinion on it. To me I felt like this was a worthy sequel to the original and Halloween 2018. It had tense and suspenseful moments, and the kills were brutal and chilling. Story wise I felt like there was development and that the plot was advanced. Haddonfield has had to live with memory of the events from 40 years ago and even if many others have forgotten about it the survivors of the original haven't. Then with Michael's second spree it's rekindled those feelings for many. The fear of the boogeyman spreading to the town was an effective plot point. Without going into spoiler territory I felt like the plot was clear in the direction it was going. In my opinion I believe people way overthink slasher flicks. They're not supposed to overly complicated. You can have a simple plot that does give development to the characters but as long as it's tense or has some good kills then its achieved its job. Halloween Kills checked all the boxes to make me feel like it was a worthy sequel and a great slasher movie.TLDR: people overthink slasher films and I don't understand the negativity around this film. It had all the elements of a good slasher flick in my opinion.",Halloween Kills
1383,dannykoamczw,Love,10,27 October 2021,I love the kills I love the storyline the dialog the cinematography I love how Michael shows why hes the shape why hes so dangerous and scary and and I'm glad that David Gordon Green and Blum house ignores all the other sequels especially that dog crap Halloween 5 and resurrection and not to mention rob zombies abominations.,Halloween Kills
1384,thomsonsarah-87148,Just let him die already!,1,18 October 2021,"I was honestly hoping that someone took over to be Michael or that there was a couple of them. Michael is not some beast of a man, he's old as hell now and by the amount of times he's been shot there's no reason why he can still be alive. Is Michael just going to continue to be this immortal being that can take on dozens of people when he's in his 60s and 70s too? These need to be more realistic cause when you know some maniac is on the loose you make sure NOBODY is EVER alone! So many of them go on a rampage and scatter leaving them one-on-one with this un-killable man. Also, when you find two guys in their home killed and one with a knife in him, you don't take it out! She didn't even check his pulse or see if he was still alive. But instead possibly killed him from bleeding out. So good job. Then she hears her friend screaming and just sits there for a good 10 seconds like a moron before deciding to pick up her shot gun. AND you'd think if the entire town was on this giant man hunt and you were splitting up that you would stay connected somehow. Why not use walkie talkies. Or hey here's an idea a CELLPHONE! We have those now, it's not 1978 anymore. Pretty sure if all the cops in that town were doing THAT shitty of a job to catch this guy that they would call all cops in the surrounding area to come help out instead of leaving it to the town folks and basically just shrugging and letting them act like wild animals. Get a friggin swat team, this guy clearly will not stop killing everyone he sees. I dunno, I'm just ready for him to die already. Michael is getting too old for this stuff, his back must hurt by now and he can't be in that good of shape to continue this. He's been shot and beaten, basically burnt, yet is still is great physical shape to take on absolutely anybody, including a mob of people. If everyone just beat on him at the same time instead of taking turns then everything would be fine. Or here's an even BETTER thought, SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD! Like with a shot gun. Ugh just kill him already, I would be more satisfied if someone took over for him rather than him being immortal. Okay I'm done my rant. Blow his head off. K thanks.",Halloween Kills

So, this legendary horror tale has turned into nothing but Liberal brainwashing. The line ""he has turned us all into monsters"", therefore, is essentially saying Myers is a Trump figure. Jesus Christ. Will leftist Hollywood leave nothing intact?Just get it over with, already, and spare us the agony. Turn Myers into a woman as soon as possible. You all know it's coming. And you can leave me out of it, because after 40 years of admiration for the movies, I'm tapping out. No desire to see the inevitable train-wreck.Agendas aren't art. And these newest Halloween movies are nothing but a Liberal hijack and total insult to the 1978 masterpiece.The newly-created flashbacks to 1978 were excellent.

If you like unnecessary violence and enjoy two digit orgy of actually pretty uninspired kills, well you might like this. Spoilers: not a lot happens. Everyone shouts about killing the truly evil, everyone tries in stupid ways, everyone is killed in painful ways, Michael is shot, burned, poked in the back with sharp object, but nothing ever happens and in the end he stares out his window.Do yourself a favour if you watch this: take some strong alcohol and a friend with you. One is team kills, one is team truly evil. Everytime someone is killed or ""the true evil"" is mentioned you take a shot. Whoever misses most of the movie due to falling into a drunken stupor and does not have to experience the absolutely non-existent ending wins. The loser has to drag the winner out of the cinema.The production value is definitely there but if you enjoy any amount of story in a movie instead of watching a compilation of rather unexciting murders taking place, you should probably pass.

I never go into a horror movie with the expectation of Oscar worthy performances.Keep that in mind when reading my review.This is simply my most honest opinion of something I've been a passionate fan about for over 40 years.In the last 25 years, I've never seen a better horror movie.Halloween Kills gave me everything I wanted, hoped for and more.It truly is a adrenaline rush, unsettling, riveting and relatable.Michael Audrey Myers at his most evil, ruthlessly brutal and relentless.This movie starts with Cameron's discovery of a unconscious Hawkins, who I was right about! For 3 years now, I preached he wasn't dead.The vindication I felt could only be described as me me saying;
I yelled
""I KNEW IT!!"" as I was watching.They then literally give a bonus scene to the original (1978). The only way to describe it.It's that good!It took me back to 1981, when I saw Halloween for the very first time.My goosebumps started from the very moment that scene opened with ""Halloween Night 1978."" didn't stop until it closed with Myers standing on the lawn of the Myers house surrounded by cops and Dr Loomis.A identical match to Donald Pleasance himself, it felt as if they traveled back in time to add him to this film.A INCREDIBLE attention to detail, was well worth the price of admission alone.From the Smith's Grove station wagon parked on Lampkin Lane, to the dead dog and broken widow pane inside the Myers house.Michael even used the rope that he stole from the hardware store, to attempt to kill Hawkins partner, that inexplicably was never used in the original movie.Speaking of Hawkins, I felt his guilt in that moment, having to make a choice and lose on that decision, sure they captured Myers but at the loss of his partner.In my opinion, this movie did a fantastic job with the acting.In spite of the heavy criticism for it, I found it to be stellar, relatable to damn near each character and their emotions.The way of showing how this has impacted them long term and how it is currently, riveting.I found one of the more powerful moments of defeat is when the show Sheriff Barker sitting on the steps in the hallway of Haddonfield Memorial, looking completely spent.A captivating moment personally.When Lonnie was talking to Alyson about her father.I'm sure we've all lost someone close to us, and what do we do at funerals and gatherings? Share funny stories about our lost loved one.Alyson allowed herself that brief moment to grieve in that backseat, on the way to find the man who murdered her father, I might add.Yet another captivating moment I felt.Karen knew they had the wrong man, and was able to make contact with Tivoli, you could already sense his fear and just a want for help, he was certainly not comfortable with being out of confinement.I rooted for her to save him and felt for him, his sense of hopelessness.Feeling like his only escape of fear was death. Truly riveting.The 1978 survivors, were fantastic, particularly Lonnie, you saw and felt his fear more than any of them, with the exception being Lindsey perhaps. Tommy was great, drunk with a blood lust for vengeance.Lindsey was awesome, she captured being very aware of what evil was brewing and showed no fear when faced with it as she used a bag of bricks, although not smart, in a attempt stop Myers, after he just slaughtered Marion, Marcus and Vanessa.She knew what to do once realizing she had no chance, ripped at his mask, run and hide.I hope we get more of her in Ends.The moment in the park involving Marion with the gun in the SUV.The callback to 1978, when Michael slaps his hand on the passenger window breaking it. Goosebumps.There were so many tributes to past movies, some you gotta pay attention to.The Halloween 3 nod with the Silver Shamrock masks, well done.Then there is the few that seemed like it. For example;
Was Big John's death a nod to Brady's death, perhaps?Is Cameron's a nod to Halloween 6, when Michael spins a man's head clean around, breaking his neck?Michael in the bathroom when Phil cuts on the light, a nod to Annie's death in Rob's H2?Perhaps overthinking on my part, or maybe a coincidence.I'll stick with them being tributes just for my sheer enjoyment.True or not. I like the thought.The fear of Myers has infected and ruined that town for over 40 years.It finally has taken over, they became a thirsty with vengeance mindless mob.Fear made them mindless like Michael Myers.Hence the chaos and confusion at Haddonfield memorial.One of my most favorite moments came when Hawkins put Laurie in her place and told her that Myers has never been about you.""He wasn't there for you.""
Bravo!! Brav-O!!I do believe that she's beyond being convinced otherwise, she truly believes that she's gotta be the one to stop him.I think, it will ultimately be her undoing in Ends.Her vengeance will make her even more blind with rage.Especially when she finds out about Karen.She becomes driven by rage, just like Myers, coincidence? I think not.Big John and Little John were FANTASTIC!No other opinions on those men will be acceptable.Oblivious to the world around them and were genuinely enjoying each other as a couple on Halloween night.Imagine a couple like that actually existing, the audacity of Gordon Green and the rest of the team to try to make it as real life as possible.Cameron, bravo sir.A duchebag I ended up rooting for. The fear he had when he was upstairs in the Myers house looking for Michael, he nailed it! He was so much better in this one.Alyson got him done perhaps the worst out of all Michael's victims, and is definitely one the best kills, if not the best.Michael recognized her, he was definitely being deliberate in the way he brutalized Cameron. As if it was his was of saying, he didn't forget she played her part in trying to burn him alive.Alyson and Karen were stellar.They did a great job as the leading women.I felt Alyson's pain and need to put a end to it.Karen showed her strength, and willingness to step into the belly of the beast to save her daughter.It was refreshing to see Laurie not dominate the screen and was completely likable in this installment.Karen truly showed how fearless and strong she was, she went out like a G, if that was indeed the ending and not a epiphany or some kind of dream.JJC absolutely hit a grand slam, a 360 slam dunk from the foul line, scored a hat trick, passed for 500 yards, whatever superlative to describe his performance, insert it here. He was absolutely phenomenal.Arion Armstrong was nothing short of a carbon copy of Nick Castle himself, he did a marvelous job as the flashback Myers, felt like a proud father watching him work.The score was brilliant, and it helped set pace and tone so beautifully. I'm really at a loss of words when trying to explain how well I thought that was done.Once again Carpenter shows why he's one of the best, if not the best in creating those moods you can feel through music.This movie was in no way shape or form; a let down, a disappointing movie, filled with holes, terrible acting.My opinion, it's literally none of that.I don't want to say anyone is foolish for thinking so, as that is a discredit of their opinion, but I almost feel like it's my civic duty to do so.The hate is truly mind boggling.This movie is solid gold, that diamond in the ruff.There is so much more I could cover and unbox with this movie but I think I've covered enough at this point.A Picasso by Gordon Green and the gang, the best ""slasher"" movie of this generation and perhaps over the last 40 years.Easily the second greatest movie in the Halloween franchise.10/10.",Halloween Kills

1411,treveraluedtke,Movie wasn't as bad as it would seem,7,23 October 2021,"Now, other than the start of the movie and the several other factors that would seem to be just some filler for the movie, there is several great factors in the movie that make it unique, the movie is a film of not horror but of the mind. The movie has some bad acting and rather gory scenes however that's not the point of the film its just taking from what movies now days are expected of, it follows the people more than the shade, it shows truly how fast the human mind can change from fear to hopping on an a single focused idea, like the ""evil dies to night"" taking refrences from real events of riots and boycotting that take the turn quickly when one person builds the wagon, us people do jump on that idea fast proven time and time again. At the end when Laurie strodes' analysis of evil and how it works shows that the movie was trying to setup the state of mind the film was shooting for, there were many un-necessary scenes in the film to add fluff to it but i think the director didnt do as bad as the film critics would like to say it did. And the film overall without the fluff and un-neccesary gore was great.",Halloween Kills

1414,adamgoodman-74057,Can't kill The Shape,8,23 October 2021,"Halloween Kills sticks to the title, this film is just a pure blood bath from start to finish. We get a realistic look for once on how Micheal survived the fire, and the mistakes of humanising Michael from ""Halloween""(2018) are fixed. He wants one thing in this film and that's to kill everything in his path. Another great point to put out there is the NOSTALGIA in this film. This sequel reintroduces characters from the original in a great way and without giving to much away let's just say the film makers really do not care about saving them, or giving them some safety buffer due to them being OG characters. There are a few bad points with this as the film fails to identify a key/main character to drive the story but I feel that having these multiple characters with different stories to why they want to destroy The Shape does justice to the greatness of this film. The filmmakers also did a great job from start to finish in setting up his goal to kill and return home. The flashbacks help us see this point and also give us more incite into the Myers legacy. Without rambling on for to long an ruining the whole film it is great, gory and the ending scenes honestly gave me goosebumps. One last thing you can't kill The Boogeyman!",Halloween Kills

Maybe I missed the point of Halloween 2018 and this movie but Micheal clearly is super natural. Which is confusing Mr cause I thought Halloween 2018 showed he was vulnerable. Guess I was wrong. Had the mob killed Micheal in the end like they should have just shows that the director only wants the pay day of making a third film. Having Laurie's daughter, Alison, stupidly sacrifice herself to Micheal makes me fear that they are setting her daughter up to be the next shape in the third one for future films. What I did like was the unique kills in this and Micheal showing a brutality he has never shown before. Also I liked that most of the OG characters got killed.

1426,elixr-71734,#TeamMichael2021/2022,1,25 October 2021,"Made an IMDb account just to comment on this train-wreck of a movie!!! JLM is the main lead and is literally only shown for a minute in total and is sidelined the whole time being in the hospital within (Halloween Kills) while the whole part of (HK) action is Michael's pointless emphasis of his brutal raw unhuman strength in a small town with victims having the IQ of -1 . In the beginning, the Firefighters being massacred was unnecessary. It's was actually funny seeing them all lining up one by one to fight against Michael , when they all could've attacked him at once & why didn't they radio in to the police that they have engaged Miachael Myers ??? Next scene we see the ending clip of (Halloween/2018) of Laurie along with her daughter Karen and Karen's daughter Allyson , being driven away from Laurie's burnt trap house en route to the Hosptial , where they assumed they finally killed Michael , and then they see FireFighters on call immediately going to put out the fire at Laurie's house where Michael is trapped & they simply yell "" Let it burn"" lol . What grinded my gears is that , not one of them had a cellphone on them so that they could've atleast called the police and say that Michael is trapped at her house and that the Firefighters would need assistance ASAP . And that for some reason , Laurie magically forgets that she didn't kill Michael at her burning house & that she herself saw Firefighters en route to put out the fire that was at her house with Michael . Overall, I'm glad Michael cleaned out the trash characters, they all deserved it , however he forgot to take out the granddaughter of Laurie , Allyson . He got Karen and he could've finish off Allyson when he finished off with Allyson's bf , instead he goes off to chase Karen who sets Michael on a trap with a few mob of people who have an IQ of literally -1 , some have guns and shot Michael a few times but Michael is unfazed by bullets and plays dead and catches everyone off guard lol . Also I'm actually glad he got Karen at the end , when she makes (a stupid Karen decision) her name suits well for her role , to go alone inside Michael's house and be at nearly the exact place where Michael had originally killed his sister & Michael creeps up from behind her does his masterpiece on her , I was rooting for Michael to get her at that point . Karen did not heed her mother's (Laurie) advice to take Michael seriously, Karen downplays Laurie's obsession to be ready for Michael, since (Halloween2018) Karen wants to have a normal life and be a surburban mom & ignore completely that Michael is nonexistent and tried to kill her mom (Laurie) multiple times in other movies where JLM was the lead cast. I'm glad Michael took care of Karen and I hope he goes for Karen's daughter, (Allyson) in the next trainwreck movie or maybe (HalloweenEnds2022) , where Michael goes to finish off (Allyson) and hopefully , JLM can redeem herself and finally kill Michael, if not , I will root Michael all the way.",Halloween Kills

I loved how the town got involved to kill Michael in the end with the OG characters. But the they ""kill"" Michael and he gets up to slaughter everybody like it just doesn't sit well with me. John Carpenter should have done better. You got the whole town all of the characters there and it felt surreal have everything set up for the end. The suspense was built. Just for a voice over of Lori talking about how Michael lives off fear and then he gets up after being shot 4 times stabbed 2 and bother time with a pitch fork.

I can't even begin to tell you how many peoples heads he punches in and what made it even better was the retro Halloween theme played through out with that unreal horn like score from John carpenter. Was the movie scary ? Absolutely not, we laughed our heads off the entire time, but that's what made it so good. Honestly best night of my life.

If you're looking for a slasher, gore and a lot of murder then 100% go watch it. However, if you're looking for the storyline to progress, dont bother. I liked how they made the film and how they put it together. I loved how they went back to the original film from 1970's. My only problem with it was that it did nothing to progress the actual story line of Michael Myers. All in all I would give it a 7.8/10. Very gory, very halloween, no progression in the storyline whatsoever.",Halloween Kills

Whoever came up with the script is not a true Michele Myers Fan or Halloween.,Halloween Kills
1449,haydenconnorthompson,Pointless,3,1 November 2021,So there are a couple of issues with this film. Characters are extremely stupid throughout the entire movie splitting up or letting him regain his composure and then promptly dying. The entire film is rendered pointless at the end with many characters dying and mr myers being as free as ever. So basically you don't have to watch this movie nothing happens because any progress is undone and all that is achieved is people dying. But the scene with the girl shooting herself was kind of funny so 2/10.,Halloween Kills
1450,kevvsp,Get a grip,7,1 November 2021,So you are chased for 15 minutes in 1978 and you are mad. For real. Same with Tommy. Never chased. I think Ben Tramer had a worst night. EVIL DIES TONIGHT. Christmas sweater anyone. WOW.,Halloween Kills
1451,darenfritz,"No story, just an excuse to see gory things",1,1 November 2021,Just a bunch of angry people running around waiting to be killed. Recommeded for who likes stabbing and head smashing. In the end every one dies and as always police came for nothing.,Halloween Kills
1452,sjames-58380,Nope!,1,1 November 2021,Warning! Spoilers!One thing that I loved about the. Halloween franchise was that Michael had a method to his madness. His kills had some type of formula to them. Two things I didn't like the most? Michael NEVER ran! And he could certainly be wounded! This moving made him into John Wick wannabe! Seriously! 11 first responders with axes lose him with the one with the waterhole blasting him doing absolutely nothing! Rob Zombie's version is much better! It tells a story. Laurie and Hawkins have this weird I always liked you moment while little Tommy starts a mass riot failing to remember that Michael wore a mask and would not have come to a hospital full of crowded people begging for help while hearing there chant evil dies tonight! I get this was a new take on it but you expect people to believe this man that failed to run in his younger years sprinting at times. Also both movies take place on the same night? Than for whatever reason Laurie's daughter just has to walk into his room and stare out the window amongst all the chaos just to die at the end. Smh. This movie gave Jason vibes and his normal murder music had a new techno twist wtf.,Halloween Kills

Tommy was the worse character ever created ... he was just too much ... too hyper ... too everything ... he was like a 5 year old with ADHD ....

Sorry if I can't just ""ride the wave"" but if the movie is not better than ALL it's predecessors I feel it should have never been made. Sometimes I think the writers producers and directors are just way too involved to actually take a step back and say to themselves ""no this isn't it"" but damn.... Just take the step back or in this case don't spend the money... go feed the needy because this was an absolute waste of a film budget.

It's funny to laugh at, and that's about it.Something so small as the way it was filmed made it hard to watch, too.

1463,paul-15282,Lost it's way,2,6 November 2021,"As a big fan of the franchise, I was looking forward to this new chapter of the story. It was a gross disappointment. The biggest issue was not the story itself but the loss of what made Halloween one of the most classic horror films of all time: the suspense. Halloween (1978) had only 3 kills but was able to terrify audiences by creating the fearful anticipation of what was about to happen through genius film making, not gore. This new version was actually quite dull, without one ""jump out of your seat"" moment. It felt like the film was created to exploit the popularity of the Michael Myers money tree, but the creators clearly forgot or worse, abandoned what made Halloween into the cult classic it was.",Halloween Kills
1464,dailenanddrew,Halloween Kills is confused and convoluted,4,7 November 2021,"This movie... oh man. 2018's halloween wasn't a fantastic movie, but it sort of worked. It was certainly more entertaining than this movie. This sequel, however, is so ridiculously confused on what it wants to be. It focuses so much more on the people affected instead of Michael himself. It becomes this whole thing where a couple of people who had encounters with him are trying to rally up everyone to put an end to him. Eventually, in a bout of mass hysteria where this huge crowd is targeting the wrong guy (instead of Michael, they're just targeting this other random mentally ill guy), and all the stress causes this man to jump out of a window and kill himself. How does this further the plot at all? It doesn't. One of the guys who rallied everyone to chase this mentally ill person is like ""oh no... we got the wrong guy... how will I fix this? By continuing to try and find michael and kill him."" At that point, how is no one telling him to calm down before he gets another innocent person killed? Whatever it is, they eventually get michael cornered, and all these guys are beating him up. He gets shot, bludgeoned, stabbed... and then he just gets back up like nothing happened, and the people just... let him. They suddenly just become 200% dumber and can't swing a weapon to save their lives, literally. There were way better ways to set up for the 3rd movie than him just getting up. What about a doctor bringing him in for an autopsy, and in the middle of it he wakes up...not great, but the actual ending is worse. Whatever it is, there's still some fun to be found in the movie. Good gore, michael has a great design here, and when michael is on screen, it can be kinda fun! Just don't expect something great here.",Halloween Kills

1466,allhallowsbeast,One of the Best,8,10 November 2021,"I know some will disagree but I actually really enjoyed the film. It was nice to see Loomis in the flashbacks that I thought they pulled off well. I know many say there was no character development and I agree, however, the movie is titled Halloween Kills. From the title you would expect a lot of kills and very little character development. The next and last movie in the trilogy will probably play more with the characters and the franchise as a whole. The kills were awesome for a modern day Halloween film and I think they did what they set out to do this movie. This movie should be appreciated more than what it gets and I think with time it will be valued more than what it has been so far.",Halloween Kills

1468,DeanJLee1977,What have I just watched?,1,31 October 2021,"As a massive Halloween fan, to say I'm disappointed in this movie is an understatement. What have I just watched? To be honest I have no idea. What makes the original so scary for me is the slowness of Michael/The Shape. He isn't fast, he moves at such a slow pace, you fear he's always a just step behind you. The fact that in Halloween you see next to no blood compared to this over the top blood bath has always added to the fear for me.There is so many boring plots in this story that you quickly forget what's happening and why we are watching this film.It's a shame as the first 20 minutes are actually rather good, it just becomes a complicated bore that I just wanted to end.",Halloween Kills

It just feels so...cheap...the movies that they keep making now. Almost a betrayal of what made Halloween so good. In the original what made it so scary was the LOW body count. There was actual suspense. You didn't want the victims to die, but I swear to you, after watching Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills, I can confidently say that I wanted 96% of all the characters to die. There is ignorance and then there is just plain stupid, and I dare you to guess which one shows up here. And for everyone who is glorying in the ""great kills"" and ""more gore"", I really hope I never have to watch a movie with you sad little children.",Halloween Kills

1473,loganmarcum,Deeper into the reason for Michael,9,16 October 2021,"I strongly suspect that the vast majority of people who rated this movie as poor weren't alive when the original came out and probably ditto for the sequels. But for those of us who were able to catch ever single one as they were released (not counting the pathetic Rob Zombie remakes that are unwatchable dreck), this one hits its mark. You've not only got the callbacks of past characters but it almost explains why Michael is able to keep coming back for more...and more...and apparently, just one more next year.I enjoyed Halloween '18 but I felt there was something missing. This film brought back the ""pure evil"" who kills without reason...and that is far more terrifying than someone with motive.I gave it a 9. Very well done and perfect for this time of year. If you're a fan of the previous films of the franchise, you'll likely dig this.",Halloween Kills

1475,SteppinWithCountBass,Blood-drenched frenzied Halloween entry!,8,16 October 2021,"See it! Really good. Critics panned it, but WTF do they know! Michael is back! In true coup de grace, beast-like form, rampaging, pursuing, and burning through the night, making the streets run red with blood, sending shockwaves throughout the community, igniting a crazed group of vigilantes set out to hunt down Myers.More darker and more intense than the 2018 Halloween, with a lot more blood-bashing kills, some cool cameos, and a nice retro-remixed soundtrack! It makes up for the slow-paced, less spirited, lady revenge movie that is 2018 Halloween.Laurie takes a backseat in this one, which is good cause the movie flows well without her overly serious character, and the lore built up throughout the movie and bouncing off just about every character adds a definite chill factor to the movie. No dis to Laurie, it does feel very much like a Halloween movie and Laurie somehow brings back that retro 1978 Halloween vibe back to the screen. Curtis warming up to her character in this entry is more apparent and is a very pleasant touch.The ending is the most uncomfortable part of the movie, because you're thinking, ""Is this seriously the finale they're going with?"" Let's just say it toys with the viewers expectations and the outcome is satisfying.Also happy that Michael deals with the more annoying characters accordingly, sparing no one! Did I mention that Michael kills people in such an operatic fashion in this entry in that it should be considered ""slasher art""?!?*** out of ****",Halloween Kills
1476,vaboy112,Poor remake,4,22 October 2021,"There are so many head scratching moments. Poor writing and logic. The first thing is how is the police captain alive after he was stabbed in the neck and run over with a car in the first film?!? Lol once he was alive I knew the film was trash. 90% of the people killed could have escaped. The Blake woman at home in her kitchen stood there waiting 4 mins for Mike to kill her. It was just so dumb, the angry mob that gave off racist Lynch mob vibes was so dumb and pointless. It just wasted 10 mins for no plot movement at all. I guess Mike is now some super human Thanos clone that can take bullets, fire, stabbing, fingers chopped off and still move like nothing has happened to him.",Halloween Kills

There are a lot of brutal kills in this one and Michael proves once again to be indestructible. That being said, the script could definitely be better. Some of the lines are laughably bad and once again, we as the audience is assumed to be stupid.It seems like every other horror movie made these days is dead set in portraying the message that we are the real monsters. In Halloween Kills, they actually felt the need to say it, which made me face palm. Honestly, what do we expect from the 12th installment of a franchise though?I didn't hate the film but I didn't love it either. I will probably watch it several times for the kills alone.

It has taken formulaic to a whole new level. Enough is enough. Can we please give the series what it now needs, closure. It is time for Michael to undeniably bite the dust for the very last time whilst leaving the viewers in no doubt.All the participants know the devastation that Michael Myers has left in his wake for 40 years so why when the residents have him totally at their mercy do they let his off the hook again?The annoying thing is that you know it is definitely going to happen once again.The original Halloween was groundbreaking and has never been surpassed by any of the sequels.

1480,bldisthlfe,In name only,3,21 October 2021,"If one includes all Halloween films (3,the reboots) then yes it's a Halloween movie. The franchise ended long ago (II) and kept itself alive by decreasing story and increasing CGI violence. Do not get me wrong, random violence is much-needed in low grade films, but not here.The first Halloween (not the Zombie-field reboot) had only 3 victims, each of which were on screen.

1482,Arredondo7,Could have been SO much more. *Sigh*,3,18 October 2021,"I'll preface by proclaiming that Halloween is not my favorite horror movie. It's my favorite movie of all time. Humble brag or not, it is what it is. That's why any movie in its saga, whether part of a reboot or reimagining, gets an honest critique from me. If one is going to flood the movie with fan service, it better be good and it better fit. This was a huge problem in this movie.I wasn't going to write a review, but after seeing one 10/10 ratings too many with quips like ""ignore the low star trolls"" I feel that I have to put my 2 cents in. Suffice to say that I've noticed anyone with a glaring 10/10 review just says ""the movie is awesome"" or ""Michael Myers at his best"" but they don't take the time or energy to tell you what makes it awesome enough to receive 10/10. The ""low star trolls"" more often than not will tell you what makes it bad and then explain.The problem, in my opinion, with Halloween movies is that they have had to fight to be taken seriously every single time a sequel is mucked together and released to the public. The reason they generally receive poor reviews from your average movie goer or critic is that the movie doesn't deliver enough backstory of characters or doesn't pay close attention to details such as the various masks used, which seems small, but magnifies under the lens of a bad storyline. That could be due in large part to some directors just wanting a new three movie deal with a certain studio, or a scenario where they don't get to do their favored project unless they complete another less than preferable movie beforehand. ""Halloween"" seems to have been the victim of those scenarios. So, when David Gordon Green and Danny McBride chose to make this their preferred project and no one forced their hands to do it, I had the greatest feeling of excitement because I believed we were going to get movie(s) that had people who were going to put their best foot forward on it and deliver the movie(s) that the fans deserved... so if this is their evidence of their best foot forward, then it makes me truly sad as a hardcore fan of this saga. And now that sadness has turned to bitterness over the course of every bad sequel, reboot or reimagining. They had a big opportunity and seemingly embraced the pressure of scrutinizing it and making sure they delivered. They had the attention to detail to ensure that the masks in the movie were as accurate as they could possibly be. Big plus. The costumes were to the point where the footprints from the boots were accurate to the era and time period of the ones Michael wore in 1978. They nailed that and the tone of the original as best they could with today's cinematography tools as opposed to what was available back in 1978 and it's very much appreciated.What's NOT appreciated is the lack of understanding that Halloween movies have had a reputation problem of not being taken seriously, as stated before. That makes ridiculous lines like ""he stabbed his sister in the tits"" and ""evil dies tonight"" being repeated ad nauseum and in the most ridiculous manner, unbearable. And no, that's not the only thing that makes this film take one on the chin. Marion Chambers stating, in a very precarious situation where Michael has just ripped out a chunk of her hair and is inches from ending the lives of everyone in the car, ""... hey Michael, this is for Dr. Loomis"" before realizing her gun's chamber is empty. She basically deserved to be stabbed repeatedly the way she was. So cliche, which makes it so dumb. Suffice to say that the dialogue didn't just need work, it was on life support. I find it very disheartening that there was a team of writers and between the 3 of them, they all read the dialogue and said ""this is fine"". To top that off, there's a team of editors that watched those words play out and decided to keep them in the movie. Normally, if a story is really strong, questionable dialogue here and there gets overlooked. But as I said, Halloween entries have not been a beneficiary of that. I'd like someone to watch Tommy speaking to himself as he describes how he's going to make Michael go ""night night"". It was hilariously BAD.As much as I loved that former Sheriff Leigh Brackett found a place in this film, it was beyond cringe when he's got a gun, that he doesn't even fire at Michael, pointed at him and spouts with as much gusto as Marion ""...hey, Michael, it's Halloween... everyone's entitled to one good scare"". What does that mean in that moment, Sheriff?? Halloween II may not be canon anymore, but we all still saw how destroyed you were when you realized Annie was dead and that it was Michael who killed her. I want your passion to come out when you're face to face with him after 40 years, not your cheesy sentiment. It had no place there. It felt like the writers were wanting to pay us some more fan service that I honestly could have done without. If that was a scene that was left on the editing room floor, and made it to the DVD bonus extras, I would have very much appreciated it. As it stands, that line is forever embedded in Halloween lore, so I have no choice but to penalize them for it. I almost wanted to turn it off at that point, but Michael was about to face the wrath of the most inept mob of people so I decided to continue watching. If the tagline would have been ""evil gets a mild beat down tonight"" it might have accurately represented the tone of their ire.Big John, Little John, Little John, Big John. *facepalm* And declaring to Michael ""you came home"" is right up there with ""evil dies tonight"". I'd rather you mourn over your lover while Michael takes zero pity for those who inhabit his house and he slaughters you as you cry. By the way, I'm glad that Michael thinks so much of your relationship that he decided to play you an Anne Murray classic... *double facepalm*.By the way, could someone tell Jamie Lee Curtis that you don't need to scream bloody murder just because you're giving yourself an injection of a painkiller that you could have just asked Karen to give you.Moving on to Karen, I didn't get the sense from her that her husband was killed by Michael just a few hours ago, if that. Coming to the defense of Allyson when she was about to be butchered by Michael was pretty cool... so why stop at one stab in the back with a pitchfork and a mild stomp to the head that dazed Michael for all of 5 seconds, just long enough for her to pull off his mask? What if Michael got up, turned right around and finished the job on Allyson and right in front of you? Or would the rules of horror movies not allow it? This is where attention to detail would have been more appreciated. What made Karen get up, in the midst of caring for her injured and traumatized daughter and look up in the window of the Myers house? Seriously. Can someone explain to me what would compel her to do that beyond saying ""she must have had a feeling..."" as stated by my lovely wife? A. Feeling. About. What. Exactly?? If you find yourself saying 'you're being really nitpicky, dude', I say to you , I'm not saying anything I wouldn't say to the production crew or to myself if I took it upon myself to procure a meeting with John Carpenter and get his blessing to expound and expand upon his masterpiece. There's a lot of implied responsibility of such an undertaking, and if you ask me, this crew didn't just miss the mark, they ignored their responsibility to do their absolute best. Again, if this is their best, then holy crap!, 'Halloween Ends' isn't looking good. You have a team of people around you, and what is their investment in this?How would Lonnie Elam end up stuffed into the attic door? How and why would Michael take the time and attention to do that given that Cameron and Allyson immediately charged into the house upon hearing the first gun shot? If you're thinking it doesn't matter, it does when this was pointed out in Halloween (2018) when everyone wondered how Michael stuffed Ray into the closet inside the house after he strangled him to death and left his body lying on the front lawn when he went after Laurie inside the house? Continuity matters, and no one has a logical explanation for it. No one. And is anyone wondering why no one will take Halloween movies seriously? With each entry, they are basically allowing everyone to treat this saga with the same reverence as Child's Play. They basically mock John Carpenter with each entry. It makes it hard to believe he signed off on this as opposed to being money whipped into signing off and giving his blessing.Evil did not die tonight. Evil was excused tonight. The heinous nature of mob mentality couple with a case of mistaken identity (although I'm still scratching my head how) forced a person to commit suicide rather than be torn apart by the mob, a mob that seemingly had hospital personnel in the fray.This film would have likely gotten 3 stars from me, but since Blumhouse was able to strike a deal with Peacock and it cost me only $4.99, plus I get to stream ""The Office"" again, it gets that extra star. That's the best fan service I've had since I started watching ""Halloween Kills"".

I especially was not a fan of Tommy Doyle's character in this film, just awful.There were so many useless mob scenes that were completely pointless and take away from the film. The flashbacks were useless and not needed. The writing was terrible. ""Evil dies tonight!"" was waaaaay over the top and just lame.The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was the 10 minute scene in the house near the end where Allyson and her boyfriend are in the house with Michael. That scene is Halloween to me! The rest of the film was a mess.Michael taking on the 11 firefighters looked so much better in the trailer, but felt like he suddenly became Jet Li.

The gruesome kills were welcoming as they were more aligned with the originals than Rob Zombie's depiction. However, that's where the positives end.The quickly-adopted mob mentality at the hospital was a bit of a reach. In this version of the series, Michael Myers killed his sister in the 60s and 3 teens in the late 70s. That means that probably 75% of Haddonfield weren't around for him to ""haunt them."" Yet, you see doctors and nurses losing all self-control in pursuit of a figure that most likely never actually affected their lives. It's a bit unrealistic that an ""evil dies tonight"" chant would cause such an immediate reaction.Couple that with a scattered lineup of characters that no one relates to, and you're left with a movie that feels like an overdramatized, bloody transition to the series finale.",Halloween Kills

Times have changed both in and out of the series and there is new blood in the writer room!

1499,jhunterwilliams,Such a let down,5,18 October 2021,"*SPOILER ALERT*
I was so excited that this was coming out and had such high hopes after the 2018 movie. But after seeing this, I wish they had just stopped with the first one. This movie was completely unnecessary and was more reminiscent of the Rob Zombie remakes with the excessive gore and violence. The dialogue was horrible and cheesy, the acting was atrocious (yes, even Jamie Lee's!), and the storyline was just absurd. This movie fell victim to the same thing most horror sequels do...we're going to make up for all these deficiencies in plot, acting, and writing by just adding in more blood and gore. But that's the exact opposite of what made the original and the 2018 sequel good. You need suspense, you need story, you need characters with some depth...not a ridiculously high body count. And don't say that they gave some of the characters more depth with all the flashbacks to the original...they were reaching with all those flashbacks and it just seemed contrived. I get that for Michael to survive all that he has that there has to be some supernatural forces at play...I'm ok with that. It's a movie, I can part with reality a bit. But these multiple ""fight scenes"" he had with the firefighters and the towns people where he takes down dozens of people at once is just ridiculous. That's not Michael Myers, that's something out of a Marvel movie! He's sneaky, he's stealthy, he hunts you down...he doesn't confront you and a mob in the street for a gang brawl! And furthermore, if he has these abilities, why has he waited 40 years to break out of the hospital?And then of course there is the hospital scene where the innocent man jumps to his death to escape the mob that thinks he's Michael. I get what they were trying to do here, trying to show what a mob mentality can do, but they took this too far. It was bad enough to see a mentally handicapped person running from an angry mob and then jump to his death to escape them, but they took it one step farther and showed his bloody carcass splattered all over the sidewalk. What purpose did that serve, other than to shock people? That was the point at which my wife got up and walked out, leaving me to finish it on my own. That scene could have been and should have been handled better, and shame on the writers for including it. They at least had some of the characters show remorse, but ultimately they didn't learn their lesson and they all paid for it in the end. I hate to say it, but I was glad to see Anthony Michael Hall (Tommy Doyle) get killed...his acting was by far the worst, and I felt little to no remorse for his character at that point. They should have held out for Paul Rudd! Surprisingly, Kyle Richards' reprised role of Lindsay Wallace was some of the best acting in the whole movie, and I'm rooting for her to make it to the finish line in Halloween Ends!All in all, this movie was a big step down from the last one, so here's hoping the writers/director have some tricks up there sleeves to finish on a high note. The silver lining is that because of the extremely high body count in this one, most of the main characters are dead and won't return for the final movie. So unless they write another ridiculously contrived script that loops in a bunch of other previously un-related characters, then there just aren't that many people left to kill! At the end of Halloween (2018) I was blown away and was totally with Team Strode, but after sitting through this disaster of a movie I have to say I'm on Team Myers! If they can't act any better than that, you kill 'em all Michael!",Halloween Kills

Also there were so many bad cuts. How about the ""no one told you? Hes still alive"" *cut to a zoom in on the actress* ""WHAT?!"" *New scene* My goodness that was awful. And how about the great plotpoint of the hospital chasing the wrong guy after shouting ""Its Michael without the mask!"" and then 5 minutes later ""He always wears a mask we dont know what he looks like."" This movie was awful, I dont know who to blame because again the same people worked on it I guess they were just high when they wrote it.Now the kills and special effects were absolutely great and the only decent part of the movie, which is basically why it has at least 3 stars.

Liked Halloween, Halloween 2, Halloween 4, H20 and Halloween 2018. All of those I enjoyed.And I really enjoyed the opening hour of this one aside from one scene regarding firefighters. Let's be honest 20 vs 1 you wouldn't individually attack one at a time, you would dog pile them all at once they wouldn't stand a chance. Funny enough a similar scene plays out later and it gets it right with how it should be and then 60 seconds later they undo it and go back to the illogical nonsense. What they should have done for the third group attack is have them all assualt him at once but he just no reacts to their shots and just bosses through any strikes that would have actually fit with the dialogue that came moments before it and honestly what I was expecting to happen. Yeah this really bothered me because it was just so illogical and poorly executed and ended with one of my favourite characters death, which felt really cheap.Anyway this is the movie in a nutshell, really good moments followed by absolute garbage. Repeat for 1 hour and.45 mins. When I first heard the synopsis for this movie I thought it sounded like a really good idea and expected to have some underlying themes for the original characters like survivors guilt, PTSD, etc. However it didn't ever really go anywhere like that beyond ""Evil dies tonight"" (count how many times someone says that) and their obsession with Michael.I did enjoy the original characters performances I just wish they were given more. We ended up wasting time on several weird random characters who just felt out of place and just canon fodder. I would rather have had time with Tommy, certainly wanted more time with Lindsey and Karen.At least they didn't mess with the lore beyond some character deaths. Michael still felt like The Shape and I loved that they brought his speed back in some scenes, especially the flashback. He comes in like a bullet loved that aspect that he isn't always some lumbering slow killer.It was really nice to get a classic slasher movie again with our 80's/90's villain. Got a sense of nostalgia at times especially with the original characters. Shame they didn't execute it better though. If you are a fan of Halloween you are going to watch it anyway and you should. I don't think it is the worst in the series, probably somewhere in the middle for me.

The first 30 minutes I kept waiting to find that it was actually a comedy spoof of the franchise. This was just stupid. I honestly don't get it.

I will give it credit for having nice moments of tension and some great kills which I felt were lacking in the 2018 movie.That said...this was a sloppy, sloppy mess of a film. The pacing is so odd. It feels like it had too many writers working on it with different places they wanted to take Michael Myers and his mythos. It's just bizarre and disjointed.The writing is BEYOND cringe worthy. Who talks like any of the characters in this movie??? Jamie Lee Curtis was given some of the most over the top, ridiculous dialogue I've ever heard spoken on screen and her performance was often painful to watch. I say that as a huge fan of JLC. She's one of my favorite actresses of all time but she really comes across as ""acting"" in this movie.That's my biggest issue with the film. The ""evil dies tonight"" thing was overdone. Who talks like that?!?! Ughhhh!!! It was painful.Overall, it's just a big disaster. I'm giving it more stars then I think it deserves just because this series holds such a special place in my heart.

I love the original two Halloween movies and also really liked the last one BUT what the hell did they think when they made this one?I had the feeling that they put out flashback after flashback and really tried to tie the story all together. But I think they made a mess out of it. It was little enjoyable because the movie can't develop a dynamic because of all these stupid side stories and flashbacks.The kill scene though where fun.

Now we know that, no matter what, he will always be and win. And, what's the point of that? Where is the excitement?I'm pretty sure that they could have found new ways to keep the franchise alive: Michael and his legacy, Michael as an idea that can be taken by someone else to let the endearing character die with dignity. But no, they just threw at us the dull fact that Michael is larger than life and for all the wrong reasons.

Specifically, it's going back to the franchise's long-running tradition of producing subsequent Halloween movies so painfully inferior that you can feel not just your fandom but your very lifeforce being drained. Bad sequels produce diminishing returns, and very bad sequels send those returns plummeting down to the earth's core. The worst, however, cast a retroactive pall over an entire legacy.

The plot is all focused around the town having enough of Michael Myers, which has almost no setup or explanation, and the now grown up Tommy Doyle on a self righteous mission to take him down coining a campaign slogan of ""evil dies tonight.""Well several things died, evil wasn't one of them. Anthony Michael Hall and the onslaught of subpar ""filler"" actors ruined the movie. The acting was god awful (minus Jamie Lee Curtis and Judy Greer of course) and they had very minimal screen time.The story rocks back and forth between graphic nonsense killings and poor attempts at cut the tension humor. Michael Myers isn't even the star of the show, he's overshadowed by a town who all of sudden is bothered by events that took place 40 years ago.Very unrealistic (even for a horror movie) and almost unwatchable. While the film has its charm in nostalgia with paying homage to the original films, it falls flat on its face and burns to the ground like Laurie Strode's compound. Except that should have been the end with Michael finally being defeated. Instead, we have to watch the franchise burn to ground taking years of horror classic story telling with it.",Halloween Kills

The sheer brutality of the kills in this installment and the genuinely anxiety-inducing scenes in the park or Michael's childhood home proves to me, once again, that Michael Myers really is the most terrifying slasher put to screen even 40 years after his first killing spree. With that said, it became clear to me very early on that this was a filler movie meant to get us from the 2018 film to Halloween Ends next year. Whatever plot was meant to be furthered here regrettably fell shorter than what I think was intended. Like...why bother hyping up Laurie Strode when she spent most of the movie in the hospital while Tommy actually went through the trouble of rallying the town? And why put so much emphasis on the old characters making a comeback when most of them would be dead by the end credits? It just felt like a lot of minimal payoff trying to get made up for by revved up carnage. Maybe I'll change my view when I see the third chapter next year and can take in the whole trilogy together. But until then, I gotta be honest: I liked it. But didn't really love it.",Halloween Kills
1583,micahgdye,No Expectations for the Audience,2,10 November 2021,"Halloween kills falls way short for me. Nothing is left to the imagination, and there is no expectation for the audience to think at all. The dialogue is slow and overtly explains every theme and sub-theme in the movie. The violence is written in the same way. Explicit and over the top with no real purpose to the story.The characters established in 2018 are not explored at all. The writers wanted to force a new storyline with new main characters. This creates some issues with continuity and opens the door for long segments of exposition. And boy do you get a lot of it. Not to mention, the dialogue for these people is scarier than the movie. If they omitted ""Evil Dies tonight' entirely, I think this movie gets 2 more stars. Seriously, its so bad.The characters' development, both old and new, is written very poorly. There are no real arcs that make you feel even remotely attached to the film. Part of the problem is that most of the characters explored in 2018 are sidelined in a hospital for the aforementioned new storyline. The same story and theme could have been developed with the original characters. It was pointless to introduce so many, try to give each a backstory, and then kill them off with no real purpose. Not to mention the ideocracy through which these new characters make decisions. Its brutal to watch...The part that worries me the most is how do you end Michael Myers now? He literally takes a beating in almost everyway possible and shrugs it all off. Especially when David Gordon Green has said MM is not invincible (Yeah right...). Now they will have to kill him off in the last movie in some dumb way that doesn't do the character justice.The intention of the movie and its underlying themes are not lost on me, and honestly lend themselves to a solid plot; the execution just falls flat on its face. I love the idea of mob mentality and how it could take a turn for the worst. But do this with the characters we care about and don't explain every detail. Make the audience think.",Halloween Kills

1588,davisilvasct,Disappointing.,2,15 October 2021,"The review below is heavy with spoilers.I'll start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Halloween franchise, as the 1978 movie is one of my favorite horror movies. I love how John Carpenter and Debra Hill managed to create a simple and extremely scary atmosphere with the town of Haddonfield and the figure of Michael Myers.We know the franchise had numerous sequels, and different timelines, and the Rob Zombie remakes. Some of these movies are good, some are bad; others have good ideas but very poor execution.And then we have the 2018 version of David Gordon Green, who ignored all the sequels released so far, being a direct continuation of the first movie. I particularly liked the idea, although 1981's Halloween 2 is an excellent sequel, in my opinion.I think Gordon Green did a great job on Halloween 2018. Excellent throwbacks to the original, and the always wonderful presence of Jamie Lee Curtis made the project even bigger. I also liked the addition of Judy Greer and Andi Matchak.And finally, two years later, we have Halloween Kills, delayed from its original release in 2020 due to the Coronavirus outbreak.In my country - Brazil - the film premiered today (10/14/2021). Of course, I needed to watch the long-awaited sequel to Michael Myers' planned trilogy.And I have to say - what a disappointment.The film has no story. It has no depth. It doesn't have the atmosphere and mystery that made the original, and that the 2018 movie did in a few moments, that made it so memorable. All we have in HK is death and death and more deaths.Here, Laurie Strode is left in the supporting role, and most of the plot - or lack thereof - is geared towards new characters, and others returning from the original film like Tommy Doyle and Lindsey Wallace (the children Laurie took care of in the original). Marion Chambers (Dr. Loomis' nurse), Ronnie Elam (the boy who bullied Tommy), and even Sheriff Breckett (Annie's father from the original movie).All of this only serves to arouse nostalgia in the fans, because all these characters - some that we've learned to like more than others - are just there to die. That's right! Everyone dies except Lindsey Wallace.Nurse Marion appears, says some unnecessary lines and dies. The character's appearance was much better in 1998's H20. At least in that movie, her death had a purpose.Although these characters mentioned above are not the center of the franchise, but Michael Myers is, I found a total disregard for them, bringing them back simply to serve as fresh meat for Michael, who is indestructible.Jamie Lee Curtis delivers her best, as always, in everything she does, but the film doesn't give her much space, and her participation boils down to staying in the hospital bed, in a lot of pain, and having some exchanges of dialogue with her daughter, and Officer Hawkins who didn't die as we imagined.Another thing that bothers me is when the director creates something interesting in the previous film regarding certain characters, only to discard them in the sequel (Randy Meeks from Scream 2, right?). Here, Gordon Green does it with Karen Strode, played by the underrated Judy Greer.He builds an interesting change in character in the 2018 film, which also has one of the best moments with the phrase ""gotcha!"". And in this one, after a lot of suffering, and more waves of growth on the character's part, he just kills her in the final moments of the film at the hands of Michael, obviously. I would not have felt her death if it had been more meaningful and not gratuitous, like all the other deaths present.HK also suffers from unnecessary scenes like Oscar's mother, a character from the previous film, showing up at the hospital in search of her son; and a long sequence where a Smith's Grove fugitive - the one with the umbrella - is mistaken for Michael Myers at the hospital and is chased by the enraged population, only to jump out of the hospital building and die.I feel that this movie only served as a filler until the third chapter, Halloween Ends. It tries to bring nostalgia with flashbacks, the return of familiar characters, but fails miserably to give these characters work, and I dare say: disrespecting the original with the expansion of flashbacks and the appearance of Dr. Loomis.Anyway, I'm no longer excited to check out the third chapter, but I'll go anyway out of pure curiosity.I give 2 stars only for Jamie Lee Curtis, barely shows up, but gives her best.",Halloween Kills

1590,ryecatcher-63227,Bad. Even by slasher flick standards.,1,18 October 2021,"It's literally laughably bad at points. When it's not just a blood and gore FX crew's flash piece for the next movie, it's a horribly written and acted film. And the kicker is, it's got a massive budget -- whereas bad low budget horror films have a valid reason to be badly acted and written. Please God. No more sequels.",Halloween Kills
1591,joshbaptiste,No plot no resolution,2,1 November 2021,Don't waste your time on this movie unless you just like senseless acting and no plot movies. JLC is old and has not point to be in this movie other then to collect a check.,Halloween Kills
1592,kgunedlamini,What in the Hollow-een is happening here??,1,17 October 2021,"Firstly, David Gordon Green must never direct another Movie, ever!!This lacks substance and logic. It is hollow from whatever angle you decide to use!Mediocre Acting!Stupid and laughable Dialogue (Little John/Big John)A plot void of logic and has so many holes you'd fall into the next dimension!Never in my life have a watched such garbage!!1. So Does Mike have some super teleportation powers or what? For a guy merely WALKING, he seems to be faster than everyone in the god damned movie. Ain't no out running this guy.2. Why does everyone handling a gun in this movie, so obsessed with close range shots?3. Why did Allyson sit and pick knives off someone visibly dead, while the boyfriend decides to just ""go die"" in the next room? Because that's what it was, an ""Oh let me just go die"" since he didn't even bother asking for help from his knife picking girlfriend.Also, why did the Dad need to be some sort of ""hero""? So you mean to tell me that we have a madman on the loose, and he'll opt to go to the house alone??? Why??? And they just let him?? Why? And what happened to him? A shot went off. And?? Not a scream, nothing?? Such a pitiful and pathetic attempt for building suspense.3. The black couple in the car with the old Lady. (This scene alone should have the Director (David Gordon) forced to retire!)So, Mike climbs on the roof of the car they are in, and this lady decides to shoot EVERYWHERE else but the roof of the car where Mike CLEARLY is. Oh and not only that, she decides to LOCK the car, so that THEY can be entrapped in the car. Really???????????Oh and by the way, the black couple also has a gun! But they'll gladly scream ""unlock the door"" rather than shoot at the monster that wants to kill them. So when the old lady decides to take the rooftop shot, it is clearly too late. This is when the black guy decides, ""The Stethoscope works better than a gun!"".Oh and the wife comes back to take the infamous ""close range shot"".4. Why do people in this movie just ""wait their turn to die"". The Fire Men all basically lined up for their death. Really Gordon! Really!!!???5. Why can't Mike die??? Is he immortal? And Karen, out of aaaaaall things decides, ""Hmmm for a guy who has survived every god damned stab and gunshot. Let me just do one pitch fork stab and just add a ""kick"" on the head for ambience!. Really?? Really Gordon!!!??THE WORSE MOVIE OF ALL TIME.If there was less than 1 star I literally would!!",Halloween Kills
1593,bridgetteee,"Put a fork in Halloween, it's done.",3,18 October 2021,"Honestly though. The time has come for the Halloween franchise to count it's blessings and 'call it a day'. It's the same old story, told in a slightly different way. It's done- let it rest.",Halloween Kills
1594,markhartlaub,Absolutely terrible,1,25 October 2021,"This movie is actually just so bad. The characters are dumb, the story is far from entertaining, and the acting is terrible. Just watch something else.",Halloween Kills
1595,mattymrksa,Incompetent and Bizarre.,2,30 October 2021,"Halloween Kills is one of the worst, most pointless Horror films I have ever seen, I was shocked by Its lack of quality to a point that Is hard to stress.To begin I'm not super well versed in the Halloween Franchise as a whole. I've seen Carpenter's admittedly masterful original, watched the decent sequel and viewed the completely seperate third film. I also watched the recent direct sequel to the original, simply titled ""Halloween,"" which while not anything to write home about followed a competent story.This movie throws all that out the window and is probably the most aimless hour and a half I have ever watched. Characters are set up, Humanised, given copious amounts of screen time, and then killed by Micheal Myers, severing no semblance of purpose.The structure continues in this manner with strange additions added every so often. Its ""plot"" could be described in a few paragraphs, with little to no progression in story or character. This is also prevalent in its confusing as weak ending, which simply happens once the film gives up trying.Jamie Lee Curtis also served no real purpose in the film, feeling almost like a quick rewrite after the prolific actor agreed to be in the film.Obviously I heavily disliked this film but If I had to honestly agree with the popular opinion that Micheal, (for the most part,) Is depicted as menacing and scary, that return to form doesn't save a movie though, after all eating mud isn't any nicer after you add a spoonful of sugar.If I could describe Halloween Kills in a simple concise manner, I would compare it to a boring filler episode of a once loved television program, past its glory days and attempting to pass episodes before one last bang. I hope the upcoming next film Halloween Ends is that last bang, instead of getting Lost, (literally.)",Halloween Kills
1596,mcnaughtchristopher,Don't waste your time,1,17 October 2021,"I will start and say I was looking forward to this movie , and hand down it did not deliver,most parts of the film didn't even seem real , it actually seemed that the director has well went off point with this film and forgotten what this franchise is all about ,I would not recommend,very dissatisfied.",Halloween Kills
1597,donchart,Horrible,3,19 October 2021,"While the kill scenes were classic Michael Myers, then rest of the film struggles dearly. Fells like the Director and writers tried way too hard to apply social commentary. The film also gets lost in sentimentalism and nostalgia. Super disappointing after the last film that was very good.",Halloween Kills
1598,software-90880,Halloween kills kills my mood,1,30 October 2021,"Most halloween movies are silly but they are often still enjoyable. This one is the least interesting it is a waste of time. The story is empty, the acting is not great, the scenes are not scary. It was a waste of tomato ketchup.",Halloween Kills
1599,toneygraham,Not impressed,1,15 October 2021,Terrible the flash backs was awful worst Halloween movie i have seen. The 2 kid actors did not do a good job at acting. Bless your heart damn this movie sucks. Worst i have ever seen good luck with the next one.,Halloween Kills
1600,ajslinger,Worst one,4,20 October 2021,"Awful, just awful. Don't wast your time. The only decent scenes are the flashbacks. Terrible acting coupled with a worse script. The whole town deserves to die for being so pathetic. Top tip: When the killer (who only ever walks) has a vice like grip and a knife, pick up something handier and a bit more long range than a baseball bat. Failing that, simply walk slightly faster in the opposite direction, which you should be doing right now, away from this movie.",Halloween Kills
1601,rjaconski,$20 million filler episode,4,25 October 2021,"This was just a blatent attempt to use the Halloween name for a quick cash grab. The story has no focus, the first half hour is used to introduce characters that have no bearing on the story. They brought back characters from the original movies in order to express the terror they've been through and create a mob to have ""evil end tonight"" but they all seemingly forget they can call each other for backup and how strong mr Meyers is. This was a cringe worthy movie with how stupid everyone was and how pointless this movie is, if you've watched any other Halloween movie this is just a copy paste of those.",Halloween Kills
1602,VerbalizeAZ,Just awful,2,16 October 2021,I felt I was watching January 6th all over again. A bunch of uneducated trying to take matters in their hands. Everything about it was stupid. I gave it a 2 only because it's filmed well. But everything else is a embarrassment.,Halloween Kills
1603,wizzemwl-67041,Fumble on the goal line!,3,15 October 2021,So I'm curious to who's green lighting these movies with horrible story lines? So in this modern day town there are no street lights. Camera's and no has any type of modern technology or knows how to shot a gun (including the police) OK! So much hope that this would've been a decent Sequel.,Halloween Kills
1604,keith-92546,Hard to follow up on 2018,5,15 October 2021,"There was certainly a lot of gore. They spent a lot of time reintroducing characters from the original Halloween, and establishing possible motives for Michael Myers. Knowing that there was going to be another sequel with ""Halloween Ends"" also didn't help. This definitely felt more like it was setting up for something bigger in the next installment.",Halloween Kills
1605,stens897,I seriously wouldn't bother,1,19 October 2021,"All I can say is Wow, what a Sh@t film. I reckon my 13 year old daughter could have written a better script. Halloween and Michael Myers is part of film history and I believe it deserves more justice than this. No scares, not a lot of gore, in all honesty, just a completely forgettable piece of trash and I'm so surprised that any actor would put their name to it. Considering how bad the script was, please let me know if you want a script that will take this this forward and actually scare people and be part of a decent movie franchise. I can't believe anyone wouldrate this more than 1.",Halloween Kills
1606,wbwalsh,Another Miserable Product of Wokness,2,16 October 2021,"Yet another ""Hollywood"" production ruined by wokness. Although a good portion of this movie was true to its genre the midway point brought ""wokness"" into Michael Myers' world. The ""all white"" vigilante group chases the wrong man through the hospital resulting in the innocent ""crazy guy"" jumping to his death from the 2nd story window leaving the black sheriff sitting in a stairwell along. To begin with it wasn't the best movie, although what is it the 6th, 7th, 8th, Halloween movie. But it was better than this... sending a message type movie.Overall very disappointed it had to pause for wokeness in the middle of what could have been perhaps the 4th best Halloween movie. Sorry guys... no sorry :)",Halloween Kills
