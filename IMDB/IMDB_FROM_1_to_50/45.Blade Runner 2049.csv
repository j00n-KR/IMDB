0,TheLittleSongbird,Jaw dropping and richly rewarding...well worth running with,9,11 October 2017,"'Blade Runner' is a masterpiece and a favourite of mine. It is still to this day a genre and film landmark, and ties with 'Alien' as Ridley Scott's best film, despite being disliked at the time it has rightly gained its reputation as a classic.Hearing that there was a sequel over thirty years later left me with intrigue, with a great cast (Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford), one of the best cinematographers in the film industry today in Roger Deakins and with an equally great director on board (having liked to loved Denis Villeneuve's previous films), but also nervousness considering (with notable exceptions) the general reputation with sequels. 'Blade Runner 2049' turned out to be well worth the wait, it is easy to see why it will alienate some with its very long length (can understand the overlong criticism) and slow pace but it is even easier to understand the acclaim the film has received.Is 'Blade Runner 2049' better than 'Blade Runner' or on the same level? No. Is it nearly, or shall we say just, as good? Yes. To me it is one of Villeneuve's better films along with 'Sicario' and 'Incendies' (my least favourite of his is 'Arrival' and despite being an understandably divisive effort to me it was still good) and one of the exceptions to the general reputation of sequels. A sequel that treats its predecessor with respect (including some thoughtful and cleverly done nods to it, including quotations from the original score, even Ryan Gosling's name is a nod to the original author Phillip K Dick) and also its audience with respect. Despite its faults, it's also one of my favourite films of the year, and this year has been very hit and miss for films so this is saying quite a bit.Sure 'Blade Runner 2049' is not without its flaws. Can totally see where people are coming from criticising the length, most of the time it was not a problem but some of the time there was a sense that the length was too inflated, 20 minutes could have trimmed with no problem at all. There are a few implausibilities and contrivances here and there towards the end and much more could have been done with the underdeveloped character of Jared Leto (the only weak link in the cast, he doesn't have the presence to pull the role off and doesn't look comfortable or interested).However, 'Blade Runner 2049' does a huge amount right. It looks amazing, it's impeccably and imaginatively designed with some of the best special effects seen in a long time. It's Deakins' cinematography that particularly stands out, darkly gritty, gorgeously fluid and beautifully audacious Deakins shows that he is fully deserving of being considered one of today's best cinematographers. One cannot praise 'Blade Runner 2049' without mentioning some of the best directing Villeneuve has ever done in a contender for the best directed film of the year (well between him and Nolan for 'Dunkirk'), he is absolutely the right man for the job and shows himself to be not only completely at ease with the material but also tailor made for it. Once again there is a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge and sense of wondrous awe.Another big standout is the synthetic music score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, so well done and fitting that one doesn't miss Johann Johannsson that desperately. Though imagine what the film would have been like with his involvement, from my understanding he was originally meant to do the music but was fired for reasons that are a mystery to me and Wallfisch and Zimmer were parachuted in and did marvellously with big shoes to fill. It's appropriately hauntingly discordant, heart-pounding and tension-filled, with seeming echoes and quotes to the original's score. The sound effects are clever and thrillingly authentic, like for example the replicated wolfhound.When it comes to the writing and story, 'Blade Runner 2049' also triumphs, even if the story is not perfectly executed. The action-oriented scenes and conflicts are filled with tension and suspense as well as ingeniously choreographed, a fine example being the masterful prologue which has to be one of my favourite opening sequences of 2017. The science fiction elements are positively awe-inspiring, often making my jaw drop, while the philosophical ones are incredibly thought-provoking and never heavy-handed (many films have made a hash with this aspect, it was refreshing to see a film doing it well). Despite being a long and slow film, a vast majority of the film was richly rewarding, with a delicious quiet tension and absorbing mysterious elements.Excepting Leto, the acting is great. Best of all being Harrison Ford as a suitably world-weary Indiana Jones-like Deckard, that and the 'Apocalypse Now'-like meeting with Ryan Gosling providing a nostalgic element, and a deliciously cold-hearted Sylvia Hoeks (her character and performance being what Leto's character and performance should have been). Ryan Gosling also plays it straight to great effect.All in all, despite imperfections this jaw-dropping, richly rewarding, very respectful and visually stunning follow-up is just as good, if not quite as, as the 1982 masterpiece and one of my favourites of the year. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",Blade Runner 2049
1,Leofwine_draca,Arthouse blockbuster tedium,5,15 September 2019,"Here's the long-awaited sequel to the Ridley Scott hit, but unfortunately it ended up in the hands of director Denis Villeneuve instead - a man I find criminally overrated after the threesome of PRISONERS, SICARIO and ARRIVAL all failed to impress me. BLADE RUNNER 2049 is similarly glacial in its construct, with the director seemingly unable to inject any warmth into his film whatsoever. As such, the performances feel artificial (maybe that was the intent) and you don't really care about any of what you see. Harrison Ford's the most interesting thing in this, and it's criminal to make the audience wait two hours to meet him again. Elsewhere, the endless CGI scenery is admittedly beautiful, but the plot is surprisingly slight - reminiscent of ANGEL HEART at times, but weaker. Watch it for the visuals if you must, but otherwise this is weak sauce compared to the first.",Blade Runner 2049
2,SnoopyStyle,pure cinema,9,10 October 2017,"It's 2049 Los Angeles. K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner hunting for old Nexus 8 replicants under LAPD Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). After the 2022 blackout, most records have been erased or corrupted. Tyrell is out of business and replicant production had been outlawed until Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace is producing a new obedient replicant. Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is his replicant henchwoman. K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K's holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.This is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original's visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.The original's detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins' work is beyond beautiful. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. Gosling is a more effective lead. Ford comes in during the second half and is a more fun Deckard. Ana de Armas is a gorgeous vision of girl perfection. Sylvia Hoeks is an amazing villain. The movie tackles all of the ideas without hitting one over the head. This is a great film although I'm not sure if popular modern audience will take to it. The opening box office certainly does not suggest that.",Blade Runner 2049
3,Hitchcoc,"Excellent, Intellectual Science Fiction",10,6 October 2017,"This is an amazing piece of work. It has incredible artistry. As a visual exercise, it is breathtaking. I thought the original was way ahead of its time in creating a milieu, a dystopian world, full of disease and commercialism. Given the wonders of modern times, the world where this takes place is nonpareil. Ryan Gosling is out to eliminate the old replicants because there is a secret which needs to kept. The hierarchy is doing what it can to keep a world event from eliminating the awful world they have created. Goslin has memories, but they could have been implanted in him, so he is continually torn by dealing with details that may or may not be true. He needs to return to the place of his childhood. Harrison Ford reprises his original role of Deckard, now old and living in the ruins of Las Vegas. Evil is in control, but there is hope. The final scenes are incredible and puzzling, but it is a great challenge to the viewer.",Blade Runner 2049
4,boblipton,Dickensian,9,19 March 2020,"One of the things that made BLADE RUNNER (1982) so interesting to me was it was an era when tv and movie sf seemed to be devouring all the genres, and this looked to be a fine melding of sf with film noir's sour, dour paranoia. There were other reasons to love it. If you were one of the fifty thousand people in the world who knew who Philip K. Dick actually was, then you probably knew he was as crazy as -- well, take whatever your saying for as crazy as you can get and double it. We knew he was poor and could use the money. We didn't know he was dying after decades of living in poverty, to top off the irony.Anyway, here we are, thirty-five years later and sf, like Flash Gordon, has conquered the universe, Ridley Scott has re-edited and re-issued the movie several thousand times, none of which I have ever bothered to look at. I did look at Blade Runner 2049 this afternoon and pronounce it visually stunning, and so what?If I want to stun myself visually, I can stare into a 300-watt bulb set to strobe. You want to stun me visually with a movie in a good way, show me some new stuff in a way that tells a story in a novel manner. That's a little tougher here, what with decades of MAD MAX and RED DWARF. There is one sequence that blew me away, the Dickensian sequence set around San Diego, with dust heaps out of BLEAK HOUSE, and tormented orphans hard at work and such. After that, it was musing on the fact that even Tinkerbelle wants Pinocchio to be a real boy and can something be done about Jared Leto? Will some one give him a chocolate chip cookie at least?In the end, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is a good movie not because it tells exactly same story with newer and more obnoxious special effects, but because it tells another story that arises out of the first, and not just one in which the good guys win because the good guy leaks marginally less blood and lives, while the bad guy dies, thus proving that..... good guys have better clotting? Yay for the good guys! No, Ryan Gosling actually learns a moral lesson and does a good deed as a result, for no benefit. Because in the end, if we want to be human, we must behave as humans.",Blade Runner 2049
5,Horst_In_Translation,The world is not enough,4,5 November 2017,"No less than 35 years after the original Blade Runner by Ridley Scott, it is Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who gives us the 2017 sequel. Hampton Fancher, the writer of the original Blade Runner and also a prolific actor for decades, returns out of retirement to continue with his career-defining work. And it was quite a challenge as not only does he have to come up with a futuristic, yet realistic work, but also take into account the events of the 1982 movie. I have seen the latter once years ago and I don't remember too much, so it's almost as if I haven't even seen it and that's the approach I am giving this new movie here. The lead actor is recent Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling and that is a big problem for me for sure. He was basically inferior in every shared screen scene from start to finish, be it with Harrison Ford, the lead actor in the original, with Dave Bautista early on or with Robin Wright and Ana de Armas. He is so bleak and the fact that there are hardly any scenes here without him in a film that goes for almost 3 hours definitely hurts the overall outcome a lot. I mean many people like him I know, but to me he is so completely void of energy that it is very difficult for me to appreciate the film with him at the very center of it.Of course it is not an actors' movie, but still. All the actors I mentioned show how to make the most of their screen time and they do a pretty good job and you can add others to that like Leto, even if a lot about his character is about these eyes and not really about his performance. As for de Armas, she currently sits on number one in the IMDb Starmeter, just like last week, and we will see how her career is going after this huge success and if she (and Daisy Ridley for example too) can make huge waves outside their blockbuster franchises in the next years, maybe decades. Harrison Ford definitely elevates the material from the moment he shows up and I am not even a fan of his. But the amount of classics he is in is very impressive. Lets see if we get an old version of his Indiana Jones too at some point, just like we do here and on Star Wars. Back to this one here: I am actually surprised by the great reception and it cannot only be my Gosling bias that kept me crucially from enjoying the watch. Sure in terms of the complete visual side and technical side, it was a spectacular watch and will definitely be represented at the Oscars. The world is great to watch. Is this the film that finally gets Roger Deakins his long overdue win? It sure looks like that. The colors, the landscapes, the buildings, the structures... it all looked exactly the way I hoped it would.But honestly, this does not keep me from criticizing the story. Just one example: The reference to Gosling's character believing he is the one who was born. There the film almost points laughingly at other films where he would have been and it seems very condescending that the movie prides itself by something so simple honestly, acting as if this would prove it's great because it takes a completely different route. Yes people may have predicted it's him, but then after this revelation it's just about nothing but guessing who's the one instead. Not enough. Not even close. We will see if there will be a third Blade Runner at some point (or a film taking place in-between the 1982 and 2017 film) and the open ending with a strong plot potentially for Leto's character make it look possible. However, the watch here does not get me curious about the original again, let alone this one here that I will not see again ever I guess. A bit of a shame as I really enjoyed Villeneuve's recent works. But from what I have seen so far, this is a career worst. Don't watch. It's only for the very biggest Gosling fanboys.",Blade Runner 2049
6,Prismark10,Back to the blade,7,11 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner was a futuristic noir thriller. It did not need a sequel but maybe like another film released in 1982, Tron, the producers thought a belated sequel was required.Denis Villeneuve directs with Ridley Scott taking a hands off Executive Producer role. The visuals are still great but not as breathtaking as the original film. We see a dark multi ethnic rain soaked LA with giant billboards.Ryan Gosling plays Agent K, a replicant whose job is to retire the older replicants produced in the era of the original film. The newer replicants are OK still being used as slave workers.Agent K comes across some buried bones which again leads to an investigation into identity, false memories and the whereabouts of an impossible child, now grown up.Jared Leto plays the mad messianic Wallace, the man who has taken over the Tyrell corporation and produces replicants but wants to creates life. He thinks Agent K will find the answers and sends one of his replicants out to assist and hinder his mission.Harrison Ford returns as Deckard who hangs around in a desolate Las Vegas hotel with holographic images of Elvis and Frank Sinatra who might hold the clues to what happened to the child.Blade Runner 2049 is really an overlong art film, it actually lacks the thriller element of the original film even some of the weird humour. I rewatched the original Blade Runner before I saw the sequel, despite the po-faced narration his Deckard provides some humour.Blade Runner 2049 has a few cameos from the original film including an iconic recreation of a replicant which excellent use of CGI.However the pacing and length is a negative, the story is not strong enough to sustain it although I have to credit the writers to lead you up one way and them wrong foot the viewer.",Blade Runner 2049
7,claudio_carvalho,Shameful Use of the Characters from Philip K. Dick's Novel,1,30 December 2017,"The cult 1982 ""Blade Runner"" by Ridley Scott is a masterpiece and one of the best films ever made by the cinema industry. The hyped up ""Blade Runner 2049"" is an overrated garbage with a shallow storyline and shameful use of the characters from Philip K. Dick's novel. The slow pace and the weak direction make this flick boring and annoying, with excessive use of CGI trying to compensate the lack of substance. Philip K. Dick might be probably trembling in his grave. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Blade Runner 2049""",Blade Runner 2049
8,nogodnomasters,They named you. You must be special.,8,18 October 2017,"The film opens with a brief introduction. Old rebellious bio-engineered humans of enhanced strength (Replicants) are being hunted and killed by new bio-engineered humans like Ryan Gosling (AKA K) who would not have been my first casting choice. The world is almost destroyed as K searches for what appears to have been a child born (now about his age) to a Replicant. Harrison Ford enters the film 90 minutes into the production and PLOT SPOILER is not killed by his son. If you pay attention to the details, it has a rather clever twist.The only fact that I missed was the date of 6-10-21 was said to be a birth date and this was 30 years later. I did the math three times and it does not come out to 2049. Good sci-fi worth a view even if you didn't see the original.Guide: F-word. Nudity.",Blade Runner 2049
9,kosmasp,Slow and beautiful,9,10 March 2018,"I guess if the producers wanted to make another Blade Runner, they totally succeeded - at least so far. As with the original Blade Runner the visuals are the ones that people will refer to when it comes to this movie. And it's not just because of the Academy Awards. You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).Having said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.While it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it. If that sounds intriguing to you, with some added social commentary flavor, than by all means watch it. But beware that you have to have patience with it ...",Blade Runner 2049
10,Sleepin_Dragon,"Beautifully made, but shockingly slow.",5,29 January 2021,"I always make it a rule to only ever do a review once a show or film is ended. In this case, I started about forty minutes in, for one reason only, I was bored to tears.I love the original film, and although a film I thought never needed a follow up, but I was open to it, and thought the basic storyline in this film was pretty good, and imaginative.I'll start with the positives, it looks amazing, genuinely, the effects, sets and all aspects of the visuals are seriously impressive, that's the major strength, the acting is hard to fault, Gosling is always on point.The downer...... It's insanely boring, how on Earth did they allow this film to be so slow, you almost forgive the first hour, where literally nothing happens, you convince yourself that it's bound to open up and switch up several gears. It never really does though, it improves, but it seems to be on half speed for large spells.I struggled with the plot a bit, possibly because there isn't one.In summary, the window dressing is terrific, it looks sensational, incredibly well acted, the problem, it bored me to tears. 5/10.",Blade Runner 2049
11,classicsoncall,"""Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.""",9,31 March 2018,"Watching ""Blade Runner 2049"" makes me want to go back and see the original film again. In some ways I thought this was the better movie, and I know I'm probably causing a rumble with that statement. But there was a lot of nuance built into the story of the long out of action Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), and it's a credit to the writers and film makers that his identity as a human or a replicant was kept ambiguous for this story. My gut tells me he's human, but then again, if Rachael (Sean Young) was a replicant, then how does that work with the concept of a live birth as the central mystery of the story? So yes, many questions, very few answers.One thing is certain, if the movie hadn't gotten the Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual Effects, then they might as well have just hung up the award. The CGI was outstanding and some of the concepts that got play were stunning, as in the character of K's (Ryan Gosling) holographic girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas). That's not to say there weren't some inconsistencies in the story line. For example, K's status as a new line replicant designed to obey didn't exactly match up with his actions throughout the picture, and I wasn't persuaded that an eventual discovery of a replicant offspring would be all that catastrophic as advanced by Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). Taking things in stride, those matters didn't prove to be a big deal but they were somewhat distracting.So over all, I thought the film was masterfully done with exceptional cinematography and dazzling effects. I'd like to special mention those hologram images of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as being well done, but the Frank Sinatra sequence was a sure bet, as the song he was singing brought me all the way back to a 1948 picture called ""Road House"" with Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark. He could have been crooning about this film when he sang ""Make it one for my baby, and one more for the road"".",Blade Runner 2049
12,lee_eisenberg,humanity's possible fate,6,22 January 2018,"In 1982, Ridley Scott released ""Blade Runner"", based on Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". It had two focuses. One was the question of what makes us human, as the protagonist (Harrison Ford) starts to question his order to capture the renegade replicants. The other was the look at a dystopian future, as there's no connection to the natural world and the population gets bombarded by advertising everywhere.Now, ""Incendies"" and ""Arrival"" director Denis Villeneuve has released a sequel: ""Blade Runner 2049"". The sequel expands on the original's dystopian focus, as anyone with the economic means has departed the moribund planet. A new corporation has replaced the one from the original movie, and has continued making replicants. A new blade runner (Ryan Gosling) is the protagonist here, but there's more than meets the eye.The visuals are impressive. I guess that my complaint is that the plot takes a long time to get going, and a lot of the movie is shots of the protagonist's face to the tune of music. Even so, I'd say that the movie is worth seeing, if not as great as the original.",Blade Runner 2049
13,jboothmillard,Blade Runner 2049,7,19 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner is one of the finest films of the 1980s, so expectations were high when a sequel was being released 35 years later, I was certainly excited, produced by original director Sir Ridley Scott, directed by BAFTA nominated Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival). Basically in the 2049, bio-engineered humans called replicants are now part of society, working as servants and slaves, a newer replicant model named 'K' (Ryan Gosling) has been created to work for the LAPD as a ""blade runner"". K's job is to hunting down and ""retire"" older rogue model replicants, his home life is spent with his girlfriend, a holographic artificial intelligence product of Wallace Corporation, named Joi (Ana de Armas). K is investigating the growing replicant freedom movement, this leads him to a farm, there he retires rogue replicant Sapper Morton (Spectre's Dave Bautista), he also finds a small box buried under a tree. Forensic analysis reveals that the box contains the remains of a female replicant who died after complications from an emergency cesarean section, this is shocking as it was thought impossible for a female replicant to become pregnant. K's superior Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) believes that knowledge of a replicants that can reproduce would be dangerous and could lead to war, she orders that all evidence is destroyed and that K finds and kills the child. K is disturbed by his orders to kill a born individual, he visits the headquarters of Wallace Corporation founder Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), there the body is identified as experimental replicant Rachael (Sean Young), K also learns about Rachael's romantic ties with former veteran blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). Wallace believes that reproduction in replicants can expand his off-world operations, but he lacks this technology himself, so he sends his replicant enforcer Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) to steal Rachael's remains from LAPD headquarters and follow K to find Rachael's child. K returns to Morton's farm to destroy it, there he finds a hidden date, it matches one of his own childhood memories about hiding a toy horse, Joi insists this is coincidence, and evidence that K is in fact human. K searches the birth records for the date, he discovers that twins were born on that day with identical DNA, but one was a girl and one was a boy, only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined San Diego, but the relevant records have been stolen, he recognises the orphanage from his childhood and finds his hidden toy horse, this suggests his memories, which he thought were merely implants, may be real. K next visits memory designer Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri), she tells him it is illegal to program replicants with real human memories, K is lead to believe he is Rachael's son. When he returns to headquarters and fails a replicant behaviour test, K tells Joi that he failed because he completed his mission and killed the child, Joshi gives him 48 hours to disappear. K transfers Joi to a mobile emitter, but he risks erasing her if it is damaged, undeterred he has the toy horse analysed, traces of radiation found on it lead him to the ruins of Las Vegas. There he finds Rick Deckard in a deserted hotel and casino, Deckard explains that he stole the orphanage records to cover his tracks, and was forced to leave a pregnant Rachael behind. Luv and her men track K's location and arrive to kidnap Deckard, K is injured and left for dead, and Joi's emitter is destroyed, she is erased, the replicant freedom movement were also tracking, they rescue K. Movement leader Freysa (Hiam Abbass) tells K that he is wrong to think he has a unique role to fulfil in the movement, Rachael's surviving child is actually a girl, K deduces that Deckard's daughter is Stelline, as she is the only one capable of creating the memory and implanting it into him. Freysa urges K to prevent Wallace from uncovering the secrets of replicant reproduction, and killing Deckard, meanwhile in Los Angeles, Deckard is brought before Wallace, he suggests that Rachael's feelings for him were engineered by Tyrell to test the possibility of a replicant becoming pregnant. Deckard refuses to cooperate, so Wallace orders Luv to escort him off-world to be tortured for information, K intercepts them, he fights with and kills Luv, Deckard is rescued, the crash is staged as his death, to protect him from Wallace and the replicants. In the end, K takes Deckard to see Stelline, he laments that his best memories belong to her, K succumbs to his wounds and lies dying in the snow, while Deckard enters Stelline's office cautiously to approach his long lost daughter. Also starring Mackenzie Davis as Mariette, Lennie James as Mister Cotton, Barkhad Abdi as Doc Badger, David Dastmalchian as Coco, Edward James Olmos as Gaff and Mark Arnold as Interviewer. Gosling gives a great performance as the almost emotionless new blade runner bot investigating and finding out about himself, it takes a long while for Ford to come on, but once he does he is great, and there is good support from the likes of Wright and Leto. This is definitely a spectacle for the eyes, seeing on a massive IMAX screen in 3D definitely helped, I will admit it is very long, 15 minutes short of 3 hours, with some slow scenes, but at the same time, the film is good as taking it's time, the special effects to create the technological beings and cityscapes are brilliant, the story is interesting, and there are some gripping and intriguing scenes, overall it is a satisfying science-fiction thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Production Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Best Production Design, Original Music for Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, Best Sound, Best Editing and Best Make Up/Hair.

14,Tweekums,A visually stunning return to the world of Blade Runners and replicants,9,27 March 2019,"Thirty years after the events portrayed in the original film Blade Runners are still hunting down rogue replicants; this time Nexus 8 models who have no expiry date. Newer models are considered safer as they must obey orders. One such newer model is 'K', a blade runner whose existence is thrown into turmoil after bones are found at the home of a Nexus 8 he 'retired'. They show evidence of something thought impossible; something that if made public could undermine the peace between humanity and replicants. He is tasked with ensuring that the most important evidence of what happened is destroyed... in the process he learns more about himself and eventually meets Deckard. He isn't the only person searching; the Wallace Corporation, successors to Tyrell are searching too.I've kept my plot synopsis as vague as possible to avoid any potential spoilers even though some of the main revelations come early in the film. The story is enjoyable; I liked how it added to the original without being more of the same. For the most part the characters are new and interesting as are the advances in technology. Ryan Gosling impressed as K; it was interesting to have a lead character who was undeniable a replicant but still had a degree of mystery about him. It was great seeing Harrison Ford return as Deckard even if the character isn't in the film for as long as one might expect; there was also a fun cameo from Edward James Olmos as Gaff. Of the other characters the three most interesting were all women; Ana de Armas, who delighted as K's holographic girlfriend Joi; Sylvia Hoeks; who was impressive as Luv, an enforcer for the Wallace Corporation and Robin Wright who is solid as K's superior Lt. Joshi. As well as being interesting the film is visually stunning with fantastic special effects and a very impressive design. The film isn't perfect of course; some scenes go on a bit too long meaning the film is quite a bit longer than it really needs to be... still I was really impressed overall and would definitely recommend it to fans of the original.",Blade Runner 2049

Good plot with some great twists and turns. Some clever manipulation of the viewer too, as you are funneled down one way of thinking, only to have things turn out in another direction. This unpredictability, and requirement that you use your brain, makes for some intriguing viewing.Great special effects, without being too show-offy and gratuitous. Great action scenes too.While I have seen the original Blade Runner (in all three forms), you don't have to have seen it in order to enjoy, or even understand, this one. It works fine as a standalone movie.Solid performances by all involved.On the negative side, the plot is not entirely water-tight. There are a few key moments where things take a turn for the implausible and contrived. The end result ultimately justified these turns, making me less critical of them, but the writers could easily have developed the plot around those moments more, in order to make them less loose and clumsy.Though I thought it was going to be, the running time of 163 minutes is not an issue. The movie never drags and the time just flies by. Great movie - certainly not your average sequel.",Blade Runner 2049

Though this sort of ""Inside Baseball"" cinematic warfare has resulted in a fairly schizophrenic film, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is still chock full of the sort of prophetic Portents of Real Life Doom comfortably familiar to all of We True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label Citizens. Many of BLADE RUNNER 2049's trademark Warner Bros. warnings could be ripped from Today's Headlines. In fact, on the day that I saw 2049 (Monday, October 9, 2017) Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin's U.S. Environmental Pollution Agency Czar, Scott ""Just Ruin It"" Pruitt, condemned 375,000 of our Asthmatic Fellow Americans to Excruciating Early Deaths by giving Big Coal a Carte Blanche to turn our once ""Beautiful, for Spacious Skies"" totally Black, just as they are pictured throughout Warner's half of this flick. Sony's 50% of BLADE RUNNER is full of crass product placement and corrupt job-killing automation, in keeping with their Mission--as the official Propaganda Arm of the Japanese Government--to destroy all the American Values that they can.It will go without saying for many if not most Americans that Sony is closely allied with Putin's Stevie Repug Party, aka the GOOPERs, led by Steve Bannon and the late Steve Paddock (commonly referred to as the Deplorable Machinegun Cult). Certified, card-carrying Satanists in Real Life, these murderous miscreants are referred to by Warner as ""Replicants"" during BLADE RUNNER 2049. This is done to distinguish these Groupthinking Automatons from We Flesh and Blood Human Beings. The soul-less Replicants rule over LA LA LAND, as actor Ryan Gosling frequently manages to remind us by plunking various derelict pianos. The climax of Warner's Las Vegas half of BLADE RUNNER 2049 involves high-rise windows being shot out, no doubt Warner's way of alerting Real Life Sin City Concert Goers to Beware of Repug Replicant Steve Paddock. Unfortunately, Sony's team of deplorable Fifth Columnist Traitors spilled the beans of this mass market caution to Replicant Shooter Paddock, who moved up his hotel reservations for Another Day of Infamy. Those familiar with that Ancient Greek Oracle Cassandra might call this turn of events Deja Vu All Over Again, but if you're Warner Bros., what more can you do?",Blade Runner 2049
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"30 years later, aged like fine wine",10,9 October 2017,"LAPD officer K(Gosling, cynical on the surface) investigates an unusual case. No, sorry, that's all you're getting for plot. If you see someone getting into a lot of detail, avert your eyes. Go into this as blind as Niander(Leto, driven by his cause). Thank me later.This is 2 hours and 33 minutes long, which is not excessive considering how it uses its time. The pacing allows some scenes to go on for a while, however, it's always appropriate. Major props to whoever thought Denis Villeneuve would be right for this. He couldn't be more perfectly chosen. His use of symbolism, exploration of philosophy and compelling themes fit as a companion to the film Ridley Scott created, without merely redoing it(the hints are neat, if perhaps a tad too numerous). This expands upon the issues about Replicants in truly inspired ways(albeit I acknowledge that not all of them were thought up purely for this movie). The acting is sublime. If Joi(Armas, expressing so much with so much forced restraint, for reasons I won't reveal) doesn't break your heart, get an EKG stat, it's stopped beating already. This is not driven by action, rather, the gripping mystery.There is some bloody, even brutal, violence, nudity and disturbing material in this, used well. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys speculative sci-fi. 10/10",Blade Runner 2049

Superior and epic sequel to the sci-fi noir classic Blade Runner set 30 years after the original with rookie future cop Gosling (well-played in stoic low-key turn) who is tasked to find the hybrid offspring of a replicant and a human in the fear of a new spawn of mankind being overtaken in the process in the ever-raining post-apocalyptic dystopia of Los Angeles and discovering that things are not as they appear to be. Ford reprises his ever-disgruntled Rick Deckard providing some insight to the journey into fear with a still-waters-run-deep performance of genuine pathos and poignancy. A superlative screenplay by Michael Green and original scribe Hampton Fancher interweave a tapestry of genuine dread and ultimate redemption while gleaning touchstones from the source of Ridley Scott's (who executive produced) masterpiece and a largely female ensemble cast to keep things lively including avatar Joie (ethereal de Armas); linchpin memory scientist Juri and icily scary android with a touch of homicidal loyalty Hoeks. Director Denis Villeneuve's Herculean task to appease the purists and evoke a new audience dovetails splendidly with some truly stunning visuals (a must to see in IMAX), a Vengelisean score by veteran composer/genius Hans Zimmer and Banjamin Wallfisch and gorgeous cinematography by ace dp Roger Deakins.

21,evanston_dad,Slogging Our Way Through a Dystopian Future,4,6 December 2017,"I felt the same way about ""Blade Runner 2049"" as I did Ridley Scott's 1982 original: it's slow, ponderous, and portentous.The dystopia has been ratcheted up a notch in this sequel set just around the corner. My office can't even figure out how to get video conferencing to work consistently, but we're supposed to have flying cars by 2049? We'd better hustle.Denis Villeneuve directs at a funereal pace to give us one long, sustained note of sci-fi gloominess. This is the kind of film in which characters don't speak lines, they recite maxims. Where scenes begin with some mad genius monologuing in an attempt to imbue what really should just be a pulpy noir with philosophical import. Every single frame of this film is calculated to make its audience feel like there's more significance than there actually is, and it's too self- consciously aware of its own effects, as if you can hear someone off-camera saying, ""ooohhh, look what our visual effects team has done here."" All of the actors have been asked to make their faces as blank as possible and speak in emotionless monotones, as if Villeneuve is daring them to have fun. All of these things were wrong with the original film as well, but instead of learning from the mistakes of the past, Villeneuve has set out to reproduce them. He's done too good a job.Grade: C-",Blade Runner 2049
22,AlsExGal,Visually striking existential science fiction mystery,9,12 September 2020,"Warner Brothers, Alcon Entertainment, Columbia Pictures, and director Denis Villeneuve team up to make this one. . It's 30 years after the events of the first film, as we follow ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) a ""blade runner"" for the LAPD. Blade runners are tasked with tracking down and ""retiring"" (killing) renegade replicants (artificially created humans with enhanced strength). The biggest change is that K himself is a replicant, one of a new type designed by brilliant recluse and ultra-powerful tycoon Wallace (Jared Leto). During his latest assignment, K stumbles upon a mystery that may change the lives of humanity and all replicants, alike.Harrison Ford was featured prominently in all of the advertising for this, for good reason, but his role is very minor, almost an extended cameo, and not even appearing onscreen until 105 minutes in. Gosling is most definitely the lead, thankfully in my opinion, as I'd rather they go at the material from a different angle than simply attempting a rehash with fancier special effects. After watching the film, I'm not surprised that it flopped. It's long (over 2 and a half hours), it's slow by Hollywood movie standards, it's frequently quiet, and it's very deliberate, introspective, philosophical on an existential level, and filled with dozens of small details in the periphery of the screen that allude more than explain. I'm happy to see that the writers decided to make this a future carried over from the first film, rather than making it a future to our present time. That may sound confusing, but what I mean is that there are visual references to a still-existing Soviet regime, and there is little of the mobile device fascination endemic to most modern sci-fi. The character played by Ana de Armas, a sort of ""virtual girlfriend"" comprised of a hologram projector and an AI, is the closest to that, but it's well handled, and helps deliver a good emotional punch or two late in the game.I was impressed with Sylvia Hoeks, an actress I'm unfamiliar with, as the film's main ""bad guy"", a severe replicant corporate type with a violent streak. Small turns by Dave Bautista and Carka Juri are also good, and while I liked Jared Leto's interesting off kilter characterization, it seemed under-utilized. The only one who I had a problem with was Robin Wright, who I normally like, but here something was off. I blame some of her dialogue. The film looks fantastic, with numerous different visual palettes and textures. The only thing that keeps this from being a full-fledged masterpiece in my opinion is a lack of closure on a few story points that seem like they may have been intentionally left dangling for possible future sequels, the likelihood of which are very slim at this point.",Blade Runner 2049
23,ferguson-6,"Say it ain't so, Joe",8,4 October 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ridley Scott's original film was released in 1982 and based in 2019. The highly anticipated sequel from Denis Villenueve is being released in 2017 and based in 2049. So we have 35 years between films, and 30 years between story settings. Expect that to be the most complicated part of this review since we were mandated by the studio to follow many rules – write this, don't write that. Such rules would normally be frowned upon (and even ignored by many), but in fact, this film does such a masterful job of paying homage to the first, while enhancing the characters and story, that we are eager for every viewer to experience it with fresh eyes and clear mind ... no matter how tempting it is to talk about!Obviously, the massive fan base that has grown over the years (the original was not an initial box office hit) will be filling the theatres the first weekend – even those who are ambivalent towards, or adamantly against, the idea of a sequel. The big question was whether screenwriters Hampton Fancher (maybe every writer should begin as a flamenco dancer) and Michael Green would be able to create a script that would attract new viewers while honoring the original film and source Philip K Dick novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" The answer is not only a resounding yes, but it's likely even those who usually shy away from science-fiction may find themselves thoroughly enjoying the nearly 2 hours and 43 minute run time (it doesn't seem too long).The cast is deep and perfectly matched, and there are even a few surprises (no spoilers here). Ryan Gosling is fun to watch as the reserved K, an expert Blade Runner who tracks and ""retires"" old model replicants – the Nexus 8's have been replaced by the more- controllable Nexus 9's. An early sequence has K in combat mode against a protein farmer named Morton (played by the massive Dave Bautista). With all that is going on in these few scenes, director Villenueve is training us to lock in and pay attention, lest we miss the key to the rest of the movie and K's motivation for most everything he does from this point on. Robin Wright plays K's icy Lieutenant Joshi, who administers ""baseline"" tests to him after every successful mission – just to make certain he is still under her control.Jared Leto delivers an understated and mesmerizing performance as the God-like Wallace who not only managed to solve global hunger, but also is a genetic engineer creating new beings. Somehow, this is one of Leto's most normal roles (which makes quite a statement about his career) and yet his character is so intriguing, it could warrant a spin-off standalone film. Wallace's trusted assistant is the ruthless bulldog mis-named Luv, played by Sylvia Hoeks. Her scene with Robin Wright is one of the best on screen female duels we've seen in awhile. One of the more unusual characters (and that's saying a lot) is Joi (Ana de Armas), the Artificial Intelligence/hologram companion to K, whose presence is cued by Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf notes. Other support work to notice comes in brief but crucial roles by Hiam Abbas, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Barkhad Abdi and Lennie James. Who is not listed above? Of course it's Harrison Ford (as seen in the trailer), who reprises his Deckard role from the original. All these years later, he's a grizzled recluse who doesn't take kindly to home visitations. Mr. Ford offers up proof that he still possesses the acting ability that made him a movie star (even if his best piloting days have passed him by). It's such a thrill to see him flash the screen presence that's been missing for many years. And yes, fans of the first film will mourn the absence of the great Rutger Hauer, yet there is no need to dwell on one of the few negatives.The story leans heavily on philosophical and metaphysical questions  just like every great sci-fi film. What makes us human, or better yet, is there a difference between humans and machines that can think and feel? Can memories be trusted, or can they be implanted or influenced over time? These are some of the post-movie discussion points, which are surely to also include the cutting edge cinematography and use of lighting from the always-great Roger Deakins, and the production design from Dennis Gassner that somehow fits the tone, mood and texture of both the first film and this sequel. The set pieces are stunning and sometimes indistinguishable from the visual effects – a rarity these days. My theatre did feature the ""shaky seats"" that work in conjunction with the sound design  a gimmick I found distracting and more in line with what kids might find appealing.There was some unwelcome drama a couple of months ago as noted composer Johann Johannsson dropped out and was replaced with Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. The resulting score complements the film without mimicking the original. Ridley Scott, who directed the original BLADE RUNNER (and its numerous versions over the years), was involved as Executive Producer, and to put things in perspective, the first film was released the same year as TOOTSIE and TRON. Denis Villenueve was Oscar nominated for directing ARRIVAL, and he has proved himself to be a superb and dependable filmmaker with SICARIO, PRISONERS, and INCENDIES. He deserves recognition and respect for his nods to the original (Pan Am, Atari) and ability to mold a sequel that stands on its own  and in my opinion, is better than the first. Hopefully stating that is not against the Warner Bros rules.",Blade Runner 2049
24,trashgang,top notch,9,13 July 2019,"Okay, it took 2 years before I watched this flick. Reason was simple, I had to be in the mood to watch and and do have some time because almost clocking in way over 2 hours it's a hard one to watch because seen the original I did know that it was not going to be a simple one to view.I can be very simple about it, Denis Villeneuve directed it and have seen Arrival (2016) I knew that this was going to be good, was I wrong, it was utterly sublime. The way it was shot, the score used by French band M83, the editing, the acting, it was all well done. If you are into cinematography then it's a must see. Some did even stated it a masterpiece, maybe that's true, because it never bored me one second. Even as it is very slow and sometimes a bit hard to understand.Even Batista shows that he has acting skills, even Harrison Ford is top notch, not that I ever doubted that but to pick it all up after all those years.Again, it shows that Ryan Gosling is a hell of an actor, and that you don't have to go for blockbusters to see a great movie.

25,mm-39,Much better than the predecessor!,8,11 October 2017,"Much better than the predecessor! I remember in 82 seeing the original Blade Runner which had mixed reviews. Years later, Blade Runner became a cult classic. The original Blade Runner is a better movie after several viewings, because Blade Runner is a multi- layered story. So many layers of stories I had to write a paper on the 82 Blade Runner for my university course. The 82 Blade Runner's many layers created many questions which 2049 tries to answer. Artificial intelligence, memories, self awareness, are topics breached. What worked the background, sets, lighting with the themes of a over populated multi racial future L A of a decaying over stretched, and stressed environment honors the concepts of the original film. The supporting characters back the environment of a world on the brink. (Robin Wright) Lieutenant Joshi wanted to stop a replicate revolt. (Jared Leto) Niander Wallace creating a society which survives on replicate slave labor. The protagonist Ryan Gosling, k character, creates a better version of the Harrison Ford Decker Blade Runner character. The lonely life K, only companion is an artificial computer companion. The computer companion creates more questions of self awareness with artificial intelligence. The K character who is a slave to genetic programming forces K to go on a detective story. A compelling detective story which several layers unravel each segment at a time. Regrettably, 2049's ending creates even more questions then answers. Is Decker a replicant? Was Decker a plant?

26,deloudelouvain,It could be our future.,7,23 January 2018,"When the original Blade Runner came out in 1982 the movie was something totally refreshing. A vision of the future with a lot of very good visual effects for that time. Now 35 years later Blader Runner 2049 is also full of visual effects, a look at the future like I could imagine it. The original was better because it was a new thing but this one is certainly not bad. Harrison Ford does not have the leading role this time, but the least you can say is that he ages well. He has a much smaller part but he still got it. Ryan Gosling is this time the leading character and he did a good job. The story is good, just a bit too long at my taste. I prefer 90 minute movies than those long movies. But it's never boring and that's already something with a long movie. If you like a good science fiction movie you probably will like this one as well. Ridley Scott did it again.",Blade Runner 2049
27,Mr-Fusion,A worthy entry indeed,8,31 October 2017,"I guess the big question here is, ""Does Blade Runner 2049 live up to the massive hype?"" Yeah, it does. In more ways than one. More important than the question of why this exists in the first place are those of a more specific nature: the whereabouts of Rick Deckard, and what happened to Rachael? And part of the reason why I love this movie is because it very purposefully answers those questions. The other reason is that it isn't short on mood and atmosphere, something the first movie is explicitly known for. This is a another nightmarish futurescape; the environment's haywire, humanity scrapes out a living, and it's usually just ghastly. Yet it's stylish enough get sucked in and admire the visuals. Ignore the orange-and-teal action movie of the marketing campaign; this is every bit a methodical Blade Runner film. And that running time is justified; the pacing is perfect for this story. It's well-constructed and surprisingly thoughtful. As acting goes, the cast is ideal (even Jared Leto), and you've gotta hand it to Robin Wright for making the most of a thankless role. But Harrison Ford is in another league entirely. You can feel the character's bitterness and resentment, and I think it's some of the best work in his later years.If I have one gripe, it's the music. You can easily tell where Hans Zimmer comes in, and it feels like a sledgehammer taken to the soundscape they were trying to create. But I'll take it. I've seen this movie twice in the last week, and I'd like to do it again. Even with the callbacks, this rises above fan service. Factoring in the bit parts with characters from the first movie (pleasant surprises), they really went out of their way to address what happened in 2019 while creating a brand new 2049. It's a great movie.8/10",Blade Runner 2049
28,siderite,A really good sequel,9,5 November 2017,"In order to judge a film, you compare the direction, the acting, the story and the production values to similar movies from the same category. How nice that we have just such movie in the original Blade Runner. On each of the above metrics, this is a much better film.One of the few things that Blade Runner had better than the sequel is the supporting characters. As Deckard goes around following replicants and growing as a character, so do the replicants themselves. In the sequel, Ryan Gosling does an amazing job, but the focus is mostly on him and very little on the other characters. That's not to subtract from Ana de Armas' acting, which proves (again?) that she is the perfect woman in every respect. And if the original film had to invent the visuals and even explored the world a bit, 2049 does little to improve on that, even takes some away (only a few scenes have more people and vehicles at the same time, the rest being ridiculously empty for something that should happen in the future, for example).Acting is great, direction is great, the visuals are impressive - and this is one of the few movies I believe are worth going for in the cinema or at least having a nice sound system at home when you watch it - the story is both intriguing and well paced, the sound and mood are perfect.Perhaps the villains are the ones that are the least interesting; they almost hurt the movie. I can't explain it without spoiling too much, but at some time there are two factions that kind of want the same thing, but act like bitter enemies. There is a scene where Edward James Olmos is brought in for nothing other than nostalgia and Dave Bautista may not be the greatest actor in the world, but what was he doing in just a few scenes? Did he ask to be put in the film because he loved Blade Runner? And Jared Leto... I believe he terrorized his mates with this method acting a lot more than he actually acted on screen!Bottom line: I think it is important to watch the first Blade Runner before you watch this. Don't even rely on memory, just rewatch the original first, then see this one. An almost perfect film that makes you feel something other than ear pain from explosion sounds. Plus it has a sexy scene with Ana de Armas and Mackenzie Davis overlapping. That's got to be worth going to watch the movie in full 3D!",Blade Runner 2049
29,namashi_1,A Visual Marvel!,6,6 October 2017,"A sequel to the cult-classic Blade Runner, 'Blade Runner 2049' is A Visual Marvel, that is a feast for the eyes. No Kidding, This Neo-Noir Sci-Fi Flick reminds us the power of visuals in celluloid & takes you in the future with finesse. Not a single frame falters, in fact, as this visual poetry progresses, the presentation gets deeper & deeper.However, Master Director Denis Villeneuve doesn't succeed entirely. Reason? Hampton Fancher and Michael Green's Erratic & Overlong Screenplay. Sure, the world of 'Blade Runner 2049' requires time, so one can absorb it, but was there a need to drag the film for nearly 3 hours (163-minutes, to be precise), Nope! Despite some terrific sequences & an intense atmosphere, the Writing lags at many a times & takes away a good bit of 'Blade Runner 2049'. While Visually Stunningly & Magnificently Shot by Cinematography God Roger Deakins, this Epic tale needed a crisper & more consistent, Screenplay.'Blade Runner 2049' Synopsis: A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.'Blade Runner 2049' is a tale on humanity, survival, violence & sacrifice. The world here is mix of futuristic dynamo, to utter ruin of waste lands (Mad Max: Fury Road, anyone?), contrasting the effects of human choices & the bleakness of the future, that remains in our bare hands. We follow K, the Protagonist (Ryan Gosling) in this bleak & violent journey, where rogues are hunted down and killed, where the cops hold power until they also are massacred & ruthless leaders who manufacturer rogues with sinister motives. Its all too much to swallow & while some of it went above my head, most of it caught my attention & the visual scenery spoke much more, than most of the dialogue. The first-hour beautifully builds up, offering some sharp action combat sequences & introducing its characters gradually. There is a sense of impending doom, covered in gorgeousness & its all visually poetic. BUT, the second-hour goes for a toss. Overlong & Erratic, the second-hour suffers on length & solid substance. And while there is a pleasure in watching Blade Runner Veteran Harrison Ford reprise his popular role, the film overstays its welcome. The narrative needed to be Written better, given the team that this film is blessed with, on and off camera & also, some editing, by at least 25-minutes. Had that been the case, 'Blade Runner 2049' would've been 2017's very own Masterpiece!And before I acknowledge all the talent here, I must start with the Star of the Show - Roger Deakins. The Cinematographer outshines himself here & leaves you mesmerized. 'Blade Runner 2049' is among the most well-shot films of recent & Deakins' Genius with the Camera, is something to be experienced. Despite the flaws, I would recommend every Cinephile out there to watch 'Blade Runner 2049' for its Cinematography. You'll be reminded, just like how I was, that being, how each & every frame can turn into Visual Mastery. The Academy has to honor Deakins next year, or else, they ain't doing any good!Denis Villeneuve is in great form, yet again. The Master Director has directed this Magnum-Opus with a vision that is easy to envy as well as to inspire. How I wish the Writing supported Villeneuve & Deakins, as their work here is nothing short of astonishing. Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch's Score is fantastic. Art & Costume Design define perfection. Graphics are incredible; among the best I've seen in recent times. Make-Up, also, is very-well done. Performance-Wise: Ryan Gosling as K, makes for an interesting hero. But there are no surprises in Gosling's turn here, its regular Gosling. And that can be underwhelming since his last release was La La Land. Harrison Ford returns as Rick Deckard & adds the much needed punch to the proceedings. Jared Leto as Niander Wallace, the antagonist, is creepy to the core. Leto emerges as a scene-stealer here, despite the fact that he only appears in a cameo. Ana de Armas as Joi, Gosling's holographic companion, is effective. Sylvia Hoeks as the villainous Luv, is exquisite. She stands out! Robin Wright as Lt. Joshi, is first-rate, as usual. Others lend great support.On the whole, 'Blade Runner 2049' is visually empowering, but not as strong as a whole. Its definitely worth a watch, but it doesn't really surpass the expectations.",Blade Runner 2049
30,Hellmant,"A fitting tribute to the cult classic original, but just a tad overrated though.",9,6 October 2017,"'BLADE RUNNER 2049': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sequel (35-years later) to the 1982 neo-noir sci-fi classic 'BLADE RUNNER'; which was based on the short story 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', by Philip K. Dick. This film takes place 30-years after the original, and it revolves around a new Blade Runner, who discovers a long hidden secret which threatens their future society's way of life. He must seek out a retired Blade Runner (Harrison Ford, reprising his role from the original film), who's been missing for 30-years, in order to stop this new threat. This new chapter stars Ryan Gosling, Ford, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Dave Bautista and Jared Leto. Sean Young and Edward James Olmos also have cameos in the movie, reprising their roles from the original film as well. It was directed by Denis Villeneuve (who's also helmed such critically acclaimed hits as 2013's 'PRISONERS', 2015's 'SICARIO', and 2016's 'ARRIVAL'), and it was scripted by Hampton Fancher (who also wrote the original) and Michael Green (who also co-wrote 'ALIEN: COVENANT' and 'LOGAN', from earlier this year). Scott Free Productions (ran by the original film's director, Ridley Scott) co-produced the movie. It's received rave reviews from critics (unlike the original, which was snubbed by critics when it first came out) and it's expected to be a big hit at the Box Office as well (also unlike the original, which bombed in theaters when it was released too). Some are calling it one of the best sequels ever, and one of the best films this year. I think it was really well made, and a fitting tribute to the cult classic original, but I also think it's just a little overrated too. In the year 2049, new 'replicants' are obedient, and they serve humanity well. The old 'replicants' (from the first movie) are still rebelling against society, and they're also still being hunted down by 'Blade Runners'. While executing one 'replicant', LAPD 'Blade Runner' Officer K (Gosling) discovers a long hidden secret, that threatens their new society's way off life. He's tasked with stopping this new threat, and in order to do so he must also locate a retired 'Blade Runner', named Rick Deckard (Ford), who's been missing for 30-years. The movie is beautifully shot, and masterfully directed. It's amazing how well Villeneuve recreates the original film's feel and style (I doubt even Ridley Scott himself could have done a better job). It's also filled with decent performances; especially Ford (reprising one of his most popular roles) and Hoeks (who makes a great cold hearted villain in it). I can definitely understand why the critics are raving about it, and it does feel like a classic sci-fi movie, but it's also extremely slow-paced; and at 2 hours and 43 minutes, it's somewhat painful to sit all the way through (in one sitting). Still, the first movie is equally slow-paced (although not nearly as long), and I know multiple people that hate the original for that reason. I think those people will also dislike this sequel, for the exact same reason. Fans of the original will all (most likely) like it though. I think it's almost as good as the 1982 classic, but not quite.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/eoAny_TuUM4",Blade Runner 2049
31,cherold,"everything Blade Runner did right, done wrong",4,29 August 2019,"Imagine Blade Runner without a strong directorial vision, and interesting story, or engaging characters. If you find that impossible to imagine, just watch the forgettable sci-fi flick Blade Runner 2049.Instead of the distinct '40s-noir of the original, 2049 offers scale without purpose and a dusty color palette. Instead of riveting, distinct, excellently-acted characters, you've got sturdy but unforgettable people. Blade Runner was full of amazing moments and places, such as the room of living toys and Rutger Hauer's every word, but 2049 has nothing but a bland lead and a bunch of characters whose motives can't be looked at too closely.Scenes come not out of the story but out of a desire to have something happened, resulting in pointless interactions like the tormenting of a naked replicant. There aren't so much huge plot holes as poor motivations and small inconsistencies that make everything in the movie feel false.If you don't compare this to Blade Runner, it's a mediocre but almost-watchable movie with the occasional interesting idea (the talking, naked ad, the memory designer's creation of a birthday party), but as a sequel to a classic, this movie is a travesty.And how is it that a futuristic L.A. heavily influenced by Japanese culture has no Asians in the entire city? It's as though there's no detail so big or small that the filmmakers won't ignore it.",Blade Runner 2049
32,FeastMode,my notes,6,24 July 2019,"This is a mild 6 star, i was not a big fan of this movie. there is a lot of good in it, headlined by stunning cinematography and beautifully-shot scenes throughout the movie. the acting was great, the sci-fi concepts were awesome. so many cool new things. lots of cool concepts that make you think. i saw it in a real IMAX with the entire movie expanded to 1.9:1 aspect ratio, and an amazing sound system, and it was a phenomenal theater experience.i was really into it for a while, but the movie is really long and somewhat boring in a few places. i would have liked it to be at least 40 minutes shorter. and the story was interesting but unsatisfying.

SPOILERS
i was very unsatisfied when the movie ended. i was tempted to give it a 2.5 just based on that feeling but i didn't want to ignore all the stuff i liked. i feel like rather than coming to a conclusion, it just kind of ended. this is the reason i frequently dislike old movies and most novels. i was wondering about so many different story points that didn't really play out, wondering what they really had to do with the movie, like jared leto's character. i really liked him, but would the movie be much different if you removed him and his ideals. i don't really know what the point of the story was. just to find out about the baby? i dunno, that should be part of a bigger and more interesting story.",Blade Runner 2049
33,Lejink,Deckard's Midnight Runners,7,16 December 2019,"Looking back at an old review of mine for ""Blade Runner"", certainly one of the highest rated films here, I can see I wasn't quite convinced by it. Thinking it may have been more me than the movie, taking the chance to watch this much belated but certainly much anticipated follow-up, I determined to take my time with it, pretty essential considering its 163 minute length, and really try to digest and appreciate it.I must admit I found the plotting a little difficult to follow, but just about got there in the end. Ryan Gosling is in the lead part as K a replicant hunter working for his unforgiving boss Robin Wright, who starts to suspect that he himself is a replicant born of a replicant mother, with its wider implications for any humans v replicants conflict in the future.It's not long before the trail leads him to Harrison Ford's Agent Deckard, the suspected father of the lost child and therefore maybe his own father, but both hunters are themselves being hunted by a murderous female assassin, inappropriately named Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), employed by the villainous Wallace Corporation whose blind, in more ways than one, leader has his own agenda as regards the preservation of the status quo in society.There's not a lot of dialogue in the film and what there is, tends more to the monosyllabic, which gives the viewer time to take in the excellent sets, including a massive space-junkyard, the slumdog shantytown populated by child-slaves and the once-upon-a-time luxurious Las Vegas hotel where Deckard is now holed up. The special effects are also impressive ranging from the large-scale, like when K's space-mobile crashes, to the small-scale holographic visuals when K's holographic girl-friend is superimposed onto a real prostitute for a love-making scene, the recreation of Sean Young's Rachael character from the original film and even the Frank and Elvis images which return to their old Vegas stamping-ground to entertain Deckard in his solitude. There are also two effective death scenes, one short and very much to the point, the other extended and climactic under crashing waves.I couldn't fault the acting either. Gosling, Wright, Hoeks and Ford's characters are all different shades of humourless, world-weary, intensity in this bleak afterworld but each personalises their performance into effective dare I say human individuals. There's also a suitably moody electronic soundtrack adding atmospheric weight and even a nod to Vangelis's original soundtrack at the end.Ridley Scott, the director of the first ""Runner"" and who executive-produced 2049, felt the final cut here could have lost half an hour which might have helped the movie's disappointing box-office but I'm glad we got to see new director Villeneuve's grand if dark vision of how this particular story should play out.If there is to be a third entry in the series, let's hope it doesn't take another 36 years to materialise otherwise it will have to be a holograph of me who reviews it!",Blade Runner 2049
34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Perhaps more traditional than its predecessor, but still packs a uniquely powerful punch; truly thoughtful filmmaking.",8,6 October 2017,"'Blade Runner 2049 (2017)' is certainly a little more traditional than its predecessor, even if it likes to pretend that it isn't. However, that by no means implies that it's your typical blockbuster fare considering that it is still a slowly yet confidently paced piece that presents its intriguing ideas (all of which are extensions to those found within the first film) with a calmly self-assured intelligence that trusts its audience to be thinking throughout. The world isn't quite as tangible, though, since it mostly replaces the bustling, grimy street-level sets with sweeping shots of seemingly lonely cities bathed in neon, and the plot isn't as tight, either, feeling as though it meanders a little bit and could've done with perhaps some tightening in a couple of key places. Still, the feature is fantastic to look at and beautifully assembled, to boot. It's entertaining and will almost certainly move you on some level. In the end, the movie is a respectful extension to 'Blade Runner (1982)' that expands on the themes and ideals which made that flick so memorable in the first place. In fact, it's arguably even better than that landmark film. 8/10.",Blade Runner 2049
35,bowmanblue,"Good, but could do with a trim",7,7 October 2017,"Despite my love of epic sci-fi, Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford and general futuristic shenanigans, I am possible the one geek out there who never really 'got' 'Bladerunner. I've watched it numerous times over the years, every time hoping I'd see it for the 'masterpiece' that everyone else seems to. The weird thing about my interaction with Bladerunner is that as soon as the credits roll, I forget everything I've seen. About the only two things I can remember are something about a man questioning a robot about a turtle and Rutger Hauer snapping fingers towards the end of the movie. Therefore, when I sat down for the (long awaited) sequel 'Bladerunner 2049' my hopes were hardly high. It's now nearly a day since I've watched it and, although I wouldn't call it the greatest film I've ever seen, at least I can pretty much recall everything the average cinema goer does about a film they've just watched – so at least that's an improvement on the original (from my point of view!).The first film is set in the future where human-shaped robots (known as 'replicants') live among the human population. Harrison Ford was the cop in charge of bringing in any replicants who go AWOL. This time round in 2049 we have a similar set-up, this time with Ryan Gosling taking over the role of the cop chasing down rogue replicants. Now, he's a good choice for the serious tone of the lead. Just because the original was filmed in the eighties where action movies were a little more over the top and tongue in cheek, doesn't mean either 'Bladerunner' film is anything other than completely serious. And, I should say now that neither should really be considered an 'action' movie. If you're looking for wall-to-wall shoot outs and car chases, you won't find them in 'Bladerunner world.' I suppose as much as I enjoyed Gosling's performance in the lead, I was (and am) always a Harrison Ford fan. Now, he came back in a big role in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' and I keep hearing rumours of a fifth 'Indiana Jones' movie. So, I hope I'm not spoiling this film for anyone when I say that, despite Ford being featured heavily in the marketing, the overall film is kind of 'Ford-lite.' This is Gosling's film and, to be fair, he does it well. But, I'm being a bit negative. The film was actually pretty good – it's strength lying in its atmosphere. You really do get a feel of what the world is like here. The long (reasonably non CGI!) establishing shots, combined with the haunting musical score bring a sense of gravitas to the film that few others have. I can see this becoming a bit of a cult masterpiece of the future, simply by how it looks and in relation to its score alone.However, as atmospheric is as this film is and, despite that being a bonus, it's also the film's undoing. The film stands at quite a lengthy two hours, forty-three minutes and much of that is spent watching long, lingering establishing shots of various desolate landscapes. Basically, I'd probably end up editing about ten seconds out of every scene and bring down the overall running time by about twenty minutes (it would help – my opinion!). Yet, as much as the slow pacing of some of the scenes did drag for me, ultimately the film didn't seem the full run time (probably felt more like around the two hour mark). So, I guess that means that I actually enjoyed this one more than the first (rare for a sequel, I know). Due to its length I probably wouldn't watch '2049' again for a while, but I definitely think I'd watch it again as it's left more of an impression on my than its predecessor. Yes, I'd have liked more Ford (and possibly more Jared Leto, too – also underused!), but you can't have it all. In a world of sub-standard sequels it does seem that this one was actually worth the wait.",Blade Runner 2049
36,dromasca,more than a sequel,9,10 March 2018,"If you have not seen 'Blade Runner 2019' yet, but you plan to see it soon, I have a friendly advice. The film is a continuation of 'Blade Runner' made in1982, and even if the story is not necessarily an extension of the original film, the theme and philosophy of the films are linked, and many of the motivations of the characters as well as the social ambiance of the future imagined in the film can be more easily understood if you first see or review the first movie, or at least read or reread the summary. The dystopian world imagined by novelist Philip K. Dick and director Ridley Scott in the original film, as well as the theme of robots with human characteristics (called ""replicants"" in the novel and films) that are at the border between tools endowed with what we call artificial intelligence and equal beings to men, capable of feelings and endowed with what some call 'soul' have become in the decades that passed since a familiar presence in sci-fi cinema, and Ridley Scott's film is considered a 'cult' film. The landscape of the 'retro' style of the future has become a visual reference for many of the distant and / or apocalyptic films that followed, and Vangelis' music adds to the 'noir' sensation of action in the future.'Blade Runner 2049' begins with a text screen (something that I personally am not enthusiastic about in films) describing the events that took place between 2019 (the year when the first film was taking place) and the 2049's 'contemporaneity'. A black-out phenomenon due to an unspecified event (ecological catastrophe? atomic explosion?) produced a high-intensity electromagnetic pulse ('EMP') destroying all electronic devices and memories of mankind. Only what was recorded on paper - books, press, archives - survived. The possibility of such an event is as real as it may be, it can also be caused by high intensity solar rashes, and various emergency scenarios take it into consideration. The industrial concern that produced the replicas had been ruined only to be replaced by another, bigger, stronger, worse, a monopoly of slave robots. The main difference to the world in 2019 is that in 2049 the replicas do not work on distant planets, but they are largely integrated into human society, performing almost all roles and practicing all the crafts. The main character of the movie, 'K' (yes, indeed - 'K' as Kafka) is such a replicant, a policeman at the LAPD. The replicants are apparently fully integrated, they seem to be peers, and they are hard to distinguish, but they are not equal in rights, being merely subordinate and generally disciplined executors of human orders. Physically they seem to be parity with people - they eat and drink, they get tired and sleep, they have sex, they get older, and the blood flows when they get injured. They even die, except they do not give birth and they're not born. Only the ability to be born and to give birth to create life like humans do seems to be lacking.The movie's intrigue triggers when 'K' (played by the excellent Ryan Gosling, one of Hollywood's most talented younger actors) over a case involving an oddity in rgw order of things, starts to ask more questions than the norm , begins to doubt. His questions would upset the social hierarchy that makes replicants simple executors of human orders, and the official version of history on which this hierarchy is based. The order to leave the investigation and to forget the anomalies - which, of course, will be ignored - sends a direct hint to totalitarian regimes, and not only to them, in which a single version of 'truth' is accepted, and in which research of alternative answers becomes a crime. During his investigation, 'K' will face not only the forces of the all-powerful corporation that dominate the economy and public order of the planet, but also secrets related to his own origin and past, revealing traces of his own identity.The disturbing questions about the essence of human nature and the boundaries between humanity as we know it and understand it today, and what it can (some would say it would be) to become over a long time are a recurring theme of the anticipation literature from the first robot stories of Capek, or the novels and stories of Asimov, to films or television productions such as the excellent Swedish series 'Real People' ('Äkta människor'). The spectacular advances in synthetic chemistry, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence make these questions not only topics of the future, but also closer issues related to the present or the near future. Self-learning ability combined with emotion synthesis and emulation, implemented on platforms with speeds and computing power and with much higher reliability than human minds and human bodies, make the robots a new species that begins to compete with humans to control the resources of the planet. 'Blade Runner 2049' describes a possible world where autonomous robots are part of the social hierarchy and have also acquired many of the characteristics that make up the human personality and the specific differences between the different individuals belonging to the species. What's left behind as a barrier that separates mankind from the world of robots? Dilemmas? ""It's not a big deal, do not envy us for that"" says in the film a human character to the hero belonging to the world of robots. Ability to love? This is not even certain in the world created in 'Blade Runner 2049' where people and robots seem to share 'resources' that allow sexual gratification, and where differences between humans and robots, or between all of them and virtual embodiments like holograms are not clear or important. The ability to give birth, to create life from your own body? This last barrier may be the real one, but you will have to see the movie to see how the issue is addressed, whatever I would say here would be too much of a 'spoiler'.The project was designed and prepared by Ridley Scott for many years, and the director intended for a while to direct the sequel. He was finally pleased with the role of producer and entrusted the direction of French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, author of several high quality and successful action films such as 'Sicario' and 'Arrival'. The combination of the action film with the intelligent science-fantasy intrigue, which raises issues not only about the evolution of mankind but also about where the directions for the future are drawn, works in the 'Blade Runner 2019' almost as well as in the original film . Ryan Gosling realizes a formidable acting performance in the lead role. In the second part of the film, Harrison Ford shows up as the original 'Blade Runner', the one who had good reasons to disappear from the world of the future between 2019 and 2049. The visual world continues extends what I saw 36 years ago with creative and executed capabilities enhanced by digital graphics. Even if the element of surprise is diminished, and if the world of the future created in the film is a continuation and amplification of the style and atmosphere of the original film, 'Blade Runner 2049' offers plenty of reasons for the satisfaction of filmmakers, not just fans science fiction, questions and raises current issues that deserve in-depth and interesting discussions. If you have not already seen it, I recommend it.",Blade Runner 2049
37,ThomasDrufke,Still Not Grasping the Love For these Movies,7,8 October 2017,"Having not been a fan of the original, I went into 2049 with an open mind. I was hoping to have a truly epic sci-fi experience that honors the original but also stands on its own. While 2049 does that, it still isn't resonating with me the way I think it does with most people.I honestly can't pinpoint the reason why I'm not connecting to these films. Great performances, beautiful cinematography, visceral action (in the limited action sequences), and a director at the top of his game, and I'm still not connecting the dots as to why these movies are viewed with such high regard. Granted, Roger Deakins' cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. Gosling, Ford, and the rest of the ensemble all fit perfectly with their characters (see - Jared Leto for example). Villeneuve proposes some fantastic story beats that definitely separate this film thematically from the original (which was a worry I had), and yet I'm still not all the way there.I think the thing that kills me with both films is the pacing. It's not like I haven't seen science fiction films with slow pacing that I liked. Heck, Villeneuve made a great one just last year with Arrival. But there's something about how slow these films play and the material that drives them just doesn't resonate with me. Whether it's the overabundance of A.I driven sci-fi features that I've seen before these movies, the bleak tone, or the fact that I just don't really care whether or not Rick Deckard is a replicant or not, Blade Runner just isn't for me.With that said, I can always appreciate when a film is sharply put together. Just because I'm not a fan of the material, doesn't mean I can't see when a film is something special in the technical way. If there was ever a guy who should win the Oscar for cinematography, it's Roger Deakins. The man has gone on long enough without a statue. And there's nothing I can knock too much about Villeneuve's directing, even with an incredibly slow burn way of telling a story. I thought Gosling and Ford played well off each other, and gave some of the more emotional turns I've seen from either of them in quite some time. And the eerie but lively score from Ben Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer are among this year's best.However overall, I can't see myself sitting down for a second viewing. I'm perfectly content with letting other people enjoy this series. I won't blame anyone for calling this or the original a classic. But I'll pass.7.1/10",Blade Runner 2049

39,gbill-74877,"Gorgeous, but falls a little short",7,8 July 2018,"'Blade Runner 2049' starts strong, with a clean, taut story, and stunning visuals from director Denis Villeneuve. This time the blade runner (Ryan Gosling), the officer responsible for 'retiring' the bioengineered humans referred to as replicants, is a replicant himself, but with a new design to make him more subservient. Early on he uncovers shocking evidence that a female replicant from the past actually gave birth, and is immediately at the center of a conflict between his boss (Robin Wright), who wants to find and kill the offspring, and an industrialist (Jared Leto), who wants to learn the secret of this miracle and build a massive labor force.As with the first Blade Runner, the film raises some interesting philosophical questions. What does it mean to be a sentient being? Can an engineered being deserve what we want as people - freedom, love, and happiness? And what are the ethics of humanity building such beings? The blade runner has a holographic girlfriend (Ana de Armas), and in one scene, she arranges a prostitute for him, since she herself is disembodied. It's pretty wild when one reflects it's a computer program arranging for sex for a robot. Unfortunately, the philosophical points don't deliver nearly as much as in the first film, where Rutger Hauer faced his mortality and wanted so desperately to meet his maker, those aspects of existence most profoundly human, culminating with that devastating scene in the rain.Like the first film, this one has a slow pace, but at 163 minutes, it's much longer, and probably too long. It does allow for the story to gradually unfold and all those gorgeous images, but it drags, and I was not a fan of how it played out. The story line muddles a bit, and then rather than being complete, sets itself up for sequels and presumably a franchise. That was a real shame, and on its own lowered by review score by half a tick. The performances are all strong, and it was nice to see Harrison Ford still getting it done at age 75. Overall it's a solid sequel, which is tough to do given the legendary film it follows, but it falls a little short.",Blade Runner 2049

This sequel had an absence of 35 years between films so it's unlikely they'd make a worthy successor. Turns out they did! I loved this, but not as much as most people. What's impressive is that I was initially disappointed because I wanted to see Harrison Ford come back to reprise his role but after half the movie was done, he still wasn't there. Finally he comes in at the 105 minute mark! He took his time. This manages to capture the spirit of the original so well.I thought I'd love the original because it would be this big epic action movie. Instead, it blew me away with its fantastic visuals and uniqueness. And guess what? This movie gives us the exact same way. I'm simply once again blown away by how beautiful this film looks and how clever the writing is. The final twist may in fact be the best part and the buildup is great.

Although technically sequel of the original story, essentially it is remake of Blade Runner's atmosphere and soul. It mimics the original so skillfully that the gap of 35 years disappears. It answers some questions that first film had left undefined, and deepens the others. Still, it's not quite It. In 1982 Blade Runner was something new, original, interesting and thought provoking. In the meantime a lot of films about artificial intelligence have been made, and 35 years later the Blade Runner 2049 does not bring anything new. Some things were taken from the original, in many others I recognized the similarities with ""AI"", ""Her"", ""The Fifth Element"" ... Simply, however good it is, all it shows has already been seen, and therefore it does not leave a particularly strong impression. I liked it, but personally I experienced it more like a remake than a new movie. Great, but inferior to the original.8,5/10P.S.

48,westsideschl,KISS,7,22 August 2018,"Not as memorable as the original, but good. Here are some reasons I wasn't super impressed. Also included is a basic guide to who is what.
1. Seems to be a paucity of flying cars unlike the original which had them practically running into each other, now most of the movie you just see the one. Same old poor science of vehicles making swooshing sounds (whether in the near vacuum of space or though the air on whatever planet). Never did figure out the propulsion system - oh well, details.
2. The movie's secondary theme was for the new Replicant ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) to dispatch the old replicants, but you don't see a cohesive storyline on that. K's killing of one of the last of the original Replicants (Sapper) who has spent the last 30 years just being a lonely farmer of protein for humanity didn't make any sense, and left a bad taste since he was a good guy. There are creative ways to deal with this situation, but the writers took the cheap way.
3. Another secondary theme was Mr. Wallace's (bad guy) purchase of the Tyrell Corp. (the old Replicant makers) so that he can build an army to take over. Luv is his Replicant assistant that does the dirty work.
4. The primary theme of the movie is K's search (as well as Mr. Wallace & Luv) to find the daughter (and/or son) of a union between old Deckard and old Replicant Rachael thus giving insight into a potential new human/replicant super race. Unfortunately the tale of this mysterious offspring and Rachael's later re-animation (which was an incredible bit of CGI) received little story/movie time. Also not explained is how the biology for this union would have even the remotest possibility.
5. Not clearly written or played out was the subplot of a 6-10-21 labeled toy horse (and labeled tree) that belonged to the perhaps dead son of this union and is now in K's possession or is it in the ashes of a furnace?
6. Also not clear were all the Biblical references as if the regular audience should ferret them out in span of a couple of hours watching. The original film had a more thematic impact that was clearly understandable with less obscurity.
7. Storyline left hanging was the new Replicant potential uprising near the end of the film, and Deckard/Rachael's daughter now living in a bubble (right under baddie Mr. Wallace's watch). Also left hanging is K's demise (or not)?
8. True to the original there's lots of rain; neon lights; overhanging tall buildings, and no sunny skies.
Conclusion: The original had more thoughtful impact.",Blade Runner 2049
49,tabuno,A Captivating Extended Movie Torn between Mystery and Romance,9,9 January 2019,"8 October 2017. This sequel to the original 1982 Ridley Scott's now classic Blade Runner offers the same mystery thriller sci fi theme that didn't really inspire a lot of initial interest in the original movie. Apparently director Denis Villenueve's Blade Runner version has also encountered some popular audience resistance and the slightly lower female rating as did Ridley Scott back in 1982. There is considerable less action involved in this release as compared to the more popular mainstream movies receiving much bigger box office receipts. Lost is the typical film noir voice-over narrative that was a problem for a number of people, including Harrison Ford, of the 1982 original theatrical release. However, there probably still exists a minority of people who prefer the film noir element of detective voice over of the 1940s, allowing the audience to get into the mental experiences going on with the lead character, including the imagined dialogue of an audio version of reading from a book or text.Many of the sci fi robotic concepts incorporated into this movie have had their presentation in a number of much earlier sci fi movies, particularly dealing with the human brain, emotions, memories. Russell Crowe's hologram turned real in Virtuosity (1995), Cherry 2000 (1987) the female robotic companion of David Andrew's character that he believes he wants to repair her damaged central processing unit to keep what close relationship he had, Kurt Russell's engineered and programmed human to become the perfect human weapon in Soldier (1998), and even Peter Weller in Robocop (1987) and Robert John Burke in Robocop 3 (1993) as well as D.A.R.Y.L. (1985) about a robotic boy and blurring between human and robot in Making Mr. Right (1987). Yet what seems to distinguish and sets this robotic or synthroid themed movie apart is the integration between a hologram and a robotic entity in both visual as well as acted portrayal. The dazzling and fascinating fusion of electronic interfacing in one of the movie's delicate sequences of awesomeness.While it is likely that many in the audience will find the outstanding visual effects on par or even more dazzling and powerful as the original and as found in Interstellar (2014) with its water and ice planets or scientifically accurate display of a black hole, the megacity features of the multitude of decrepit futuristic housing or bleak, haunting, hostile landscapes of Blade Runner 2049 appear like Sean Penn's beautiful but ""pretentious"" landscape imagery found in Into the Wild (2007). What director Denis Villenueve has introduced into his Blade Runner movie is a tribute to both the Ridley Scott's visionary imagery as well as an over-emphasis on visual design by turning it into a primary character of the movie instead of a background palette upon which to tell and to complement the story.What is really fascinating about the script is how much Blade Runner 2049 is much like the original except that its perspective could be viewed more from a replicant's point of view instead of the hunter or detective point of view by the time the movie is over. Villenueve's movie is even more dark and somber than the original, more grittier with a similar context as Daniel Craig gets to portray James Bond in the more contemporary Casino Royale (2006) from his earlier incarnations. Ultimately, it is harder to connect deeply and consistently with the emotional turmoil underlying this movie as it is also focused on a mystery. Unlike The Machine (2013), Her (2013) or Transcendence (2014) the canvass on which Blade Runner 2049 is presented is so much larger that the opportunity for a consistent, extended intimate and evolving engagement on an interpersonal level is somewhat diminished.",Blade Runner 2049
50,nairtejas,One-Line Review: Blade Runner 2049 (2 Stars),2,15 August 2018,"Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is an equally dull and boring yet visually appealing sibling of the 1982 Ridley Scott film, both of which basically have the same plot, same setting, and even the same characters to some extent, and which can only be completed watching with a struggle unless you doze off somewhere in the 31st minute, or if I want to sound pretentious like the film looks, the 49th minute. TN.",Blade Runner 2049
51,The-Sarkologist,Thirty Years On,8,6 October 2017,"When I first discovered that this film was going to hit the screens it literally jumped to the top of my must see list, however after watching the original a week before hand, and seeing a couple of previews, I simply shook my head and basically prepared for the worst. As it turned out the teaser trailers were just that – teasers. From watching the trailers I was half expecting a butchering of the original and simply an over enthusiastic film maker turning it into a travesty of an action movie. Well, since Ridley Scott did have his hands in the making of the film, after I left the cinema I realised that this was something that the creator of the original film was never going to allow. In fact, it turned out that the film was really, really good.Honestly, it was always going to be a feat to create a sequel to a masterpiece, and the danger of it flopping harder than the worst film ever made (though ironically they end up becoming cult classics) was always going to be a possibility. The thing is that the original film had a life of its own, to the point where one could almost write a PhD thesis on the production (and Wikipedia even has an entire page devoted to the themes and motifs of Blade Runner). Sure, the original book was okay, but the film took it to a new level.So, what about the sequel. Well, it is difficult to compare, and it certainly wasn't the original. Yet it does retain a lot of the feeling of what when on at first. Both films are detective stories in the classic film noir tradition, however where the first film is basically a story of a bounty hunt, the second film has a lot more mystery to it. The creators do a really good job of slowly releasing information to you, and then teasing you with one idea only to suddenly twist everything around and reveal that what we thought was the truth wasn't actually the truth at all. Even what happened between the two movies is left vague, and only bits and pieces are revealed throughout the film – we know that there was a replicant revolt, but the consequences of this revolt is only drip fed to us throughout the film.I really don't want to give too much away, and even though IMDb does drop some hints about what goes on in the film, I'm not really all that comfortable to even go that far. Honestly, it would probably be best for most people to go into the film knowing as little about it as possible, and probably even having a completely different idea as to what it is actually going to be about. The film does pay tribute to the original film, and does give us an idea of what happened at the end of the original – the final cut does have Deckard and Rachel leaving, with the suggestion that she was also a replicant that needed to be hunted down. There are also a few references back to the original as well, but the original was never actually setting up this film. Oh, and any questions that you are expecting to be answered from the first film, particularly about Deckard, are fortunately not answered in this film either.",Blade Runner 2049
52,slightlymad22,I Liked This A Lot More Than Any aversion Of The First Movie,8,5 January 2020,"Just watched Blade Runner 2049 for the first time in Blu-ray.I didn't love any of the seven versions of the 1982 movie, and since the marketing on this one relied on nostalgia for that movie (instead of promoting this movie) I passed. I seen it at a boot sale for 50p this morning and bought it.I'll just say this right off the bat, Denis Villeneuve has directed a great movie. I really enjoyed it!! A lot more than any of the 7 version of the first movie. He isn't going for setting up an action franchise, he is focusing on one movie and it's great.Its a long movie (2 hrs 43 mins), in fact It is definitely too long. It could have lost half an hour and still been awesome, it did not need to be that long. The pacing is seriously off at times and it feels like a long movie.All the acting is great, there is not one weak link. This is Goslings movie and he is excellent. Ford (who didn't show up till the 1 hr 45 mark) is gruff and great. Sylvia Hoeks is really good as Luv too. Dave Batista has a small role, likewise Mackenzie Davis (Terminator Dark Fate) has a small but important role as a human prostitute. But for the second movie in a row (that I have seen her in), Ana De Armas (Knives Out, being the first) steals the show as JOI.I'm glad to see this won Oscars for its cinematography and visual effects. It is a shame this under performed at the box office!! Maybe if it had lost half an hour, they could have fit another showing per day in.I will be keeping this bad boy in my collection.",Blade Runner 2049
53,UniqueParticle,I regret not seeing in theaters although it was my first 4K HDR experience for my 50 inch TV,10,30 May 2019,Truly outstanding in every aspect! The soundtrack and visuals are mind blowingly masterful; so glad I own this revolutionary piece of art in sci-fi! Also a fascinating philosophical topic that I love is predictive programming; the possibility of some futuristic things that could happen in the future -- would be so epic in the next few decades. Even if I'm wrong it's fun to think about and consider. Regardless this is a wonderful brilliant movie!,Blade Runner 2049
54,briancham1994,Better than the original,9,3 June 2020,"The original Blade Runner (1982) is held up as a science fiction classic, so I may not be taken seriously when I say that this one is better than the original, but I will not be subtle about it - Blade Runner 2049 surpasses its predecessor in every way. This film is truly a masterpiece in all the ways that the original is praised for, but better. The visuals are stunning, the acting is engaging, the story is thoughtful and the style is ponderous.",Blade Runner 2049
55,tomgillespie2002,"It doesn't live up to the original, but it's damn close",9,25 January 2018,"Ridley Scott's Blade Runner suffered greatly at the box-office when it was released in the summer of 1982, but has enjoyed an astonishing re-evaluation in the proceeding decades as one of the greatest and most innovative science-fiction movies of all time. During the last 35 years, talk of and ideas for a sequel have been constantly thrown around, with Scott often voicing his interest in returning to the future world of Replicants and Blade Runners. After much fan-fretting, the follow-up is finally here, only with Denis Villeneuve at the helm, but seeing what Scott has done to his other masterpiece Alien in the last few years, his departure is most welcome. With 2016's Arrival, Villeneuve hinted that he may just be cinema's next sci-fi visionary, and now with Blade Runner 2049, he has only gone and confirmed it.In 2049, Replicants are still living amongst us. With many of them retreating to solitary lives outside of the city, Blade Runners such as Ryan Gosling's K are still employed to hunt down and 'retire' any Replicants in hiding. When investigating farmer Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), K uncovers a shocking secret that will change everything that is known about Replicants and their poistion as dangerous and disposable property. K's boss Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) wants the matter swept under the carpet before the truth starts to leak out, and tasks the highly competent Blade Runner with taking care of it quickly and cleanly. Also taking an interest is Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), the head of the company now leading in the way in the manufacturing of Replicants following the demise of the Tyrell Corporation. He sends his Replicant enforcer Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) to uncover the truth and to stop K, who is having his own identity crisis, before he makes the whole thing disappear for good.One of the many issues people had with Blade Runner back in 1982 was its pacing. It runs at under two hours, but is certainly in no hurry to rush into the next action scene or to offer any easy answers. Blade Runner 2049 takes the same approach, thankfully, choosing to gently stroll around this world and let you absorb its ugly beauty. The sequel spends less time in the rainy metropolis of Los Angeles, choosing instead to explore the snowier, desolate regions outside of the city and the glowing, inhospitable ruins of Las Vegas. It's all brought stunningly to life by cinematographer Roger Deakins (who must be a shoe-in for the Oscar) and production designer Dennis Gassner. This unhurried approach may explain why Villeneuve's film - despite massive fan and critic anticipation - under-performed at the box office. It also runs at a whopping two hours and 40 minutes, so anyone who failed to bring a cushion to the cinema may have been shuffling in their seats, but Blade Runner 2049 is one of a small collection of movies that justifies its lengthy running-time, numb backside or not.Resurrecting his third iconic character in 9 years, Harrison Ford also returns as Rick Deckard, the former Blade Runner and possible Replicant who was last seen fleeing with Sean Young's Rachael. Ford appears much later in the film than I was expecting, especially when you consider how prominent he was in the marketing campaign. But Villeneuve has wisely chosen to make this K's story, refusing to re-introduce Deckard until he becomes necessary to the plot. K is a Replicant and knows his place in society, and his journey is one of loneliness, doubt and contemplation. His isolation is highlighted further by Joi (Ana de Arnas), the holographic girlfriend who finds herself in her own philosophical quandary, and who no doubt represents our own over-reliance on technology while we experience less actual human contact. Blade Runner 2049 is bold film-making, refusing to pander to the mainstream crowds or to simply drool over the original, cementing itself as a great work of science-fiction in its own right. It doesn't live up to the original, but it's damn close, and that's an achievement few thought possible.",Blade Runner 2049
56,Thanos_Alfie,As good as the first...,8,11 March 2018,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a young blade runner discovering a very important secret that has the potential to bring society into chaos and leads him to track down a retired and former blade runner who was missing for thirty years. It has to be mentioned that all the incidents in this movie happen thirty years after the first movie ""Blade Runner"" and of course there is a connection between these two movies.I liked this movie because of the plot which was very interesting and kept me intense. I also liked the visual effects and the cinematography of it. The interpretations of Ryan Gosling who played as LAPD Officer K, Jared Leto who played as Niander Wallace and Ana de Armas who played as Joi were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Robin Wright's who played as Lieutenant Joshi and Sylvia Hoeks who played Luv. The only drawback that I can find in this movie it's that it was too long if it was two hours as the first one then I believe that it would be better. The direction which was made by Denis Villeneuve was simply outstanding. Finally, I believe that ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a very good movie and I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to have a great time watching it and you are going to love it. It will remind you the first movie and after the connection between them, you are going to be even more satisfied with it. Even if you have high hopes or high expectations for this movie I think that you will not be disappointed by it.",Blade Runner 2049
57,cruise01,"Blade Runner is the example of an artwork to the science fiction genre with its powerful direction, visuals, and storytelling.",8,7 October 2017,"What makes you a human? There is plenty of these type of questions that Blade Runner 2049 always refers back too in this science fiction film that is very much impressive. And I ll admit this, better than the original movie which may shock to all since the first was a cult hit of a movie. I feel like all the credit has to go to director Denis Villeneuve in making a compelling, visually done film. Blade Runner 2049 may not please every one in the audience and it sure will divide the audience either they enjoy it or find it boring. Lets get this straight out in the open. Blade Runner is not the typical Hollywood science fiction action movie were it is loaded with big action set pieces throughout. I ll also admit, this film could have used a little more action but otherwise the movie does well in its storytelling, impressive visuals, and a stunning direction. I do not want to give too much away about the plot. The less you know the better the movie will be. I ll just give the basic plot outline of a blade runner named K (Ryan Gosling) who hunts down replicants (bioengineered humans) who have been defective. Well on his first case of hunting a replicant, he unearths something that will get the attention from a corporation led by Wallace (Jared Leto) who is trying to perfect a great replicant. And K will need the help of a former blade runner Deckard (Harrison Ford) in order to find answers about what he has discovered that can change everything they once knew. The storytelling in this film is what makes it great. It is slow moving in a good way. It does leave you wanting to explore more about the dystopian future. The film spends its time in a futuristic Los Angeles, were its gloomy and flashy with its holograms. Then, K travels to San Diego, were it is a complete wasteland. Where L.A. dumps there massive loads of trash, which literally looks like a huge city of a junkyard. Also, the landscapes of Las Vegas, were it is orange and gloomy from the radioactive. These sequences of different areas does want you to explore more about. Also, K interpersonal relationship with his A.I. device that he carries with him that brings up a hologram of a young woman (Ana de Armas) who can keep him company emotionally or physically. There is plenty of details in the story that the film does take its time with its length. But it never gets boring. The visual effects are top notch impressive. Like I mentioned above about the landscapes to its neo noir lighting from the city. And to even make everything better is the music score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Bringing back the original score theme and adding a few changes does give you that nostalgia feeling when seeing the score volume loud and seeing every shot with the camera done great as it captures the visual sets and effects. Director Denis Villeneuve (known for Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival) if you seen those films. You should know he builds suspense, characters, and overachieves in trying to capture the best shot visually. And a lot of talking throughout the movie. Well the same goes for Blade Runner. He is all about storytelling and respecting the original by exploring further with its plot. He is starting to become one of my favorite directors that can always capture a tone and build its suspense. Sure, my one small issue with the film is it does lack in some action sequences. You get some small brief fight scenes and shooting sequence. And than a flying car chase in the climax. But I only wish there was a bit more to the action. Otherwise, Blade Runner 2049 is a good science fiction film. The direction and music score is great. The visuals are amazing and hard to take eyes off the screen. Ryan Gosling and the cast ensemble were good. The storytelling is slow moving but works great at being an artistic film than a typical action blockbuster. I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend to see it on the big screen for its impressive music score and visuals of a dystopian future and plot. If you enjoy an artistic science fiction movie or loved the original than this will be a film for you.",Blade Runner 2049
58,Dr_Coulardeau,No guru will save humanity from its Doomsday,9,16 April 2018,"To revive an old film that was considered in 1982 when it came out and in later years, and has been since and still is, as a classic representing some cultural or even civilizational achievement is always a difficult task and here again, a lot of imagination and skill, if not art, has to be found and developed, though the result is slightly obscure and entangled into complicated intertwined circumstances that make facts fuzzy more than clearly explained. This is a systematic artistic approach and vision: lose the people in wordy complex speculations since they will not really understand and it does not matter. We are in the world of Facebook manipulation and target advertising: loosen the audience critical mind with obtuse ranting and raving with a lot of technical words no one understands.The Title cards are typical:
Title Card: Replicants are bioengineered humans, designed by Tyrell Corporation for use off-world. Their enhanced strength made them ideal slave labor.
Title Card: After a series of violent rebellions, their manufacture became prohibited and Tyrell Corp went bankrupt.
Title Card: The collapse of ecosystems in the mid-2020s led to the rise of industrialist Niander Wallace, whose mastery of synthetic farming averted famine.
Title Card: Wallace acquired the remains of Tyrell Corp and created a new line of replicants who obey.
Title Card: Many older model replicants - Nexus 8s with open-ended lifespans - survived. They are hunted down and 'retired'
Title Card: Those that hunt them still go by the name... Blade Runner.It does not mean much and you have to accept what is said as being factual and clear, though it is as clear as Danish pea soup.The first element is carried by the graphic - in all meanings of the word - scenes represented on the screen. It is a world divided in two. On one hand the world of desires. All you want to see, all you want to hear, all you want to feel, all you want to taste and all you want to smell. A full sensorial world of sensual and sensuous impressions and pleasures. Living within the next five minutes and never beyond in your head, hardly your mind because you do not have a mind anymore. Los Angeles is no longer the city of angels but is the city of all pleasures, perversions and probably fetishisms. It has many skyscrapers, though the sky is no longer what it used to be due to pollution, smog and probably even pea-soup smog delivered by the shovelful directly from hell. You cannot scrape such a sky, you can only stir it with a very strong spoon or shovel it down into some overflowing gutter. You will never see the end of it.On the other hand, the completely ruined wasteland of what might have been a city and buildings and is nothing but a big pile of derelict and falling apart constructions with piled up tons and mountains of debris, waste, garbage, in what has become an open-air dumping oversize site, haunted more than inhabited by AWOL replicants of old times plus a vast population of children exploited in some kind of sweatshops and never reaching adult age. Only rats are not shown but there should be millions of them. The children are nothing but surviving slaves that will never get to any adulthood at all. To escape this world is to get on a spacecraft and move to distant cosmic colonies where most of the slaves working and producing there are new generations of replicants more or less controlled by the human elite that has moved to these distant places.This is a total, absolute, extreme dystopia, complete dereliction, and derangement. This world is in a final state of decomposition and decay. It is rotting on the spot, on its own legs that are sinking little by little into the mud. The music is the perfect sound and noisy interpretation of this dystopian world. The flickering images in the darkest colors imaginable make us think of the comic-book world of Enki Bilal that imagined the rotting Soviet world if it had not been destroyed and dismantled. In this world humans are beasts and replicants are monsters, normally at least. And that's the problem of this replicant Agent K.By discovering some old records and recollections among replicants that thirty years ago, hence around 2019, he comes to the idea that there happened one event that could have changed the texture and destination of the world. A love affair between two replicants, a man and a woman. Agent K finds the buried body of the woman, Rachael. But he also finds some survivors who actually tell him a girl was born and the father is still alive. The film is thus and henceforward the search for the daughter and the father.Actually, he will find the daughter first and will have to hide it from the humans in LAPD who want to destroy her and to erase the possibility that two replicants can actually have children. Agent K is reduced to having a holographic woman in his apartment. He manages to find a special device that enables him to take his holographic female partner out of the apartment and thus to merge her with a material woman and then be able to satisfy his drives, impulses, and instincts in a real sex act instead of a mental rant. Replicants are supposed to be perfectly programmed Artificial Intelligence robots that obey first all and never get off the line imposed onto them. After any mission, Agent K has to go through a special debriefing session that goes as follows.Interviewer: (Baseline test room at LAPD HQ) Officer K-D-six-dash-three-dot-seven, let's begin. Ready?
K: Yes, sir.
Interviewer: Recite your baseline.
K: And blood-black nothingness began to spin... A system of cells interlinked within cells interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem... And dreadfully distinct against the dark, a tall white fountain played.
Interviewer: Cells.
K: Cells.
Interviewer: Have you ever been in an institution? Cells.
K: Cells.
Interviewer: Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
K: Cells.
Interviewer: When you're not performing your duties do they keep you in a little box? Cells.
K: Cells.
Interviewer: Interlinked.
K: Interlinked.
Interviewer: What's it like to hold the hand of someone you love? Interlinked.
K: Interlinked.
Interviewer: Did they teach you how to feel finger to finger? Interlinked.
K: Interlinked.
Interviewer: Do you long for having your heart interlinked? Interlinked.
K: Interlinked.
Interviewer: Do you dream about being interlinked?
K: Interlinked.
Interviewer: What's it like to hold your child in your arms? Interlinked.
K: Interlinked.
Interviewer: Do you feel that there's a part of you that's missing? Interlinked.
K: Interlinked.
Interviewer: Within cells interlinked.
K: Within cells interlinked.
Interviewer: Why don't you say that three times: Within cells interlinked.
K: Within cells interlinked. Within cells interlinked. Within cells interlinked.
Interviewer: We're done... Constant K, you can pick up your bonus.
K: Thank you, sir.Of course, it means nothing except conditioning and control. For the audience, it is the type of dialogue that may bring a smile to their lips, though it could be a very condescending smile about such a world. Note the interviewer is a machine, hence no interviewer at all, just a program.Finding the father is a lot more complicated and as soon as he is found, LAPD and their replicant or human agents can follow Agent K and thus trap, capture, torture this replicant, Rick Deckard, and plan his deportation and execution. But of course, Agent K goes AWOL and saves the situation though officially he will die soon after the end but after having accomplished the meeting of the daughter and her father. Mission accomplished, a mission of paternal love and a mission of the promise replicants can reproduce and thus can save the completely depleted and vilified humanity by generating a new humanoid civilization: the reinvention of love and human emotions that even make death a good event when a mission of rejuvenation and resuscitation has been fully accomplished against the scorched wasteland project of humans. The dystopian situation depicted all along is thus ending with the promise of a humanoid replacement to a humanity that has lost all ethics and all vision of a liberated future. This is both dark and somber on the state of our society and optimistic on the potential of some human invention in Artificial Intelligence. Now Europe is discussing if not even envisaging the granting of rights to these AI robots that start appearing in our universe, it is high time we wonder if the Singularity Ray Kurzweil is so haunted by is not going to produce an anti-human revolution in the hands of humanoids and replicants and androids with AI robotic minds. But you will recognize the hand of Ridley Scott's Scott Free Productions who uses science fiction to animate his most dramatic and tragic vision of the future. A lot more than a dystopia, we are dealing with an apocalyptic Blackout in 2022 and its post-apocalyptic decomposition of humanity. There is no hope for humans who will never be able to survive without replicants who can procreate and thus will become the working class and the proletariat of this slave-owning humanity. The future of hominins in the cosmos is only in the hands of humanoid replicants, a new artificial intelligent species.We are far from the after all optimistic vision of Terminator and John Connor who will lead humanity to full victory over the mechanical dictatorship. There is no future for humanity here because the narrow elite of this vast slave world is completely lost in a transition they have themselves brought upon themselves. Let the last Hominins die to liberate this world and this cosmos of their doomed and damned incoherent lack of plain human intelligence. (...

59,zkonedog,Better Than The Original,8,18 February 2018,"Before this movie came out, I went back and watched the original Blade Runner again (my second viewing of it). Neither viewing of that first one impressed me. Ridley Scott's original is a bit of a muddled mess of half-baked plots, odd characters, albeit containing stunning visuals (especially for the time). The only reason I had any interest in its sequel is that this one is directed by one of my favorite Hollywood helmers, Dennis Villeneuve. He ""does it again"" with ""2049"", of course, managing to put together a film that both pays homage to Scott's controversial original as well as crafts an even better, more interesting story than that film ever dreamed of.For a basic plot summary, ""2049"" focuses on K (Ryan Gosling), a new type of Replicant in a post-Tyrell Corp. world. Through the course of an investigation (he's with the LAPD), K and boss Joshi (Robin Wright) discover that Replicants are now able to give birth...a revelation that is both shocking (shouldn't be possible) and terrifying (would induce panic among the colonies). As such, K is dispatched to find the ""miracle child"" and dispose of it by any means necessary. This includes a trip to new business head honcho Wallace (Jared Leto), as well as discovering that Deckert (Harrison Ford) may still play a role in all of this.Likely because of Villeneuve's mastery behind the camera, ""2049"" is a film with a very defined, follow-able plot. At no time was I ever really lost or frustrated with the proceedings (as happened multiple times during my viewings of the original). Clearly, this sequel is less about ""noir"" (establishing an atmosphere) and more about actually following through with plot structure and characters. To me, that makes it considerably better than its predecessor because of this next point:Even though it is a much more streamlined movie, it still creates a wonderful sense of atmosphere. The visuals here are stunning, and all the environments are interesting in their own right, filled with grandiose images/artifacts and futuristic color schemes. I don't think there is a scene in this movie that isn't filmed from behind some sort of crazy filter, but none of it ever really gets too distracting, either.A Blade Runner film will probably never be my absolute favorite type of filmmaking. Even on its best day, it forgoes much potential plot nuance in favor of visuals and atmosphere. Even clocking in at nearly 3 hours, however, Villeneuve's ""2049"" easily held my interesting all the way through, and that is something I never expected from this film.Overall, I think this is a film that will be enjoyed by most who watch it. If you are a big fan of the original, there's enough of that here for you. If you were ambivalent (like me) towards Scott's first one, rest assured that this one is much easier to follow and understand exactly what is transpiring. A win-win situation for all involved.",Blade Runner 2049
60,Floated2,Visually stunning exprience,7,19 January 2019,"Blade Runner 2049 delivers as a unique and interesting visually stunning film. Although there is more to the story as the film does begin quite slow, once it fully ejects itself, it becomes a great ride. We can see why this film did not do well at the box office as the studios expected, as many audience members claim the film was too long, slow and boring. Although the film does move at a slow pace, its visuals is what makes the film great.The story isn't that complex and quite confusing at first but the more watched, the more you begin to further understand what is occurring. Although there could have been more scenes of action, and more tense moments. And some scenes do somewhat drag on a bit. With its run time at 2 hours 43 minutes, there feels like much happening but also feels quite long.Blade Runner 2049 is more of a one actor show, in which Ryan Gosling stars as officer K. Many trailers showed Harrison Ford quite much in the trailer as we assumed his role would be a major part, though he is heavily reduced as doesn't come in the film until the end, within the third act or so.Despite its flaws, this film is quite an experience, and its shame more Hollywood films aren't like this. Perhaps another viewing in the future will satisfy and be necessary.",Blade Runner 2049
61,eddie_baggins,One of cinema's most unlikeliest of sequels is one of the years best,9,5 October 2017,"With one of cinema's most unlikeliest of follow-up's, walking in the footsteps of its forefather 35 long years after its initial release, Blade Runner 2049 gives us one of the 21st century's most accomplished of sequels.The year's most original, risky and downright beautiful blockbuster (just give Roger Deakins the Oscar now thanks Academy), Denis Villeneuve's lovingly crafted new addition to the world created by Ridley Scott in 1982 is a film that pays respectful acknowledgment to its counterpart, all the while carving out a mysterious, engaging and most importantly, an emotionally charged continuation of what has come before and what is still yet to be uncovered.Focussing its attention this time around on Ryan Gosling's blade runner K, a man with a mission very similar to Deckard in the original, that being the ""retirement"" of runaway replicants, 2049 is a film that deserves to be seen with as little knowledge of its story as possible, as Villeneuve and returning screenwriter Hampton Fancher alongside Michael Green have produced one of those rare modern day blockbusters where there is genuine intrigue as to what exactly is happening and where our final destination may take us.Fans of the original will be pleased to know that 2049 tackles just as many big question's as Scott's adored adaption of Philip K. Dick's source material as it journeys on its way, as by expanding the universe of a futuristic Los Angeles and this time its outer surrounds, Villeneuve has enabled himself to be able to delve even deeper into the questions of what it means to be human and what separates man from machine.It's always a tough task for films of 2049's nature to pay homage to the aesthetic and life of the original while creating a vibe and world all of its own but Villeneuve and his team have balanced out the scales brilliantly here.Seeing more of the landscape of this futuristic but not unrealistic world only heightens the sense of wonder, Ana de Armas's role as Joi will be a great talking point for many, Jared Leto's somewhat overacted and underdeveloped role as new replicant king Niander Wallace will still demand great debate while Roger Deakin's work behind the camera capturing this visually incredible production makes every single scene a work of visual wonder, a blockbuster production that is pure art instead of pure popcorn eye-candy.The other key elements to 2049's many successes are the performances of its two poster men Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford.Without talking in depth about how the roles of characters K and Deckard playout through the film, both performers acquit themselves brilliantly to their roles. Gosling who has the most to do here delivers one of his most memorable turns yet as K, it's a role that requires both restraint and moments of rage and Gosling handles it all with aplomb, while it's great to see Ford invested in his return as Deckard with the aging star doing a lot more than he can be prone to do in some of his usual phone it in performances.Just like it's much talked about original, 2049 does have issues that rear their heads throughout the film and do hold the film back at times from the greatness that it often touches.Most glaringly is the films runtime, at 160 minutes in length Villeneuve's film doesn't always justify its near 3 hour existence, some scenes feel like they could've been both shortened and cut and it wouldn't have adversely affected the final product, while some of the films middle section in particular does cover similar ground for an extended period of time.The other more cosmetic letdown is the films soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, that fails to match the grand heights of Vangelis's classic 1982 score. With music playing such a key role in the universe of Blade Runner, it's a shame this one feels a little tacked on, which it was, when the composers came on late in the picture replacing original choice Jóhann Jóhannsson after ""creative differences"" between himself and Villeneuve.Final Say – Not made for everyone and far removed from the usual blockbuster fair, those seeking sci-fi action kicks from Blade Runner 2049 will be left wanting but Denis Villeneuve has crafted that near impossible sequel that's respectful to its original, all the while moving forward in brave new directions. 2049 is a ponderous and meticulously crafted production that's not only the year's must-see science fiction event, but one of the year's best films regardless of genre.4 ½ Elvis holograms out of 5",Blade Runner 2049
62,leonblackwood,"Expected much better, after waiting so long for a sequel!",5,19 February 2018,"Review:
I must be one of the only people in the world who wasn't a big fan of the original movie, which is why I wasn't over excited when I heard that they were making a sequel. I was glad to see that Harrison Ford was returning for this sequel but once the film began, I got bored really quickly. Gosling was extremely moody throughout the film and it took about 2 hours for anything interesting to happen. When Harrison Ford finally makes a dramatic entrance, the whole tempo picks up, and it starts to get interesting but it's to little to late in my opinion. Anyway, the film is set in 2049, hence the title, were a LAPD officer, K (Ryan Gosling), a new generation of Blade Runner, comes across a hidden secret which could damage civilisation and cause mass destruction. He then goes on his own personal mission to find the root of the secret, which leads him to an old Blade Runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been in hiding for 30 years. The Tyrell Corperation, led by the powerful Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), also wants to get his hands on the priceless secret, so he tries his utmost to get to K by using his lethal agent Luv (Sylvia Hoaks), who does anything to get the information that is needed. With the help of Rick, K fights off Nianders henchmen whilst still trying to piece together the truth about the hidden secret, and were it all began. Personally, it took way to long to get going but the twist in the middle, does perk it up a little. I was expecting more action, especially with such a big budget but I know that the director was trying to stay true to the original concept, which is loved by many around the world. The ending was quite disappointing, especially after such a big build up, and I was hoping for a massive showdown with Niander, which might have been left open for a third movie. On the plus side, the movie does look pretty, and Luv was brilliant as the ruthless baddie but I can't see myself watching it again in a hurry, especially after falling asleep halfway through the film. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Denis Villeneuve, 50, even though I was hoping that Ridley Scott would return in the directors chair, and he has also brought you Prisoners, starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, Enemy, Sicario and Arrival, so he has worked with some big stars to date. I couldn't help feeling like there was a lot of unanswered question left at the end, even though it's nearly 3 hours long but I was impressed with some of the attention to detail, and the Elvis and Sinatra scenes. If they do decide to make a 3rd movie, I hope they make it so there is something for everyone, because this film was too close to the original but no way as good. Although this is a watchable film, it could have been 100 times better but I'm sure that the die hard fans will love it.Budget: $150million

63,TheMovieDiorama,Blade Runner 2049 proves that good things really do come to those who wait.,9,27 February 2018,"35 years since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was released and slowly but surely a fan base was building. A cult following with many stating it is the best sci-fi film ever created. How do you beat that? You bring in Denis Villeneuve, Roger Deakins and Hans Zimmer. Unsurprisingly, this was aimed directly for me. A narrative constructed from visual storytelling. Seamless realistic futuristic effects. Thought provoking themes on humanity, memories and creationism. A script where every scene of dialogue is palpable. Direction so flawless that my eyes started to bleed and my mind melted. Is it perfect? No. But when a blockbuster doesn't bow to Hollywood's typical action traits, it's just refreshing to watch. Where thrills aren't created by mindless explosions, but actually through the meaning behind the words. There is so much substance in every scene, meticulously woven into a narrative that questions what it means to be human. I was entranced. Hypnotised in fact, clinging onto every word spoken. Roger Deakins' cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Sci-fi rarely looks this beautiful. The colour palette used for certain chapters was truly a work of art, and if he doesn't receive that Oscar...heads will roll. Denis Villeneuve's direction was perfect yet again. He has yet to put a foot wrong. In my eyes, it didn't surpass Prisoners or Arrival but still incredible in a filmography that many directors can only dream of acquiring. Hans Zimmer's electronic synthesised soundtrack felt absurdly natural and fitting. Like one long soundscape that assisted in creating the industrial city scape of 2049 Los Angeles. Acting was solid all round, monotonous yet beneath the surface I could see so much emotion just wanting to burst out. I did find the ending anti-climactic and some of the supporting cast members were wasted. However, a carefully constructed sequel that, in my opinion, surpasses its predecessor. I warn that it's not for everyone. Moves at a glacial pace.",Blade Runner 2049
64,Tweetienator,Well Done,7,12 November 2019,"Blade Runner 2049 lives imo mostly of its very good to sometimes even excellent and superb visuals, on top the acting is good. The bad news is that the story provided adds not much new to the original movie and is just more or less a repetition of the first one (I call it the Star Wars syndrom). Anyway, Blade Runner got a straigth 10 by me and the sequel gets a solid 8 - 2049 is no new classic but a good and rock solid sci-fi movie and sequel.",Blade Runner 2049

67,matthewssilverhammer,Villeneuve>Scott,10,13 October 2017,"In 1982, Ridley Scott gave us a film adaptation of the Philip K. Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and titled it ""Blade Runner."" It escaped audiences, polarized critics, warranted multiple re-edits, and then eventually became a giant in the sci-fi world. It's flawed and confused (hence the multiple versions), yet undeniably engaging in its dark futuristic vision and mysterious story. However, with ""2049,"" director Denis Villeneuve has turned in something timeless, brilliant and more assured. Perfectly matching the tone and aesthetics of the original, it still flies above it, and ultimately feels wholly its own. One difference is its tendencies. Where the original heavily leans into its film noir aspects, ""2049"" is more insistent on its heady sci-fi elements. We've got giant incestuous corporate corruption (creating products that buy other products), Siri/Alexa-like beings taken to the Nth degree, villainous powers-that-be lying to everyone about who and what they are. It's a dense and precise script, with dialogue good enough to chew on. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast, Robin Wright is a national treasure, Jared Leto is a creepy beast, and the appearance of Harrison Ford as classic anti-hero Rick Deckard is a re-emergence for the ages. At this point, I'm convinced Villeneuve couldn't make a bad movie if he tried. The way he uses the actual art of filmmaking to get across his points almost seems second-nature. In one edit, the embers from a fire slowly fade into the lights of the city, indicating the futility of trying to contain something wild. It's a viscerally, aesthetically, emotionally and violently overwhelming film that not only builds on the original but surpasses it.",Blade Runner 2049
68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Carries on the spirit of the original in its own bold way and laced with stunning visual achievements,8,12 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is not a conventional sequel. The 1982 original failed to reach commercial success despite being a sci-fi film released during the years of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and starring Harrison Ford (and coming from acclaimed ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott). So there was not a lot of financial incentive to revisit this dreary dystopian vision of Los Angeles 35 years later. In fact, that lack of an urgent need to succeed and have mass appeal is what gives ""Blade Runner 2049"" the space to find its own artistic voice and build off of the vision and ideas that made the original a cult classic.Art direction, production design, visual effects and cinematography were the hallmarks of Scott's ""Blade Runner,"" and they are far and away the crowning achievements of ""Blade Runner 2049."" As ""Blade Runner"" did, director Denis Villeneuve (""Arrival,"" ""Sicario"") creates a compelling film through visuals that pull you into the story rather than simply dress it. Roger Deakins (director of photography), Dennis Gassner (production design) and the large art direction team do some of the best work a genre film like this has ever had the pleasure to know. This is not a breezy watch at 2 hours and 45 minutes, and consistently its the visuals that ignite and re-ignite our interest in what's happening.Hampton Fancher and Michael Green's screenplay isn't bad, but it's fairly low on the lengthy ladder of praiseworthy elements of this movie. Mechanically, the story operates as a mystery/thriller: modern-day Blade Runner ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) uncovers some secrets that lead him to what happened 30-some years before that involve missing Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), secrets of major interest to replicant creator Niander Wallace (Jared Leto).We learn a lot more about Gosling's character than we did the first time around with Ford's, and his casting is perfect for his brooding, un-emotive character. Generally, the acting has a lot more to offer in ""Blade Runner 2049"" than in the 1982 film. The supporting cast includes memorable work from Robin Wright as K's superior, Ana de Armas as an unusual ""love interest"" and Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks as the muscle for the antagonists. It also needs to be said that Ford's supporting work in the film is some of his finest, a very unexpected achievement that the film can proudly own. Deckard's role in the story goes beyond the perfunctory torch-passing that so many reboots and long- gestating sequels default into with their older heroes.The thematic tone of ""2049"" also feels similar to the original. Dialogue occasionally spills into the overtly preachy with some characters, but the story itself, and the way the film stays true to and tries to build upon the '80s-style dystopian vision of ""Blade Runner,"" allow for certain ideas to naturally emerge. The film doesn't override the original to comply with more contemporary science fiction, but it does work in some story elements that will resonate with contemporary audiences who experience more artificial intelligence in their daily lives than anyone did in 1982.Not every ounce of this exhaustive runtime is put to good use, but the craftsmanship of ""Blade Runner 2049"" makes it a rather affecting filmgoing experience, and in doing so, it honors its ""source material"" in a way so few of these delayed sequels do. Villeneuve makes the film unmistakably his, but with the same innovative, patient, detail-oriented spirit that Scott applied to ""Blade Runner."" In an era when audiences have become accustomed to studios pouring big dollars into blockbuster visuals because they assume these elements are what get audiences to pay up, ""Blade Runner 2049"" shows how that cash can be used to take us deeper into the film and not cater to our baser instincts. Sadly, what we get from ""Blade Runner 2049"" is not something most studios will consistently take a risk on (see ""Inception""), so we just have to treasure the distinctive gifts of a film like this whenever we're lucky enough to get one.~Steven CThanks for reading!

70,imseeg,"It aint ""Star Wars"". And how pleased I am about that!",9,29 March 2018,"Blade Runner is sciencefiction. HOWEVER, sciencefiction fans who search for mindless ""Star Wars"" entertainment probably wont be pleased with this Blade Runner sequel, because it hasnt got the Star Wars ""fun factor"". And how pleased I am about that! I really cant stand those Star Wars franchise series and anything that looks like it. Fortunately ""Blade Runner 2049"" is totally different than the usual hollywood sciencefiction franchise crap.""Blade Runner 2049"" has got an almost hypnotizing slow dynamic. It is as if one is submerged into a mindset unlike any other science fiction I have ever watched, besides similar mesmerizing worlds of fantasy in the other great sci-fi classics like the original Blade Runner and the magnificent ""Alien"" of the same director Ridley Scott.Blade Runner 2049 is about an android killer machine who has got to track down other robots which have to be terminated. This story truly excels at the suspense that one cant tell the difference any more between who is machine and who is human.I was really in awe of the world and the mood the director created with the use of gloriously dark pounding music. The soundtrack really was AS important as the visuals were. Highly recommended to listen to this movie with headphones or good speakers, because the bass tones will create ambient dark spaces that one can ""swim"" in for hours on end.I really felt transported into another world by the stunning visuals. I mean, they were just breathtakingly dark and ominous. Excellent Oscar worthy photography by the famous Roger Deakins! Days later I still had these gorgeous visuals floating in my mind.""Blade Runner 2049"" impressed me on a level few other scifi movies have ever done. It's a visual and sonic mindtrip into another world. Villeneuve's direction is what made this possible, because he is capable of creating a continuous suspenseful mood. Even when not much is happening in the story this dark but alluring suspenseful mood is constantly present. Difficult to describe and other people might simply will experience this dark mood as boring, but I really was in awe of this mesmerizing dark mood which the director had created.I have now watched it for the second time and I could better understand the somewhat difficult storyline. I enjoyed it even more the second time around. Blade Runner 2049 has all the merits and power of becoming a new sci-fi classic. Time will tell..",Blade Runner 2049

72,Vartiainen,Manages to live up to its predecessor surprisingly well,8,31 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner film by Ridley Scott is a thoughtful, philosophical science fiction masterpiece. It's a neo-noir detective story set in a dystopian future and has since its release influenced entire generations of film makers and other creators. So if you're going to direct a sequel over three decades later, you better make it work.And getting a guy like Denis Villeneuve to direct certainly helps. At least on a purely visual level. Well get into the story in a little bit, but let's first talk about the visuals, the sound, the whole feel of the film. Because all that is fantastic! It's so easy nowadays to say that the film looks good, but this goes beyond that. The original Blade Runner had a very unique look back on its day, which would then influence all the scifi films to come after it. Yet it always remained kind of its own thing. But this film finally captures the essence of that world where rain always falls and people live low, miserable lives amidst giant, towering monoliths of technology and science. Everything from grand, sweeping shots of the city to the haunting, electric howls of the sound track to the grime and yellow filth clinging to every surface. Eleven points out of ten for pure style.As for the story, it's good. And that's unfortunately the best I can say about it. I've always found Villeneuve to be a better visualist than a storyteller and that holds true here as well. The themes and the characters have that Blade Runner feel to them, which is why I can call it at least good, but the story is not terribly deep or philosophical, nor is it surprising. The film makers actually specifically asked for the early critics not to reveal any plot points, and for the life of me I can't see why. It is a predictable movie. There is one fairly good twist near the end, but that's it. And even that you could kind of guess based on common storytelling tropes.Still, I'm glad this movie exists. The look and feel of it alone is easily worth the price of admission and the story, while not amazing, will scratch that urge you have built over the decades.",Blade Runner 2049

74,paul-allaer,One of the best sequels EVER,9,8 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017 release; 162 min.) brings the story of K. As the movie opens, we get a thumbnail reminder/explanation of what replicants are and what a blade runner is. The newest generation replicants (in ""California 2049"" we are told) are fully integrated into society. We see K visit a farm outside LA, where he ""retires"" an old model replicant who had taken up farming. On the farm, K stumbles upon a mysterious box that contains the remains of a female replicant who it seems was pregnant and died while delivering the child. How could that be possible? At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the long-awaited (35 years!) sequel to the seminal sci-fi movie ""Blade Runner"", which when it came out in 1982 was light-years ahead of its time and cemented Ridley Scott as one of the top directors of his generation. This time around, Denis Villeneuve (who previously has brought us, among others, the excellent ""Sicario"" and ""Arrival"") is at the helm, and, apparently not feeling the weight of sky-high expectations 3+ decades in the making, Villeneuve takes us on a journey that delivers, and then some. This is a plot-heavy movie, so the lesser said, the better. But a couple of general observations: I cannot easily recall a movie where the production and set design is so integral to the plot, and so remarkable. The production budget for this movie reportedly was $150 million, and it certainly shows. But even more important, it is absolutely amazing how closely this sequel stays true to the original movie in spirit and in tone. If you are expecting an ""action movie"" (as the Blade Runner 2049 trailer gave the impression), you will be wildly disappointed. Sure there are some action scenes, but the movie is slow-paced in the best possible way. Ryan Gosling brings perhaps the finest performance of his career as K. And don't be mistaken, this is a Ryan Gosling movie far more than it is a Harrison Ford movie (who finally appears almost 2 hours into it). Cuban actress Ana de Armas (previously in ""Hands of Stone"" and ""War Dogs"") has a break-out performance as K's virtual PA. Jared Leno has a small but noteworthy role as the replicant manufacturer Wallace. Robin Wright stars as K's boss in the LAPD. Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks (keeping the Dutch connection with the 1982 movie starring Dutch actor Rutger Hauer) is remarkable as Wallace's enforcer Luv. Last but certainly not least, the original score (credited to Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer) is very much Vangelis-inspired and sounds glorious. Beware: at 2 hrs. and 45 min., this is a dense movie which takes its time, but which rewards richly for those wanting to invest their time, interest and emotional involvement.""Blade Runner 2049"" opened wide this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. I went to see it with my 30 yr. old son. In anticipation, we had watched (for me: re-watched) the original movie, and our expectations were high. Even so (or despite that), we were both stunned how good this movie was. We literally couldn't movie from our seats when it was over and we stayed stuck for the entire end credits (which seemingly take forever). The Saturday early evening screening where we saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but by no means was it a sell-out. Regardless, if you liked the 1982 movie, I bet you will LOVE this sequel, one of the best ever sequels in my humble opinion. I'd readily suggest you check out ""Blade Runner"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Blade Runner 2049
75,jtindahouse,Too long and consequently loses its impact,5,2 December 2018,"I have to start this review by admitting two things: 1) I wasn't a big fan of the original 'Blade Runner' and 2) I very rarely enjoy films based around AI (Artificial Intelligence). I find that they too often ask you to care about a robot and I simply find that very difficult to do. After watching the original recently I gave the sequel a chance hoping it would be a very different film since it was made 35 years later. And while it is different in a lot of ways (and undoubtedly a better made film in my opinion) it still suffered from similar flaws.First of all the film is far too long. Nearing 3 hours is just ridiculous considering very little actually happens in terms of story development. Compare it to a film like 'The Dark Knight' and the incredibly complex story arcs that it possessed and it still managed to come in at 2 and a half hours. For a film to be this long the pacing has to be immaculate and while it wasn't terrible in 'Blade Runner 2049' it certainly couldn't justify the runtime it had.I was a big fan of the cast. Harrison Ford was the stand-out. He was captivating to watch in every scene he had. I knew he wasn't a happy man on the original's set, but this time around he put his heart and soul into his performance and it showed. Jared Leto was also a nice cast addition, however he wasn't in the film anywhere near enough for my liking.There are some really great moments interspersed in this film and with a little more of those the film could have been something truly special. The scene with the two girls combined into one (that sounds weird, but you'll know what I mean once you've seen the film) and the final shot of the film were both masterfully done and very special moments that don't deserve to be forgotten. Who knows though, maybe they'll make another cut of this film one day and turn it into something great.",Blade Runner 2049
76,hellraiser7,Quest for Humanity,10,4 January 2018,"I honestly never thought that my favorate film of all time would ever or even should get a sequel, but surprisingly sometimes their the best kind of sequels to spring up and I'm proud to say this is another one of my favorate films of all time that I put along with the first.There is just so much about this film that is great from the production value to cinematography which is just top notch where it's just a feast for the eyes. I love how the futuristic world isn't too different from the one were familiar with but it also expands upon it making this world broader than ever before. 
From some of the customs like we see there is this big vending wall where everyone like crazy just simply touches the screen to pick out what they want to eat and they get it, much like a food replecator in ""Star Trek"". This is kinda interesting because I noticed there are no restarurants or cafes anywhere in the city, which shows how those buisnesses have gone extinct like the drive in and video rental stores but also how overly dependant humanity has became on technology which makes this fact a bit sad. Even like that there is a update on the verbal command tech from the first film.Down to certain lands that K ventures to, one scene which is just beautiful where K is walking in the post apocalitic ruins of Las Vegas. It just has such an other worldly quality almost like he's traversing a Martian Landscape as we see the sand and even the sky is redish and some of the statues he's passing by are kinda strange; this scene alone proves that a revival film to ""Dune"" (and possibly the whole book franchise) can be made. Seeing things like this made me wonder how much more was in this world and what happened to bring this world to where it is now. The music is just fantastic, the score is just memorable and really fits the film as it's a sort of futuristic noir. The film goes at a steady pace, it may seem a bit slow for some but you get use to it and it actually really helps making the film kinda on the meditative side. There is a bit of action which is well chorigraphed, it's not exactly wall to wall but that's because it's a bit more realistic which helps ground the film in reality.However were not in this for the action were in this for the mystery and the metadative extencial phylosophy. This truely is a thinking persons sci-fi which I always like as long as it holds my interest. The mystery is intreging which is this search for the identity of a replicant or hybrid child which is unusal because replicant's can't produce children until now. Though by it's nature that's just a motive device, the real mystery is K himself. This is probably my favorate role for Ryan Goslying, I really loved his character arc thoughout the film which corilates with one of themes of the film.His character's extensial dilemma parallels with Richard's in the past film. Just like Richard, K (which ironically is the initial for Killer as well as Philip's middle initial) is a Blade Runner a hit man/dectective whose job is to retire the old models for a hidden agenda by the corrupt company that has now monopolized the police force much like Omni Consumer Products from ""Robocop"". The guy really isn't his own person hense the fact he hardly has a name let alone a life as we see his apartment which is slightly sterile and bare, all he really has is his job which is really sad because it's a two dimentional existence.However what's interesting about him is he's a replicant or so he's lead to believe when he begans to uncover thoughout the film there might me more to him. Much like with Richard whom isn't sure if he's totally human. I really like how thoughout this film we're practically in the same boat as K as he is uncovering not just the facts to the mystery but constantly wondering about his own identity or even more of what it can be with his time with Joi.This soul search is part of what makes K become more human thoughout the film, because in a way that's what we all do everyday as time moves on we constantly wonder what more is their in our existence, is there more to ourselves, and can we be more?But to me the highlight is his interactions with his holographic partner/significant other Joi. Ana de Alma's is just excellent in the role, she the classic femine noir character as she radiates both physically and emotionally a lovely mysterious beauty. She also has the same extential dilemma; despite a hologram she is truly human because of what she feels and what more she wants to feel and discover for herself which to me is part of what being human is about.I really love the chemistry both of them have which I think is touching and lovely as we see her struggling to find way to become more human and get past her limitations which in a way goes with transcendence phylosphy which is about accending above our past limitations. There is a very interesting moment when she syncs with another woman in order to be able to make love to K, it's just a beautiful sequence but shows how far and close Joi has came to humanity.Harison Ford despite coming in around the third and final half is great as usual as Richard Deckard. Wherether Richard is a Replicant or not is still up in the air, though he's probably human due to living out as long as he has, unless he's a more advanced model that's programed with a longer life span. It doesn't mater, his character is still the same though a little on the grouchy side but due to what he's been though I don't blame him. But I like how we discover how far he's come especially which his relationship with Rachel which just shows how much he's transcended and has made both of them officially human.Humanity can never be retired.Rating: 4 stars",Blade Runner 2049
77,DarkVulcan29,Everything you would want in a Blade Runner sequel.,10,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner(1982) was a groundbreaking masterpiece, I have no doubt it inspired such films like Ghost in the Shell(1995), and I Robot(2004), to name a few, but was a sequel really needed here, the way the film ended it never felt left open for a sequel, and being Harrison Fords least favorite film, so this sequel hold up? I believe it does, never tries to be a rekindle of the original, there are a few throws back but this stands on it's own. Ryan Gosling plays his has Blade Runner named K, a very emotion less performance, but when he does explodes with anger he'll make you jump, you see he's a tormented character, and Gosling plays it too perfection. Jared Leto is also good has the creator of the new replicants, not in it much, but when he is, he just grabs you in the audience. I also liked Harrison Fords return has Decker, and yes there is a twist involving his character. The film is quite a dark vision of the future, just like the first film, but shown more here. If you like the original, then you'll give this film a look.",Blade Runner 2049
78,jamesrupert2014,Visually stunning,8,10 May 2018,"Picking up 20 years after the events portrayed in the original ""Blade Runner"" (1982) and continuing in that reality (i.e. extrapolating the future from the world of the first movie, not from world when it was made), ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a direct sequel to Ridley Scott's iconic film. Subservient replicants (synthetic humans) have replaced the potentially rebellious replicants that drove the plot of the original movie and the sequel follows K, one such replicant (Ryan Gosling) who is tasked by the LAPD to hunt down and destroy any remaining potentially dangerous older models. In doing so, he stumbles upon a secret that could jeopardise the dominance of naturally born humans. Continuing with the high-tech retro-noir of the first film, the visualisation of the bleak yet bustling post-apocalyptic world of 2049 is outstanding and the story of K's unravelling of a complex of misinformation, and his slow realisation of the humanity of Man's AI creations, including himself, is compelling. As much of the story is about deception and the 'replicant' technology includes synthetic memories, the 'unreliable narrator' is central to the narrative but is logical and consistent (although I would have thought the visualised memories would be POV). The film is quite long (163 minutes) and (IMO) slow moving at times, but other than that, is an excellent and 'worthy' sequel to what many people consider to be one most influential science fiction films ever made.",Blade Runner 2049
79,generationofswine,An Honest Review,6,7 May 2018,"Did it really need a sequel?It was beautiful. I mean, it looked beautiful...even if there was one part that made me motion sick, but even that part was beautiful. And that, I think, was really more of a lighting thing than a set design thing or a special effects thing.Honestly, you remember the lighting in this. You remember it the way people remember the lighting in an Edward Hopper painting.But did it need a sequel?The acting was great, it really was. There was honestly no real flaw as to how the movie looked, how it was directed, or how it was acted. It was pleasing......but it was also kind of empty. So, did it need a sequel? Questions were answered, but those questions were best left as questions weren't they? The little mysteries that fueled debate that made the first film so...talked about, even if it was initially hated.Why did those questions need to be answered? They were better left as little mysteries to ponder.And the result is the empty feeling you get when a really fun problem is finally solved. There is that A-HA moment of adulation...and than that little depression when you realize the mystery is finally over and you can move on.From now on the questions will be officially answered and as it doesn't hurt this movie, it doesn't take away from the film as a singular entity, it kind of kills the first film.Now we know it all and because of that, the first Blade Runner will never have the same feeling when you watch it.",Blade Runner 2049

This is a sequel to the 1982 Blade Runner and it takes place 30 years later. Ryan is a Blade Runner-he is a cop that hunts down and usually terminates replicants, human looking robots that have gone rogue. Robin is his boss. When Ryan finishes his latest job, he discovers a buried dead body that leads him to go looking for Harrison, a former Blade Runner that disappeared about 30 years earlier. The corporation that makes replicants is run by Jared, and he acts kind of weird, like a futuristic blind hippie. There are questions about who is or is not a replicant and Sylvia Hoeks-an actress from the Netherlands-does a good job as the female counterpart to Rutger Hauer-also from the Netherlands. The visuals are stunning in the way the future is portrayed. There are several scenes of people playing music and a holographic image of the performer is shown, as if they were performing live. I remember seeing Elvis, Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe-I know, she is not a singer but they still showed her. There are 3 of the original cast members that pop up too, and yes, Harrison is one of them. Harrison does not make his appearance until about an hour and forty five minutes into the film, but it's almost 3 hours long so that is just a little over half way through. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 44 minutes. If you liked the original movie, then you will probably like this one, too. I know I did and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Blade Runner 2049
81,JoeB131,"Boring, missing the point of the original",1,8 October 2017,"In the ongoing tradition of Harrison Ford's Action heroes of the 1980's turning out to be really terrible dads, we have Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to 1982's Blade Runner. We meet a replicant cop named K who is of a new variety that doesn't rebel unlike those bad ones in the movies. So he tracks down a Runaway Nexus 8, even though in the original movie, we were assured that Nexus 8's only had 4 year lifespans. During the course of this, they discover the bones of Sean Young's character from the original movie, along with the realization she had given birth. Our hero also has a relationship with a Hologram Girl for some reason. I guess so he is sad when she gets deleted later in the movie. If you are watching this movie to see Harrison Ford reprise his role as Deckard, you don't get to see him walking around like someone's confused grandpa until 2 hours into an interminably long movie. (Seriously, I feel bad for Ford. Why does he do this to himself?)So they want to find the child of Deckard and Rachel because this is a replicant that can reproduce, which is supposedly more efficient than just growing them, for some reason. They say they need more replicants to colonize the outer colonies, but of course, there are plenty of people living in squalor, including a child labor sweatshop. I can't emphasize enough how long, boring, uninteresting this movie was. It's like they watched the original and still had no idea what made it a good movie.",Blade Runner 2049
82,drqshadow-reviews,Strong Conceptual Sci-Fi That's Almost Exclusively Aimed at a Die-Hard Audience,7,17 January 2018,"Essentially a love letter to the thirty-five year old original, this long-overdue sequel takes great pains to revisit, recapture and expand the world originally populated by Ridley Scott in that timeless sci-fi classic. It's very particular about its authenticity, from the perennially hazy atmosphere to the glaring, inescapable corporate advertising and the darkly moody synth-driven score. The dressings are right and the mood is perfect, though it often seems more interested in fleshing out the state of technology in a depressed future society than swiftly advancing the plot. Slow rumination and observation are keynotes of the franchise, vital cogs in its construction, but they don't always seem as purposeful here as they did in 1982. The new model has extraneous characters everywhere; complex, colorful and helpfully disposable but also curiously unnecessary in the greater picture. As a huge fan, I loved the opportunity to dwell in the world again, to see how other cities in America have fared alongside LA's dystopia (spoiler: not well) and to appreciate the little oddities that have become fixtures in that noir-ish future vision. Those with less regard for the first film, though, will most likely find themselves bored by the ponderous pacing and frequently cryptic, hidden meanings. And I can't blame them. It's made, almost to the point of exclusion, for a single dedicated audience, virtually impenetrable without a fair knowledge of preceding events and the patience for multiple viewings. Even then, it doesn't seem like there's quite as much material to extract. Most of its riddles are clearly answered before the closing credits. A wonderfully competent modernization of the franchise, constantly enveloping and sweeping and awe-inspiring, but not perfect. Admirable to set its sights so high and to come so close. I'd be game for another.",Blade Runner 2049
83,parry_na,Thinly spread.,5,29 March 2018,"I believe they call this kind of film 'world building.' It's an apt description of the results of a talented production team using budget and effects to sustain a convincing environment in which you can immerse yourself. In my view, such is the potency of projects like this, actors are there primarily to compliment this imagined civilisation. In 1982, the original 'Blade Runner' achieved this perverse enigma very convincingly. Here all these years later, is the sequel.There was some mild controversy concerning original composer Vangelis not being assigned to provide a soundtrack for this, but Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer's score is impossible to fault. Vast, weird, laced with industrial swirls and chunky klaxons. Denis Villeneuve's direction is vast and eccentric, exactly as it should be, and the myriad of art directors ensure that the society, the interiors, the streets, even the habitat of Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford of course: grizzled, isolated, but still very much the same character we knew 35 years ago) is as impressive and spacious as it could be, an arena so absorptive and convincing, you can completely drink it in. My problem is, at 2 hrs 44 minutes, I really felt the need for a change of flavour after a while.It's impossible to be impressed at wonderful representations of an intricately carved tale for that length of time with no change of tone throughout, no levity, no particular sense of strident drama and only an irregular threat (Sylvia Hoek's splendid Luv). We have K (Ryan Gosling) and his girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas, who, as a perfectly pouting, characterless hologram, is very good) and the very slow story of Deckard's 'improbable' child Rachael, and the long trek to locate her. It is good, but thinly stretched over such huge running time. Wrapping it in the beauty of almost overwhelming effects and atmosphere is an impressive compensation, however.",Blade Runner 2049
84,XweAponX,Did they even see Blade Runner when it came out?,10,24 January 2018,"I always wonder why people who hated something RUSH to post an iMDB review about it. It's just a waste of time. I think it is because Franklin Graham told his congregation to log in here and write 10 1-stars per recent film. This might explain the large amount of identical 1-star reviews that can be seen, repeating themselves throughout the reviews section although apparently written by ""different people"". Different people from the same IP address, or Anonymiser. I come in here to read the diversity of reactions to film, and when I do not see diversity, but 1-stars written according to a formula (You'll notice these people always list the same 4 points for every movie playing in the theater that they attack), then I know that I am not seeing diversity, not true diversity. Real diversity is not a rubber stamp replica of 10 other reviews.Reviewer ""Horrorgasm"" has it spot on: I'm tired of people panning this film based on opinions of the original, which they never saw when it came out. I however, did see the original when it came out, and I saw this today. I was in shock and awe when I saw Roy Baty decide to love life at the end of Blade Runner, even Rick Deckard's life, and I was in shock when I watched ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) start piecing together the story of Rick and Rachel out of nothing but bones in a Box.The original Blade Runner got panned more for the differences to the Phillip K Dick novel than the Narration that was added without Ridley Scott's permission. And of course, adding the narration like that sucked. But I preferred the narration because it made the original flow like a 40's Noir film, and Ridley Scott got the look and feel of 40's Noir. When it comes to film, we always prefer what we had originally seen. There have been a few extended versions of films which I liked more. Normally, director's cuts are alternate edits, like Ridley's version of Alien, which has a few different scenes in it, but is not really an ""extended"" cut. But extended versions always have the original scenes, but with more added.But here, the same 10 ""people"" are complaining about ""Sequels"". They can relax, this is not a sequel. It's a seamless continuation. Denis Villeneuve had great respect in reconstructing the world of Bladerunner. Sets, Costumes, MUSIC. The moment this film starts, we know we are in the Replicant Universe, and we stay in that universe for about 2 and a half hours. My only real gripe is that Gaff, when we meet him in this film, is no longer talking in his colourful Street Speech, but it could also be that sometimes, when we get older, we drop things that were affectations.It is 30 years later, and Replicants are up to Nexus 8. There was some incident that EMP'd all of the electronics. No trees left on the planet. hard to tell which animals are real or if there are any left that are not cloned. and 'Skin Jobs"" are now allowed on Earth, but they have all the crappy jobs, the ones we hired slaves and immigrants to do in the past.This film continues the statement made in Blade Runner that ""disposable people"" have always been used to make civilizations. In Old Testament times, in Babylonian times, in Roman Times. Slaves built and died building the monuments. Slaves picked the cotton that made the south rich. And today, immigrants do all of those jobs for low pay, no benefits, and they even have taxes taken out for benefits they will never get, while the ICE waits to split up their families and deport them after 30 years of paying taxes.In this film, and the original, there are references to slaves and immigrants, in the representation of the Replicants. Their lives just do not matter. But there are a few, like ""Luv"" (Sylvia Hoeks) who works for ""Mr Wallace"" who somehow think they are equal and superior, while their owners (Jared Leto) continuously display contempt for her kind right in front of her, over and over again.There is a MacGuffin which has come to the attention of ""K"", his boss Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), Luv, and Mr Wallace, but it is ""K's"" efforts which show us his discoveries. In Fact, our attention is directed to the wrong person the whole time. A Memory points ""K"" to a certain course of action. But...Who has the best memories?",Blade Runner 2049
85,alindsay-al,A great sequel that is jaw dropping,8,8 October 2017,"This film has been gaining a lot of hype with some people saying it is the best film of the year, I have now seen blade runner 2049 and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film is set 30 years after the original seeing a new blade runner attempt to work out a mystery that could rock society. Ryan gosling plays agent k the main blade runner in this film and he does a great job carrying this film on his shoulders as the lead. He adds depth to his role as he goes through a real journey of discovery throughout the film which builds a lot of layers to the role. Harrison Ford reprises his role of deckard and he is really great in the film. He isn't in the film that much but when he is he owns every scene that he is in. Jared leto and Robin wright are in smaller roles in the film and they both do very solid jobs with what they are given to work with, which isn't that much. I really liked the character of goslings AI romantic interest and I was fully invested in them and there struggles in the film. The story similar to the first film has a lot of philosophical question's raised and they are interesting enough, I enjoyed watching the investigation that gosling had to go through in the film and as mentioned before the romance was a real strong point. But similar to the first film I feel like this film attempts too many sub plots that I really didn't care about that just caused the film to have a much longer run time then was necessary, which I will go into later. The script is very good, with a lot of well written dialogue that helps make these characters interesting to watch, mixed in with a little bit of fun humour too. The style of the film has jaw dropping amazing visual effects that really need to be seen to be believed, with some decent action scenes as well. However, now to the pacing of the film, this film is nearly 3 hours long and it really shouldn't have been. The film takes its time but to a ridiculous degree at times that will have you would dieting if you are enjoying the film, but I managed to pull through. Overall I actually prefer this film to the original blade runner and think it should definitely be seen especially if you are a fan of the original.",Blade Runner 2049
86,iquine,Every Frame Is Striking,10,2 November 2017,"(Flash Review)If this does not win an Oscar for Best Cinematography I'll be appalled. My eyes were tickled with glee throughout the impressive 2:45 runtime. This film was reminiscent of the original and honored the atmosphere, music score and the clean, minimal and captivating shot framing. It moved the core story points along 30 years in the future of what does it mean to be human, how emotions effect humanity and can beings that are 'made' truly feel human. The main objective of the film is for a more modern blade runner, named K, to track down Deckard, an older model for a crucial reason. Can or how will he achieve his objective? Much like the original the plot was slow to evolve which was OK for me as it left more than enough time to soak up the visuals and ponder the story. There were moments where the future technology reminded me of the film Her and Gosling's acting was right out of Drive. One quibble I had was I wish there was a bit more story detail to chew on or context of the future world we are presented with. A few times I was so swept up in the visual smorgasbord that I had to re-calibrate and think wait, where's the story going? Overall, it was an honorable sequel to a cult classic with meaty visuals and a deep yet sparse story.",Blade Runner 2049
87,Fluke_Skywalker,Blade Crawler,6,25 January 2018,"Plot; Officer K, a Blade Runner tasked with tracking down Replicants, begins to unravel a mystery that could shake a fragile society to its very foundation. The original Blade Runner is not an action film in even the loosest sense of the term, but it's also not a deep, meditative think piece. It's more of a tone poem; a dazzling marriage of music and visuals that move and evoke. Oh it has ideas, but it's no philosophical treatise. Blade Runner 2049 fancies itself a bit deeper than its predecessor, and to prove it, it goes on for over a half hour longer. In the end, I don't think it digs any deeper into its themes, and its impact is undermined by glacial pacing and a bloated run time.As far as the visuals, 2049 is the original's equal and then some. With a more diverse environmental palate at its disposal, it's utterly immersive and a wonder to behold. The score is a strong supporter in creating the mood, but it lacks the signature cues of Vangelis' iconic work. The cast do solid work. It takes a special talent to played muted without being boring, and for the most part they achieve that here.The last act of the film picks up a head of steam, culminating in an impactful and emotionally satisfying conclusion. If they'd somehow managed to trim some of the fat while also putting a bit more meat on its bones, this could very well have been a classic. As it stands, it's a film of tremendous technical merit too often undermined by a thin story stretched to and well past its breaking point.",Blade Runner 2049

It's a race-against-time and Wallace sets his best replicant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) with the task of getting to Deckard before K, but who will reach Deckard first?When reviewing this film I have the advantage that it was only fairly recently since I watched the original film so a lot of what happened in the original film is still fairly fresh in my mind...And unfortunately, that only makes this worse for this belated sequel.. For a start, the film is unbearably slow-paced, far too long, with messy plotting, uninteresting and underwritten characters. It's fair to say that the original film was not perfect and suffered from some of these problems, but even the weaker aspects of the original film were stronger than the strongest aspects of this film.When I watched the original film, I did find myself much more involved in the story; the replicants and their cause was straight-forward and despite them being the antagonists I did find myself having some empathy with their cause. The replicants were also better developed and it has to be said that they also gave far more memorable performances; Rutger Hauer's terrifying turn still resonates with me now as well as Darryl Hannah's sassiness is also something that lingers in the mind. Deckard and Rachael's romance was also handled sensitively and with some degree of believability. The problem is that you get none of that here; the characters are uninteresting, the narrative is a bit choppy, at times it also feels a bit unfocused and really hard to care about. Worst than all of this though is that it's a pretty dull film it's supposed to be a chase picture so why not make it feel like one? Instead of this it's filled with a lot of lengthy rambling scenes that don't seem to add much to the story - in fact all they do is add to the already long running time.The cast do the best with what they have to work with, but no-one really stood out for me; Gosling sleepwalks through the film and does nothing of interest at any point. I felt more could have been done with him living a lonely existence with his only interaction being with his non-real girlfriend, but this never really develops. Sylvia Hoeks is probably the best thing about this film, but she isn't strong enough to carry this on her own. Jared Leto tries to add some menace, but isn't in the film enough to make much of an impression. Harrison Ford makes an appearance late on, but is probably more transfixed on past glories and wondering why he chose to sign up for this in the first place?It isn't all bad though, like the original it's a strikingly beautiful looking film - although with the exception of the odd touch here or there it doesn't look all that different to the original (particularly the shots within the city). The action sequences are reasonably good - although again perhaps I appreciated those more based on how uninteresting I found the film as a whole.It's not completely irredeemable, but it's weak compared to the original and feels somewhat unnecessary.",Blade Runner 2049

92,kluseba,A remedy against sleepless nights,3,7 November 2017,"Are you seeking a remedy against sleepless nights? You won't need any prescriptions to solve your problem. You simply need to watch Blade Runner 2049. Almost everything that could be wrong with a movie is wrong with this one. To start on a positive note, the visual effects are faithful to the original film, the directing is precise and doesn't feature any annoying contemporary shaky camera passages and the last third of the movie quickens up the pace and is at least slightly interesting. These three positive elements explain my rating but I really had to think very hard to find these reasons.Let's talk about this movie's massive problems. First of all, the film is way too long and takes nearly three hours to tell a story that would have justified a length under a hour and a half. The original movie wasn't the most fast-paced genre film ever made but it was bearable with a length just below the two-hour mark.Secondly, the plot is quite tiresome and can be summarized in three sentences. When things finally could start to get interesting, the film actually ends without a resolution. This makes me fear the worst. It's quite probable that there will be a sequel to this sequel which means that even those who haven't appreciated Blade Runner 2049 might feel forced to watch the sequel to know how the story actually ends. If you don't want to go through that dilemma, don't watch Blade Runner 2049 in the first place. While the original film is overrated in my book and doesn't do Philip K. Dick's novel justice, it had at least a coherent plot diagram featuring an exposition, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution.Thirdly, the movie tries to be overtly atmospheric but ends up being pretentious. There are numerous shots when characters walk through decayed landscapes in slow-motion. This idea might work every now and then to emphasize on the dystopian future that serves as setting but the idea is overused and prevents any momentum or pace to build up. The original film was slow as well but also had a few emotional and vivid sequences that contrasted the bleak vision of the future.Fourthly, the soundtrack of this movie is awful despite being written by renowned composer Hans Zimmer. Whenever the movie is dragging on and showing the main character walking through empty buildings for five minutes, the soundtrack suddenly gets louder for no apparent reason but to keep the bored audience awake. This surprising effect got my attention in the beginning but after it was used for a third time in a row, this strategy became laughably predictable. The present soundtrack tries to capture the essence of Vangelis' gloomy compositions for the original film but doesn't even manage to be a rough blueprint of the original score.Fifthly, aside of Harrison Ford's character who returns in the last third of the film when the pace quickens up a little bit, most of the other characters are quite pale. Especially Ryan Gosling's characters is so faceless that you won't care about his destiny at all. Jared Leto's villain character seems to be stolen from a weak episode of a science-fiction television series of the late sixties at best. The few interesting side characters such as Carla Juri's are underdeveloped and only have a few minutes of screen time despite the film's epic length. It's quite ironic that the most interesting character is the main character's holographic girlfriend played by Ana de Armas. The original film had several memorable performances by less talented actors like Rutger Hauer who were pushed by a great director while this film doesn't have that chemistry despite the skilled personnel involved.It was a pain to sit through the entire movie. I felt like walking out of cinema numerous times but I stayed because I had paid for it and because I was expecting a surprising ending. Now I know that I should have walked out. Despite the great director involved, several outstanding actors and actresses on board and even one of the best soundtrack composers in the history of cinema, Blade Runner 2049 is boring, hollow and uninspired. The original film was overrated in my book but this sequel is plain horrible. It's a mystery why this film got such a solid critical acclaim but hundreds of negative reviews prove that I'm not the only one who disliked this vapid flick. For me, Blade Runner 2049 even beats the shallow Kong: Skull Island in terms of negativity and is what I consider the worst film of the year. My suggestion for you is to read Philip K. Dick's novel instead of spending any money on this disaster.",Blade Runner 2049
93,Pairic,Flying Cars Are Here!,9,7 August 2018,"Blade Runner 2049: Flying cars, lots of flying cars. Flying in formation; crashing through windows; crash-landing after being shot with an Emp enabled harpoon; involved in dogfights; sinking in the sea; providing an arena for fights to the death. Yes! The Flying Cars are here! If anything we have an even darker, gloomier setting for this sequel. There are snowstorms in LA, there are sandstorms. Traditional farming has largely collapsed, replaced by Synthetic Farms introduced by the Great Saviour Nilander Wallace (Jared Leto) who has also acquired the remains of Tyrell Corporation.The film opens with Blade Runner K (Ryan Gosling) tracking down a replicant on a farm, a Nexus 8 model which has an open ended life span. The replicant has been hiding out there for 30 years. As he terminates the farmer we learn that K is himself a replicant. A new, obedient model which is subjected to regular loyalty tests. K faces prejudice from other police officers, at home he has a holographic wife, Joi (Ana de Armas). He also encounters a pleasure replicant, Mariette (MacKenzie Davis).The remains of another long dead replicant are located on the farm and they point to a biological mystery which causes K's boss (Robin Wright) to send him on a quest. This will takes him from LA to a largely abandoned and ruinous San Diego and from there to a radioactive Las Vegas where her encounters Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) and engages in a fistfight with him as holograms of Elvis and Liberace perform in the background. But Wallace's killer replicant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is on a similar quest.An SF thriller which lives up to the magic of the original but leaves some question tantalisingly unanswered. 9/10.",Blade Runner 2049

95,Enchorde,An experience,10,28 December 2018,"Bladerunner 2049 picks up the story somewhat after the original Bladerunner. Replicant K is a police hunting older versions of replicants. At his latest mission he got word of a miracle, the start of a mystery that threatens the order of the world. There is talk of a replicant giving birth, which makes K question his loyalties, and his own identity.I really loved this. There is a feel to the movie, that is hard to match. I was impressed by the use of colour, light, framing and sound. Visually and audibly, this is stunning. The mystery plot don't lack much either. For once the story is given time, time to develop, time for the audience to reflect, think and feel, not just force fed action-scenes. There is time to give the pictures, the sound and colour, space to work. The pace is rather slow, making the movie rather long (almost three hours) but it is really worth it. There are some good action now and then, but the point of the movie is the mystery, and the questions of identity it rises. If you want it, there is depth. I really liked that, although it is long, no scene is unimportant. There is toughts, clues and developments everywhere. Even the reappearance of Deckard has a crucial part to play, and is not at all just a wave to fans of the old movie. I am utterly impressed by the work of director Villenueve , cinematographer Deakins and the other crew.Ironically, many of the main characters not being human, the acting is great. That Gosling and Ford are quality actors are established but both Hoeks and de Armas was pleasant new actresses. Funny that de Armas virtual character perhaps is the most human of them all.To sum up, this movie got it all. Watch it!",Blade Runner 2049
96,aidanratesmovies,Brilliant,9,31 March 2020,"Brilliantly shot, directed, and acted- Blade Runner 2049 may not live up to the hype as one of the greatest sequels ever made, but it certainly a worthy sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi classics of all time. Ryan Gosling leads the film as the Blade Runner referred to as K. Through Gosling's great acting, as always, and the deep insight to the characters life, the performance doesn't just seem like a standout but truly one of the greater characters portrayed in a sci-fi movie period. Harrison Ford also returns as Deckard Shaw, but his part is smaller than I expected, and seemingly pointless. At times, the film can seem a bit tough to follow, which can be even more troublesome considering how long it is (around 2hr and 45 min). But despite the overstuffed story, the film does delve into some great conversations and worldbuilding that makes the film ever the more interesting. The cinematography in the film is fantastic, with more great shots than I could count. Denis Villeneuve again provides excellent direction, and brings the films to new heights, that are both fresh and quite compelling. In the end, Blade Runner 2049 can be a bit hard to understand at times, but is full of fun twists and turns that are more than interesting. The sci-fi worldbuilding in the film is phenomenal, along with its cinematography, and performances. The film feels very real, which is tough to do, considering the already stellar circumstances of the first film, but it nails it. It may not be quite as compelling as the original,but for fans and many more, it still deserves a place in our hearts.

97,dierregi,Do tears freeze in the snow?,1,15 October 2017,"BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big ""plot twist"" that I won't mention, not because it would spoil much, but because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be disappointed by its stupidity.The big ""twist"" is mentioned as the ""miracle"", but it is absolutely idiotic and illogical from the point of view of a manufacturer of replicants. How did ""that"" might have ever be considered a good idea? One would assume that after the disaster of the Nexus 6 series, Tyrell Co. and his successors would have invented some more reliable security system - such as a lower level of self-consciousness, way safer than the questionable ""obedience"" of the Nexus 8. Or even something like all the androids looking the same, so that they can be easily detected and you would not need blade runners to locate and eliminate them.Anything that would provide humanity with useful, free labor without ethical problems But no, in this movie ethical problems just got exponentially bigger. And so much for a science so advanced as to reproduce perfect bodies and minds...Besides, since it is established that humankind sucks, I failed to understand how replicants are in any way better, since they just want to be more ""like humans"". On the visual side, BR2049 sucks, too. Looks like they used random leftovers scenery from other Sci-Fi/disaster movies, from the overused industrial background of Terminator to the desertic blurred landscape of MadMax and the inevitable nightmarish city-scape, which looks like Blade Runner, but on cheap side. Costumes looks like the contemporary drab clothing promoted by Nordic high street chains: lots of dark, cheap-looking leggings and stretchy tops, a far cry from the decadent, elaborate futuristic/retro suits of BR.In one scene, Deckard meets Tyrell's successor in a closed room filled with water, except a square island in the middle. A room that has no other reason to exist except bringing back memories of the ""original"" Tyrell building.The dialog is unbelievable bad and scenes drag on forever. When the Goslin character finds Deckart, the two spend over ten minutes fighting and chasing each other, when a couple of lines of dialogue would have avoided that. The ending is both manipulative and plagiarist: it wants to move the audience, recreating the amazing poetic moment of Roy Batty's death, but using snow instead of rain. If nothing else, the ending would have been enough to put me off this piece of commercial garbage.",Blade Runner 2049
98,truemythmedia,A Miracle of Cinema,10,1 November 2019,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a minor miracle. A sequel no one was asking for, it follows up a beloved classic sci-fi film that was genre changing in its own day. How could anyone thing that it needed a follow up?Thank goodness they did, because this is one of those rare instances where the remake, reboot, sequel, soft reboot, re-imagining, or whatever you want to call it, actually turned out to be not just as good as the original, but in it's own contemporary context, as effective as the original in its original context.This film follow K (Ryan Gosling, ""Drive"") as he tries to find a specific replicant which has eluded capture so far. This particular replicant may be the first of its kind, a replicant that was not manufactured but born. Of course there are forces at play that want to stop him, help him, and use him as he conducts this search and unraveling of the various plots at play but the heart of the film is K's search for meaning, since he is a replicant himself.Just as in the first film, the questions at play are really about what makes us human, sentient, or alive. How unique are we? K struggles with this because his life seems pretty straightforward. You do what you were created to do. When he starts to suspect that he may not have been created by a person it brings up issues of destiny, choice, and action. Now that his choices are his own, what will he do with them? Were they always his own even though he didn't realize it? How much of what has transpired was the invisible guiding of another person and how much was his own?Story wise, this film is not that impressive. The plot is simple with a couple good revelation moments but most of the story beats are seen coming a mile away. This is ok, though. The movie spends the most time on what it should be spending time; the character complexities and philosophical questions of the audience watching. Languorous takes, stunning production design, eye watering color, and cinematography with texture give this film a feel that you want to wrap up in as you contemplate your own existence.If I had gone to see this movie with the expectation that I was about to see the next 'chapter of the blade runner saga,"" I would have been disappointed. The world is not much expanded, though some changes are hinted at. Frankly, if that's what anyone went to this movie for, I'd have to ask them if they even saw the first film. It is very similar in tone, pacing, and interest as this one.But, since, what I was hoping for was a meditative sci fi epic which muses on the reality of being, existence, and life in the universe, I was not disappointed in the slightest. This film was everything a cinephile could ask for in a blockbuster summer release from one of the big studios even if it was an unusual one.",Blade Runner 2049
99,jadepietro,"Visually Stunning, But Running on Empty",7,11 October 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Eye-popping visuals a-plenty, but the film delivers little for the mind.SYNOPSIS: A ""blade runner"" searches for a missing person in this sci-fi epic.JIM'S REVIEW: I remember seeing the original Blade Runner back in 1982 and being transported to a strange new world. The starkly lit visuals, well staged action sequences by Ridley Scott, and the macho Harrison Ford made the movie-going experience quite memorable. The plot, however, was a confusing mess and I truly never understood the rapturous cult adoration that followed. Now, after 35 years, comes its sequel, Blade Runner 2049, and oddly, the overall effect of this new replica about replicants is mostly the same old, albeit quite dazzling, but a bit more boring and a lot more addled this time around.In truth, Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most visually arresting movies of the year. Now at the helm of the film is Denis Villeneuve, a very skilled director. He brings his powerful images to the forefront, but over intellectualizes the film to the point of confusion. He is taking us on an epic sci-fi journey, the mere length of the film, clocking in at nearly 3 hours, wants to indicate its greatness, as if size really matters.Yet the film hopelessly meanders from one tedious plot point to the next, with many scenes that cry out for some judicious editing and characters in need of better clarity. As the film relies on a convoluted script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, it tries to construct an involving and coherent narrative and never really succeeds. It is the woeful screenplay that needs a major reboot as it continually short circuits all the artistry on display.The absolutely stunning photography by the great Roger Deakins pays perfect homage to the neon noir color tones and stark lighting effects of its predecessor and his lens captures an array of contrasting places, from the dusty amber sandstorms of a dystopian Las Vegas to the urban squalor of Los Angeles with its giant female objectified holograms showing the chaotic future. Wonderful production design by Dennis Gassner adds to the film's visual look...absolutely gorgeous. The CGI by is stunning also.The film is very well cast, with Mr. Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard with the needed gratis. His presence immediately legitimizes the project. Ryan Gosling, quite convincing as K, a tough shamus trying to solve his case, is very strong in his role as well. There is a nice chemistry between both actors once they cross paths, which unfortunately takes nearly two hours to fulfill that cinematic promise for avid moviegoers. Also giving fine support are Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, and Sylvia Hoeks who makes one mean villain. Only Jared Leto seems out of place in a poorly written role as an evil entrepreneur / oracle figure that want to control the replicant population. He lacks real menace and slows down an already slow story-line.So it is with mixed results that I recommend this film. Blade Runner 2049 is certainly worthy of your attention for its sheer visual accomplishments. Imagine a sci-fi film with touches of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, and a little Terrence Malick pretension thrown in to reach that metaphysical level of awe, and you have the essence of Mr. Villeneuve's eye-fetching film. Beautiful to behold, but the mind longs for more.",Blade Runner 2049

At 156 minutes, the Rutger Hauer/Daryl Hannah type of replicant is sorely missed, and it does not have the poetry, novelty or force of its predecessor. You have instead a couple of gratuitous scenes pretending to be funny (as the one featuring ""Elvis Presley""), a mini-battle ""a la Star Wars"", and what is worse... almost all the plot is too predictable. Thirty years later androids no longer dream of electric sheep but visual effect galore and prepare for revolution (lol), to illustrate the weeping tale of a man searching for momma. Or so he thinks. Ryan Gosling (as in many films) is beaten to death, but he just goes on as impassible as replicants should be. Watch it.",Blade Runner 2049
102,rgkarim,Crime-Noire Runs The Show: Not A Thrilling as I had Hoped,8,5 October 2017,"There are plenty of movies in Hollywood, only some of which ever reach legendary status that seals their place in history. These sacred films were usually ended in a manner that didn't require a sequel, but leave it to the big studios to not leave things along. Tonight, Blade Runner 2049 premiers to the public, alongside some high review scores and plenty of praise. Despite the decades long gap, this movie holds promise to be just as good as the sequel. Robbie K is here to share some thoughts on the latest flick and help guide your viewing pleasures. LIKES:True Sci-Fi Crime: The trailers don't lie when they say Blade Runner 2049 is a crime noire film. It opens with the reference back to the first film and soon uncovers a mystery that will run the course of the movie. As this occurs, the other parties are seeking ways to hinder our ""hero"" (Ryan Gosling) from uncovering the truth. Like a glorified episode of half the crime-dramas on television, Blade Runner 2049 is all about capitalizing on a prolonged crime and mixing as much drama into it to help add character development. All of this is nicely wrapped up in a science- fiction spin, integrating the floating ships, robots, and large computers as the theater it unfolds in. Emotionally Artistic: The thing that many reviewers seem to appreciate is that the movie brings a lot of emotional punch to the audience. Our directors managed to interject a lot of feeling into Gosling's supposedly emotional character. As his story continues to unfold, you'll be submerged into the psychological nightmare he is forced to face. While the traumatic stress is certainly enough to pull some heart strings, it's the artistic portrayal of determining one's self that adds fuel to the fire. Self-Identity, a thing many struggle with, is well-addressed in this film, trying to uncover the truth about his self, all while solving the crime. Throw in a rather deep, albeit weird, romance story and you will round out the emotional plot lines many seek. Acting: A character is only as good as the actor who portrays it to life and Blade Runner 2049 is a shining example of quality acting. Gosling as the lead was a good choice, his ability to play a man with an identity crisis is quite believable, primarily in the way he seems to stand on the border of sane and psychopathic. While not his best role, I enjoyed seeing the anti-hero part played by him again. Harrison Ford reprises his edge well enough, but I felt they didn't utilize him as well as they could. Ana De Armas: I was happy to see more of Ana in this film, seeing her branch down some more emotional pathways, all while driving the character development of Gosling's character. Yet, I can't lie, that she was beautiful in the various outfits she shifted into during the film. I got the best of both world in this film, and appreciated the costumes that she sported in her awkward scenes. DISLIKES:Not so thrilling: The first Blade Runner had some suspense to it, the constant thrill of the chase as Ford tried to hunt down the rogue androids. It kept the pace going, all while integrating the elements I mentioned in the likes section. Blade Runner 2049 though wasn't that thrilling to me. The action was rather bland, the emotion with it almost as flat, and had little suspense outside of how much torture some of the characters could take. I expected a little more spice to the mix, but don't let the trailers fool you, the thrills were more like spills. Long: If a movie is going to be nearly three hours, it needs to either move, or have an exciting climax. I found neither of these elements in this movie, but instead a very drawn out movie that seemed to drag. While the message and artistic license are appreciated, the editors could have really dropped half the footage to get me out of the theater faster. Perhaps if the ending hadn't been predictable I would have been more intrigued, but I found myself fighting sleep at times because from these elaborate, and often unnecessary details. Predictable Story and Under Utilized Characters: Blade Runner 2049 might have been a well- built Sci-Fi Crime story, but that doesn't mean it wasn't predictable. Most of the ""twists"" I got in the first hour, leaving me nearly two to go until they revealed it. In addition, my expectations of where the story was going were also shattered as other characters were underutilized for more sappy looks and near depression. This especially goes for Ford and Leto, who I felt got the short-end of the stick in this film. Throw in some of the loose ends, more like bait for the next film, and it left me unsatisfied with where the story was going. Loud: Many films are loud in a theater with blaring music and special effects to make the seats shake. This movie though, just had obnoxious sound effects that were high-pitched groans, mixed with a soundtrack that while unique was not the most pleasing to me. Brace yourselves for this interesting sound soiree, because you are going to hear it a lot. The VERDICT:Blade Runner 2049 is artistic, a visual display that is packed with emotion, Sci-Fi charm, and a crime noire element. It has much of the same feel as its predecessor, but I felt it lacked the suspense and thrills that the trailers promised back in the teaser. Sadly the predictable story, underutilized characters and audio assault didn't justify the nearly three hour run time for me. Don't see this one when your energy is low folks, or you just might be fighting sleep. My Scores:Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",Blade Runner 2049
103,invisibleunicornninja,A load of pretentious bs.,6,16 April 2018,"This movie is dumb. The first movie was also dumb, but it at least managed to be somewhat entertaining and interesting. This movie is nearly THREE HOURS LONG and I couldn't imagine seeing this thing in theaters.Plot - The pacing of this movie is even worse than the first one. At least the first movie was movie-length. This movie should've at least been split into two parts or maybe turned into a mini-series. By the end of this movie I was so bored I watched an Avengers movie (I was going to watch it anyways, but still). I wouldn't be complaining if things actually happened in this movie, but they don't. Sure, there's slightly more of an overall story in this movie then the previous one - the main character is trying to figure out is identity and then you think he does but in the end he doesn't or maybe its all left up to interpretation which would be fine if it was at least interesting - but there are way too many overlong and unneeded establishing shots and endless filler of people just standing around or sitting around and doing NOTHING. Characters - None of the characters are developed well. You'd think with so many and of almost THREE GODDAMN HOURS we'd get to know some of them. Even the main guy whose name I forget was pretty weak. Most of the performances were pretty bad - even from the guys who were in the first one. Sights and Sounds - The cinematography and effects are all fantastic. The music is very bland. This boring movie could've been slightly more entertaining if the very music wasn't trying to put me to sleep. I will say though, the music fits the tone of the movie. No, I would not recommend this movie. Though it is somewhat competent, it is overlong and boring with weak characters and a weak plot. Also, I'm not sure if I mentioned this, ITS NEARLY THREE HOURS LONG.",Blade Runner 2049
104,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Blade Runner 2049,4,9 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 (my latest review) is the long-awaited sequel to 1982's cult hit, Blade Runner. Guess what, I'm gonna compare the two films outright. Like GEICO, it's what I do.""2049"" is forty-five minutes longer than Blade Runner, ""2049"" expands on Blade Runner's universe from three-plus decades ago, and ""2049"" is a little more violent and more action-packed. Still, Blade Runner 2049 is discombobulated. It's an inferior product that doesn't quite manifest as a rightful companion piece. There's less mystery, less darkness, no hypnotic Vangelis music, and less of a noir feel this time around. Sadly, those are the things I liked about the first outing.Now would I consider Blade Runner from 82' a masterpiece? Not quite. I'd still recommend it though. The storytelling is tighter than in ""2049"" despite both flicks being vehemently slow-paced. Blade Runner is a pioneer in the visual effects department and has a poignant, ironic ending. Blade Runner 2049 by comparison, is a nettlesome exercise that has too many ideas and tries too hard to be relevant. Sure its look is decent enough. But with a bloated running time, some scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor, and some shaky editing, Blade Runner 2949 ends up being an annoying, sci-fi slog.People all over the world have been debating the humanoid status contained in the first Blade Runner. These fanboys have been doing it for the past thirty-five years. With ""2049"", they'll probably just sigh and wonder what all the new fuss is about.Harrison Ford reprises his Rick Deckard character for what feels like a minuscule cameo. Regrettably, he doesn't act with the mannerisms of Deckard enough to think that you believe he's back in Rick's nominal saddle again. It's almost a thankless performance. Then you have Ryan Gosling in the lead as protagonist K/Joe. Gosling is basically playing himself here. He's quiet, solemn, and appears like a less nastier version of his Driver trouper from 2011's Drive. Finally, there's Jared Leto as the ill-defined villain in Niander Wallace. It's Suicide Squad all over again because Leto barely registers in his role. It's like his presence feels akin to a separate motion picture altogether. That can't be good.All in all, Blade Runner 2049 unfortunately comes off like other sequels in the past. You'd rather watch the first film again the minute ""2049's"" closing credits come up.

105,justin-fencsak,Underrated classic,8,27 January 2018,"When the director of Arrival, Dennis Villenueve, came on board to direct the sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 cult classic Blade Runner, he crafted a nearly 3 hour visual fx feast that's high on substance, and low on storyline. Harrison Ford doesn't even appear until halfway through the movie, and that's a shame. The rest of the cast though shimmers and the score lives up to the original by Vangelis. The dialogue was so hard to hear that i had to put on captions to read what was going on. It's sad that this movie failed to break even at the box office, just like the original Blade Runner when it came out during the summer of ET, 1982.

I just heard the words Blade Runner but didn't know exactly that it was a film, nor did I know it's story-line, theme, or that it was a book series before hand, let alone when it was released! This film, Blade Runner 2049, takes place 30 years since the last, though the film itself is made 35 bloody damn years after the 1982 original! That's way, way way way too long to make a sequel, the excuses are simply not good enough, this could've been a damn remake, that's how long ago it was made!Anyway, having heard about this film coming up & from a friend of mine, I decided to give this a watch, though I noticed that this was 163 minutes long, but I was willing to give it a watch despite also not being a Sci-Fi fan!I found the film to be stupidly, stupidly long! Way too loud & I'm on 23 not 80! It was confusing I didn't have a clue what was going on from the get go! The film dragged & dragged some more & it got duller & duller, by the time it got to the 1 hour mark I was already beginning to get restless & bored. The film just simply plodded on for too long & it was 1 hour too long than it needed to be! It could've been 90 minutes short, but pointless scenes dragging on unnecessarily & other pointless dragged out parts had to be in there! It slowed down the pacing to well below the 1 mph mark! The sound was extremely loud, too loud even for someone like myself whose used to watching loud action films with gunfire sounds booming explosions! But this film was badly edited though length & sound mix it was just bad! The story-line was confusing & made no sense, the length & pacing didn't help with this as you forgot what was what at the beginning! Not to mention the middle to which even then the film felt stretched & like it was never going to end! It went on & on & on & on & on...! If you know what I mean, it was slower than a damn tortoise! How many times do I have to emphasis to these idiots who make these films? Cut! The! Shite! OK!? Less is more! Short & Sweet! You get me!? This film could've been over & hour short! 1 hour & 10-20 minutes of fine tune super cut editing should've done it & of course made the film better, that & to beef the story-line up & make it more simpler to understand for those who weren't even born when the first Blade Runner was released! Cutting the shite & trimming the fat! That's how they should've edited this film! But no!They have to make it long & dragged out! So sense mental! By the time it got to the end, you were just glad to get out of there! You didn't care for the end result because you too bored to even care, you only cared that it ended in the first place let alone the content of the ending which just like the pacing & story-line, was proper arse!The reviewers are clearly paid, once again, to write great 10/10 reviews! Because any old tosser who gets £20 million flung onto their lap would take money like morons right!? Gullible tossers! I guess Money does really talk & well Bullshite does actually walk!

109,bkrauser-81-311064,It May Be Almost Too Good!,8,8 October 2017,"This movie shouldn't have worked. Ignoring for a moment that Blade Runner 2049 is a long gestating sequel to a landmark achievement in genre cinema; the fact that this movie is vying for a high-level of complexity and grandeur alone means it's already got a tough road to haul. Not even the original Blade Runner (1982) achieved those ends the first time around. I mean there is seven different versions of the movie out there each boasting varying degrees awesome. So it'd be hard to use the idiom lightening striking twice when technically it didn't even hit once.This movie could have so easily been Ghost in the Shell (2017). It could have fallen into the abyss of mediocre movies trying desperately to expound on the metaphysical with nary an understanding of the medium of film. Even with director Denis Villeneuve at the helm – the only name I would have trusted if I inexplicably owned the rights to this property – this thing could have so easily gone off the rails.Well we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief. 2049 is decidedly not a disaster. It is in fact, a stunningly beautiful, complex and audacious cinematic achievement. Not only does it reinstate Ridley Scott's original post-apocalyptic vision of Los Angeles but it uses said vision as a great jumping off point. There are piece of the old but at its heart 2049 is a bold new narrative in a beautifully rendered world that seamlessly incorporates a larger even grander design. It's truly is almost unnerving how good this movie is. At least as a standalone feature.2049 takes place about thirty years after rugged replicant hunter Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly took a bounty job that all but shattered his worldview. Since that time, Wallace Corp, an inheritor of Tyrell's patents has created newer, more abiding replicants, one of which is the unfeeling Blade Runner K (Gosling). But when a routine ""retiring"" mission leads K to a body buried in the middle of a farm, K's seemingly ordinary investigation leads him to potentially earth shattering implications.Much like the original, the ""mystery"" is pretty much there to frame the film's loftier ambitions. No attempt is made to make it more complex than it needs to be, which might irk a few audience members unaccustomed to the film's steadier pace. There's no denying it's a pretty straightforward swoop down the rabbit hole that, like most classic noir tales almost seems beside the point.The rub here - again, much like the original - is the atmospherics i.e. its unique mix of heavy sci-fi trimmings, tech-noir distinctions and Wagnerian operatics. Villeneuve is no shrinking violet when it comes to this kind of stuff and thanks to impossibly great cinematography by the great Roger Deakins, every frame sits at the perfect nexus of belying information and being just so emotionally satisfying in its beauty.The film is almost too good! It's technical superiority and pitch-perfect mimicry comes at the expense of soiling some of the original Blade Runner's most enduring elements. Starting with the obvious; Deckard's inclusion in this movie puts to rest the theory that he was himself a replicant. Less obvious is 2049's lived-in quality. Blade Runner was the introduction to this world and as such should be given credit for its thickly laid, almost impenetrable mythology and the enduring legacy therein. But 2049 is the meticulously thought out expansion set that comes at a time when audiences have the ability to really geek out over the franchise in universum. It basically has Empire Strikes Back (1980)-syndrome. It took a fluke of an idea that shouldn't have worked but did and improved on it.The ultimate irony is if you change around a few names and places 2049 could have been its own thing. The narrative pencils in obligatory homage where it works and lord knows Harrison Ford turns in the best performance he's given since Witness (1985). But every time Mackenzie Davis was channeling Daryl Hannah or Jared Leto was doing his King Herod routine I kept thinking, ""Boy wouldn't it be cool if Rutger Hauer showed up?"" ""Wouldn't it be cool if Joe Turkel showed up?"" If 2049 was introduced as a completely original idea ""inspired"" by Blade Runner, there'd be less distraction. Then who knows how much further we could have gotten.Luckily the cast of 2049 is game to fill the void placed by long deceased characters. Sylvia Hoeks is quite a find as the cold, vamping villain at-large. On the other side of the emotional divide Ana de Armas channels a refreshing amount of vulnerability as a hapless projected AI who provides K with much needed emotional support. As K, Gosling isfine. He's basically pulling the same instinctively driven, vacant-eyed shtick he debut in Drive (2011) which I guess is how the character is written. Rest assured if every leading white guy in Hollywood but him got the plague, the mononym-ed antihero trope would still remain well tended.Much like Deckard and K at the close of this beautiful looking epic, my world has been thoroughly wrecked after seeing 2049. Granted, I was hopeful that this movie was going to be good. But if it wasn't, I could always fall back on the self-satisfaction of knowing what I thought was obvious – making a sequel 30 years after the fact is not a good idea. I may have to rethink my life but I'll hold off on critical paradigm shifts until the director's cut comes out.",Blade Runner 2049
110,mhorg2018,An unnecessary sequel,3,8 November 2017,"There are some movies that get made that should never be diluted by a sequel. This movie is one of them. Following in the footsteps of his absolutely terrible Arrival (The aliens don't understand our concept of time. Five minutes later it's we'll be back for your help in 3000 years). Dennis Villaneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is too long, too dull and too derivative of the original. A sequel that's based on what I feel is a lame story line (which I can't give away simply because it's a major spoiler). While the look of the film is in line with the original, if not dirtier, the movie itself really goes nowhere. I can see why it bombed at the theaters. It really isn't for anyone who's not a fan of the original. It's another in Ridley Scott's recent line of failures (even though he only produced it. It want's to be a smart movie, but honestly, the only smart movie I've seen recently is Ex Machina, which was brilliant, something this movie isn't. There are parts that were interesting, but overall the entire film just plods from scene to scene. Ryan Gosling's inability to emote doesn't help this. Nor does waiting nearly 2/3rds of a too long run time for Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard to show up. I have to say that I wasn't looking forward to this film and now that I've seen it, I'm disappointed.",Blade Runner 2049
111,jellopuke,the best possible sequel,10,4 November 2017,"I will admit that I was dreading this. I was worried they were going to double down on the Harrison Ford is a replicant angle that Ridley Scott seems to push so much which in my opinion ruins the movie and is stupid, but they didn't! I was worried they were going to go all shaky cam, action overload, but they didn't! I was worried they'd dumb down the story and they didn't! This was all that I hoped it could be, with actual themes, characters, and drive. Loved it! Glad Ford was only in it for a short bit, glad that it had its own story while playing off the original, glad that it had something to say! So glad this wasn't another terrible Hollywood remake/reboot but was it's own thing!",Blade Runner 2049
112,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Blade Runner 2049""- A stirring and cerebral sci-fi thriller that is in every way equal to the outstanding original!",10,27 October 2017,"Over the past thirty years, Ridley Scott's iconic masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" has quietly reigned as a beloved and treasured cult classic in the world of science fiction. An off-kilter and introspective drama taking heavy cues from old-fashioned film noir, that original film has been long studied and analyzed, and is an oft-cited favorite film among movie enthusiasts the world over. And for very good reason, as it can function not only as a surface-level thriller, but also as a strangely complex and philosophical experience should you choose to look beneath the visuals and really take in the themes and tone.Though the journey was most certainly not a smooth one, with the original cut of the film being butchered by studio interference and met with a general initial apathy from viewers. However, with subsequent releases, the audience and appreciation has grown on a consistent basis, and the film is now recognized rightly for all it does so well. So it should come as really no surprise that there would eventually be call for a proper follow- up to expand the universe and continue the story begun so long ago. And though I had some caution towards the film during production, producer Scott and the exquisite director Denis Villeneuve have risen to the occasion with ""Blade Runner 2049""- a sharp and cerebral film in every way equal to the outstanding original.Thirty years later. Sentient, human-liked robots known as replicants live among humanity to serve as laborers. A Blade Runner agent known as ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) continues to track down and 'retire' rogue Replicants who have become dangerous or volatile. However, on his most recent mission, he makes a startling discovery- the decomposed remains of a female replicant who appears to have died during childbirth- a human process long thought impossible for these artificial lifeforms. K is dispatched to solve the mystery behind this troubling development, but is pulled into a web of corruption and deceit, which will eventually lead him to the only person who might be able to help him. A former Blade Runner agent... Rick Deckard. (Harrison Ford)""Blade Runner 2049"" is a powerhouse in every conceivable sense. Villeneuve's beautiful eye for flow and composition brings to life the future world in a way few others have ever accomplished, and everything he does compliments and expands upon the concepts and motifs established in Scott's earlier film. Without doubt, this is one of the most visually arresting films of the decade, and Villeneuve continues to deliver scene after scene. Longtime fans of that original work will feel instantly at home, though the film also wisely spends enough time on its world-building to bring the uninitiated up to speed rather quickly.The script, co-written by original writer Hampton Fancher, is beautiful and poignant in its execution and takes the series into startling new directions while never losing sight of what made these concepts and characters so special. Heady and complex themes are well developed and established, and appropriately serve as follow- ups to what came before. ""Blade Runner"" often dealt with issues of mortality and identity. ""2049"" in many ways is about legacy and acceptance. All the while complex notions and clever symbols are used to drive home the rampantly intelligent metaphors of the film. It truly is an ideal continuation from a storytelling perspective, fulfilling virtually all potential.And the performances compliment this in the best of ways. It really is a joy to see Ford back in one of his career-defining roles, and it's fascinating to see how Deckard has changed in a person as time passes. Gosling lights up the screen in a nuanced and sensitive portrayal of a troubled agent, and I very much found myself captivated by K's thoughtful relationship with an artificially- intelligent ""companion"" called ""Joi"", played incredibly by Ana de Armas. The sort-of unnatural romance the two share builds the heart of the film and blurs the lines between the real and the artificial. And I definitely enjoyed Jared Leto in a minor but wonderfully slimy performances as Niander Wallace- the film's primary antagonistic force. It's a fascinating character despite being less hands-on, and Leto chews the scenery just right to leave a lasting impact while never making Wallace come off as silly or contrived. It's a fine balancing act.In the end, I truly cannot recommend ""Blade Runner 2049"" enough. It has surpassed all potential and expectation, and I left the theater almost unable to speak while my mind continued to drift over what I had just witnessed. It is without doubt one of the year's best films and is in every single way equal to the iconic original. And it easily earns an incredibly 10 out of 10. I see it without question joining the legendary status of its predecessor and being treasured for years to come. A perfect film.",Blade Runner 2049
113,valadas,Replicants,7,9 October 2017,"Many of them. Replicants are copies of human beings who can behave like humans do and also feel and suffer like them. Well if you like science-fi you'll love this movie but if you don't I don't advise you to watch it. A complicated story that tells also about the conflict between replicants and humans who are their bosses and to whom they must obey totally. The story is a about young blade runner (a replicant) who is a detective of LAPD and who is ordered to kill one of the old replicants whose models must be retired. During that task he finds a box buried under a tree and there begins his engagement in solving the mystery contained in the box which includes a disappeared child of a replicant woman which adds more mystery to the plot since replicant women cannot be pregnant. From there on a lot of violent episodes develop themselves involving humans, replicants and virtual creatures who can transfigure themselves and merge into others. The visual effects are terrific and excellent and that is perhaps the main motive to go watch this movie.",Blade Runner 2049

115,Abdulxoxo,Great visuals but way too long,7,20 February 2021,"The film dealt with some of its main themes (life and memory) in quite an interesting way. The cinematography was exceptional. The visual effects were stunning. The score was good; Hans Zimmer took inspiration from the original movie and amplified it in his own unique way. As good as the music is, at times it's far too loud and overpowering, which is a shame. There were also some good uses of older musicians; and one brilliantly selected song choice. The film's main problems is its length. At 2 hours 43 minutes, my patience was tested at times. Much of the movie is slow and quiet. The film could easily have taken out half an hour and it wouldn't have made a difference. Performance-wise, I thought Gosling was fine. Harrison Ford doesn't come into the movie till quite late on. But then again he was fine too. The best performance was probably from Ana de Armas, who plays Joi, K's holographic girlfriend. She plays off K and seems to learn to meet his needs and desires. She's beautiful; and her existence plays into one of the films' key themes. Overall, BR: 2049 is a beautiful looking film, well-acted and has a very intriguing concept but all of that is overshadowed with lengthy, tiring runtime.",Blade Runner 2049

Poor old Harrison Ford is past his best for sure!
Overly long and tediously arty farty by at least 2 hours!
Bad CGI that overwhelmed and made everything seem false
No real story to speak of - Phillip K. Dick would be ashamed
Style over substance like most things these days!Compare it to the original:-
Magnificent acting from the entire cast from Darryl Hannah To James Edward Olmos!
A soaring score from Vangelis that lifted your heart and soul
A film that actually had a clever and interesting story!
Great visuals made with great models and forgotten art that only Ray Harryhausen , Stan Winston, Rob Bottin and all the greats would appreciate!
Magnificent script with every line and scene a masterpiece of dialogue - who can forget the epic Rutger Hauer ""Tears In The Rain"" speech and compare it to this!It did start off well and there was promise but it all descended into an advert for corporate ripoff just like everything from yesteryear these days - ie Star Wars, Star Trek Discovery etc Nothing original just tired old politically correct retreads of the inspired and magnificent days when Cinema was a truly uplifting and wonderous experience.How sad I sometimes feel for the youth of today who will never experience the joys of great acting, great ctors, great stories and being taken from their humdrum lives to another world and another time for a few hours - I remember well the first time i saw Charlton Heston in Planet of The Apes looking up at the Statue Of Liberty, Darth Vader telling Luke ""I am your father"" and even Kirk fighting the Gorn in Arena - wonderous times - I no longer feel that anymore - Am I just an old fart or has cinema and film making really become uninspired and playing for the safe dollar especially when I know for a fact that there are literally zillions of good stories that exist in the comics of 2000AD, Tornado and Starlord like ""WOLFIE SMITH"", ""FLESH"", ""BLACKHAWK"", ""MELTDOWN MAN"" etc etc etcThats not to say there arent some movies around that are inspired and original ""RIDDICK"" and ""PITCH BLACK"" to name but two but a classic like Bladerunner should never have been treated like this, its a disgrace!",Blade Runner 2049
117,Screen_Blitz,"Powerfully crafted and exhilarating in its visual scope, Blade Runner 2049 is a chord-striking achievement that is simply breathtaking",10,24 October 2017,"Being a masterful influence in the science-fiction genre, it only comes to no surprise that a sequel to Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' would be subject to significantly high expectations. With Scott's availability restrained to the producing team, the studios manage to no one other than Denis Villenueve, the visionary behind 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and last year's 'Arrival', to fill in the director's role. Blooming with striking visual methodology and superb craftsmanship to capture the heart and soul of the 1982 original, the film powerfully exhibits why Villenueve was the right choice to take over for Scott. The French-Canadian filmmaker has proved himself as one of the cinema's most profound visual storytellers which only makes up half of the equation of why this continuation to its influential predecessor succeeds on making ends meet. It is a film that not only embraces the beauty of the original, but expands upon it in more ways than one. As the title states, the film is set thirty years after the events of the first film where we meet K (played by Ryan Gosling), a Los Angeles police detective tasked with eliminating the last remaining replicants who have evolved from the Tyrell Corporation which is now on its way to bankruptcy. Employed by his cutthroat boss Lieutenant Joshi (played by Robin Wright) who uncover a dark secret associated at the hands of a diabolical human creator named Niander Wallace (played by Jared Leto). This soon places him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who has been missing for decades. If you know Denis Villenueve, you know that he by no means lets his filmmaking talent go to waste. He squeezes out every inch of his talent and pours into this film, and the results take the spirit of its predecessor and spin it into cinematic gold. His greatest strength lies within his ability to take the futuristic city of Los Angeles and, with today's newly updated technology, turn into a roller coaster of eye-popping visual beauty. Downtown Los Angeles, dominated by holographic advertisements and neon light soaking the streets and skyscrapers, is just the beginning. As Ryan Gosling's K travels through war-torn landscapes and a wasteland clouded with tangerine-colored fog, Villenueve's visual grandiose is beautifully captured with master cinematographer Roger Deakins. Seizing the gritty atmosphere of his dark visual design, supplemented with the roaring electronic score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, Deakins captures every frame with immense precision, and if his efforts are not enough to finally ring him his long-awaited Oscar, Lord so help me! The visual style greatly serves as a helping hand to the plot which follows the lead character on a quest that gladly avoids the common sequel cliché of rehashing elements from the original and takes us on an all-new adventure, offering twists and cutting-edge thrills that define against average storytelling. And for a lengthy runtime pedaling just merely under three hours, this film knows how to keeps things moving without feeling the need to splash us with a bombastic actions sequence every five minutes but instead dedicating its time to constructing its characters and building upon its story arc. In the end, there is just enough justice done to compensate for its slow pacing that is likely to turn those who lack patience.Over the last several years, Ryan Gosling has proved worthy is tackling nearly any role he is placed into regardless of its genre. As for here, the Canadian actor is given the daunting task of carrying an enormous portion of the film on his shoulders, and the performance he gives as the lead character is simply satisfying. His chemistry with Cuban actress Ana De Armas, who plays his girlfriend, is nothing short of astonishing considering the highly original nature of her character. It is somewhat unlikely that Gosling will pitted with a role more challenging than this. Robin Wright stands strong in her role as does Jared Leto in his villainous role of a man lacking pupils in his eyes. As eerie as his appearance can be, Leto makes a decent impression of his character. Dave Batista, who shares very little screen time, puts in good effort for the short time he has on screen. And it should come to no surprise that Harrison Ford reprises his role as the veteran Rick Deckard, but his amount of screen time will definitely leave some surprised. Nonetheless, it does a solid job in his three-decade old role. Whether he makes a larger star than Ryan Gosling is somewhat debatable, but it is nonetheless satisfying to see the aging actor make his return to one of his most memorable roles. Blade Runner 2049 stands as a landmark in the realm of cinematic sequels, and with Denis Villenueve's astonishing craftsmanship and ability to embrace the soul of its predecessor, soars as a highly remarkable achievement in the science-fiction genre. With all the potential that lies within the picture, this film does not squander any of it and places it all on full display. Denis Villenueve, you're a winner!",Blade Runner 2049

Harrison Ford and Sean Young must have been carved from the same tree to put in such completely wooden and uninspired performances. Ford has been brought back from the dead for one last (we hope) performance.Gosling is a million times better in this version and the sci fi story is superior to Dick's hack job.I'm just kidding about Blade Runner 2049 and the 10 stars.

119,Troy_Campbell,Stunning sci-fi saga that surpasses the original.,9,6 October 2017,"Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is quietly becoming one of the most interesting and exciting filmmakers in Hollywood today. Since 2015 he has released modern masterpieces Sicario and Arrival, with this sci-fi sequel adding another triumph to his recent success. Although linked to Ridley Scott's 1982 cult classic, this futuristic epic stands on its own two feet with a new story centred on LAPD agent K (Ryan Gosling), a Blade Runner (someone who hunts and 'retires' faulty androids) questioning his own existence. With unwavering support from girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas), K continues to seek answers in places his superiors would prefer he didn't look, all paths leading to an infamous predecessor who has been missing for 30 years: Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). Screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green have provided Villeneuve with an abundance of meaty, thought-provoking material to bring to life, real world parables thinly veiled inside an intelligent and mature narrative that even provides a few genuinely impressive twists. Cleverly inserted flashbacks and references provides enough context for those who aren't familiar with Scott's Blade Runner, but thankfully the audience is credited with enough smarts to join the dots without having their hands held. For a movie so focused on the theme of identity, it's only fitting that Villeneuve—along with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins—has crafted an exquisite visual identity that pays homage to the original whilst establishing it's own uniqueness. Every frame is meticulously dressed, the stunning production design merging seamlessly with the CGI to create a utopian world that feels entirely lived-in, whether it's the metallic, technology-centric inner-city or the dusty, wasting-away outer limits. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer is also amazing, the deep base and subtle synth tunes seeping into each scene to enhance the ethereal atmosphere. Don't be scared off by the lengthy runtime, Villeneuve ties all of the elements together—including outstanding performances from Gosling, de Armas, Robin Wright and Jared Leto—to deliver an utterly engrossing sci-fi saga that warrants a big screen viewing. Blade Runner 2049 is that rare follow-up that not only matches what came before, but surpasses it.",Blade Runner 2049
120,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Even taken away from the original film, 2049 is surprising as a piece of art.",10,9 October 2017,"Watching this film, I couldn't help but feel disappointed that the general movie-going public wouldn't see this in droves. And unfortunately I was right; the film's $31.5 million US opening was a sign that there IS an audience for the film, but it's a NICHE crowd that won't attract the likes of Transformers fans or MARVEL buffs flocking to see it. Thankfully it made $50 million plus at the foreign box office and will surely make a fortune in Japan; the original Blade Runner is effectively the godfather of several dystopian franchises ranging from AKIRA, to Ghost in the Shell and even the likes of Cowboy Bebop. So how does 2049 hold up to that VAST legacy? It stands it's own two feet pretty firmly and proudly. And Denis Villenue was just the man to helm this sequel: and he's one of the 2010s' hottest rising film directors, an auteur who could become the next Christopher Nolan.The story: this truly is a follow up to the original Blade Runner; it takes place 30 years after the 'tears in rain' spoken by Roy Batty, and Deckard has gone missing ever since the events of the first movie. What happened to him and what the hell has transpired in his absence? Replicants and humans hate each others' guts and there's racism on the streets and a new corporation has taken over Tyrell's job. And the line between replicants and humans is basically non-existent. Los Angeles is just as hostile as it was in 2019 and memories are either real or 'implanted' from someone else's conscious. Basically, what is real? It asks 'The Matrix' question pretty well, except 2049 shows that the fine line between humans and non-humans can become a blur. Is Ryan Gosling's character K (Joe) a replicant or is he human? That's something that drives the plot, that and his excellently well done confrontation of Rick Deckard himself. As things get more chaotic and nightmarish it's revealed that things aren't as black and white as Joe wants things to be. The concept of memories is crucial to 2049's message and experience. We're defined by the lives we've lived, and how is it right planting one's memories into an organic machine pretending that they lived it at all?Bottom-line: ignore the press emphasising that's it's a premature 'flop'. They just want history to repeat and put people off from seeing it. SEE THIS MOVIE ASAP! It says a lot about human nature and unfortunately reflects the chaos of our present; the film has racism, corporate oversight of the public, and several unknowns about our world sitting right under our noses.See Blade Runner: 2049 in IMAX; you'll thank yourself later for that.

121,blumdeluxe,Great Pictures but not the Original,7,14 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a follow-up to the famous ""Blade Runner"" movie and takes over its characteristics. It tells the story of a modern-day Blade Runner that one day stumbles over a long hidden secret and has to question his whole identity, leading to many unforeseen encounters and danger.The film is a visual masterpiece. Especially when you get to enjoy it on a larger screen you will almost instantly be drawn into the world and the futuristic surroundings. The general tempo of the movie is rather slow, so at no point events seem to be rushing, which keeps the film from being just another action adaption. On the other hand I have to say that the plot is not very surprising, it pretty much delivers what was expected from the film before, including a bit of fan service. Unfortunately, it seems that producers will try to establish a franchise out of this and air more parts of this series and this is where for me it is hard to believe that it is really for the benefit of the story any more, but rather for the dollars coming in, even though I don't doubt that there's enough story left for another decent part.All in all this is a very visual movie that isn't shaming its prominent ancestor, but it is also not a milestone or something that I would have need a third part of.",Blade Runner 2049

The direction is great, the cinematography is deserving of all awards going, musical score follows on wonderfully from the original. Ryan Gosling is fine in the lead role, although in my view, any decent actor could have played the part. The movie is more about concepts than action sequences, reminiscent of '2001 A Space Odyssey'.

124,Jeremy_Urquhart,Methodically paced and beautifully shot; will probably get even better with repeat viewings,8,6 October 2017,"First off, the less said about the plot the better. I feel like I can say as much as I can about this movie without mentioning any plot details. And maybe that has something to do with the fact that I really can't say a whole lot about the movie just yet, not after a single viewing, at least.Blade Runner 2049 was overwhelming, but in a good way. It's long, dense, and even close to exhausting. I was in a bit of a daze walking out, and it took me a few minutes to collect my thoughts and try to figure out how much I'd enjoyed the past (almost) three hours of movie. What I did know for sure though was that I liked it. It's hard not to get swept away by how gorgeous this movie looks, how interesting the score sounds, the strong performances all around, and all the really cool sci-fi stuff the film throws at you (which I also wouldn't dare to spoil). However, I can't say I absolutely loved this movie, not yet anyway. Even if there's not really anything in particular that I find easy to criticize. I feel roughly the same way about the original, which I also might have to watch a couple more times to fully get my head around and process. I think ultimately that's a good thing. There's not many movies this long that I feel a desire to revisit almost immediately, and I could easily myself taking a second trip to the cinema to see it again (insane movie ticket prices be damned). With Arrival and now this, Denis Villeneuve might well be the best sci-fi director we have at the moment. This is a seriously impressive film he's crafted, and far from the cheap cash-grab/ reboot I initially had some fears a sequel to the 35-year-old Blade Runner could be. There's not too many big budget American films that are paced this way, or so long or dense with ideas and things to look at and think about. Absolutely worth a watch, and don't be surprised if you end up feeling like going back. I know I almost certainly will, and won't be at all surprised if I come out of a second viewing even more enthusiastic about it.",Blade Runner 2049

Rather like the original, '2049' is too slow, too shallow and relies way too much on the visuals, which is the only impressive part of the movie.Everything else about 'Blade Runner 2049' is massively disappointing as far as I'm concerned. The plot is sub-standard, especially for a near 3 hour long movie. It is convoluted and messy in parts. Fans of Harrison Ford will be disappointed too, given that he barely does anything in the movie, only first appearing around the 2 hour mark. I thought 'Blade Runner 2049' was thin in just about every area other than the visuals. The biggest disappointment of the year so far for me.",Blade Runner 2049

Unclear story, nonsense, and lack of logic. Only bit good things are few earthly (humane) things such as father daughter relationship and man woman relationship, job, vehicles, robots, bit of spiritual or religious philosophy. Bit hot women, bit emotions, bit moral, bit high presence of filth, fashion, technology. But the lack of clarity, unreality, and long time makes this not worth watching.

128,kevin c,No need for a Director's Cut this time,8,6 May 2018,"I was never a fan of the original, i've tried all the later 'cuts' but it still leaves me cold. So surprisingly this wowed me. This is awe-inspiring film, beautiful; and so enigmatic.On a technical level, it gets Zimmer fresh from his Dunkirk star turn to produce a stunning, intimidating score. And Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning, but it just always is. I love the nods to the original - the Pan Am and Atari street neon in particular. Like the director's recent Arrival, this appeals to our intellect as well as to our sense of adventure. The film deals with love, memory, reality and identity in a probing and though-provoking way.Not everything works. Some of the sci-fi movie seems very clunky and dated, perhaps because so much has imitated it over the years? Harrison Ford's returning Deckard, is a bit too returning Solo. But Gosling gives another soulful and intelligent performance - he's a consistent gem for me.",Blade Runner 2049
129,proud_luddite,"mysterious, unique, and enjoyable",7,6 January 2018,"Following its predecessor ""Blade Runner"" (1982): In a futuristic Los Angeles, K (Ryan Gosling) is a replicant i.e. a bioengineered human. His job is to exterminate fellow replicants who are rebellious and refuse to accept their status as servants and slaves. He is sent on a mission to resolve a mystery of a birth many years ago.I can remember my first reaction when I saw the classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" decades ago: I couldn't understand much of it but what I did understand, I found fascinating. I also thought the work of director of Stanley Kubrick was astounding even in the sections I did not understand. I would later appreciate ""2001"" in a greater way in subsequent viewings - even though some parts remain incomprehensible.It is possible that I may feel the same about ""Blade Runner 2049"" some time in the future (though hopefully before 2049). Although it is more incomprehensible as a whole than ""2001"", each of its scenes were amazing as separate entities. This is mainly due to the film-noir vision superbly executed by director Denis Villeneuve who successfully creates a very bleak and nihilistic universe. He is greatly aided by topnotch work in cinematography, background music and especially a brilliant production design by Dennis Gassner. (It helped to have seen the film on the giant IMAX screen.)Gosling does a fine job in the lead role. He is convincing as an emotionless being who slips occasionally into the emotional human form. But the screen is truly lit up when Harrison Ford enters the picture in the second half. He is often riveting and this might possibly be his best performance.",Blade Runner 2049
130,saptesh786,Bladerunner OR Investigator ?,4,12 September 2018,"Seen movie hoping that a good sequel for old blade runner. But unfortunately this works went in vain.My observations are below.1. Detective officer working like a investigator instead of blade runner.
2. How many replicant he found and destroyed ? only one.
3. In 2049, where technology goes highly sophisticated, but attacks and defense styles are old like guns etc ? There is no improvement in fight sequence even holographic images looking like real? Surprising !
4. What is mystery of horse ?
5. Superstar and veteran actor Harrison Ford has wasted role. He looks helpless here, whereas He had played remarkable roles in many b grade movies.
6. No thrill and actions seen which is essential part of such science fictions.
7. Instead of thrill and actions, movie only focus on sophisticated future world.
8. As me there should have brief clipping of previous blade runner to link new one because there is 30 years gap in both movies.
9. No climax, but a dull ending. I hope no other boring sequel.
10. Rating 8.1 is wrong, it only desired 4 star.",Blade Runner 2049
131,maurice_yacowar,Blade Runner hunts down revolutionary baby,8,18 October 2017,"In the first shot a closed eye opens, awakening. The second is of the humongous new mechanical civilization in space. The film's central theme is of the awakening of humanity in a dehumanized world. There it has become impossible to distinguish between the genuine human and its replica. That confusion extends down to Deckard's dog: ""Is he real?"" ""I don't know. Ask him."" On a more emotional level, the hero's spectral android girlfriend tells him she loves him: ""You don't have to say that."" ""I know."" To protect him she has herself erased and eliminated. In her drama humanity ennobles even an android, making her human. This spectre has a higher sensitivity: ""I always told you. You're special. Your history isn't over yet. There's still a page left.""I won't relate the new Blade Runner to the original for two principled reasons: (i) As an independent work, by a new writer and director, it deserves to be treated and read as an independent work, on its own terms. (ii) I haven't seen the original since it first appeared and don't remember a thing about it.In any case, the new film draws on a wealth of pertinent archetypes. The villains' quest to find and to kill the miraculous baby — and the slaves' determination to protect the baby in hopes of a liberating revolution — revives a common saviour myth that includes Moses, Jesus, Spartacus, El Cid, etc. Later K learns what his opening target Sapper meant when he said ""You've never seen a miracle."" Hence the history behind the evil Wallace's ambition to expand his slave race: ""Every leap of civilization was built on the back of a disposable workforce, but I can only make so many."" K's success disproves Wallace's ""All the courage in the world cannot alter fact. "" The blade runner hero is named ""Joe"" K, evoking the Kafka hero Joseph K who stumbles through an absurdly antagonistic and frustrating universe, the emblem of modern deracinated man. There is also the passing of the torch from the old action hero (i.e., king) to the new. K fights the final battle underwater while Deckard struggles to breathe, helpless in his shackles. The predominance of water scenes, including the climactic fight to the finish, draws on the association of water with the origin of life. The water scenes confirm the film's themes of rebirth and resurrection. And of course, ""You can't hold back the tide with a broom.""In the last scene, while Deckard visits his daughter, the memory maker, in her protective bubble, K lies across snow-covered steps, as if frozen in suspended animation. His mission is accomplished, the baby discovered, and he accepts his reality as an android not the hidden human. Like his lover, even an android is capable of acting and feeling like a human, even as humans content themselves with practicing inhumanity. The opening eye shot extends further as well. The evil mogul has false eyes, emblematic of his moral blindness and the failed fecundity of his millions of slave androids. K identifies his targets by plucking and reading their eyes. That befits a parable about human vision and understanding under threat, The film also plays out the emerging New Woman. As the futuristic fiction amplifies our present tendencies, the film abounds with simpering sex objects, some androids, some real women, some grotesquely amplified caricatures of ersatz sexual appeal. But the greater emphasis is placed on women of strength, will and power: the characters played by Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Carla Juri, Hiam Abbass and Mackenzie Davis. Here there are several Wonder Women, sans magic. As the android rebel leader Freysa declares, ""Dying for the right cause. It's the most human thing we can do."" One woman makes the race's memories. Another leads their campaign to become human.",Blade Runner 2049
132,Richie-67-485852,The Blade Has Run,8,7 October 2017,"I was entertained. I was eager to see this movie since the first one registered so well and ended on a exploratory note. To me, I got closure finally from the Blade runner concept. You can see this alone but for the maximum treat, see the first one then this. Its a decent story-line and they spent more time on time than on making this a quick movie. But the slow pace doesn't detract. It sets you up for what is to come locking you into the moment on the screen. I did have a hard time hearing some dialog as the background sounds were loud at times and coincided with the dialog. The future as depicted here is not good but then, we are only referring to humans aren't we? Another thing I look for is a comeback experience i.e. memorable scenes that make you want to see a movie over and over again. None here for me. Once the story is told, it's told. We are done here. Too bad because it would make for a nice DVD collection piece to go with the first movie if they added some extra-ordinary scenes. The first one has memorable scenes so make your own comparison. I have seen that one several times and the director helped that along by coming out with different cuts of the movie all good. I prefer the first one and the final cut. what could have really helped this movie is more character development, some explanation about the guy who bought Terrel Corp (the guy who made this replicants) out and more details about the mystery which I will not give away. Is this worth seeing? Yes if you have seen the first one. If not, I am not sure this movie can carry itself. I snacked on some soy jerky extra spicy and I noted that everyone in the theater was transfixed to the story telling me that they all saw the first one too. Enjoy P.S. I came back to this write-up to add this: I read what Wikipedia had to say about this movie. It explains very clearly and in specific detail what is going on and cleared up quite a bit of mystery for me and answered questions I had too. Question: Why couldn't the director make all those points clear in the movie? It would have upped the experience. Read it for yourself and see. Thank you",Blade Runner 2049
133,classicalsteve,"The Case of the Missing Replicant Offspring and Outstanding Visuals Compromised by Length, Pace and Distance",7,16 October 2017,"In the original ""Blade Runner"" film, blade runners were hired assassins paid to ""retire"" renegade replicants originally manufactured by the Tyrell Corporation. Replicants were manufactured to work as slaves on colonization planets, and some replicants began to rebel and band together to fight their oppressors for freedom and longevity. It should be pointed out that blade runners were humans, and replicants were bio-engineered humanoids without biological births. In the new film, the Wallace Corporation has built upon what Tyrell began several decades earlier. Their new ""breeds"" of replicants are incapable of disobedience and some have been drafted to be blade runners themselves, mainly to find some of the older models which escaped blade runners.Ryan Gosling plays ""K"", the beginning letter of a long-winded serial number. He's one of the new breed of replicants who is also among the new force of blade runners ordered to hunt down and retire renegade replicants, mainly older models which escaped retirement. During one of K's hunts, he finds a box containing skeletal remains which he brings back to the LAPD offices and labs. Upon further analysis of the remains, the deceased appears to have been not only pregnant but also a replicant. The implication is staggering: replicants may have the ability to reproduce. Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright) puts K on the case to find out more about the pregnancy and discover if the offspring is still alive with orders to retire it.The main plot is generally a good one: a case of the missing replicant believed to have been born, not bio-engineered. Three groups are interested in the biological birth and the offspring, which may be a hybrid: half replicant, half human. On one end of the spectrum is Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), head of the corporation which has succeeded the Tyrell Corporation. Wallace is not against the biological breeding of replicants. When knowledge of the birth reaches Wallace, he embraces, for he plans to use the millions of new replicants as slaves. On the other side are a group of replicants who desire freedom, similar to the first film. And then there's Lt. Joshi, part of the LAPD, who simply fears renegade replicants and possible biological breeding will destroy the infrastructure of society. In other words, humans are humans, and replicants are replicants, and things should remain thus.First the good news. The look and atmosphere of the sequel is very similar to the original. Even the music, written mostly by Hans Zimmer but based on some of the original themes and style of Vangelis, parallel the original. The story also explores the ideas of what makes us human. In the original, the rebel replicants seemed to have more humanity than the biological humans, which made for an interesting rhetorical juxtaposition between the nature of human reality. Similar ideas are explored here.I think the biggest criticism is that it's almost too slow-moving and long for it's own good. The original was assessed as being too ""slow-moving"" but today it doesn't feel that way at all, and even the director's cut is still just under 2 hours. Clocking in at nearly 3 hours, ""Blade Runner 2049"" could have used a lot more cutting. A couple of scenes, such as one where a large King-King-size animation interacts with Gosling could have been cut and the film would not have suffered one iota. However, some of the long drawn-out throw-away scenes made it difficult to focus on things which were more crucial to the plot. Other times we often see Gosling in multiple view shots where nothing is happening. Sadly, one character which will become important later is shown briefly in one scene. I would have liked more about that character and less screen time devoted to seeing the pores of Gosling's face! Still, generally a good film, although I don't think it will become a classic like the original. Some parts were interesting, others became too long without much plot development, while other very important points were not developed very much. In both films, we hear about the off-world colonies but we never see them. And we never see the replicants actually engaging in rebellion, two aspects which would have made the original stories a bit richer.",Blade Runner 2049
134,drjgardner,Could not be any worse,2,15 October 2017,"This film has almost no redeeming qualities. The plot is dull and boring. Really boring. The music is too loud and dramatizes every little thing. The photography spends about an hour with closeups of Gosling. How they could take a great film like Blade Runner and produce this garbage is beyond me. BTW - the 3-D version really has no 3-D visuals, so it's a rip off.",Blade Runner 2049
135,sergelamarche,Sensical continuation,8,6 September 2018,Very well done and well thought. A few twists as to where it was heading give it value. Not lyrical and ground breaking like the first was. Replicants are much too perfect. Their imperfections of bodies and mind made the first much more intriguing and unpredictable.,Blade Runner 2049
136,phubbs,Blade Runner 2049,7,27 May 2018,"Another year and another old franchise is brought screaming and kicking back into the present. For better or worse? Well that's always the million dollar question and often its the latter. And with that in mind I dived into the sequel/reboot (bit of both really isn't it) of one of my favourite movies...with much trepidation. The Plot: Its now 2049 and now all older model replicants are illegal (newer models are legal). We now follow a replicant blade runner called K (Ryan Gosling). After retiring a rogue replicant K discovers a box buried in the ground which contains a mysterious skeleton. Turns out the skeleton belonged to a female replicant and bares the marks of a caesarean delivery. K is now tasked with finding the child and retiring it. He takes the remains to the Wallace Corporation, which took over the Tyrell Corporation, to identify the remains. The replicant is of course Rachel from the first movie which will in turn eventually lead K back to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Of course Wallace CEO Niander Wallace wants to know how replicants are reproducing so he sends his combat model replicant Luv to get the remains and track K to find the child.The Visuals: Oh man its dark here, its so really really murky dirty and dark. Like has mankind somehow blocked the sun out and everyone lives in perpetual darkness and rain, like lots and lots of rain. But seriously, we all know the first movie was a dark moody vision of the future so its of no surprise that that has continued here (despite the fact that outside the cities there is still green countryside and blue skies, apparently).Director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins have certainly recaptured the original movies looks...and then some. Every scene, every shot, every sequence feels like something you'd see in an art museum exhibition. The imagery ranges from stunning to super stunning utilising vivid colours, muted colours, barren wastelands, surreal interiors, and of course bleak dystopian cityscapes. Anyone who knows this franchise will know what to expect for sure, but what you see here is still gonna blow your socks off. Whilst some scenes look like something straight out of your standard futuristic anime vision of Tokyo complete with huge holograms and neon signage everywhere. Other (interior) scenes do certainly seem to have a 'Prometheus' vibe about them. You could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a sequence involving the Weyland Corporation.Indeed whilst some sequences do look highly imaginative, at the same time they can be quite bizarre also. Most interior shots of the Wallace Corporation are wildly outlandish and alien looking. In fact some of it is so alien looking it actually comes across as less authentic and more showcase, literally like an exhibition of the future by a designer. On the flip side it seems impossible to escape the more obligatory dystopian visuals. As already mentioned you have the typical Futuristic far east vibe; but then you also have the typical grotty wastelands and ruins where typically hostile scavengers eek out an existence. An abandoned ghostly city (Las Vegas) is also a pretty standard sci-fi trope but in this case its visually breathtaking because its enveloped in, an apparent, eternal dazzling sunset coloured haze. Without that haze these scenes would look pretty dull and standard.The Score: After much tinkering around with different people at the helm at various times, eventually Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch were hired. The aim was to get the score back to the roots of the franchise, more in line with Vangelis's iconic score. With that in mind do I think they achieved that? Well yes and no. On one hand parts of the score is very original, very bombastic with its very loud blasts of electronic synth. But it does also tend to feel a bit too heavy or videogame-esque in places more than anything. On the other hand the more recognisable parts of the score (that remind you of the original film) are good but tend to feel a bit too close; as if they just modified Vangelis's actual work instead of coming up with their own. That's fine, but then maybe just use Vangelis? Sticking Vangelis's original score over the finale merely confirms that they should of used it throughout.The World of 2049: So what's really changed here? Not much by the looks of it. The cities (or at least LA) still look like highly polluted, rain drenched, flying traffic infested urban sprawls festooned with various (oriental influenced) neon signage. Vegas is now (ghost town remember) awash with radiation after a dirty bomb struck it (bomb? What??). We don't see much else of the world but apparently the climate is ****ed up which has led to California suffering almost permanent winters and the sea reaches inland up to Sepulveda Boulevard. Oh and said state is also overcrowded with refugees, so an accurate portrait of California for the future then. But where did all the Asian people go from the original film?In this age K can now appear to lead a normal life with a hologram partner. To the point where said female hologram actually falls in love with him and arranges for a prostitute to pop round so she can 'merge' with the prostitute and have sex with K. I found this...odd, to say the least. So is this female hologram programmed to so this? Did K request the hologram like this? Did K programme the hologram himself? Also full blown gigantic neon advertisements can interact with you which seems kinda pointless. I did like how they advanced the technology from the point of view of the original movie. In other words this films future tech is based and advanced on from the future tech of the 1982 film, not our reality based future. Hence plenty of analog tech and Atari are apparently still a big company.The whole police protocol baseline test that K must undergo in order to remain...emotionally reliant I guess, seemed overdone to me. He seemingly undergoes this everyday I think, at the end of his shift. Its quite clear that K has been taking and passing this test for quite some time and is a solid blade runner. Yet at one point he fails the test and is immediately branded rogue. By this point I would of thought failing the test wouldn't be that big of a deal. I would of thought something like that would/could be easily sorted as part of a constant police monitoring programme because surely over time it will have occurred often. I just don't see how it would be a major problem anymore, in the early days maybe but now?Also K stages Deckard's death at the end, intending to claim that Deckard drowned in the crashed spinner (or whatever flying car that was). But how does that work?? Surely anyone could quite easily find the crashed vehicle reasonably quickly (especially a man like Wallace) and discover no body. With all the tech in this world I'm sure Deckard would get found out soon enough (ahem...sequel). Niander Wallace and Luv: I can't deny that Leto fit the bill here perfectly with his smooth baby-faced looks. But I can't help but think that both Wallace and his brutal assistant Luv were slightly generic. Wallace is a highly perceptive, intelligent, calm, and softly spoken man. He is blind but we do not know if he was born this way or not (I originally thought he was a replicant). He also has a sadistic streak about him and a clear God complex as he refers to himself as a father to all of his (replicant) creations. He really did come across to me as your typical 80's kimono wearing bad guy who dwells in his large lair sending out cronies to do his dirty work. That leads us to Luv who is Wallace's female replicant enforcer. And that's all you need to know really. She's your typical menacing, equally sadistic enforcer type who knows martial arts, meh.Its worth noting that in this sequel the replicants do not appear to have the noticeable shine in their eyes anymore. I put that down to the obvious evolution of replicants, the slow blurring of both human and replicant. Well that plus the whole managing to give birth thing also.Overall the lack of a proper score throughout this film is but one issue I had in a string of issues that all led me to one real conclusion. What is the actual purpose of this film? I'm a solid fan of the original 1982 Ridley Scott masterpiece. Back in the days of yore (the 80's) when I was young I didn't really like or appreciate it. Later in life I have since grown to understand the film, I like (but not love) it. But I have never really thought the film required anything more, and that's the problem (on top of the fact this franchise is highly divisive which was proven at the box office. If you didn't like the first film...forget it).This new feature doesn't really feel like it needed. Yes the visuals are (inevitably) lavish and opulent, yes the acting is solid on the whole, and yes the package overall is well put together (kudos). But the story just felt kinda dull, not really important, not really required. There is little action which was to be expected, but also no real moments to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Nothing that rouses your emotions and adrenaline. Nothing that almost brings you to the brink of tears (...in the rain, yes I'm referring to that iconic scene). The original movie is fine as a stand alone film. It offers intrigue that doesn't require a bow on top, it doesn't really need anything further. This just felt like a sequel for the sake of having a sequel. As though they did it merely because they could, because Ford is still alive, because they could basically remake the original with better visuals. That's essentially how this came across to me. And despite being a good science-fiction film, it still can't touch the original.7.5/10",Blade Runner 2049
137,dglink,As Beautiful and Intriguing as Tears in Rain...,10,16 October 2017,"From an original 1982 theatrical showing to a Beta videotape, to a standard laserdisc, to a deluxe Criterion letterbox laserdisc, to a DVD, to a high-definition blu-ray, Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" has been viewed countless times in the original voice-over version, the European cut, the director's cut, and the final cut over the 35 years that followed its release. All those memories have not been lost in time, like tears in rain, but rather are indelible images from one of the greatest science fiction films. Thus, any thought of a sequel evokes mixed emotions. Despite the involvement of Ridley Scott, the results could be another disaster like ""More American Graffiti,"" or an undistinguished but palatable followup like ""2010,"" or a companion masterpiece like ""The Godfather Part II."" Fortunately, ""Blade Runner"" cultists can breathe a sigh of relief; while ""Blade Runner 2049"" may fall short of the unqualified masterpiece status of ""The Godfather"" sequel, at least on an initial viewing, the film enhances and builds upon, rather than diminishes, the original; however, only time will determine if ""BR2049"" will enjoy the same repeatability as the first film and join it as a timeless classic.Fresh from his outstanding work on ""Arrival,"" director Denis Villeneuve helmed ""BR2049"" with a steady hand and attention to detail, which were likely guided or inspired by Ridley Scott. Set thirty years ahead of the original film, Roger Deakins's career-best cinematography captures a future that is colder and bleaker than that portrayed by Jordan Cronenweth's original work, which has a warmer tone. However, Deakins's cooler hues are appropriate for 2049 Los Angeles, where snow has replaced rain and holographs rule rather than neon. Warm or cool, the atmospherics in both films are equally dazzling. The aurals are as captivating as the visuals; the haunting music by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch evokes the original Vangelis score without plagiarizing.The casting is also superb with Ryan Gosling spot on as K, the blade runner whose job, like Deckard's in the original film, is to retire renegade replicants. While the role may lack showy moments for an actor, Gosling's tall lean figure and enigmatic face create an image possibly more enduring than that of Harrison Ford in the original. Both Ford as an aging Rick Deckard and Edward James Olmos as a retired Gaff return to link the sequel to the first film. Among the newcomers, Robin Wright is well cast as Gosling's deadly serious, deathly pale Lieutenant Joshi of the LAPD. Ford and Olmos are not the only returnees, an origami figure and a small wood carving wordlessly connect the two Blade Runner films, and implanted memories, flying cars, outsized advertising, and transparent plastic raincoats also have encores.""Blade Runner"" cultists are best served seeing the sequel knowing little; the story unfolds as a policeman sent in pursuit of a mystery that expands upon threads in the original movie. Tthe film's length is arguably excessive, especially for those unfamiliar with the original, and ""Blade Runner"" novices may be left behind by a leisurely narrative that prizes visuals above action. However, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is that rarity of movie sequels, a film that enhances and elevates the original, yet stands on its own as a masterful film. The passage of time will determine if ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Blade Runner"" become the inseparably coupled films that ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" have become, but all the elements are in place.",Blade Runner 2049
138,aciessi,A Beautiful Visual Feat,8,6 October 2017,"Blade Runner. An 80's futuristic film noir that some filmgoers revere as one of the all-time great films.. with a caveat. Which of the endings did you see? The right one? or the really bad happy ending? Few films give the viewers their own personal ultimatum for the characters, but the first Blade Runner was that indecisive. So is it then, wise to give Blade Runner a 35 year old sequel/reboot? It apparently is. It turns out that Denis Villeneuve was destined to make it and truth be told, if you never saw the first Blade Runner, never fear. This is a film entirely of it's own.Blade Runner 2049 is the best looking film of the year. In terms of it's cinematography, it is a masterpiece. The production design brings us back to the incredible world that Ridley Scott introduced us to, but expands upon it exponentially. Our world is almost entirely replaced by holograms. 2049 focuses in on the idea of a society completely removed from humanity, where perfect virtual realities and artificial romances take the place of the human condition. Villeneuve and Roger Deakins work wonders on the ideas and the mis-en-scene that surrounds them. What we get is a film, though bloated in run time, fascinating from beginning to end. You will spend nearly three-hours in the theater, but entirely fixated on the image. You don't want to keep your eyes off of it. I know I didn't.",Blade Runner 2049

140,rockman182,Blade Runner 2049 (2017),7,7 October 2017,"It has been a while since I've seen it, but the original Blade Runner is a fantastic sci-fi film and up there with some of the best of all time. Ridley Scott used to be such a cutting edge filmmaker and the themes and visuals of the original Blade Runner still resonates well all these years later. When I heard about Blade Runner 2049, I was mixed- but only for a little bit. I love Ryan Gosling and Ana De Armas is stunning. The trailer looked like a visual feast and the attachment of Dennis Villeneuve heightened the hype surrounding the picture. Having seen it on opening night, there are many positives albeit some problems and concerns I had.The film takes place decades after the first film where K (played by THE GOS) is a newer modeled replicant who is also a blade runner tasked with taking out older models. He stumbles across a mystery of a replicant giving birth, which was previously thought to be impossible. He is tasked with finding that child but must also stave up the forces of Wallace, who is a prominent creator of replicants. K also unearths information about Deckerd who has gone into hiding since the events of Blade Runner.The first thing I have to praise is the absolutely eye-popping, crisp, and vivid cinematography. The scenes are phenomenal. The sheer gorgeous nature of the picture is worth seeing it in theaters all by itself. This is expected with the legendary Roger Deakins and Villeneuve at the helm. The bright lights and barren landscape of the future are just stunning. The CGI is some of the best you will ever see. The soundtrack is loud and at times jarring but very effective in mood and tone setting.I actually loved seeing Ryan Gosling's K in a relationship with the computerized but very intelligent girlfriend, Joi. I love Ana de Armas and love that she's getting more work after Knock Knock. Sylvia Hoeks, who I really enjoyed in The Best Offer, is also ridiculously compelling as a menacing villainous henchwoman to Wallace. I had problems with Wallace's motivations. His dedication to go after the child born from a replicant doesn't seem strongly motivated. He's also speaking too prophetically and metaphorically a little too often. The writing has a few holes in it. Its not perfect, but is acceptable and is complemented by stunning cinema display and action.The film is very long. I think 20 or so minutes could have been condensed to make the film a little more succinct and effective. It was always going to be hard making a sequel to Blade Runner. Was it necessary? Absolutely not. Does the film deliver? Yes, its one of the best visual films I've ever seen. Is it great? Almost. It seems like the type of film that could use a re-watch to let the plot and and character displays really sink in. Its still a really admirable effort from Villeneuve, who is one of the top filmmakers going today.7.5/10",Blade Runner 2049

142,jon.h.ochiai,More than human...,9,8 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is visually stunning like nothing you've been before with the opaque orange sky of the industrial ravaged future Earth, and its vivid gaudy neon holographic skyline at night. Director Denis Villeneuve and Executive Producer Ridley Scott, who directed the original ""Blade Runner"", are more provocative inquiry, ""What is it to be human?"" At a narrative arc Ryan Gosling's blue eyes widen welled with tears as his Replicant LAPD Officer K says, ""It's real!"" K realizes that his implanted childhood memory is real. But whose is it? His? Villenueve and cinematographer Roger Deakins's ""Blade Runner 2049"" is the masterfully sublime futuristic mural that unconceals the compelling and flawed inquiry of humanity in the screenplay by Hampton Francher and Michael Green, based on the Philip K. Dick novel. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford as the returning aged Deckard are awesome. Gosling commands as K in his profound stillness and compassion which betrays his character's human design. He tells his LAPD superior Lt. Joshi, played by powerful Robin Wright, that being born gives one a soul. She acknowledges him, ""You've done just fine without one."" ""Blade Runner 2049"" surprises, because of Gosling's courage in finding K's purpose, his soul. Gosling and Ford have amazing chemistry and partnership. Ford brings a world weary gravitas. K finally locates the recluse retired Blade Runner Deakard (Ford), who possesses vital information of this Replicant conspiracy and his own past. Deakard tells K, ""Sometimes when you love someone, you got to be a stranger."" What is real?Replicants are the synthetic genetically engineered humans, not born, created as the expendable work force. In 2049 Wallace Industries assumes the production of Replicants, who are designed with great physical strength and enhanced intellectual capacity. Jared Leto plays the enigmatic blind CEO Niander Wallace. Leto has the quiet, yet malevolent enlightened air. Wallace says, ""Every civilization was built on the back of a disposable workforce, but I can make only so many."" He arrogantly believes he is doing God's work. Blade Runners like K retire or kill rogue Replicants, who are deemed dangerous. Part of K's curse is that he too, is Replicant. ""2049"" opens as K tracks down Replicant agro farmer Sapper Morton, played by quiet hulking Dave Bautista. Their vicious battle reveals K's unique strength and resilience. However, this Replicant ""retirement"" reveals the unheard of. There may exist, a child born of a Replicant mother. Lt. Joshi (Wright) has K pursue this investigation at Wallace Industries. K meets the forceful and beautiful Replicant Luv, played by astonishing charismatic Sylvia Hoeks, Wallace's executive in charge. K's questions threaten, and Luv surmises that K must be terminated. Villeneuve eloquently orchestrates their defining conflict. Inadvertently, Luv's reveal cues K to locate Deakard (Ford). In the backdrop, K lives the isolated existence. His love is the sad and beautiful holographic program Joi, played by captivating Ana de Armas. Joi is the sentient program wishing to be human to be with K. This is the weakest movie narrative. The virtual ménage of K, Joi, and Replicant prostitute Mariett, strong pretty Mackenzie Davis, is more a hollow plot device than about human frailty. Too bad. In the telling confession with Deakard and Wallace in his Zen-like lair, Wallace says to Deakard of his deceased Replicant love Rachel, ""Love or mathematical precision?"" What is it to be human? That gets lost at times. As Luv, Hoek's consumed ruthlessness, fierce intellect, and spinning sidekicks provide the formidable match for Gosling's enduring warrior K. Luv's purpose is self preservation of her kind. K's purpose is far nobler. He searches for the truth, and protects those who are weaker. K may not be entirely human, yet he becomes Hero. This narrative thread and the performances make ""Blade Runner 2049"" special. Aside from Harrison Ford, Carla Juri stands out as the gentle brilliant orphaned Scientist who created K's memories. She is bright light with a profound sadness. ""Blade Runner 2024"" also has a sense of sadness which is its strength and poignancy. Villeneuve surprises in the end. Then we recall that even in the darkness, ""Blade Runner 2024"" is the Hero story of K and Deakard. Gosling and Ford give their best here, and we are thankful, the better for it.",Blade Runner 2049
143,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Pretty good for a sequel that didn't need to be made.,8,8 March 2019,"Back when I first heard about a Blade Runner (1982) sequel, I was skeptical about its quality. Sure, the ending was a little open-ended, but it stood by itself quite well. A Blade Runner sequel coming out mere years away from the original's futuristic timeline of 2019 seemed just as ridiculous. The one redeeming factor that eventually led me to think this sequel would be any good was that Denis Villeneuve was tapped to direct it. While I've liked Villeneuve's films as far back as Prisoners (2013), I've really become a fan since his Best Picture-nominated Arrival (2016) revealed how well he can do science fiction.Of course, Blade Runner isn't really science fiction. Sure, it has the trappings of a futuristic society, but at its core, the movie is a noir. The plot and aesthetic of noir is considerably different than that of sci-fi, but Villeneuve manages to merge the two into a visual beauty that I think would rival the art you could find in museums. In fact, I would almost wager that every single frame from Blade Runner: 2049 (2017) could be hung in an art gallery and be indistinguishable from any other form of art.While the beauty of this film is undeniable, its pacing leaves a little more to be desired. Sure, Blade Runner: 2049 is beautiful enough to be in a museum of art, it just has the pacing of actually walking through said museum. I get the deliberate nature of the flow, and there wasn't any point where I was falling asleep, it just felt slow for the sake of showing off the ambiance. Furthermore, while I thought the ""artificial life"" plot was done much better than Ghost in the Shell (2017), the digital assistant subplot felt derivative of Her (2013). The soundtrack also seemed to be channeling some Interstellar (2014) without linking to the same emotional impact.Pretty good for a sequel that didn't need to be made, I give Blade Runner: 2049 4.0 stars out of 5.",Blade Runner 2049
144,RforFilm,This won't be lost like tears in the rain. Blade Runner 2049 is an even greater movie then the original,10,11 October 2017,"This era has seen a resurgence of storytelling from the 1980s. This doesn't just mean reboots and sequels from that time, but the themes of that as well. One such is the dystopian future. People tend to forget that the idea of a future in shambles was once new and fresh. Ray Bradbury once said that he wrote dystopian stories to prevent, not make the future. Once movies like Terminator, Soylent Green, and Robocop became popular, every science-fiction story had to get in on that game. One movie however, got out one of the most intriguing and impressive visions of tomorrow, Blade Runner. Based on the Philip K. Dick story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner is a heavily layered story about the moral consequences of recreating the human consciousness and whether they would even help humanity. It became a cult classic that many critics have gone to claim as one of the greatest movies of all time. I myself like it fine, though see it as too slow and dull to watch multiple times. It's a movie I highly respect for it's design, but do care about its themes. I was intrigued to return to this world in Blade Runner 2049. In 2049, human androids called ""replicants"" have been engineered to obey and have become a part of society to ensure humanity's survival. A replicant named K (played by Ryan Gosling) works for the LAPD as a ""blade runner"" who hunts and ""retires"" the older replicant models who can go rogue (like from the previous movie). His investigation into ""retiring"" another replicant Sapper (played by Dave Bautista), he finds a set of human remains. After having them analyzed, they appear to be remains of a replicant. To add on to that, it died from an emergency C-section. This is baffling, as pregnancy was thought impossible for replicants. K is ordered his superior Joshi (played by Robin Wright) to destroy all the evidence in the case. When he returns to scene of the crime from earlier, he finds a date that corresponds to something that happened when K was younger. This leads him to examine whether he may or may not be a replicant. He tracks down former blade runner Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) to find answers. At the same time, replicant creator and head of the Wallace Corporation Niander Wallace (played by Jared Leto) sends his enforcer Luv (played by Sylvia Hoeks) to go after K. Considering how things could have gone, a sequel to Blade Runner is a major gamble. Thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 is the rare movie that continues to build upon the world that was established before, and even improves on the original. Yes, I think that this is better then the 1982 classic. Director Denis Villeneuve has managed to take the two things that made original memorable and expand on them here; the style and substance.I'll say upfront that Blade Runner 2049 has to be one of the greatest looking movies of all time. And I'm not just talking about the design of the tech noir architecture of Los Angeles (which actually has a chance to look larger then before), but within the cinematography. Every shot is like a beautiful painting of high technological tragedy that reflects the future of humanity and it's reliance on the dreams and fears of tomorrow. I'll say now that this movie may have won all the technical awards, but I'll bet my money that it's cinematographer will go home with an Oscar. This is a rare time that I feel like I'm seeing the two hundred million dollar budget with every penny spent well. The script builds further on the fears of Phillip K. Dick and his fascination with where we could go wrong. The themes of the moral consequences will make you question whether humanity in this world is even worth saving. Who knows? This movie is just as layered as the original, if not more, as replicants seem to be more in the spotlight, therefor throwing you off as you constantly have to figure out just how much more human are the androids? Even with the new restrictions given here. If I had any problem, is that the movie may be a little too long. I may be in the minority, but I still catch glimpses of the dull pace that I didn't like for the original. At nearly three hours, that's a lot to ask from a mainstream audience. I know that fans of the original won't care, but what about the newcomers. You don't necessarily have to seen the original Blade Runner to enjoy this, but it helps. Wouldn't it have hurt to add an intermission, just so that we can catch our breath? I'll give this ten wooden horses out of ten. Even if your not a science fiction fan, I still encourage you to catch thisin theaters at my most insistent. All that style is going to be a visual thanksgiving on the big screen. So check it out to see this is a memory that won't be lost like tears in the rain.",Blade Runner 2049
145,carbuff,"A must-see for fans of the original ""Blade Runner"", but wrapped up too simplistically.",8,15 September 2019,"First off, a saw the original ""Blade Runner"" a long time ago, and, while I remembered the gist of it, I did't recall it with intensity due to my age and interests at the time. This sequel ""Blade Runner 2049"" jogged my memories well (assuming that they're not implants), and is a very well-crafted movie with outstanding production values.I'm not going to throw any spoilers into this review, because I think that would significantly hurt the viewing experience for those who loved the original. With regard to the original, I think that it's pretty much mandatory that a viewer be fundamentally familiar with it, since it lays much of the foundation on which this plot is built.I am, however, only giving it 8 stars, because I personally feel that towards the end it took too many easy outs by way of some really blatant contemporary cultural mythologies (you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it) and avoided any actually difficult philosophical issues, something that Philip Dirk wouldn't have cared for either. Basically, it just went too ""Hollywood"" towards the end for my tastes. On the flip side, this is still one of the best films I've seen in a quite a while. It's definitely a solid sequel and belongs on the ""must-see"" list of every fan of the original ""Blade Runner"".",Blade Runner 2049
146,petra_ste,A rare sequel passing the Voight-Kampff test,8,6 November 2017,"Hollywood is usually predictable, but it can still surprise you sometimes. It can be an unpleasant surprise, like the guy who made the wonderful Lord of the Rings movies churning out the turgid mess that was the Hobbit trilogy. And it can be a welcome surprise, like a Blade Runner sequel being, you know, actually good. Count me as one of the fans who rolled their eyes at the idea of a follow-up to Ridley Scott's masterpiece... but 2049 won me over. No, it's not on par with *the* Blade Runner, and no, I don't believe in thirty years this will be part of the collective cinematic imagination like its predecessor... but it's still better than I expected: neat science fiction made with intelligence and care.Denis Villeneuve crafts a stylish, atmospheric piece, slow-paced but never boring. The introductory vignette with two men confronting each other in a remote outpost has a Sergio Leone vibe; the nightmarish future cities imagined by the great Philip K. Dick are portrayed with a mixture of dread and fascination. The cast is game, with always reliable Ryan Gosling as the lead and Harrison Ford giving his best performance in decades. Lovely Ana de Armas gives a star-making turn; the relationship between the protagonist and his holographic partner is the most interesting thing about the film, once again highlighting the question underpinning the whole Blade Runner mythos: what does it mean to be human?The antagonists are underwhelming. They are not exactly poorly made - even if some dialogues by smug demiurge Wallace (Leto) have the cringingly ponderous quality of Supervillain Fortune Cookies - but they are a little obvious compared to the original's memorable Roy Batty.Still, the script avoids many potential pitfalls - screenwriter Hampton Fancher (who worked on the first Blade Runner as well) was involved, and it shows. There is (thankfully) no definite answer to the ""Is Deckard a replicant?"" question; on the other hand, we learn immediately that Officer K (Gosling) is in fact a replicant, instead of moronically trying to mimic that specific conundrum. K is as different a protagonist from Deckard as possible, a deliberate and clever choice. The plot references the events of the original but without parroting them Force Awakens-style. 2049 doesn't try to top the legendary ""tears in the rain"" monologue, which would have encouraged unflattering comparisons; a similar scene at the end is entirely silent and works just beautifully. Once again, it's about finding a moment of grace and freedom in a decaying, oppressive world.7,5/10",Blade Runner 2049
147,juliankennedy23,I watched Ana de Armas glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate,9,16 March 2018,"Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.
The Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be.

151,fernandoschiavi,"Blade Runner 2049 justifies its existence as a late sequence by expanding concepts from the 1982, renew a franchise with pertinent, cinematic and human inquiries",8,28 November 2020,"Blade Runner 2049's biggest success lies in maintaining the ambience that enshrined the film directed by Ridley Scott - who returns in this sequence, now only as an executive producer. The flying cars, the constant rain (or snow), the huge buildings with few people on the streets, the giant neon panels ... it's all there, pointing to a decadent future where the glow comes only from what is false - not by chance, the only character that demonstrates liveliness is precisely a digital companion programmed for this purpose. It is a dry and serious world, with deep-seated prejudices, where people pay to have a glimpse of happiness without caring if it is true. The sensation or the need, is more important.Blade Runner 2049 tries to bring a narratively evolutionary clarity in the positioning of who is and who is not human. The governing factor is the biological issue: being someone's child is the key. The replicants, therefore, are products to be used at will, however much they may have a practically unattainable perfection and however much more capable they are. The objective of the writers and direct was clear: to expand the mythology of the first film in a logical way. For this, the opening opening text (and the short ones available online, which, however, are not essential, but very good, that is to say), fills the 30-year gap between one story and another informing about uncontrolled replicants (or humanoid androids) that they would have organized terrorist attacks for what was left of the Earth, leading to its prohibition. The main company behind the technology, Tyrell Corporation, thus went bankrupt, being acquired by Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), who reuses the technology to save humanity from collapse. At some point, the replicants - now of the Nexus-9 model, completely obedient - started to be manufactured again, although some of them also showed their own will, which justifies the permanence of the blade runners police unit to retire the androids, exactly as in the first film. However, the new model is so efficient that Officer K, corrupts (to honor Philip K. Dick) his identification code KD6 - 3: 7 (Ryan Gosling living the kind of role that his dramatic latitude allows: the silent man bitter), one of the policemen in that unit, is himself a replicant, blindly following his orders.
There is an essential difference between the characters of Gosling and Harrison Ford in the original, which returns in this sequence: K is aware that he is a replicant, which guarantees him a tacit acceptance of his destiny. However, it is from a journey of rediscovery about himself that Villeneuve works on philosophical questions about soul and life, in order to detail (and, in a way, justify) the way of acting of the two rational species that cohabit the Earth, humans and replicants. Such questioning is just one of those raised by the feature film, not only through history, but also from the stunning visuals brought by Villeneuve and his team. With an intentionally slow pace, Blade Runner 2049 takes on clearly contemplative contours with the aim of seducing by the artificial and, from it, questioning feelings. The beautiful art direction and photography help a lot in this sense, composing scenarios always engaging and attractive.Villeneuve does not hide his respect for Scott's work (which he signs as executive producer) and for K. Dick's book, but all references are placed in order to instigate a new audience, not to disturb him. It is about not only continuing, but updating and signing this new perspective. Thus, the director ties the cyberpunk neo-noir of the 1982 film to the exquisite photography of Roger Deakins with the aesthetic grandeur that he established in Arrival (Arrival, 2016). The director uses the advancement in visual effects to alternate the indoor environments of the city with a wide view of this desolate Earth. However, your search is not for realism. Each scene is calculated in detail - camera placement, characters and scene objects - in a translation of the relationship between real and artificial that follows the story.The script by Michael Green and Hampton Fancher consists of several levels. The first is the plot, investigation and actions of the protagonist. K needs to investigate a new form of replicant that could collapse society. It is from this variable that the other meanings of the film are born, the good old moral and philosophical discussion so well known in science fiction. After all, how is humanity classified as a being? What is the role of the soul? Can feelings be learned? Can machines love? Etc. Each questioning of these, coming from simple and poignant dialogues, adds to the psychological elaboration of the protagonist and also of the supporting actors.There is a very interesting distinction in the performances, which adds to the proposed debate. Humans are always insignificant. Emotions do not seem to gain space or relevance in them. Meanwhile, the replicants suffer, cry, fall in love and love. There is compassion. There is sentimental pain. K, for example, loves Joy (Ana de Armas) a kind of tactile hologram, programmed to be and say everything the owner would like to hear. He takes her with him, worries about his safety. She says she loves him. Is this genuine or a schedule? With this separation quite clear, I return to the question asked above, in the second paragraph: And is Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) a replicant or not, after all? Well, that's the film's responsibility, so it's up to him to say it. However, it is worth considering that Villeneuve, Green and Fancher give another proposal to this issue. Also, due to the way adopted to elaborate the question, Harrison Ford's participation is contained. In order to create a film of its own, Blade Runner 2049 does not become hostage to the character, nor does it attempt to create new Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) or Pris (Daryl Hannah). Nor does it try to establish new classic phrases. Instead, it makes room for new characters, which are even a form of variation from those in the first film, but only as a semantic and emotional link.Unlike the classic, Blade Runner 2049 does not adopt the neo noir atmosphere. The predominant genre is the dramatic, focused more on the development of K than on the investigation itself. The narrative uses the structure of the mini plot as a guide, especially regarding the internal conflicts of K. There are external conflicts in Blade Runner 2049, but they are spaced and punctual. The space and time between them is filled by a minimalist and deliberately slow journey. K is a character who absorbs his surroundings, the consequences of his acts, the morality of retiring replicants, the prejudice suffered by a society that does not accept him (and he demonstrates this with nicknames such as ""fake skin"" or ""soulless""), but it depends on it both on physical strength and on experience. If there is no action in the film, it is because the internal conflict has great weight and size. Although he is the predominant narrative driver, there is not only K's psychological elaboration and subjective drama as a narrative driver. The investigation, at a certain moment, gains prominence and leads the viewer by clue and suggestions that, in an unexpected turn, surprises the public. Villeneuve makes it clear that he never lost control of the narrative.It is amazing how the resurgence of Deckard (Harrison Ford) completely changes the tone of the feature film. As much as the return of such an iconic character immediately brings a smile to the fans, it is from his appearance that Blade Runner 2049 takes a bias closer to that of an action movie, with villains devoting time to scrutinize their plans and a number well greater number of action scenes. Deckard is the link between Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049. And this is symbolic not only for Ford's participation, but for being an aging life. The past of humanity (symbolized in that man) fighting the future, at first, artificial. But the questions return: What is artificial in existence? What makes life a miracle?The soundtrack emulates the classic through visceral and minimalist work. Even concerned with having its own identity, it is possible to notice references in the snoring of each booming and electronic note. Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer demonstrate punctual care when using the modulations proper to the 1980s to create an automatic sentimental bond. Present in very specific moments, it also has its own narrative, which grows with the film, amplifying the atmosphere. Each technical detail works in unison to compose a favorable environment - suggestive and sensorial - for the development of the narrative and its varied and deep moral and philosophical layers.Blade Runner 2049 justifies its existence as a late sequence by expanding concepts from the 1982 film and others established by Philip K. Dick. It does this not to answer old questions or simply renew a franchise, but to proceed with pertinent, cinematic and human inquiries. That remains a detective story and a story about existence. Only time will tell whether Blade Runner 2049 will represent what his father represented for science fiction. But answering that question is irrelevant in the face of what this film now represents: yet another beautiful demonstration that sequels can be just as relevant as the original.",Blade Runner 2049
152,Falconeer,Worthy Sequel To A Film Masterwork,8,15 August 2019,"This was a risky venture, making a film that is this slow and cerebral, in an age where social media and cellphone addiction has caused modern audiences to have the attention span (and IQ) of a flea. But ""Blade Runner 2049"" defies the demands and tastes of modern, ""mouth breathing"" audiences, by emerging as a sequel that retains both the mood, and pace of the original. Gosling, in the role of the young Blade Runner, ""K"" doesn't quite have the charisma of Harrison Ford, but his cold, emotionless style of acting fits perfectly with the role he is playing. A detective, hunting down and ""retiring"" older model Replicants, is a manufactured human himself, albeit a more modern and much improved model. But is he in fact, manufactured, or could it be that his childhood memories are authentic, and not just an implanted chip in his brain? And what connection does he have to Rick Deckard? This is the question, and main dilemma in this quiet and thought provoking film. And while not as flawless as the 1982 masterpiece, BR2049 is certainly the finest sequel to come out of Hollywood in two decades. Having the structure and pacing of a European film, it is so refreshing to finally see something of this caliber on the big screen again. That in itself is nostalgic; that feeling of being truly immersed in a movie at the theater, without being disappointed by inferior, rushed features that were so obviously just produced to generate a profit. It's interesting to note that. although this film is visually stunning, it still isn't as gorgeous as a film that came out 37 years earlier. But so many scenes in this sequel are unforgettable, and iconic. The 'return of Rachael' cameo was stunning and absolutely chilling, especially seeing the way they so coldly dispatch her when her image doesn't fulfill it's purpose. Of course without a solid script, this could have been little more than a series of pretty images. Thankfully, the story line is captivating from the very beginning. The mystery surrounding Joe's origins was well executed. in fact it was an emotional journey, as one can feel the character's pain caused by the desire to find his own worth and identity, a timeless subject that so many of us can relate to on some level. The final scene in the snow was filled with such desolation and loneliness, and i was not expecting to be so emotionally moved by a film like this. I cannot fathom the reviews that tear the movie apart and suggest that it is a bad film. I imagine those who hated this had no real understanding of the first film, or they are simply of the younger generation, who obviously possess no attention span whatsoever. BR 2049 is a film that Sci Fi fans will cherish, and want to add to their personal film libraries. It's bound to be a classic. It certainly won't be forgotten.",Blade Runner 2049

154,dave-mcclain,better than the original!,8,6 October 2017,"What on earth is a blade runner? Well who's asking? And why? You see, there are several ways to answer that question. The most obvious answer is ""Blade Runner"" is a movie – a classic 1982 science fiction thriller directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young. In this film's dystopian future, a blade runner is a cop who hunts down and ""retires"" (kills) synthetic human ""replicants"" who have escaped back to earth from the ""out-worlds"" where they served human colonists as slave labor. The story is an adaptation of the 1968 novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by legendary sci-fi author Philip K. Dick. But the phrase ""blade runner"" isn't even in the book!In fact, it was a phrase put in the original screenplay by ""Blade Runner"" co-writer Hampton Fancher – and enthusiastically embraced by Scott. But the phrase didn't originate with Fancher. He picked it up from the title ""Blade Runner (A Movie)"" by William S. Boroughs which was a treatment (and early version of a possible screenplay, hence the name) based on the 1974 novel ""The Blade Runner"" by Alan E. Nourse. That book creates a dystopian future in which the law requires that people who seek medical treatment get sterilized so their illnesses and/or tendencies to injury don't get transmitted to future generations. In the story, an underground medical community functions with the help of smugglers called blade runners who supply outlaw doctors with supplies ranging from medications to scalpels.Of course, the focus of this review is the 2017 sci-fi thriller ""Blade Runner 2049"" (R, 2:43). In an excellent article on theverge.com, writer Adi Robertson sums up the whole blade runner history this way: ""So 'Blade Runner 2049' is the sequel to a movie based on a book but named after a completely unrelated film treatment of yet another book, which was itself published as a third book with the subtitle 'A Movie'. In case that's not confusing enough, the latest reissue of 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' is also titled 'Blade Runner'. And we won't even get into the three Blade Runner sequel books by K.W. Jeter."" Obviously, when deciding whether to see this film, we all hope that its plot is less convoluted than the real-life story that brought us Movie Fans to this point – and that the 2017 film will satisfy fans of the 1982 original – as well as those who have never seen it or don't remember much of it.30 years after the events of the first film, newer, more human (but more obedient) replicants have been integrated into society, while the older models are still hunted down and retired by blade runners. 2049 Los Angeles is every bit as dark, dreary and damp as it was in 2019, just more technologically advanced, especially when it comes to the pervasive outdoor advertising (think huge electronic billboards which can be anywhere and have images that move and interact with prospective clients). One of the blade runners is simply known as K (Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling). K doesn't especially enjoy retiring replicants, but he loyally and competently serves his supervisor, Lieutenant Joshi (Golden Globe winner Robin Wright). Also, he has no friends and his roommate is a hologram named Joi (Ana de Armas).When K is sent to retire a newly-discovered rogue replicant named Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), K makes a curious discovery at Sapper's farm. K alerts Joshi who sends a dig team to the property. All this results in a startling revelation that Joshi tells K ""breaks the world."" Joshi is desperate to destroy any trace of what they have found. Niander Wallace (Oscar winner Jared Leto) is a replicant manufacturer with a serious god complex who is also very interested in the discovery in question. He sends his ruthless replicant assistant, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), after anything and anyone linked to the discovery, leading K to go looking for answers himself. Along the way, he seeks help from replicant memory maker Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri) and eventually finds long-retired blade runner Rick Deckard (Oscar nominee Harrison Ford – who isn't the only member of the original cast to show up.) And then I stop, so as to avoid spoilers.""Blade Runner 2049"" is actually superior to the first ""Blade Runner"". While Ridley Scott and company deserve credit for terrific creativity in bringing the original book to cinematic life (and creating a sci- fi classic), I didn't find the 1982 version to be especially compelling or well-acted. I have no such complaints about the sequel. The screenplay by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green honors its predecessor and takes the drama to a higher level. It also lays out a series of intriguing twists and surprising reveals from very early in the film and continuing until the very end – while asking some of the same questions eluded to in the first film – and taking them even further. There's just more at stake in the sequel – for the human race – and definitely for the individual characters (which are played superbly by all involved). Director Denis Villeneuve takes full advantage of the advances in cinematic technologies since 1982 and gives us visuals which are alternately (and in various combinations) raw, vibrant, haunting, erotic and just plain impressive. Both the original and the sequel are slowly paced and have minor plot holes, but 2017's version is much more entertaining. ""A-""",Blade Runner 2049
155,joebloggscity,Like tears in rain: Deep and impacting homage to the original,9,21 November 2018,"I have to concede that I was wrong on this movie. I have just watched it for the second time and now am conceding that it is an exceptional film, having at first been disappointed. I guess like the first film you need to watch this more than once to fully enjoy it, but I'm sure there will also be plenty of people who enjoyed it from the first watch.I'm a devotee to the original movie, and a sequel filled me with some dread. Concerned of what they were to do with the sequel, the storyline is admittedly quite heavy. The idea of replicant reproduction and its existential impact on the world is not exactly something I'd ever thought of before. Again as with the original, we are at the coalface of a future world, which in 2049 has destroyed its environment and is held together by technology. The world has progressed, but mankind hasn't.Our lead (Ryan Gosling) is excellent as the lonely man with only his avatar girlfriend for company who as a Blade Runner has stumbled upon a mystery that he has to investigate for himself as much as the authorities.The film is very long, it's very beautiful but give it a chance and you'll be engrossed. Just make sure you make a lot of time for it, as unlike its predecessor it's a long viewing with a lot to try to understand. A myriad of characters in this mostly amoral world who despite having power are emotionally unsatisfied. That's one crux of the film, but you'll find various other themes.It hasn't to date and will not have the impact of its predecessor, but it doesn't appear to attempt to do so. For cerebral viewing, truly it is up there with some of the best in many a year, and that is the best compliment you can give it. Another truly special movie.If you don't enjoy it first time, then please like me give it time to watch it again and you'll soon find that you will change your mind.",Blade Runner 2049
156,agmoldham,Better than original,5,10 November 2017,The Original Blade Runner movie is one of my most watched movies. I've probably watched it well over 20 times. You may be expecting me to go into a gushing critique about why Blade Runner is so good. The truth is that I never quite got it even though it should have been one of my favourite movies based on other peoples analysis.Forward 35 years and along comes Blade Runner 2049. For fans of the original movie the good news is that it has a very similar feel to the first movie. The story is very much the same with the main focus of the film being a blade runner K (Ryan Gosling) who is tracking down and retiring replicants. The movie is well acted and personally I found it slightly more satisfying than the original. Something tells me that I will be in the minority with that view though. Well worth a watch and sure to be one of the movies that 2017 is remembered for.,Blade Runner 2049
157,MihaiSorinToma,A very slow paced disappointment,6,14 October 2017,"Thirty years after the events from the first movie, another Blade Runner makes a staggering discovery which makes him investigate what turns out to be a very deep mystery which is somehow linked to the one from the first installment. Along the way, many secrets will be uncovered although it won't be an easy task, especially when there are several parties which want to know the truth.It's a movie which continues the events from its predecessor but it also does it in almost the same way, which is quite a disappointment to be honest. It manages to maintain its slow pace without any hesitation, making it even more tiresome than the previous movie. The plot is indeed a bit more interesting, but not enough, while the new characters seem to have a bit more depth. You still don't get to care about them, but it is marginally better regarding this aspect.It is also boring for a good period of time, having a tendency to over-extend each sequence much more that it would have been necessary to transmit the intended idea. Thus, it ended up as a very lengthy movie which could have told basically the same story in about two hours, if it would have left behind all the fillers and the exaggerated description of every scene, which can only induce boredom.Visually speaking, this movie is absolutely gorgeous. Its special effects are excellent and play a very important role in creating a very enjoyable dark atmosphere of what it looked like a post- apocalyptic city. Unfortunately, they simply aren't enough to raise this one from mediocrity, as they failed also in the first installment.The actors seem to do a good job but the plot and its sluggish rhythm simply drag it down. It's simply hard to enjoy a movie which seems to be made by a sloth, which bores you to death and then, from time to time, it realizes that it should bring something interesting to wake you up, cycling this way until the end, which, by the way, leaves plenty of room for yet another sequel which I truly hope will not exist. In my opinion, both movies are a big let-down, considering what worlds they had created and how spectacular they look, only to fill them with below average stories, told in the way they are told which simply do not provide interest, emotion or satisfaction.",Blade Runner 2049
158,swilliky,A long dazzling sci-fi sequel to a classic,8,8 October 2017,"This film may be one of the longest I see this year at nearly two and a half hours. Films by Denis Villeneuve move at a slow steady pace with long shots. This sequel to the 80s cult classic is gorgeous and mesmerizing as it moves around various parts of this futuristic west from trash heaps in San Diego to the red desert of an abandoned Las Vegas. Los Angeles is constantly stormy or snowing as the detection takes place in drab buildings or on dark city streets. The film begins with text informing the viewer that in the thirty years since the original film the Tyrell corporation has become bankrupt and the Wallace corporation has taken over. Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is a new version of the blade runner but also a newer model replicant. He arrives at the house of Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), a maggot farmer. He confronts him about his identity and the two fight until K finally kills Sapper with a pistol blast to the head. Before he leaves the site, his drone notices a strange box buried beneath a tree.K must go through tests to keep him at a baseline as they monitor the replicants more closely. Madam Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) is K's superior officer. Other people know K is a ""skinjob"" and yell slurs at him or write them on his apartment door. He has a virtual woman for company, Joi (Ana de Armas). He brings home a new update that allows her to travel around but he's called back to the office before he gets to use it. The box beneath ground contained bones of a recently pregnant woman but K zooms in to find a serial number etched mysteriously on the bones. Lieutenant Joshi is disturbed by the revelation that replicants can reproduce and orders K to destroy the evidence. Tracking the serial number brings K to the Wallace corporation where he is met by the replicant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). She identifies the number as belonging to Rachel and plays the recorder from the first film when Deckard (Harrison Ford) tested her.

160,abisio,A movie longer than the ideas in it,4,9 October 2017,"Denis Villeneuve has become an interesting director; INCENDIES was interesting, PRISONERS quite cynical, ENEMY and SICARIO real masterpieces. Not that fond of ARRIVAL but anyway it was acceptable. I am not a huge fan of Ridley Scott; I always believe that his visuals and concepts were larger and more interesting than the movies he crafted. Take for example PROMETHEUS and its follow up ALIEN CONVENANT. The first one was an interesting concept; completely destroyed in the follow up. Villeneuve was able to expand the BLADE RUNNER concept but instead of developing his ideas he dedicated more the visuals and expanded the movie to 2 hours and 44 minutes; which is at least one hour more than it needed to be. BLADE RUNNER was far from an action flick with a running time below two hours was able to deliver an idea; this one only delivers boredom. Lots of unnecessary over extended scenes that even great actors like Ryan Gosling have trouble to dealing with. And after almost three hours; the ending is simplistic and take away any interesting concept that could came earlier. Basically the final scenes leave the viewer expecting for more and obviously frustrated.In brief; if you are a hard fan of the original get good nap before entering the theater; you are going to fall sleep anyway but at least not so often.",Blade Runner 2049
161,bob-the-movie-man,A Visual Triumph,9,6 October 2017,"I lived in fear of this film since it was announced having loved the original, a sequel was always going to be a risky prospect. But my fears were slightly quelled when I learned that Denis Villeneuve (""Arrival"") was at the helm. And having now seen it I am pleasantly relieved: this is a memorable film. In 2049 the first-generation Nexus replicants of the original film are still causing problems, and Ryan Gosling is 'K' – a blade runner employed by LAPD lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright, ""Wonder Woman"", ""House of Cards"") to track them down and liquidate them. On one of these missions, K uncovers a buried secret that brings the LAPD into a desperate race for a pivotal prize, against replicant-builder Niander Wallace (Jared Leto, ""Dallas Buyer's Club"") and his henchwoman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). The mission leads to K searching out his illustrious predecessor Deckard (Harrison Ford), who is not keen to be found.Firstly (and most impressively) this is a spectacle to watch. ""I've seen things""! The visuals are just gorgeous, from the junk-yards of Greater Los Angeles to the radioactive ruins of Las Vegas, vividly glowing amber to glorious effect. Hardly a surprise with Roger Deakins (""Hail Caesar"", ""Sicario"") behind the camera, but Adam Heinis (""Rogue One"") and the rest of his special effects team deserve kudos for the effects never feeling overly ""CGI-like"".The music (by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, via a replaced Johann Johannsson) pays suitable tribute to the spirit of the original Vangelis soundtrack. (It's curious though that ""Tears in the Rain"" from the soundtrack is a reworking of the Vangelis original, but Vangelis doesn't seem to be credited anywhere! Vangelis and Ridley Scott clearly had a SERIOUS falling out!). On the acting front, Ryan Gosling is his dynamic self as usual! (But here, somewhat justified). Harrison Ford is given very little screen time, but what he does do he does exceptionally well – his best performance in years. It's some of the supporting parts though that really appeal: Dave Bautista (""Spectre"") is just superb in the opening scenes of the film, and I particularly enjoyed Ana de Armas's portrayal of K's holographic girlfriend Joi. I've seen comment in other reviews that described this relationship as ""laughable"" and a downward step for ""woman's rights"" compared to Villeneuve's previous strong female characters (of Louise from ""Arrival"" and Kate from ""Sicario""). But I disagree! I found the relationship truly touching, with Joi's procurement of a prostitute (Mackenzie Davis) to act as a surrogate body being both loving and giving. And as regards 'woman's rights', come on! Get serious! This is a holographic commercial male companion. the ""Alexa"" of the future. I'm quite sure the male version looks like Ryan Reynolds! Sex still sells even in 2049!! My favourite character though was a cameo by Barkhad Abdi (""Captain Phillips"") luxuriating under the name of Doctor Badger!I was less comfortable with Jared Leto's dialogue which – for me at least was barely audible. In general this film is both a challenge for those aurally challenged (with some fuzzy dialogue/effects/music mixes) and those visually challenged (with 8 point font for the on-screen text that was almost impossible to see on the cinema screen, so good luck with the DVD!).I really wanted to give this film 10 stars. But I can't quite get there. The story – while interesting and having emotional depth – is lightweight for a film of this length (a butt-numbing 163 minutes!) and it moves at such a glacial pace that I'm ashamed to say that my mind wandered at times. The screenplay was by Hampton Fancher (one of the original Blade Runner writers) and Michael Green (""Logan"", ""Alien: Covenant"") but even with this track record, the it's the film's Achilles heel. It's a relief that Blade Runner revisited is not a complete disaster: quite the opposite in fact. It doesn't quite match C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate (what could) but its a damned good attempt.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the full and graphical version of this review.

162,silvermistvio,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The movie is so slow, so boring as the plot is so plain.",1,21 February 2018,"I really had a high hope for this one because it had high rating here on IMDB. So, I watched it. The running time is nearly 3 hours long, so, I patiently watched. As an hour passed, nothing much happened. At that time, I thought the movie was 3 hours long, so, they needed some time to build the plot. And so, I waited for great scenes. But instead of great scenes, what came from the movie was disappointment. The movie is so slow, so boring and the plot is so plain. The plot has nothing. The K character was moving and tracking for something from place to place. And he found a man as a result. That is all for the plot. I'll tell you how much the movie is boring. Normally, I always finish a movie in one sit. I always finish a movie in one day. I could watch it even when I was about to go to sleep. I remembered when I watched Justice League, I was about to go to sleep. My eyes were almost closing. But the movie kept me awake. I finished it without feeling sleepy. But this movie? Well, it took me 3 days to finish. Because it's so boring, after every an hour passed, I didn't want to continue to watch. So, I stopped watching it. A day passed, on the next day, I thought if I haven't finished it, I wouldn't know about the movie. So, I continued to watch. The same thing happened. I got bored again after an hour passed. So, I stopped watching again. In this way, it took me 3 days to finish. This movie might be great one for some people, but for me, it's not even worth to spend 3 hours of free time.Thank Buddha that I didn't go to cinema and watch this crap. If I did, my aunt would probably scold me for wasting money to watch this crap. And I'd probably wanted to get out in the middle of the movie and wanted to get a refund. I saw that some people watched this one for more than once and some people watched it many times. I don't know what made them like this movie. But for me, it's one time watch only. I would never ever watch this crap. I only watched this one because of high ratings and nominations for Oscars. Although the movie is so slow, so plain and so boring, the sound mixing is quite good. Sound editing and visual effects are not that much good and also cinematography too. I hope the other nominees would win for sound editing, visual effects and cinematography. All in all, if you don't have anything to watch to make you feel sleepy, then watch this one. It will definitely make you feel sleepy because it worked for me.",Blade Runner 2049

It is oh so boring!Then I watched Blade Runner 2049 and I was hopeful that this would make more sense. Oh my gosh, almost as boring, but making more sense, but even more overlong, getting close to 3 hours. Why this movie is made out to be top notch sci-fi will remain a mystery and beyond me. Movies are supposed to be entertaining and joyful to watch, but neither Blade Runner fits the bill.I was drawn to watch Blade Runner 2049 because of Harrison Ford, but normal movies would have finished before he finally appeared. 2018 it not starting with a good impression and this movie only gets a fair 6.",Blade Runner 2049

A villainous corporation owner (Jared Leto) also seeks Deckland and sends Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), his own vicious and ruthless replicant to hunt Deckard and K down.This long awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 film is well worth the wait (Scott was also an executive producer on the film). Of course this newer film is more in tune with the politics of its time, yet retains the hologram adverts corporate images of a rainy noirish LA from the original. The deserts and landscapes outside of this urbanism is barren and otherwise windswept and post-apocalyptic bleak image of a dystopian future.Gosling as K is suitably moody and melancholic, unsure of his own identity while Hoeks is blank and malevolent, almost a female version of a Terminator.

So this time I watch the 1984 final cut first. Honestly, except the last monologue, I thought that first movie was a snooze fest. 2049 improved a lot more than the 1984, but still I thought the pacing was a bit too slow.What's significantly better was the story, which was more intense and harder to predict than the first. There was also more characterization to the main blade runner, played by the subdued Ryan Gosling. He had to figure out his past, and the twists and turns made his journey much more interesting than Deckard in the 1984 movie.The cinematography was undeniably top-notch. Almost every shot was breathtaking and gorgeous. Ana de Armas looked out of this world, just like she was in No Time to Die.Overall, I wasn't entirely onboard with the story, but I definitely enjoyed the beautiful look of the dystopian world. 8/10.",Blade Runner 2049
167,DarthVoorhees,Moody and narratively thin but a visual triumph nonetheless.,6,24 June 2018,'Blade Runner 2049' was a movie that really did not beg to be made. I felt that the themes of 'Blade Runner' and it's gloomy sense of slim hope ended perfectly with the original film. 'Blade Runner 2049' is a film that cosmetically appears more clever than it is. As a story it is verily predictable and it's secrets aren't really all that impressive. However It's visually one of the best recent Science Fiction films of this generation. On the strength of how the movie looks and builds its worlds I strongly recommend the film.There just isn't much of a story or character development. It hammers the philosophical questions into the faces of the viewer rather than have them unfurl as I felt that the original did. Jared Leto is waaaayyy too much. I also feel like this one takes away a lot of the ambiguity and mystery that was a strength of the original 'Blade Runner'. I mean part of the appeal of the cult following of that film is that you never quite understood how everything fell into place at its great ending. It wasn't a film screaming for a sequel. I gotta be honest it was kind of a let down seeing old Edward James Olmos folding his orgami in the retirement home.,Blade Runner 2049
168,brankovranjkovic,Blade runner 2049: Harrison Ford is still the Ultimate Blade Runner,7,6 October 2017,"I was (and still am) a big fan of the iconic 1982 original. The grey, dingy, unattractive visual appearance has influenced the look of the 'future' in almost every other sci-fi film since. The original plot has had audiences discussing the 'is he or isn't he' Deckard character for over 30 years. I anticipated something special, but surprisingly felt a little let down. My spontaneous reaction is that besides the very noisy soundtrack and overlong run-time, it's hard to pin-point the reason for the lack of magic, which the original had in abundance, as there's nothing wrong but nothing very special either. 2049 sequel won't endure in quite the same way, probably not worthy of a second viewing.",Blade Runner 2049
169,Darkside-Reviewer,Even synthetic life finds a way,9,6 February 2020,I really wasn't expecting much from this movie seeing as most sequels or modern adaptations of older movies tend to be pretty poor quality compared to the originals but Blade Runner 2049 is in that rare category of sequels that does exactly what sequels are meant to do take the original movie's idea and source material and do two important things with them number one add to the movies universe and story and number two improve on the visual effects and tie up any unresolved story points left over from the original this movie not only does both of these things but it does them without messing up or ruining anything from the original movie which is considered to be a science fiction classic.The movie follows K (Ryan Gosling) a Blade Runner who is hunting his own kind synthetic androids who are designed to look and act as human as possible while having android benifits like increased strength and speed K is an advanced model that while smart independent and deadly is programed to always follow orders and never run from his eventual fate of retirement/death after hunting down an older model who remained in hiding for 30 years on a protein farm K discovers that a miracle happened on the farm 29 years ago a synthetic gave birth to a child something thought impossible as androids do not produce life but after discovering this miracle he is ordered to track down the child and erase all evidence of it's existence to prevent an uprising by synthetics his investigation takes him on a journey that will test everything he thinks he knows about synthetic life and even his own past while bringing an old Blade Runner legend out from retirement Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford).The movie both looks and sounds amazing with absolutely breathtaking visuals that make the Blade Runner universe look better than ever while still keeping a lot of the original movies designs and architectural elements just with an updated look that uses CGI in an effective way without looking overly flashing or as in your face as most modern science fiction movies tend to do.The movie really is more about Ryan Goslings character than it is Harrison Fords so if your expecting a movie that had a lot of Ford in it you will be disappointed as he is only in the movie for the last hour and his actual screen time is around 30 minutes maybe less but honestly Goslings performance in this movie is amazing he really brings his A game and delivers a unique and interesting performance that actually changed my view of him as an actor and I personally would like to see him in more science fiction movies in the future.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the original Blade Runner and enjoys science fiction movies that tell unique and interesting stories while also having some kick ass action scenes.,Blade Runner 2049
170,djurrepower,good,7,16 March 2021,"It gives the same mood and atmosphere as the last movie, but it lacks some of the plot. Sure this is an amazing movie, but it feels like it misses some soul, that charm and passion from the previous movie. But overall this movie is great.7/10: good good",Blade Runner 2049
171,anselmdaniel,A different Blade Runner,8,5 October 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to Blade Runner. The movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Ryan Gosling. The movie takes place 30 years after the end of the first movie. Ryan Gosling plays officer K, a replicant police office, investigating a mystery of a replicant child that underwent a natural birth.Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful movie. The movie is gorgeously shot with images that will stock with the viewer. Denis Villeneuve is an excellent director that was able to capture the spirit of the original movie with his own style. Denis Velleneuve is also able to convey emotions on the screen without dialogue simply by showing visuals. The visual aspect is easily the best part of this movie and any scene has the classic Blade Runner feel to it.The story can be hit or miss for the audience. Much of the movie is about Officer K. Ryan Gosling does a good job in his portrayal of the character but much of the movie revolves around K's actions to other characters. This is where the audience's involvement in the character's struggle is important. Throughout the movie, K believes himself to be the chosen one, the replicant that was born from a human father and replicant mother. This narrative is supported by Joi. The entire movie is the investigation of this. The audience needs to care about this story arc. However some elements of the movie are weak that prevent fully enjoyment and engrossment into this part of the movie. Niander Wallace, played by Jared Leto, has weak scenes and does not feel like a developed character. He simply wants the child for profit. Likewise, a replicant resistance movement wanted to protect the child. The motives and evidence is not completely clear and some of this feel intentional. The ending with K finding Deckard is also out of place as K had lost track of Luv at this point. Somehow he was able to find Deckard's convoy and was able to shoot down the correct cars. This felt strange to me as up to this point, the movie felt logical.The movie's minor flaws are not enough to prevent enjoyment of the movie. Ryan Gosling is great on the screen and I became engrossed in the story. It was great revisiting the Blade Runner universe and seeing its themes were still intact. I also enjoyed the dynamic between K and Joi.Blade Runner 2049 is highly recommended.Grade: A.",Blade Runner 2049
172,Headturner1,not basing off the orriginal,7,10 August 2018,"I don't even remember if I saw the original. But it seems as tho most the bad reviews are from people comparing it the the original. I thought it pretty good. The acting was good loved Luv. Thought everyone's acting good except ""gasp"" Harrison Ford. Jared leto does a good job of playing creepy characters. Yes there were flaws in the script but I thought it was better than 80% of things released now a days. I also loved Joy. Seems most the men only liked it for the women. maybe buy a fashion magazine and quit whining. I believe this is worth the watch and Ryan gossling was also good. If you just go in with a open mind and not compare the two I think you'll enjoy it.",Blade Runner 2049
173,msbreviews,Rating: A+,10,6 October 2017,"Before I actually start reviewing Blade Runner 2049, I need to briefly share my thoughts on the first film and also to answer a question that a lot of people have been asking me: ""do I need to watch the original to enjoy and understand the sequel""? Important fact: I re- watched Blade Runner: Final Cut (1997) and a few hours later, I was standing in an IMAX theater waiting for 2049 to start, so I'm pretty sure that I was the best-prepared person in that theater to watch Villeneuve's movie.After a lot of thinking and analysis, I concluded that I love Blade Runner. The cultural influence that it had on sci-fi and how it changed filmmaking, makes it a masterpiece, even though it has some flaws. From the incredible, profound and intriguing story to one of the brainiest unconfirmed mysteries of cinema, it's one of Ridley Scott's greatest films. It's one of those rare movies that gets better and better with time (extremely underrated when it came out), but it's still mind-blowing how well a film stands 35 years after its release.I would give it an A, due to some issues that I can't overlook. The romance between Deckard and Rachael (Sean Young) feels very forced and the pacing isn't well-balanced. However, the amazing story, the well-developed characters and the beautiful cinematography, plus an excellent performance by Harrison Ford and an exquisite directing work by Ridley Scott, elevate Blade Runner and make it one of the most influent sci-fi movies of all-time.So, my answer to the pertinent question at the beginning of this review is ... Watch the original! I'm not advising you to watch it because you'll not understand the sequel if you don't, but due to its importance and how it molds 2049 as one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen.I don't think this movie is for everyone though. I don't think an occasional film-goer will understand how mind-blowing Villeneuve's movie is or how influential it will become. Some people will feel extremely bored during the first half of the film, some might even leave. Others might enjoy the second half of the movie and end up being satisfied with it. People like me, who LOVE movies and LOVE the art of filmmaking, will leave the theater jaw-dropped and tearily happy for having experienced such a stunning masterpiece!Villeneuve requested film critics to not spoil any plot point that could ruin the movie. I'm overjoyed to honor that request because this is a film that you NEED to watch at the best quality theater, with the best looking screen and with the best sound speakers. Roger Deakins' cinematography is beautifully perfect. It's just perfect. There's not a better word to describe such flawless and stunning visuals. If he doesn't get every single award for this category, I'll give up on caring about Oscars or Golden Globes. Congratulations on being such an inspiration and on elevating every single movie you're in, Deakins.Denis Villeneuve reinforces his position as my favorite director working nowadays and as one of the best directors of all-time. His unbelievable imagination and wonderful way of grasping every single moment and turning it into so much more than it actually is, either by adding asphyxiating suspense or overwhelming dialogue, are just two of many phenomenal skills that he possesses.Michael Green and Hampton Fancher's writing is worthy of all attention and some more from the audience. Every single word matters! Every line of dialogue is filled with so much depth and meaning, which setups so many surprises that Villeneuve brilliantly executes with the help of a memorable soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Every single technical aspect of Blade Runner 2049 is an epic example of how to produce a film. I have no words to describe how PERFECT the work behind the screen is ...Ryan Gosling deserves every type of praise and so much more. If he got nominated for his La La Land's performance, he's definitely going to win everything this year. I mean, he has to! His characters' conflicting memory and heartfelt story are extremely well displayed by Gosling in the first half of the movie, the half that most people will have a grudge with due to its pacing, but not me. The deliberately slow rhythm is so magnificently compensated in the last half that I don't even consider it a minor issue. In addition to his great performance, Gosling also has the best dialogue scene in the entire film, which I can't wait to watch all over again hundreds of times.Harrison Ford has his best performance in years and he also might get some nominations. Once again, his characters' past is as mysterious as it was in 1982 and the surprises are jaw- dropping. Robin Wright (Lieutenant Joshi) and Ana de Armas (Joi) also achieve great performances, as Jared Leto (Niander Wallace) briefly shines in his few scenes.Finally, the story is what gives this movie the feel of epicness. It truly justifies the long runtime (even if I agree that it could have been 10-15min shorter), but it lays those reasons on the audience, expecting us to wait ... and wait. Patience is more than a virtue in this film, it's a necessity. These are the only pieces of advice I'm giving to people: watch the first movie and WAIT for the second one to blow you away. That's as far as I'm going with the plot, I want you to enjoy and have the same spectacular experience that I had.Undoubtedly, Blade Runner 2049 is my favorite film of 2017 and it's going to be extremely difficult for any other to surpass it, as Denis Villeneuve's flawless masterpiece surpassed Ridley Scott's original. Denis' technically mind-blowing directing, Roger Deakins' jaw-dropping cinematography, Hans Zimmer's memorable score, Michael Green and Hampton Fancher's incredibly tricky and meaningful screenplay ... All of that, plus heartfelt and compelling performances from Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, elevate this movie and make it an EPIC MASTERPIECE.I'm filled with tears of wonder and joy ... Go see it so you can be too.",Blade Runner 2049

176,mahmus,A perfect sequel,10,21 October 2020,"When I heard they were making a sequel to Blade Runner, one of my favorite films at that time, my reaction was ""No! Leave the original alone!"". Thank God they didn't because Blade Runner 2049 is just as good, if not better than the original.I remeber my biggest fear was that they would drop the slow pace and noir atmosphere for more action and explosions, but thankfully, the film remains just as slow and just as great for it as the first one.The effects are outstanding and sure to stand the test of time just like the original's. Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning in every way. The performances from Ryan Gosling, Ana de Armas and Harrison Ford are spectular.I love how realistically the technology has progressed since the first once. Everything's just a little more advanced after thirty years.I also love how it subverts the ""chosen one"" trope.
K may not have been a real human bean, but he sure was a real hero (sorry).Rarely does a movie come around and blow away all my expectations like this.",Blade Runner 2049
177,joachimokeefe,Blade Crawler,2,10 October 2017,"In 2017, Hollywood successfully clones a film from 1982. New features include enhanced eroticism, several powerful female characters and implanted shoutouts to the original. All that's missing is an emotion chip, and a fast-forward button. The story is about who the lost replicant baby had grown up to be; this plot maguffin didn't appear until 28 minutes. That's 28 pages of script before there's any story at all, and that's about as suspenseful as 'The Sixth Sense'. Mostly it's CGI, models, green screen, all very fascinating, heavyhandedly recreating the atmosphere, but not the impact, of the original movie.An hour and a half in, Harrison Ford appears, living in a sort of Star Trek TNG holodeck crossed with the Overlook Hotel from The Shining, then a man of 29 and a man of over 70 have a fist fight. Time begins to stand still. 1980's shoulderpads make a comeback. The climax is a cliché-packed replicant fight against rising flood water that goes on and on and on. And on. Like Cape Fear did, only that had thrills. Then somebody dies, eventually, on the snowy steps.Harrison Ford is worth watching when he's on, so there's a mark out of 10. Ryan Gosling also masterfully conveys the severely limited emotional range of an android. He's a natural. But you miss Rutger Hauer.Who's real? Who's a replicant? Who cares after TWO AND A QUARTER HOURS? Retro flying cars by Peugeot. Look out for this movie shown every Xmas for the next 40 years. Especially Xmas 2049.",Blade Runner 2049
178,0w0,"Great sci-fi action, hampered by plot holes",7,2 May 2020,"Nothing is more infuriating than seeing characters in movies making unrealistic and irrational decisions, which end up changing the plot / story irrevocably. Throughout the movie, the main character makes 3 such irrational decisions that I noticed, that change the outcome of the story (there may be more). One example, without spoiling: At the end of the movie, one character makes a very unrealistic decision in a gun-battle, and it ends up costing this character's life... this was poor writing and it created a plot-hole, since no rational person would have done what this character did in a real gun-battle... and to make it even worse, we have to remember that this character has military-training and is supposed to be a tactically superior to a 'normal rational person'.This is honestly a 8/10 movie, but it's brought down to a 7/10 due to the plot holes. Nonetheless it's a movie that's worth watching, but this movie is even better if you watch the 1982 Blade Runner beforehand.",Blade Runner 2049
179,RussHog,Awesome,10,7 October 2017,"One of the greatest stories ever told gets an incredible sequel. This film pays tribute to the original but does not try to remake, reboot, or launch a prequel. 
The new Blade Runner is a replicant with a long life span - but the mystery that leads him to seek Harrison Ford begins to make him have connection with ideas of love and family. The visuals and world building in this movie rule - and it is a must see in IMAX. Also, the slow methodical probing world building is truly masterful.",Blade Runner 2049
180,Andres-Camara,More conventional than the predecessor.,6,11 February 2018,"What do I mean? Although the predecessor was commercial, the director had printed a stamp so lyrically yours that you had to enter it or you stayed out. I always stayed outside and I've seen it several times. But it is his brand and he does it. It had a touch of its author. This does not have that touch, you do not have to enter any of his world, you just see it, a little long, trying to give a mystical touch that does not get, but you see it and that's it. What happens is that as you do not have to enter, if you like it, you like it and if not then it is not, but it is easy to see it.One thing I do not like about modern cinema is that they explain things to you. When a director, you put a plan again to explain something that happened. In this case they do it and it is worse because at the end of the film it solves it in the final plane, but it explains you and goes back in history.The photography is spectacular. It gets you into that world. It's dark, but it lets you see. It is beautiful and it helps. Along with art and makeup they do a great job.The effects, of course, great. In a movie of this size I did not expect less, but they are well made and support the film.The address, however, I do not finish liking. Use the camera without a reason, change the plane goes in and out of action too many times. He does not have the camera and he does not know how to make beautiful shots. He tries to make poetry and luckily, he does not get it.Music, I liked the old one, in this case, it will not go down in history.But good for the duration it has, it can be seen well.",Blade Runner 2049
181,MrDHWong,A masterpiece of science fiction and possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made,10,5 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) and once again based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, it successfully recaptures just about everything excellent about the original and is a superb sequel to one of the greatest and most important science fiction films of all time.Thirty years after the events of the first film, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) works as a Blade Runner, retiring old rogue replicants (artificial humans) hiding out around the Los Angeles area. One day while on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of a replicant which leads him on a journey to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical and thought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point where I felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted to see. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who does a fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhaps best of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fully understand everything that is going on, although it would probably still help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that author Philip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10",Blade Runner 2049

Yes the sequel is much simpler than the original. In general Denis Villeneuve the excellent director, has perfectly reported the atmosphere of the original, but after all the first hour of the movie is tightened and in general almost doesn't bear important semantic loading. Jarrett Leto has perfectly played the antagonist, will be sure continuation soon and he will be revealed completely as personnel. And the main thing, is an ending. She has a little disappointed, after all there is a wish to see the complete final, let and open, but complete. As in the first part, but not just end of a deytstviye and credits.",Blade Runner 2049
183,Alexander_Blanchett,One of the best sequels ever,9,8 October 2017,"Never been a fan of the first one, not even after multiple viewings. I always adored its visuality and atmosphere but never connected to the story. In this sequel it worked in both areas. Breathtaking visuality and a fantastic story I totally related to from the first tot he last minute. People complain its long or even over long. I disagree because I think the complex story needed its time to develop in its full glory. Denis Villeneuve is a fantastic storyteller and with almost 3 hours running time he had my full attention. The screenplay was also excellently written. Its a great detective story, I would even go so far and compare it to Film Noir in a SciFi frame. Acting wise it is more than satisfying. Ryan Gosling was the most perfect choice for the leading role. He really embodies everything Harrison Ford had in the original and really made his character relatable. It was also not your stereo SicFi hero character, he really had a lot of depths. Harrison Ford himself was solid enough. I question his believably in those action scenes but he really explored his character further and was adequate doing so. Jared Leto overdid his role and actually the scenes with him were the weakest of the film, yes the character was important for the storyline but generally I did not care much for him here. Ana de Armas had a lot of emotional depth in his otherwise possibly one dimensional character. Sylvia Hoaks was a decent enough villain. Robin Wright a little bit wasted and I really liked David Bautista here. Visual the film could not have been any better. Cinematography was perfection. Visual Effects were perfection (Sean Young's rejuvenation was probably the best version of that effect any recent movie had so far). The score was good and did justice to the original. All in all a great detective tale and for me a HUGE step up from the first one.",Blade Runner 2049

This film is an example of how editing us vital.",Blade Runner 2049
185,CANpatbuck3664,Beautiful Atmosphere and an Interesting Mystery Help Blade Runner 2049 Continue a Classic Story,8,7 October 2017,"I've only seen the original Blade Runner once and it was a long time ago. I liked it but I just haven't got around to revisiting it. I mention this because even though I'm not a die-hard fan of Blade Runner, I still found the plot of 2049 engrossing. It's a well put together mystery, I found that they constantly took the plot in unexpected directions and other than the trailer spoiling the return of Deckard, I was always excited about what was going to happen next. The movie pulls an excellent bait and switch at the end that really surprised me. They made the right decision to not repeat the formula of the first one and take the story to a new place. They also create some compelling subplots which is something that few movies get right.The biggest star of this movie is the cinematography and the excellent work of Roger Deakins. The original was noteworthy with the special environment that Ridley Scott and his creative team brought to the screen. That was continued here if not improved upon. The look of L.A. in 2049 they decided to go with isn't completely distinct but it was a little more understated (I'd compare it to the 2017 Ghost in the Shell but less fantastical). My favourite scene might have been a shootout in a defunct club where the lighting and the background show are turning on and off. I don't hesitate to praise when a movie looks good but this is an exemplary example of using visuals and atmosphere to help build on a strong story.Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously.There were points in this movie I could have rated this a 9/10 but some small things that I had to dock the movie for. Even with a compelling story, the movie has such a long run time that it couldn't help but drag. There are certain scenes where the movie wants you to really drink in the environment but they could have edited it a little tighter. They also couldn't help but lose me at points through how much artistic flair the utilize. Villenueve is an authority in this area and while I appreciate an artistic approach to this science fiction tale, for me they overdid it a little.I was surprised how much I ended up liking Blade Runner 2049. I think if you're a big fan of the original, you'll love this to bits. This is successful in bringing in the uninitiated but I think fans will enjoy this even more. I haven't been on board for all of Villenueve's films but this is a good combination of his artistic style with enough of a commercial element for the masses. I'd give this somewhere between an 8-9 but with the extremely long run time, I'll give this an 8/10.",Blade Runner 2049
186,cliftonofun,A suitable follow-up that stands on its own,8,27 December 2017,"Following up on a cult sci fi classic is not quite impossible. But it is close. Villeneuve's task is Herculean, and he basically nails it. From the visual scope to the sonic experience to the slowly evolving mystery, this movie returns to the world of Blade Runner...while also offering something new that stands on its own. It is cinematic and emotional and stunning. That said, a lot has changed since 1983. This film is great, but it is hard to impress me with visuals now, and stories about noir near futures are not novel anymore. I'm not sure we needed another Blade Runner, and I could have re-watched ""Her"" to get the same themes. But if we were gonna do another one, I'm glad this director was around to make it happen.",Blade Runner 2049
187,ronakkotian,One of the best sequels made,10,23 July 2020,"Blade Runner is a cult classic and has inspired countless sci-fi films after it so making a sequel to it thirty-five years later will be worrying to fans of the original. I have to admit, Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels made.Blade Runner 2049 follows K, a blade runner in the year 2049, who unearths secrets that lead him on a mission to find Deckard.Even if you don't like Blade Runner 2049, the one thing everyone can agree on is how amazing the cinematography is. Roger Deakens is one of my favourite cinematographers and the amount of work he put into this film is stunning. I'm so happy he got his long deserved Oscar for this. There are so many gorgeous frames that could be hung up on a wall as a portrait. The visual effects and colourful scenery entrance and transcends you to this dystopian world and keeps you there through its duration. It's an absolute feast for the eyes. The Blade Runner universe has never looked better.Denis Villenueve has impressed me with films like Prisoners and Enemy but Blade Runner 2049 has solidified him as one of the best directors working today. This man has a huge amount of talent and I'm so happy he got chosen to direct this. I honestly cannot wait for Dune adaptation. Hampton Fancher, who wrote the original Blade Runner, returns to write 2049 as well. I think the story this time is more entertaining and Fancher retains everything that made the original so good. Some may say the film is too long but for me this was an extremely fast 2 hours and 40 minutes. I felt each scene had purpose and nothing was wasted.Ryan Gosling continues to impress with his restrained performance here. You can by Harrison Ford's acting whether he cares about the film he's doing and this is one of the best performances in recent years. He clearly loved this script a lot. I loved Ana de Armas in Knives Out and once again she proved herself as a worthy actress. Robin Wright was great and Jared Leto redeemed himself here after Suicide Squad.If you are a fan of sci-fi or the original Blade Runner, I sure 2049 will not disappoint. It's that rare sequel that I think is even better than the first. It's a film that manages to build upon the first one and present itself with extraordinary cinematography, an interesting story and great performances while staying faithful to the original. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels made.",Blade Runner 2049
188,garethcrook,Did I like it? I loved it!,8,18 May 2018,"Bladerunner 2049 should be seen in a cinema on the biggest screen you can find. I don't often go to the cinema though, which is why I review films long after their release. With a decent TV and surround sound (seriously, this will rattle your bass bins) this still packs a punch though. As I've said before, I'm not one for science fiction, but I do enjoy a good bleak depiction of a dystopian future and Bladerunner is nothing if not that. There are problems here, I don't rate Gosling, but then he's playing a soulless replicant here, so perhaps he's perfect. Same for Ridley Scott, self indulgent and self aggrandising, but Bladerunner is what he does best and seeing as he's handed the controls over to Villeneuve here he seems to get away with it. So despite this not matching the originality of the... original, it is a worthy piece of carefully crafted cinema. Deakins' cinematography is gorgeous. Equal parts cyberpunk sensory overload and sleek desolation and lets face it, a big part of this is all about style. Couple that with Zimmers Vangelis inspired score and you've got a real feast for the senses. Despite Reynolds inadequacies, he's the hero, the focus, present in nearly every scene and thus even I find myself warm to him as he melts in with the bleak industrial nightmare of the future and his world begins to unravel from what he thought he knew wasn't real. Sadly some of the plot points are somewhat telegraphed, but the narrative still ticks along very nicely and for all the stark future-tech, there is jeopardy, a real connection with the characters. When Ford appears though, I couldn't help feel that that kind of presence is what it had been missing for the previous 2 hours. I don't know whether he had it written into his contract that he'd get the best lines, but to be frank, he delivers them all with style, a style that despite his best efforts, Gosling can't touch, not least due to his apparent inability to convey any kind of feeling in that vacant look permanently etched on his face. Is it indulgent? Of course it is. Did I like it? I loved it!",Blade Runner 2049
189,trinaboice,Long-awaited sequel,8,21 October 2017,"Grade: A-Rating: R, 164 minutesIn a Nutshell: This is a LONG movie. If you're a big fan of the 1982 original Blade Runner, you'll probably love every minute, while admittedly, it's not everyone's cup of futuristic tea. This visually stunning sequel was a long time in coming and I'm thrilled that Harrison Ford was able to be in it so we can revisit his character.You don't have to see the original Blade Runner movie first, but it sure helps. While this film stands alone in an impressive way, it also deepens and expands the original. It's a science-fiction masterpiece that has director Denis Villeneuve earning the praise he deserves.Uplifting theme: What makes a man? What is humanity? Life....the value of life, the meaning of life.Things I liked: You had me at Ryan Gosling. When he touched a piano key, I kind of hoped he'd start singing City Of Stars (From ""La La Land"" Soundtrack) ha ha Ana de Armas is just fun to look at. I loved her scenes with Ryan Gosling. Robin Wright sure has come a long way since The Princess Bride (one of my all-time faves.) They did an amazing job with creating a new world and time. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is outstanding. Some say it's the best of his career and worthy of an Oscar. The sound is impressive, but sometimes annoying. There are many surprises, which makes movie-going so much fun.Things I didn't like: Everything is so dusty! ha ha Some of the frames are just so long and drawn out and slow-moving. Did I say the same thing three times? There are a lot of scenes where people sit, think, and stare. Lots of monologues. It takes forever to be rewarded with scenes that include both Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling. You kind of have to watch both films more than once to really understand it. I readily admit I don't get it all.Tips for parents: Kids may be confused with what's happening and get bored. Watching the movie requires a certain amount of patience. Violence. Some gory, bloody scenes. Full female nudity. Prostitute action. Some profanity.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",Blade Runner 2049
190,brett-76260,Crap this was a waste,2,6 July 2018,"Good lawd what a waste of time on this one... long, boring and just a mess to watch. They could have cut out half the movie by editing out all the items that did nothing for the plot. Can't believe this has so many good reviews as it was hard to watch after about the first 15 minutes. Could have been so much better... epic failure!!!",Blade Runner 2049
191,statuskuo,Huh?,3,6 October 2017,"I agree with Rutger Hauer in his assessment that this movie didn't need to be made. To be this long is a travesty of the mystery that brought on the original. A humanistic question that didn't need to be answered. We have a lifespan...we are going to die.In the wake of Ridley Scott treading over old and unused imagery and ideas (along with Hampton Fancher's cantankerous insistence of story before David Peoples bend it to Scott's will) this is the shadow of the original punk neon-rock music video film noir. Instead, it's a tiresome Max Fischer play on what was cool about the first one.Lonely and alone, with wet smoky streets...check. The soul provided by a sad android story...GONE. I assume most critics will not truly criticize for the fact that they don't want to be on that same train that re-assessed 80's ""Blade Runner"" and had to choke on Scott's self-righteousness. The original derailed as well and was the accidental hit it is now. Fanboy cries of sequel maybe gutted what was once a masterpiece into a cash grab of epic boring pursuits. By the way, long lingering shots isn't meditative or artistic or thought-provoking, it's pretentious and dumb. Even Scott knew that from the beginning. As Denis Villanueva can do no wrong in the eyes of modern day streaming vid. Guess what? ""The Arrival"" was dull too. He's a dull movie maker. BUT...this society we've crafted today enjoys mistaking slow with drama.Here we are again, Scott revisiting his past ghosts but having some French-Canadian d-bag do his dirty work. Next up...""Thelma & Louise 2: Breaking Bad Got Nuthin' On them."" Work out your own personal issues elsewhere. Dull and uninspired.",Blade Runner 2049
192,statuskuo,Plastic Worlds,3,2 January 2019,"There's been a ton of talk why this movie was ever made. I'll focus on the real issue. Roger Deakins' poorly shot project which eventually earned him an Academy is possibly the most laughable part.
It looks a) like plastic b) too bright
In what universe does Los Angeles in 2049 look like a hermetically sealed lab? Answer, one that is attempting to get as far away from the original as possible. Though I do hold 1982 version in the same holy temple that the director Denis Villenuve supposedly does, his vision of the dystopian future is somehow...flat.
Also, I do have respect for Ryan Gosling, but somehow he is way too baby faced to be a grizzled hard boiled replicant assassin replicant. Yes, that's what he is. But he also has implanted memories that make him question if he is one. They don't leave that a mystery.
Also mis-casted...Robin Wright. Yes, I get she's suppose to be tough, but there was no reason M. Emmet Walsh could not have played this role MUCH better. Aside from the fact that no one probably remembers him. Even better. Wright plays the captain as a stiff hag who feels uncomfortable using swear words.
Yes, and Jared Leto. Ugh. Does this guy's smug face seem phony in anything he does. Hollywood still wants him to be something. He's not. Never will be. His popularity should be reserved for...uh...teeny boppers.
A total mess that even Harrison Ford nor Sean Young can save. Specifically how they dispense with the rebirth of Rachael. Rather gruesome and unnecessary. This one leaves you truly empty. A total gut punch.",Blade Runner 2049
193,rubenm,"Richer, deeper and more beautiful than the original",8,15 November 2017,"After having seen 'Blade Runner 2049', there are lots of things to debate. But the most important one is this: is this sequel better than the original, or is it the other way round? As things stand now (november 15th), the IMDb community has decided in favour of Denis Villeneuve's film. It is rated 8,4 versus 8,2 for Ridley Scott's original. The sequel is number 62 in the top rated movies, the original is number 147. And, after only six weeks, the sequel has almost as many user reviews as the original has accumulated in 35 years.It's clear that the sequel is already becoming a cult classic, just as the original is. That is no small accomplishment and it is entirely deserved. In a way, this film is richer, deeper and more thought provoking than the original 'Blade Runner'. Maybe it is also more beautiful. And, at the same time it is a great homage to the original. Already in the first seconds of the film, it's clear that this is not just a sequel, but in fact a modern recreation of the 1982 film. The oil refineries from the original are now huge solar installations, to mention just one updated detail.But there are also differences. Villeneuve has a lot to say about modern society. The 2022 blackout is a reference to the way we tend to organize our entire lives online or in the cloud, without realizing the possible risks. The children in the orphanage are not much different to what must be happening in modern day sweatshops in countries like Bangladesh. And the derogatory remarks the lead character has to cope with, reminded me of the racial inequality in the US.As I said: there are lots of things to debate after leaving the cinema. But above all, 'Blade Runner 2049' is a superb film from a cinematographic point of view. The world in 2049 looks frightening, but also beautiful, and never artificial. The integration of special effects and on set acting is seamless. Even if you don't care about the story, which at times takes some complicated turns, just watching what happens on screen is already a great experience.",Blade Runner 2049
194,bheadher,"OMG, this should not have been filmed...",3,28 January 2018,"How can anyone rate a movie that is so slow, drab and gloomy...even when the director turned on some lights, Bladerunner 2049 still was moving so slow that I simply could not get interested...What we are presented, is a bare echo of the Bladerunner we new and loved. The original was filmed as a drab and dreary world, but this one IS drab and dreary, with nothing at all to grab your attention...to me, it was the same as reading a scifi book that isn't very well written, and spending most of the time skipping ten pages at a time, to see if you can find something good in there...this one had exactly the same feel...The ambiance was literally atrocious, and the little things that make a movie good were missing. They even forgot that when someone is in fridgid cold, and it's snowing, you can see your breath, heh heh...that is how bad it really was...",Blade Runner 2049
195,davidgee,Did I lose the plot?,3,11 October 2017,"I'm not often lost for words, but I really don't know what to say about this belated sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 BLADE RUNNER. The original was visually stunning and densely plotted. This new version is even more dazzling to look at, but if there's a plot to be found, I'm afraid I lost it. Ryan Gosling plays 'K', a new generation hunter of rogue androids for the LAPD. In other words he's the new Deckard (Harrison Ford) who was hunting rogue androids in 2019 Los Angeles (the 1982 movie was set in 2019). But he ends up tracking Deckard who has himself (I think) gone rogue. There are humans who may be androids and androids who may be humans, but this confusion was a major element in the first movie and there's a lot more of it now.At two and three-quarter hours the film is way too long. There's a protracted sequence towards the end in (I think) Las Vegas, in an arena peopled by flickering holograms of bygone stars (Sinatra, Monroe, Elvis, Liberace), which for me encapsulated the whole movie: a feast for the eyes but overkill for the brain. High concept - low impact. Don Siegel's 1955 INVASION OF THE BODY-SNATCHERS is still my favourite sci-fi.Doubtless the fault is with me but I came away, as I did from INCEPTION and SHUTTER ISLAND, with the feeling that I'd been looking at the Emperor's New Clothes. I wouldn't say Don't go to see this picture, but be prepared to be very (very) bewildered.",Blade Runner 2049
196,sbweightman,"Spectacular, but feels as though it's lacking something.",8,12 October 2018,"A spectacular sci-fi tale with a strong atmosphere and commitment to its impressive artistic style and futuristic setting. The acting and story is good and will keep your interest, but the meandering pace and focus on style left it cold in parts. 
Some bits of the plot don't quite add up and it feels as though it's lacking something, as is the (almost) requirement to have pre-knowledge of the first film. I did like the characters and the topics the plot covers.",Blade Runner 2049
197,bgar-80932,"Pretty good, not quite great",7,19 June 2018,"I was about to rate this a 7 until something came up that I didn't realize. Regardless it's a good movie. It has excellent visuals that I don't know if they're beat anywhere. The story is good for sci-fi these days. Most of the stuff I've watched lately is more looks that having an actual good story a la mute and altered carbon. This is better than those but it still has flaws. Let's face is Ryan Goslin is shit. If he was better this movie had potential to be a masterpiece. Once Harrison Ford came around the movie became so much better. That said this is probably one of Ryan Goslin's best roles ever, he's a robot in real life so this was him. Drive sucked is what I'm saying. Good movie though and a satisfying conclusion, could have been amazing though.",Blade Runner 2049
198,judywalker2,"Pretentious, slow and boring",1,7 October 2017,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I didn't expect awful. I'm old enough to remember the original movie which was innovative and interesting. Most of the acting in the original was stellar and it wasn't gimmicky. I can't say the same for this sequel (which might just be a set up for a third unfortunately). Ryan Goslings character was interesting, most of the other replicants were not. Jared Leto's character was just annoying. Robin Wright's small but interesting part was maybe the highlight of the whole film. You notice I haven't said much about Harrison Ford who is Indiana Jones old man mode.The most annoying part of the was the visuals and the music (at least I this that's what they're calling it). I though of 2001 Space Odessy but that music was actually good. It was suppose to post-war California but the sets were so dark you couldn't see the characters. In one scene I kept thinking of Mad Max and not Blade Runner. Totally a missed opportunity to make an interesting sequel.",Blade Runner 2049
199,latinfineart,"A pale shadow of the original. Slow, brooding, and not a filling meal.",4,25 July 2018,"This film is slow as dripping molasses. Very little suspense. Most of the film is spent developing the Gosling character. He is great as usual. The problem is he just did not have that much to work with. Most of the stunning visuals from the first one, are missing. Even Altered Carbon is more fun to look at. It just looks like a very heavily polluted version of Beijing, with a bit of LA thrown in. It appears that little money was spent on the sets, costumes, or decor. When you consider how dazzling the original was, one has to wonder why so little effort to replicate at least some of that magic?K's in love with Joi (Ana de Armas), an adoring hologram who places a simulation of a steak on top of K's real dinner-a plate of drab microwave noodles-while Frank Sinatra croons on the speakers in the background. It's painfully clear that K wants to be an American man, though this cozy image of tranquility is as illusory for him as it is for the people who feel the American dream has left them behind. K isn't human (or is he?), isn't living with someone, and his anonymous apartment is locked off from a neighborhood engulfed in poverty. Everything in this world is impersonal and corporately manufactured. Where Deckard used to buy noodles from a vendor, K gets meals on the run from a vending machine. Human jobs are rendered obsolete whenever possible, further detaching us from a centralized society and ironically sending us scurrying to our phones and computers for refuge.The premise of this film is not enough. And Harrison Ford is absolutely wasted in this film. Not even sure why he was included, nor what the scenes with him were meant to represent. He is inept, incapable, old, tired, and just not up to the task at hand, which is hugely disappointing. And the ending. What a terrible ending. For a director as talented as Villaneuve, this is a surprising result. I watched this film again last night, as I was very unimpressed the first time around. Figured I might pick up on some subtext, some subtle hints, some secondary plots. Nothing there. This film is as empty as the Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia. Not much there. I say this as a major sci-fi buff. Not much there.",Blade Runner 2049

201,harryplinkett14,"Boring, pointless drivel",1,19 October 2017,"I don't even know how I endured this pointless torture until the end. First of all, while the original Bladerunner was stylistically a masterpiece, I couldn't care less about a B-movie star chasing his creator so he can get unlimited life. There is nothing genuinely engaging about a robot's quest for immortality. In my view, Bladerunner should have been a film noir revolving around a love story, not an action film with philosophical crap about what it's like to be a robot. I am not a robot, and I don't care how a robot might feel.This is why I see no point in making a sequel, which gives us all the boring stuff from the original film, with none of the genuine thrills of the original. Stylistically, the new film is inferior. It is also inferior in terms of screen writing and acting. The roles are given to actors that shouldn't be in these roles. They really did everything wrong.Finally, was this a film that needed to be made? The original Bladerunner was a product of the 80s. Times have changed since then. Sensibilities have changed, the needs of the audience have changed. We no longer have the ability to sit back and enjoy an image of a dystopian future, because we actually live in one. The 80s are over, and everything they stood for is over, too. You can't repackage it for 2017.I hate this film. Zero stars. Oh, ONE plus: it's not PC!",Blade Runner 2049
202,JoelChamp85,Great Sequel,10,23 July 2021,A superbly incredible film and a worthy sequel to Blade Runner. Every frame is a painting with the meticulous attention to the noir style lighting and Mise-en-scène. Villeneuve was the perfect choice for directing and the casting was great. I can't really fault the film in any area. The set designs blew me away with the epic scope and attention to detail. The power and beauty of the Replicants is impressive. Well done.,Blade Runner 2049
203,PyroSikTh,Somehow Manages to Surpass the Original,9,10 October 2017,"So where could they possibly take the Blade Runner franchise after the one-and- done original? Even as 2049 began, I had no idea, but somehow it manages not only to build on the original, develop the story naturally, and evolve it's themes, but sometimes even surpasses them. Replicants have had a rocky history in the last thirty years, being prohibited and brought back gradually after a series of violent outbursts. The Tyrell corp was bought out, there was a blackout that wiped out electronic records across the globe, and even a famine.Sapper Morton benefited from the famine with his protein farm, living a secluded life away from the dystopian hustle-and-bustle of LA. Until the day K arrives to bring him in, unraveling a miracle impossible to believe that could shake the very foundations of human society if the truth ever got out. The single biggest theme of both the original and 2049 is what it means to be human, what it means to be alive, how to measure consciousness and sentience, and whether that offers certain rights or not. 2049 builds on that, introducing new concepts with the express purpose of exploring and extrapolating this theme further. K is stated outright from the very beginning that he is a replicant. It's important information as he plays into how he's treated, and how he thinks of himself. While he thinks for himself, he is programmed to obey, and yet that doesn't make him come across as any less human. He's still treated as a lesser-class citizen because of it though, the same way white supremacists treat black people, or Myanmar Buddhists treat the Rohingya. One party sees themselves as more important, as more real, and spit on those who they see as beneath them. K is at the bottom of the heap...to a point.Roger Deakins is Hollywood's biggest awards underdog. His work is simply astounding time and time again, and 2049 is no exception. Every frame is a canvas to him, as he paints glorious strokes of colour and composition. Every scene outside is grey and miserable, with snow falling peacefully around, and the streets covered in sludge. Everywhere looks like a miserable place to be, whether it's LA's slums, or the rubbish tip that is San Diego, or Morton's maggot farm that resembles a moonbase. The opening shots of the film show fields that stretch as far as the eye can see, bringing them into focus as warehouses, hangars, and industrial greenhouses. Wallace's headquarters tower above the iconic Tyrell pyramid, made of the wealthiest commodity; wood, while Deckard hides out in the irradiated wasteland of Las Vegas, bathed in red and orange hues.The acting is also top-notch as well, of course. Ryan Gosling has become famous for his unblinking stares, some of which speak volumes with little surface emotion, while some falls flat and just looks lazy. Having watched the movie, his lack of facial emoting makes sense. He's a replicant after all. Strictly speaking he doesn't, or at least shouldn't, have emotional responses. He's a blank slate stuck into the world to do one job and one job only. Thankfully the enthralling character arc allows Gosling some room to work, and the emotions he does realise are fully formed and fully empathising.A big mention goes to Harrison Ford as well, who's turned himself into a bit of a meme in his old age, reviving old franchises and lazing through every scene as if he doesn't really want to be there. 2049 is an exception to the rule. He doesn't go into this for the paycheck, he has a genuine interest in the film, it's source material, and the script that was written for it. He offers his best performance in years, without a doubt, and creates all the impact of the final scene all by himself. Ana de Armas is also really, really good as Joi, giving her a sense of humanity and sentience that quite literally brings her to life. The chemistry she and Gosling share is palpable and goes a long way to developing her role as a non-sexual companion. Sylvia Hoeks is menacing as Luv, Wallace's right-hand assistant. While she doesn't get quite as much meat to play around with, she does have her interesting moments tapping into what it means to be an artificial sentience. The way she treats Joi is heartbreaking, and her snarky posture makes her just as human as her protagonistic opposites.Jared Leto, Robin Wright, Edward James Olmos, Dave Bautista, Mackenzie Davis, Lennie James, Barkhad Abdi, and even a brief appearance from Sean Young all share varying levels of supporting roles, and all enhance the movie in their own little way. Whether it's Wright's subtle advances on K, Bautista's marvel at the miracle he witnessed decades ago, James' quick change of character when he realises K is a cop, or Leto's menacing philosophical musings, each of them make their mark on the movie in such a way that they'd be missed if they weren't there, whether they have two minutes of screen time or fifteen.Blade Runner 2049 has a hell of a lot going for it, from the way it balances nostalgia and self-referentialism to enhancing the story and themes of the original without retreading old ground is probably the best thing about it. But the story it tells and how it wants to tell it is executed to perfection. I have no doubt that in future, if I fancy watching Blade Runner, I'll choose 2049 over the original. Despite being slow and really quite long, it uses every moment to it's favour, building character and atmosphere perfectly. I give 2049 a 9/10, without hesitation. I already want to go to the cinema and watch it again.",Blade Runner 2049
204,CinematicInceptions,An unfathomable work of art.,7,26 February 2018,"I'm actually not sure if I should be reviewing this, because I don't think I fully appreciate this movie enough to write about it in a meaningful way. I can see how people love the original Blade Runner and this one as well, because it seems like a really immersive sci-fi world that delves into some deep themes of what it means to be human. However, it all goes a little over my head. I like the way that Westworld and Ex Machina both go into similar themes of the line between machines and sentient beings, and I love the immersive sci-fi world of Inception. So in some ways, it seems like the Blade Runner movies would be something I could get really into. But the story and the world of the Blade Runner movies seem to be very involved with its symbolism and making the replicants representative of immigrants and things like that. I've had a couple of people explain it to me, but I still can't seem to grasp what Ridley Scott and Denis Villenueve are getting at with these two movies. I can tell something is there, but I just can't tell what. Still, I can't tell how any given scene ties into the overall plot and theme, nor do I understand what the significance of the ending of either movie is. Maybe that's my fault, but in either case, I think it's safe to say that this is not a movie that everyone will enjoy or be satisfied by.In terms of how this reboot will fare at the Oscars, I think it deserves all of the nominations that it received. I'm not sure that it will win in any of these, given the competition, but any win that it gets will be deserved. If you're considering watching this, you kind of have to see the original first. There is basically no explanation given for what replicants are, and the expositionary text on the screen is way to small to read. Even if you have seen the original, it's probably a good idea to watch it again before you see this one. Even though I'm not huge on either movie, I think that there should be more original and artistic movies like this. Overall Rating 7/10.",Blade Runner 2049

Or a homage to tedium. With several failed attempts to last through to the ending, I had recourse to Wikipedia, and discovered what was supposed to be its plot. It was still incomprehensible. It will be some time, if ever, before I watch this film right through. Faint echoes of Ridley's earlier masterpiece. Since it was photographed by Roger Deakins, the photography had to be skilled. It was just that the scenery and sets were 90% dismal: a kind of grey rust colour, inside and out. The acting was nothing to celebrate. I can't imagine anything less demanding. It was far, far too long, for no reward. I couldn't tell who was real and who was a replicant. Quite a lot of pointless violence, semi-nudity and termination. Was that the message ? How do replicants age ? How do they replicate ? Were they all replicants ? Why did they apparently replicate like humans ? What exactly was this terminally dreary story about ?

208,Offworld_Colony,If Blade Runner was a beautifully polished turd. Then 2049 is a rough dirty diamond.,10,14 February 2020,"Tonally very different to Blade Runner but spiritually very similar. It's a magnetic film, a brisk film despite its running time, it deepens and widens the world and does the impossible; tells an interesting and different follow up, intrinsically linked to the first film but yet it's own yarn. It takes a thread about memory and it makes it it's focus. A worthy and artistic sequel and maybe the most beautiful and visually accomplished film since the first one. Consistently high quality, and a few blips aside, it's a pretty excellent film by all accounts.Very delicately it examines memory, artifices of love and devotion, expectation and duty, cause and belief. It deftly dresses a twist in a twist and plays with many of the themes inside the film and out. Long, messy, obfuscating with glaring holes in it, but also painterly to look at, trippy, hallucinatory, tender. It rises above its flaws and produces not just a perfect sequel but a tremendous, thoughtful, elegant science fiction masterpiece.If you like Blade Runner a lot, you'll like this a lot. I happen to, so I was won over by its complex mood. Blade Runner 2049 Succeeds spectacularly as a sequel to Blade Runner with the right balance of New and old.

Now it's Born and yes it's about time someone did a sequel of Blade Runner Denis Villeneuve I am fan of Sicario. Ridely Scott should been doing sequel Since years ago then we could have still have a lot Blade Runner Movies He could have any chance to make sequel rather doing Prometheus. But anyway Sometimes it takes years and years for sequel to be made if someone rushed It then it won't be good sometimes it will flop bad but I hope their Always be a Third Sequel but please not in next 20 years later or more Years later just to make 3rd or 5th film of Blade Runner. Cast Thank God they got a really good lead actor Ryan Gosling I Always love Ryan Gosling is Blade Runner I thought Role Suited for him To be in franchise I hope he gets in big franchise not someone else Replace him I wanted to see Ryan Gosling in all movie franchise with Harrison Ford good well cast in film Jared Leto thought noting special He hasn't done much in movie I am not a Jared Leto fan at all I thought He did OK not best or great actor of all time. I thought the colors of Movie looked well like a Neo-Noir like Only God Forgives and Atomic Blonde interesting looks of movie me I Really Wish they gave Dave Bautista more to do or given his character a lot More I thought they Gave Dave Bautista lead villain role I won't mind That if that happens like Rutger Hauer role that's what I thought or Maybe rather than having Jared Leto. Dave has more of looks of being Villain has more of look of evil looking person more then Jared Leto, for this movie I would Love to see that but it's Shame. It Continues from sequel from (1982) Blade Runner it actually does it's Amazing how they bought back staff from first movie there is a lot of Things they explained about First Movie you have 5 minute scene of (Dave Bautista) Sapper Morton I Thought the scene together is really good but I wish it was better Giving Bautista something to do a lot more give him a bigger role for Villain. The city has a lot new looking big city I love the new look of Scene with hologram of Naked Girl kind of idea of Total Recall chick with 3 tits but it expect its different looking of it I thought the city And looked dam fantastic, You have other characters Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) she is boss of K giving him orders something to do found long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) that everyone knows, who's been missing for Thirty years. I am not going to spoil it but there is a lot things in This movie talks about 30 years ago showing it they is a lot of it like This movie is very connected to classic movie from (1982) Blade Runner. Now if you guys like Slow Burning film it maybe put you sleep a little Because I did its bit slow but you get the hang of it don't worry it's Not really of boring movie like Star Trek. It's really good film it's Not that really of boring movie it's not a Action SC-FI or SC-FI Horror Film. Joi (Ana de Armas) she is not really in the movie she is only in It she is Hologram when K Gets back home. Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) he is theirs not much To say it's hard to explain what character he plays as role. That Is Hard To Explain It's noting Special he does play Bad Guy in this movie villain but he is not much I Don't know why is he in movie for? my opinion just have Dave Baustia as lead Villain he looks and sounds evil. Harrison Ford Role in movie doesn't Appear until 30 or little longer minutes of movie but then he is back In all movie still but remember the role starts of Ryan Gosling K the Acting between them is really good just don't watch full trailer of it because it Spoils everything 2h 44min is running time of movie it's great to have A sequel back a lot of hard work for Denis Villeneuve and rest of Actors it's very long movie but hey it's worth it but try not full a Sleep while you're on theater watching first watch Blade Runner (1982) Classic then this it's thriller SC-FI not Action everyone like in Trailer don't watch trailers of this movie or anything that's how every Movie or sequels flop because trailers spoil everything believe me go And see movie or see little teaser that's it 10.10 great sequel have a Look please specially for Blade Runner Fans don't listen to Disappointing Debut of haters or read about website don't even read About if go and see it problem solved",Blade Runner 2049
210,blackmamba99971,"Stunning, and beautifully captivating",10,19 December 2017,"As all sequels go not every first attempt can be fulfilling. Denis Villeneuve surprised me with this new installment with Ryan Gosling as a new Blade Runner. 'K' as his name goes is a rather gentle but also vicious policeman who finds that a rogue replicant named Sapper (Dave Bautista) lives on the outskirts of L.A. in the echo farmlands of old San Diego growing protein grubs designed for off world troops. Coming across his home K learns of a so called miracle born into the tumultuous era of 2049 in the form of a newborn child directly from a replicant, which is supposedly impossible. Clues abound, which leads K on a wild goose chase to match some of his memories in accordance to his orders. Along the way he finds Dekkard (Harrison Ford.) Who at a time was also a Blade Runner who escaped L.A. with his beloved Rachel who was the mother of said child before she died from giving birth to a girl. I found this movie spellbinding not only because of the newly adapted artistry but also its grittiness within the city itself that has been drowned with millions of citizens. Since the fall of the Tyrell corporation another entity had also come into the picture by the name of Wallace industries headed by Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) who's dream is to find the child at all costs in order to extend human lives. I liked the idea having Jared play Wallace as the mind bending philosopher was a nice touch to in order to add more darkness to his character. A man with no conscience or morals for his idealistic approach to immortality. Also Edward James Olmos playing Gaff was so nostalgic it felt that a bit of the old Blade Runner was still present even after all of these years. Apart from the all star cast the effects were kept at a minimal albeit for the flying police cruisers, which to me was the icing on the cake. It would not be Blade Runner without those iconic vehicles gracing a thick brown polluted sky giving a contrast of polarized beauty amongst unhealthy cloud cover. Finally the music was top notch, which was provided by both Hans Zimmer for orchestral along with the synth appeal of Benjamin Wallfisch. Incredibly he kept the sounds, and tones relatively the same but also added new tones that helped its rich vibrant story telling right on top as each scene changed. It would have been nice to have Vangelis's help on the musical score but lately his health has been not too well I am afraid so he opted out. A sad shame really, his beautiful and graceful style of music has been hailed as the most influential among other famous composers alike.Apart from the initial description to the movie I rather liked the set scenes with Avant garde type of old world buildings with the gratuitous Elvis Presley hologram singing on a stage in front of an empty audience chamber where both K and Dekkard duke it out with fists rather than blasters. I found that kind of funny that two men punch each other out until they are black and blue but instead decide to get a drink because they could fight all day, and night if need be. Replicant are like any other machine, they're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit it's not my problem... as Dekkard once said.I think there might be a third installment. A kind where a revolution will be coming in the form of human against replicant. A fight that would be so brutal, and moralistically wrong that it would task the human condition to its limits on whether life is either bought or created. In either case Dekkard is not done yet, and possibly Joe isn't either. We didn't see him die on those steps. His wounds were not that bad in fact. Still if he did die then another will take his place to carry the torch for one of the most successful Sci-fi franchises in recent years. Highly recommended for all Sci-fi fans world wide. Not for those under sixteen.",Blade Runner 2049
211,SkullScreamerReturns,Bleak but somehow captivating dystopian vision,6,21 July 2021,"First of all, I'm one of those weirdos who don't really understand the huge praise of the original Blade Runner. It has impressive visuals but overall the movie feels to me like depression and not much else. I had heard this sequel is quite bleak so I wondered will I jump from the window after watching. But it wasn't quite as depressing as I expected.Many reviewers have said that the movie is too slow. I kind of liked the slow pace. It lured me in even if I wasn't sure first will I like it. That's always a good thing when a movie creates it's own...place where you sink in, whether it's a pleasant place or not.Maybe a bit too long movie for my taste. Yes, but it wasn't really boring either, so I think the slow pace worked.I thought the story was interesting. It moves like a detective mystery so you keep waiting for answers. Nothing too bad to say about the story itself.Dystopian sci-fi movies depress me about as much as reading the news, so it's not my favorite genre. But I don't think this was a bad movie. Quite bleak and cold world it paints, so decide yourself if you want to go there.",Blade Runner 2049
212,rdoyle29,"The best and the worst of ""Blade Runner"" intensified",7,9 October 2017,"I can't say I particularly liked the ""Blade Runner"" sequel. That seems odd to say since it's a beautiful looking film that I like many parts of, but I thought the plot was kind of terrible, especially as a sequel to the first film. It has a laser focus on the parts of the original film that really do not work, and then runs with them constructing a whole plot out of them. I can't say I cared about any minute of the actual plot. If the first film kind of works despite having a vague plot and a host of badly drawn characters, this seems to accentuate both the best and worst elements.",Blade Runner 2049
213,Cinemaniac1984,An overlong and slow paced disappointment.,5,24 November 2017,"I liked Blade Runner (both the original 1982 version and the Director's Cut). It was atmospheric, visually dazzling, and the story kept me engaged throughout. Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard was also someone that you liked and you cared about, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. It goes with out saying that Rutger Hauer's Batty was a villain that keep you intrigued and engaged throughout the entire movie. Blade Runner 2049 had some question marks over it as to whether it was going to be well worth the wait 35 years later. The early teaser trailer looked very promising with a brief throwback to the 1982 classic. Upon seeing Blade Runner 2049, I left the cinema very disappointed upon seeing the end result to a long awaited sequel to be very ordinary.Blade Runner 2049 now takes place 30 years later after the original events which centers on the new protagonist LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) who is also a blade runner tasked to hunt down and task replicants. He is drawn into an investigation following the discovery of the remains of a female replicant. K's superior Lieutant Joshi (Robin Wright) orders to have the evidence destroyed for fear of another war which could see to the end of human civilisation. K's investigation leads him to the Wallace Corporation led by CEO Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) who tasks his chief enforcer Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) to eliminate what's left of the remains as well as anyone involved in the investigation. K finds himself enlisting the help of former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who had been living in seclusion for 30 years.Ryan Gosling has always been a likable actor and I couldn't fault him as Officer K. Jared Leto looks like he is stuck on the bench as the main villain Wallace. Jared Leto looked like he had that fearful presence about him in the trailers and he could have been used A LOT more. Instead he is just reduced to rambling monologues. The rest of the supporting cast including Robin Wright, Sylvia Hoeks, Dave Battista, Mackenzie Davis, Ana de Armas, Carla Juri, and Lennie James do their best with what they have although some of the characters are nothing more than time fillers. Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard should have been left out of the movie altogether. I liked his character in the 1982 classic and he was very charismatic and heroic. Fans of Harrison Ford will agree that Rick Deckard was one of his very memorable roles throughout his career, right up there with Han Solo, Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan. Even though he is second billed and heavily promoted for the movie, he only appears in the last half hour. As he is 75, time is against him and he is not the nimble and agile star that he was in his prime. Even Clint Eastwood took several steps back and stopped all the action scenes and stuck with a lot of dramatic movies as well as sitting in the director's chair. I strongly felt that Harrison Ford is way too old to be doing action scenes that he could still be capable of doing 20 years ago. He definitely had it with Air Force One (1997) and he was pushing things with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). In Blade Runner 2049, he looked tired, weary and past his prime. I didn't need any more convincing that he was capable of kicking any butt and he looked as if he was ready to call it a day.Director Denis Villeneuve takes the director's chair from original director Ridley Scott. He might be a quality director given his critically acclaimed Sicario (2015) but his vision of Blade Runner 2049 is nothing like the 1982 classic, resulting in a slowly paced and dull science fiction movie. Dennis Villeneuve should have had his editor trim down 30 minutes of unnecessary details and time fillers which has contributed to the slow pacing of this overlong movie and have the story tightened up a lot more. He should have beefed up the story and the dialogue a lot more. The original's action scenes were more thrilling, but here they are as effective as a blunt knife failing to cut through a bread roll.Writers Hampton Fancher (who was one of the writers of the original) and Michael Green have let the best of a good opportunity slip right through their fingers. Their end result could have looked a lot better on paper but they are half the reason why this movie did not work.Blade Runner 2049 was always going to be a hard act to follow from the 1982 classic, but I was very disappointed how it turned out to be overlong and very slow paced. It should have been wound a lot tighter, and the story should have been a lot more engaging. The action should have kept me at the edge of the seat, but it was anything but that. In fact, I felt indifferent and that the Blade Runner universe should have been left alone. At one stage, I dozed off somewhere in the middle of the movie. The only reason I stuck at it was to see how it turned out. If I viewed this at home, I would have fast forwarded through the slow parts. Even the Blade Runner game which was released on PC in 1997 was a million miles better. It stuck with the Los Angeles 2019 setting and despite its non-linear plot, I loved the game and I was amazed that the makers of the game did an excellent job recreating the universe of the 1982 classic.Blade Runner 2049 was one of the most disappointing movies of 2017. It should have been a lot better.5/10.",Blade Runner 2049
214,cseabhi,Wanted to love this movie so bad. But it was slow.,5,11 May 2020,"There is nothing wrong with the story but I found the movie to be too slow. Altough the concept, story and some of the dialogues were really good but the pace of the story was the problem for me.",Blade Runner 2049
215,pfgpowell-1,Perhaps a tad baffling to be really great,6,21 June 2018,"Several claims have been made about Blade Runner 2049, including one in review that appeared in the UK's Guardian, that it is destined to become a future 'sci-fi classic'.Other reviewers suggest that in some kind of profound way the film examines what it is to be human (or something). Both claims might well be true: but either way, the film does go on for quite some time and almost - almost - overstays its welcome. As for 'being profound', well, if that's another way of saying the film occasionally gets close to being a little baffling, so be it.Oddly, I never saw the first Blade Runner all the way through - I always grew a little bored and doing something else seemed a little more attractive, but I understand that first film is now a 'sci-fi classic'. Perhaps, but by my own admission, I'm in no position to say yay or nay.As for Blade Runner 2049, I can see how some might like to make the claim, but as for being profound and some kind of ontological examination of both humanity and whatever '-ity' droids will claim for themselves, the jury is still out and won't be back for a while.Even if the production company's publicity department had thought of describing the film as such, it will surely soon have been obvious to them that they would run the risk of alienating all those fans who like their words to have no more than two syllables.
 Visually, Blade Runner 2049 is magnificent, so it is a shame that the storyline - 'plot' is a little too mundane for a 'sci-fi classic' - meanders rather more than a tale told by the local bar bore.It hooks into the first Blade Runner outing and in a somewhat convoluted way - I've already used the word 'baffling' so I'm attempting what is often called 'elegant variation' - doing so make sense. It's just that the sum of the parts doesn't quite add up to a satisfyingly coherent whole. You can admire each part, but drumming up total admiration for the whole is rather a challenge.I feel rather guilty being so apparently mean-spirited, but I have no choice. Blade Runner 2049 is a well-made, well-acted, well-directed and well-produced film, but doesn't quite pay the full shilling. Go for it and make your own mind up. Who knows, you might even decide that I'm talking cobblers. Or perhaps not.",Blade Runner 2049
216,stevenrotherforth,I get the feeling every time I watch this masterpiece I'll discover something new,10,14 February 2018,"Blade Runner 2049I can say with joy and relief that Blade Runner 2049 is an absolute triumph.
There's good reason why a sequel to the original has taken so long to come to fruition.
The possibility of getting it wrong and tarnishing the world Ridley Scott created would have been too much to bare.
There are questions we simply don't want answering. There are paths that we just don't want to go down. Some things are better left undiscovered.
Thankfully we have been blessed with a fantastic movie that grabs the audiences attention from the very first frame and transports us to a visually stunning futuristic world.
It's a world that looks like a natural progression of the world created in the first film.
Technology, architecture and environments look like they have evolved from those featured in the 1982 original. 
Here in Blade Runner 2049 every scene oozes with authenticity and realism.
There's a realistic and gritty texture that remains faithful.
This is a real credit to all those responsible for the production of this superb science fiction movie.Director Denis Villeneuve has kept things respectful and true.
He hasn't so much as answered questions that we didn't want answering. He instead has given us more questions to expand on a already intriguing universe.Set some thirty years on Ryan Gosling plays K, a Blade Runner who whilst investigating a case begins to tug on a thread which leads him to Harrison Ford who reprises his role as Deckard.
I'll say no more of the storyline and plot. The journey of discovery is one best left for you to uncover for yourselves.
All I will say is that Hampton Fancher and Michael Greens Screenplay is captivating.
Dialogue is superbly crafted, every scene is a deep and immersive experience that is wonderfully performed by all of the cast.
Gosling is a talent to behold but there are no weak links in this modern day masterpiece.
I really do believe that this sequel is every bit as good as the original Blade Runner.
Possibly even better!
Ford doesn't have as much screen time as I would have hoped but he is the best he's been for years.
I get the feeling that he was much more enthusiastic about reprising this role rather than the other iconic hero he recently resurrected.
Jared Leto does the creepy weird guy thing to Oscar winning worthiness and Sylvia Hoeks is a superb if surprising villainess.It's easy to get carried away by the visuals and excellent sound design in this movie.
They are absolutely stunning.
We've had a recent crop of Sci-Fi extravaganzas lately that have tried to mimic Blade Runner.
Ghost in The Shell (2017) failed to do its own source material justice whilst Netflix's Altered Carbon is visually very good but pails in comparison to this movie.At 2hrs 44mins Blade Runner 2049 is a lengthy feature but it is so well done the minutes roll by without notice.

218,sunznc,Much more enjoyable on second viewing.,6,25 June 2018,"When I first saw Blade Runner in the theaters it was not my favorite film. It seemed obscure, hard to relate to, I couldn't get into it. Maybe being young I was wanting something more friendly, more lightweight. I knew it was something special but I couldn't relate to it.
Decades later I saw Blade Runner on DVD and I fell in love with it. It just seemed so timely. When I first saw Blade Runner 2049 I thought it was a mess and I couldn't relate to it. I thought they blew it. But.....months later I've re-watched it and.......I like it! It isn't perfect, I'm not quite sure of the beginning, seems a little grim but I do like it.It would be nice if the hologram partners could have been male. Why does a helpful, loving hologram ALWAYS have to be some sweet, slightly vulnerable female? Starting to become predictable and tired.May have to see this twice to really get it.

219,p-jonsson,Way to dark and depressing for my taste.,6,21 February 2018,"As a movie this is a very good movie. The scenery, the acting, the colors etc. are of a very high technical standard. To me personally however, this movie is much too dark and depressing for my taste.I cannot say that I am surprised that the movie is dark. The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.As I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.The acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.Unfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.

221,EthanBJones_03,Highly Recommended,10,28 October 2017,"'BLADE RUNNER 2049' - 2017Directed by Dennis Villeneuve{Arrival}Starring Ryan Gosling{La La Land}, Harrison Ford{Star Wars} and Ana De Armas{War Dogs}Plot Overview: Out of respect for how fantastic this movie is, I will not divulge ANY plot details. If you want to get a rough grasp of the film, please watch a trailer, then see the film because it is amazing.I think the best way to start would be to voice my opinion on Ridley Scott's 1982 'masterpiece', the original Blade Runner. Keep in mind that I've not seen the Final Cut so that may factor into it, but as a whole I wasn't too impressed with Blade Runner. I don't think it was a bad film but it certainly didn't live up to my expectations. 2049 is completely the opposite. I had very high expectations from the praise this film was receiving and even THEN, it exceeded my expectations. 2049 is a movie that I predict winning some academy awards, and maybe even Best Picture. It's not often that a sequel is superior to its predecessor, but I think this may be one of those times!So what is good about this film? Well, where do I even begin! I think that Ryan Gosling is a good place to start. Many people thought that Gosling would be awarded the Oscar for La La Land. He did not win however. But I think this year may be his year. Gosling was FANTASTIC in this film at delivering his masterful performance as Officer K. Not once was I in disbelief about his character. Not once did I not buy a single line of dialogue. He was exceptional in this film.Accompanying Gosling is the star of Scott's film, Harrison Ford. The man; the myth; the legend. Ford gives, pretty much as usual, an excellent performance as Deckard, and is responsible for some truly gut wrenching and harrowing scenes. I love this little comeback tour Ford is going on, revisiting his classic films. And if he's as good as this in 'Air Force Two' or 'What Lies Even Further Beneath', then I think I'm gonna like this tour very much.Ana De Armas was great as Gosling's companion, Joi. She genuinely moved me in her performance and made me care about the relationship between a man and a hologram. Armas was excellent in this film and deserves a lot more praise than she has been getting.Sylvia Hoeks was also excellent as the rather ironically named, Luv. Hoeks gave a sinister and at point down right evil performance. I thought she was great in this movie, and played the antagonist perfectly. Speaking of which, the antagonist for 2049, which by no means erases the GREATNESS of Rutger Haur, was a fairly interesting and conniving villain. In a weird way, she is justified, and I like that freedom to interpretation that Villeneuve provides.Now for something that, if I had the film in front of me, could be analysed and analysed for days at a time: the technical side of this movie. Blade Runner 2049 is, without a doubt, one of the best looking movies of the 21st century, maybe even one of the best of the past 30 years. Villeneuve's direction is absolutely flawless. The jaw dropping visuals are absolute delights to behold. The camera work and framing is out of this world. The editing is perfectly concise. Even the visual effects look sensational. I swear to God, if Roger Deakins does not FINALLY win an Oscar for this movie, then there is NO justice in this sorry excuse for a world. The academy has been ducking Deakins for FAR TOO long and that needs to change. Please Academy, give the man what he deserves!!!!Another thing I absolutely loved in this film was the absolutely riveting and intense story. I'm going to restrain myself from divulging any plot details because you really need to experience this film blind to the plot. But let me tell you, the plot is absolutely sensational in every sense of the word. I loved every single line of dialogue uttered, and I honestly think this film could win best original screenplay, or at least get nominated. The themes that are present are on par with the amazing themes present in Ridley Scott's movie. It is just, simply put, a fantastic movie.If you can't tell, I absolutely loved Blade Runner 2049. It's got my vote for Best Picture and, while it just quite get to be my favourite film of the year, it certainly gets my vote for the best. I HIGHLY recommend that you see Blade Runner 2049. I'll rate it 10 'Wooden Horses' out of 10!",Blade Runner 2049

224,room102,Disappointing. For fans of director Denis Villeneuve,4,5 October 2017,"Like director Denis Villeneuve's other recent films, this is a simple and empty movie. It's pretentious and disguised as something clever and artistic. It's extremely slow and although I went to see it in the earliest show (in the morning) on the premiere day, I still had to keep myself from falling asleep. The audience was silent but when the end credits rolled I could hear the disappointment of others too.It's extremely long (163 min) and painfully slow and nothing much happens in it. Every scene and every shot is stretched endlessly, like watching an entire movie in slow motion. Ryan Gosling, a very talented actor, unfortunately once again plays the same character which seems to have sticked to him since DRIVER - extremely slow moving, minimum dialog, lots of staring (yeah, Red Letter Media were right in their satire of the trailer). There are bits of interesting scenes sprinkled throughout the movie but they just seem random and don't create any coherent story. It's like scenes and shots made to be put in a trailer.On the good side, there is a good production, good sets, impressive cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins, and they really tried to replicate (no pun intended) the world create in the original movie. If you watch closely, you'll even notice an ad for Pan Am, just like in the original movie. The music is also similar to Vangelis' style at times (including ""Tears in Rain"" at the end). I should mention that this is the second time this year that Hans Zimmer uses the Shepard tone and as much as I like Zimmer, the use of the Shepard tone here was too obvious.I was also very impressed by Carla Juri's scene as Dr. Ana Stelline and I liked the Joi/Mariette scene.All in all, this is a very disappointing movie with some good visuals.

225,ericrnolan,"A review of ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017)",9,8 April 2018,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017) is indeed a worthy sequel, even if it cannot equal Ridley Scott's seminal 1982 original film. (And this is absolutely understandable -- I opine that Scott's dour, challenging ""Blade Runner"" is arguably the greatest movie of all time.) Some of it worked, and some of it didn't -- but I sufficiently enjoyed this movie to rate it a 9 out of 10.There is a lot going on here in terms of plot. I won't be specific about what I liked and what I didn't like, because I want to avoid spoilers. (There are definitely some surprise plot developments, and this is a relatively recent film that fans have waited no fewer than 35 years to see.) But I'm happy to report that ""Blade Runner 2049"" satisfies by being a direct and logical follow-up in terms of character, plot and setting.I do think that this would be a stronger standalone story if it had included the material that was relegated to the online short films that serve as its companions. (You can find all three of them at Open Culture right here.) The first one, ""Black Out 2022,"" is probably necessary to understanding the feature film's story and ought to be required viewing.The visuals were vivid and arresting, the action sequences were generally satisfying, and the acting across the board was quite good. Harrison Ford was predictably perfect. Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks are suitably intense and make terrific bad guys. (I've always loved Leto's work -- even his criminally underappreciated, spot-on interpretation of DC Comics' ""The Joker."") And Carla Juri nearly steals the entire movie with her mesmerizing performance in a supporting role.What I liked best about ""Blade Runner 2049"" was how surprisingly well it captured the ... vibe, I guess, of the first film -- its existential angst and the surprising tragic nobility of its characters. Simply put, this film got the feeling right. For me, this was best evidenced by a poetic subplot between the characters played by Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas. It's great dystopian science fiction -- a fusion of troubling futurism and genuine human emotion. And the mood was greatly enhanced by an evocative score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch.There are were a couple of things that I didn't like -- they were plot points that I won't detail here. The pacing also felt too slow, at times. (This is a long movie, at two hours and 44 minutes.) And the the climactic fight scene felt just a bit claustrophobic and awkwardly executed. (It's a far cry from the epic feel of the original's rainswept rooftop confrontation.)I'd still cheerfully recommend ""Blade Runner 2049"" to fans of Scott's film. I'd caution them to sit down with it with as few expectations as possible, though, and to just enjoy this second chapter on its own merits. It's mostly great stuff.",Blade Runner 2049
226,Mike_Devine,Who knew a bleak future could seem so entertaining,7,10 June 2018,"Coming 35 years after the events of its predecessor, Denis Villeneuve's futuristic law enforcement thriller 'Blade Runner 2049' picks up further down the road when the world of replicants has evolved for better or worse.Instead of centering around the POV of Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard, we follow Ryan Gosling as he navigates the pitfalls and threats of greater Los Angeles to get to the bottom of a mysterious discovery that could jeopardize society's otherwise oblivious view of the human-like replicants' roles in their lives. This sets us up for an interesting ride full of mystery, confusion and winding roads. Gosling is well cast in this role, as his trademark poker face comes in handy given the serious nature of his character K's job as a blade runner. We also get to see Robin Wright give the kind of performance she's really been able to own of late, as the no-nonsense, deceptive Lieutenant Joshi.Otherwise, the casting is more or less ""meh,"" aside from Ford's (all too short) screen time. Jared Leto barely has a chance to make an impact as the psycho genius Niander Wallace, and the two female leads are a holographic assistant, Joi (Ana de Armas) and a ruthless Wallace confidant, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). Neither have anything special to offer here, mostly due to poor character writing. But it's not the acting that makes '2049' what it is. Villeneuve is on a sci-fi hot streak, coming off the heels of 'Arrival,' and is developing a specific filming style that will likely become associated with the director in the coming years. '2049' is filmed beautiful, with haunting cinematography and a soundtrack (and in some cases, lack thereof) that translates to sensual overload in many scenes.There's a healthy balance of typical ""bad guy beat-up"" action scenes and low-key dialogue-heavy ones that help '2049' drift into ""boring"" or ""over the top"" territory, and despite the fact that the plot seems to reveal itself in a formulaic way, there are a few twists in the film's third act that keep audiences from feeling like they've seen this all before.'Blade Runner 2049' was not considered to be a monster hit with general moviegoing audiences, but it's clear the effort and investment that went into creating the movie has resulted in a quality final product.",Blade Runner 2049
227,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Poetry In Perfect Motion,10,7 February 2021,"All these scolding reviews really shows what wrong with the world today and the future of movies. GenX millennium moviegoers that only wants cgi filled trash without any depht, atmosphere or scenes that linger. A fake spectacle like Marvel that lacks everything and begs for nothing. Thanks to all you kids streaming and Cgi has nearly ruined all hope of ever watching a really great movie with great production values again. Bladerunner 2049 Is such a movie that only gets made in a lifetime. Thanks to the director who somehow manage to keep the world Intact. Not straying to much from the original style and pacing. In a showbiz thats so reliant to spit out cgi crap at Daily basis.. destroying every franchise ever. Still Denis manages to make a real movie (I'm sure It was no easy feat.) Still keeping true to the original and showing us something new.Do NOT listen to any of the negative reviews saying it's a sleeper and It's boring haha!
My god..They have clearly not seen the original movie. The original was also an dystopian lullaby. I loved falling asleep to that movie! It had cinemas most amazing score. It was poetry even if the eyes where closed. Bladerunner was a tear inducing, rainy saturday night movie for artists and deep thinkers all over the world. It just had that mezmerising gloomy neon effect on us. And this new movie Is exactly the same. It starts with melancholy and ends with melancholy! It's a modern masterpiece from the viewpoint of us that stops and take a picture of a tree. Or enjoying our booze alone. The Soundtrack Is an absolute stunner of droning deep house and liquid techno. Its insane how Good It Is.
Ofcourse It's not nearly as good as the original but remember.. when was the last time you saw something this great? Its gone many years since this was released and all we see is cgi junk. Every movie sucks today. In that wider knowledge this movie sure Is as good as they come.",Blade Runner 2049

230,markgorman,It's good but it's a bit indulgent.,7,20 October 2017,"Someone needs to get Ridley Scott in check.  His recent Alien movie was awful and overindulgent.  This is far from awful but it has his stamp all over it and at two and a half hours long is really quite indulgent.Ryan Gosling may also need to go to some acting classes because his one trick pony is wearing rather thin now.Having said that, the bad stuff, there's a lot to like about this movie.Roger Deakins is in fine form with a simply gorgeous cinematographic experience.  The yellow city and the green biodome actually take your breath away.The CGI is universally excellent.  The opening aerial sequence draws your breath and there's a love scene in which a hologram juxtaposes the body of a replicant hooker that is one of the most imaginative things I've ever seen in the cinema.Indeed this movie is RAMMED with great creative ideas.I mostly didn't mind how slow it is until perhaps the third act when, even with the excellent introduction of Harrison Ford, it began to outstay its welcome.Clearly it's a little Marmite as I've rarely seen so many of an audience leave, and its length certainly tested many a bladder.  Not mine thankfully.The plot has its challenges and I'm not going to go there as it would be too easy to spoil for you, but it's interesting and quite clever.The score by Hans Zimmer is simply brilliant.  All booming, crashing percussive synth punctuated by little moments of Vangelis (echoing the original).  He's on fire just now, what with Dunkirk under his belt.  He'll have more than one soundtrack Oscar nomination come February.I liked the way director Denis Villeneuve dwells on scenes, allowing you take in the mastery of Deakins' and the technical team's work but when he dwells lingeringly on Gosling again and again and again you do wish it would push on a bit.So, overall, a good, but not great, movie.  I wouldn't want to see it again actually given its drawn out editing.  But I liked it much more than I didn't.",Blade Runner 2049
231,colewaters,Fantastic movie,10,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is one fantastic movie that just needs to be seen. Harrison Ford, Ryan Gosling, and Jared Leto what a cast those three powerhouse actors together equals Oscar nominations. This film from start to finish is a thrill ride. This movie was way more entertaining then the original and better film then the original. The 3D in this movie is like no other it is mind blowing. Parents this movie is rated R for Vilonce some sexual nudity and language throughout. It is not a kid friendly film, but if they saw the original then this will be nothing for them. I recommend this movie for everyone who loved the first Blade Runner movie and even if you did not like the first one I think you will love this one. The only thing that I did not like was the 2 hours and 43 minutes, but it did not bother me enough to give it a 9 star ratingThank You for reading hope my review was helpfulMy score 10/10",Blade Runner 2049
232,coreyjdenford,A shining neon-glowing sequel.,10,5 October 2017,"This review of Blade Runner 2049 is spoiler free ***** (5/5) WHEN RIDLEY SCOTT released the first Blade Runner back in 1982 it was unlike anything before it, it was essentially more than just a film with an impressively compelling performance from Harrison Ford, it was immediately noticed as a technological accomplishment filled to the brim with an impressive collection of special effects – the moving holographic billboards were enough to make your eyes pop, the flying cars which now are more of a fantasy than a reality and a combination humans and robots called replicants. It really achieved higher than any other sci-fi before and even after the time – which essentially is why today it goes down as a masterpiece and perhaps the best that cinema has ever been. However when French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve announced that he was going to do a sequel long time fans were sceptical about it saying that it wouldn't be as good, it would give the predecessor a bad name and won't go down as well.Emphatically now at the long-awaited release of Blade Runner 2049 you can erase your fears as this is by far the best a sci-fi sequel has ever been. We open with Ryan Gosling's Officer KD6-3.7 a Blade Runner for the Los Angeles Police Department who's on a case to bring in any old replicants while on the case he unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos which could destroy everything they have come to know. Set in a world where the Earth is left in anarchy after an event which shook the world and brought the people of the city into fear shattering previous memories everything is left empty seemingly without repair. The film erupts from the opening reel as Villeneuve drags you into the often lonely life of Gosling's policeman who tries everything to repair his life back to the way it was, his character is complex yet cleverly thought out thanks to a script penned by Hampton Fancher and co-writer Michael Green they give his character a simple story but he's emotional too dealing with feelings way beyond his thoughts. And for any of you La La Landers out there Gosling is on top of his game much like Ford's performance in the film's predecessor he's incredible and brings a powerful dynamic to his story and essentially the film would be nothing without him.As an experience it's a must see especially in IMAX – it's loud ominous score quakes around the halls shattering your eardrums from the vibrations, the beautiful giant holographic billboards are enough to make your eyes pop just looking at the colour and the bright city lights and the sci-fi action is riveting and fast paced. Immediately after entering the live futuristic city of Los Angeles it's clear that Villeneuve is right at home here using the same directing techniques he's become accustomed with during Sicario, Prisoners or indeed Arrival using impressive close-ups, stunning long shots and eye-shattering panoramic shots. However at a runtime of 2 hours 43 minutes it's quite a long marathon that you will have to exercise for before stepping into the theatre yet that exercise is worth and is thoroughly paid off.Stylistically it is a Blade Runner film so for long-time fans the environment will be all too familiar and producer Scott who's happy to be back in this territory he makes every collection of images as real as possible bringing Villeneuve's imagination to life it really doesn't get any better than this. Happily when Ford's Rick Deckard comes onto the audience smiles from ear-to-ear. Story wise his character is a bit like Luke Skywalker from Star Wars: The Force Awakens he has been missing for thirty years and there is an extensive search for him. When found, Rick doesn't take to K at first he immediately thinks that K is trying to kill him. Here Ford now 75 years old looks a little worse for wear as if he's been lost aching for a little company which has been missing from his life and he brings this emotion into his character's grief giving him some emotional prowess which thanks to his stunning performance pays off.Happier still, the action is incredible there are only a few action scenes but each one is as brutal as the previous time round – Villeneuve introduces the action scenes as a cinematic thespian adding momentum to the white knuckle punches and a deafening ping from the two characters' blasters which surprisingly look as good as new. The action is relentless, fast-paced and utterly riveting from a wide-eyed opening fight scene with Dave Bautista's Sapper Morton, through electric chase scenes to a brutal final fight scene they are compelling and Villeneuve lets them play their toll painting a shiny gloss to the end credits. What Villeneuve has created in Blade Runner 2049 is an impressive, compelling and brilliant sci-fi sequel that shines with a glossy finish and will still look good with multiple viewings and is an experience that will last for decades to come.VERDICT: An impressive exercise of stunning colour, immersive CG images and incredible techniques Villeneuve's sequel isn't just a movie, it's a technological accomplishment, and is by far this year's best film.",Blade Runner 2049
233,kgprophet,Perhaps Too Many Re-Writes as the film Wanders,6,30 August 2018,"There is lot to like about this film IF you are a fan of the original film. If not, there may be a few places where you might be checking the clock on your phone. This film has been handled with care every step of the process, recruiting Roger Deakins being the most important. The direction is fine, the production design is apropos, the music works well, the characters are OK. But nothing really yells masterpiece other than the cinematography. Fittingly so, our protagonist Ryan Gosling slowly explores many interesting sets. Warning - many spoilers ahead. Gosling works well as a new Blade Runner that is also a replicant. He accepts that his memories are implants and dutifully goes about his life. His partner is a hologram, who shares some self-aware moments, perhaps feeling like a variation of the film ""Her"". Exploring this hologram's desires at times felt like a side-trip that kept us away from the main story. It is a foregone conclusion that this film exists primarily to answer questions from the first film. Knowing this, the script at times teases the audience that we will get to that destination, but then steer us into another rewrite. What may have been originally a hint at other goings on, feels fleshed out into many subplots. Our antagonist, the heir apparent to Tyrell, suffers from being overshadowed by other supporting characters and their own storylines. This includes a female Terminator of sorts. She enforces the other replicants, and a few humans too. Buried in these many storylines is Deckard, and the film waits until the third act to even acknowledge his existence in this sequel. In the fourth act, we see a CGI young Rachel. Quite appropriate as the plastic look of an animated human face gives her an unreal quality. I found the extra screen time to Gosling's holo-girlfriend as an idea that sounds more impressive on paper than in reality. She synchronises her movements to a prostitute, so that they can physically interact. It's an effect that wanted to be poetic, but I found it to be only mildly interesting. Again, somewhat familiar territory covered in ""Her"". The storytellers also wanted to be poetic, only to duplicate similar Harrison Ford storylines in recent years. Old Indy runs into his son. Old Han Solo confronts his misbehaving son. Now Old Deckard has to come to terms with his offspring. It leaves the answer to who that offspring may be until the end of the film. It probably was yet another rewrite that changed who that person is. I walked out of the theatre feeling OK about the experience. Maybe I need another showing to get a proper perspective on how effective the characters are in getting me to care about them. But in the meantime, another revelation came upon me as I was watching a film I worshiped pretty much since it was released. I saw the original film when it came out in 1982, and went to a revival theatre to see it anytime it was playing. Including the more recent ""Final Cut"" showing in the mid 2000s (and at a special showing yesterday). It occurred to me that the sequel's production design didn't really have to update their vision of the future, because the original production design was such a heavy influence on style into our actual future. Our actual world pretty much resembles what the Blade Runner's world looks like. I noticed that leaving the theatre and driving home past a police car with a string of lights with different colours. Previous to the original film, police cars had the standard two cherries on top (think Blues Brothers). Now it is commonplace to see a spread of lights along the top. Then there are the self-driving cars, something that current technology has caught up with. When Gosling strolls through a gothic-like industrial structure, we are reminded that the original Blade Runner invented this dark look, ""Tech Noir"". Fusing new technology into old buildings is something that is commonplace in every hip warehouse district from San Francisco to all other parts of the country. Then there are the mesmerising cityscapes that now exist for real in China and Arab countries. We are living in the world defined in the first film, and the new film need only toss in a drone or such to stay caught up. The music and sound design from the first film also became a timeless keepsake, preserved and revered over the decades since the film came out. I was not so immersed in the auditory universe of the sequel. No new themes stood out, although the instrumentation was faithful to the original by Vangelis. I could tell the late addition of Hans Zimmer was a desire to add some 'punch' to the soundtrack. This happens by way of loud tribal drumming that we heard a bit of in ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Again, another viewing (and listening) session is needed to get a deeper impression of the effectiveness of the sound. As much as I am a nut about the technical and social impact of the original film, it is hard for me to feel the same about this one. On the other hand I am always glad to revisit the Blade Runner universe if it is handled with care.",Blade Runner 2049
234,backup-50362,It's a good watch if you have 3 hours and love terrible endings that make you feel like you wasted 'em,1,20 July 2019,"A nice payoff after patiently sitting for 3 hours is having an ending where it makes you feel like things mattered. You expect 'it's gonna get better' moments but they don't happen. You expect the characters to say or do obvious things that would make sense but they don't.I like how all the reviewers rave about the 'hot chicks' in this movie when only the hologram girl was pretty. The hooker chick looked like a man and so did the overpowered robot woman. I'd rather stroke Jared Leto's beard every morning than wake up next to that smug chin-dimpled edgy face.Aside from this degenerate argument, the movie was way too long and slow. I can appreciate it if that's just how they envisioned it - lots of suspense and nothing. But it didn't always seem nescessary.But you know what I hate? Quiet mumbling for 20 minutes followed by obnoxiously loud music. And this movie has alot of that.The acting was great though, the futuristic concepts were fun, there's alot to like here. You just need to be extremely patient and not mind a bad plot meant for saddness, leading to an unsatisfying destination.",Blade Runner 2049
235,eagandersongil,The most scientific fiction of the 80's in the XXI century,10,28 October 2017,"The continuation of the spectacular, ""Blade Runner"" of 82 achieves an unthinkable feat, to be as good, if not better, than its predecessor, with a great script, good performances and a perfect art direction, Denis Villeneuve can do it again, we had already enchanted with ""The arrival"" last year, now he makes us fall in love with his film, for those who like science fiction it is impossible not to love his new work, which is the best science fiction film of recent years, surpassing until his great "" arrival"". The Blade Runner 2049 script does everything a good fiction has to do, think a concept of the future alienated to the present bringing with it a critique and a message, the film had everything to have a continuation with a forced script, but not , is a very clever script that brings a new concept alienated what we saw in the first, full of surprises and incantations. Bringing an extremely sexualized future, perhaps inspired by the future of ""Mechanical Orange"", and with many oriental influences in that future, perhaps because of the great economic and population domination that China has been taking, we do not have a beautiful and dazzling future, it is somber, dirty , without life, where the entertainment and the sex and the search of any relation with something real is the objective of life, is a future that puts in check our actions in the present, to where the world already is polluted too much, forcing an exodus causing social discomfort, where brands and companies exercise more than financial and political power, but a social power, although none of this is dealt with directly in the film, but all that is there, on the scene, in the interactions, in all, the future shown in blade runner is not something unpublished - Even because its predecessor does it - but the way it is shown is perfect and viceral. In the technical part, ""Blade Runner"" is a spectacle, with few special effects, but incredibly vivid and absurdly beautiful scenarios, the direction of art and photography of the film are perfect, it is a contrast of pure mastery dazzle with a depression surrounding the film, it's a palette of dark colors, and it looks like the scenarios look even more vivid and grandiose, and it looks like we're watching a movie from the '80s in 2017, and that's not a bad thing as it gives an inexplicable charm to new villeneuve film not only in photography, but in the direction of art in general, even the buttons, screens, machinery, technology concepts are those applied in the films of the 80's, ""Blade Runner is already born a classic"" and is right indication in the next Oscar in the category of photography, art direction and even costume, since almost all his characters have their own personality oppressed in the costumes in tiny details, and that the cruelty of the future does not open the full individuality of the costumes, and this is well portrayed in the film, and we can not fail to mention its great soundtrack, which is not grand or epic, it is synthetic, discreet, almost nostalgic, tacky and at times talk with the photograph of the film. Although the film contains a magnificent cast, we have no performance that jumps to the eye, but we also have nothing to spoil, Ryan Gosling is well as replicant, manages to be centered, indifferent and at the same time pass small feeling, Harrison Ford has a presence of absurd tel, when the same appears is impossible to notice in anything other than him, moreover, his recent laps to his classic characters makes everyone die of nostalgia and loves, save a highlight for the great Robin Wright, who seems who still does not leave House Of Cards, but this combines with his character, Sylviac Hoek, who as Ryan performs his role beautifully, and also to Ana de Armas, who with his hologram demonstrates its incredible beauty that we believe is a hologram, in addition to making numerous metaphors about virtual love and loving discoveries, and the great Jared Leto, who despite having a great costume and having incredible designs in his offices, their performance does not convince or excite. Denis Villeneuve is filming another great film, for me the director is already a natural successor to the great Ridley Scott, and if Denis finishes his career tomorrow, he would already be consecrated. Finally, contemplate one of the best films of the year, a more than worthy continuation to one of the greatest and best science fiction films of all time, well acted, well scripted, well directed, I can not point out a weakness in the film and yes to praise and applaud standing.",Blade Runner 2049
236,OttoVonB,Imperfect but Haunting and Memorable,9,11 October 2017,"It is fascinating to see parts of the audience replay reactions to the original Blade Runner. You've heard grievances about plot holes, false set pieces and style over substance, no doubt, as well as something of an open-ended ending? While all these points are true in part, they also all constitute strengths within the context of this particular film, and do justice to its forebear.Blade Runner 2049 opens as Agent K (Gosling) hunts down remaining Nexus 8+ replicants, against a backdrop of ecological collapse and mega-corporate rule. Tyrell Corp is gone and replaced by a bigger, more ominous force manufacturing a more obedient synthetic workforce. When the seemingly impossible happens, it sends K on a disturbing investigation with severe implications about whether these robots really are, as the original Tyrell tag-line promised, ""more human than human"".Much has been made of the stunningly oppressive cinematography. Is it maestro Deakins' career best? It is hard to say, given the extent to which the phenomenal production design and the cinematography complement each other, along with effects that - save for one smartly played uncanny valley-leaning revival - make you wonder what is digital and what is practical. Director Dennis Villeneuve forges another mighty link in a very impressive chain of meticulous films, and while the film can never aspire to be as era-defining as its predecessor, it does convey more emotion and manages infinitely superior chemistry between its characters.Ryan Gosling anchors and carries the film, despite the emotional distance deliberately placed between him and the audience from the onset. His is a quieter, more subdued tragedy than Rutger Hauer's fallen angel in the original, but his anguish and its pay-off resonate just as deeply. Harrison Ford bares his heart like never before, and his pairing with Gosling works wonders. The rest of the cast often acquit themselves very well despite sometimes limited screen-time or development, with the exception of a slightly underwhelming Sylvia Hoeks as the antagonist's hench-woman. For all his good work as a nightmarish version of a machine-linked Elon Musk, Jared Leto makes you wonder what original choice David Bowie might have done with the role.In terms of collaborators, the only weak link, at times, is Hans Zimmer, who goes balls-to-the-walls with the more oppressive parts of Vangelis' concepts, but fails to blend those and the quieter moments into a cohesive whole. The music is, when present, also menacingly loud in the sound mix, and while this does reenforce the oft- present and appropriate sense of dread, it sometimes sets up summer blockbuster expectations, which this decidedly - and thankfully - is not. One wishes Villeneuve regular Johan Johansson had been given a chance to play in Vangelis' sandbox.This is a rich and oppressive work, which refuses to answer all your questions, while evoking many fascinating ideas. It more than does justice to the original, and whatever throwbacks occur and, more often than not, thoughtful - even a reprise of the tears in the rain music theme, which Zimmer comes within inches or overplaying. What worked in the 1982 film still works here, and what didn't is actually improved, from the chemistry to the fact that our detective actually, you know, does some detective work for a change. It is that rare event film that has confidence in a more languid sense of pacing and textured atmosphere.Imperfect, yes, but undeniably haunting. Much like the original.",Blade Runner 2049
237,TouchTheGarlicProduction,"The first proper ""science fiction"" film with a big budget to come out in a LONG time",10,5 October 2017,"Sci-fi is everywhere these days, but real science fiction, the sort that plays with big ideas in a way you've never seen before, is hard to come by... especially in big budget movies. I'm talking about films like the Matrix or the original Blade Runner, which create worlds unlike anything seen before that are built upon scintillating ethical quandaries. There are still shows (like Black Mirror) and books that do this kind of thing, but this is probably the first blockbuster film released in my lifetime to achieve what this on the same scale as the classics. There are a couple of scenes in particular that explored concepts I had never seen before in a way that could never have been done in an earlier or lower-budgeted movie.Speaking of things were done in the film, the cinematography is absolutely outstanding. For those not in the know, the Director of Photography on this film (Roger Deakins) has been nominated for an Oscar 13 times... and has never won. When you watch this film, you can tell he's pushing real hard for this to be the time he wins. Every single shot is stunning, to the degree where you can almost feel the furious determination behind it. Watching Blade Runner 2049 feels like being punched in the face for three hours by an art gallery with a vendetta. At this point, if Deakins doesn't win, the Academy is being just downright cruel. Even funnier than the sheer madness of the cinematography is the critical reaction to this whole situation; the reviews seem to talk more about Deakins than Denis Villeneuve; the director of the film!The movie is nearly three hours long and pretty slow paced, yet I didn't feel a minute of it. I was surprised when it ended; I was sure there had to be another hour at least. That's how engrossing the film was. I think people should do their very best to avoid spoilers because the experience of watching the film unravel for the first time was absolutely brilliant. For once the studio managed to restrain themselves, and not give away the whole movie in the trailers. In fact, I was pleased to discover not only that all the cliché dialogue and moments in the entire film had been put in the trailer, but also that those moments had a much less conventional meaning once put into the context of the film. Ryan Gosling in particular had me worried with his completely bland and emotionless face in the trailers, but the in the movie he showed more range, justified the moments from the trailers, and created one of the most interesting characters in the movie.The only element of the film that I found to be somewhat lacking was the sound design. Vangelis' sweeping soundtrack was one of the most iconic aspects of the original film, creating half the atmosphere of the world. That music is notably absent from this film with one notable exception late in the film. It is replaced by a generic, forgettable, and at times ill-fitting suspense soundtrack with one or two synth sounds thrown in as a vain attempt to recapture Vangelis' magic.In short, Denis Villeneuve has crafted a true science-fiction masterpiece, a film that somehow manages to rise to the level of the original film and stand alone as an impressive achievement in its own right.",Blade Runner 2049

239,Danny_G13,It's terrific but not quite up there with the original,10,28 December 2017,"Let's face it, it could NOT be as good as the original, which is one of the greatest pieces of movie making ever be conceived, so let's get that out of the way.Rarely are sequels as good as the first one, and while this makes a hell of a good shot at it, it doesn't manage it.But what it does manage is to refresh the world of Blade Runner, making it relevant for the present day, while still keeping the feel of the original as much as it can without being derivative.The story follows on 30 years from BR, with Ryan Gosling, a new-age Blade Runner doing the same thing the old ones did - but after making a discovery, needs to track down ol' Deckard to solve an even bigger mystery.The original story was filled with so much philosophy and depth it's impossible to know where to start - what the sequel does is keep in enough of a level of depth to keep audiences engage but not making it as extensive - it's a sad reflection of the iPhone age that we just do not seem to have the capacity to think as much as we once did, and it feels like Villeneuve and Scott knew this and made a Blade Runner to accommodate the modern world.But they keep enough of what made BR good to avoid alienating its many fans, while adding in enough new stuff to avoid it seeming dated.For Gosling's part he's brilliant - he was immaculately cast in this role and it's the best I've seen him. Ford isn't in it a huge amount and definitely seems a different Deckard to 1982's. And a lot of the structure is similar - there's a 'Roy Batty' (if a pale imitation and nowhere near as threatening) type, a Tyrell (a much more cynical one) and even a kind of Sebastian too - an isolated soul who makes their own world.So fans will feel familiar ground. The directing is good - it does not feel like a long film and it goes by quickly - the pacing is spot on.But it just cannot compare to the original overall. It is a 10/10 by today's standards, but the original was a masterpiece which is off the charts.This is close enough, but no cigar.",Blade Runner 2049
240,dr_clarke_2,A worthy sequel to one of the finest science fiction films ever made,9,24 August 2021,"Thirty-five years after Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner was released to slow acclaim, a belated sequel arrived, helmed by an award-winning director who cites the original as a major influence on his career. Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049, which sees the return of both Harrison Ford as an older Deckard, revisits the world of Scott's film thirty years after the original and - despite a poor performance at the box office on its release - just about lives up to the hype.Blade Runner 2049 follows K, a Nexus-9 Replicant who works as a blade runner, hunting rogue Replicants. With the short life spans that plague Roy Batty's Nexus-6 generation a thing of the past, the new Replicants have found other things to rebel against as they dream of freedom. Previously obedient, K has reason to start sympathising when he uncovers evidence that a Replicant has had a child, something previously considered impossible, and sets out to find both the child and its father, Rick Deckard.Blade Runner 2049 is co-written by Hampton Fancher, who co-wrote the original film and penned this sequel with help from Michael Green and an uncredited Ridley Scott. It is perhaps unsurprising then that this builds faithfully on Blade Runner, exploring many of the same themes without feeling derivative. The future is still thoroughly dystopian, with orphans used for profit, women often working as prostitutes, and slavery - in the form of Replicants - normalised. More than the first film, it also examines the idea of what makes us human, with Replicants forming a liberation movement and K's holographic girlfriend Joi written very much as a person rather than simply a program. The plot is straightforward but not quite predictable: an enormous red herring manipulates audience expectations that K is Rachael's child, which turns out not in fact to be the case. Incidentally, the film also doesn't answer the question long pondered by fans of whether Deckard is a Replicant or not, with Tyrell-successor Niander Wallace making cryptic comments that could be taken to suggest that he is.Scott was originally lined up to direct Blade Runner 2049, but ultimately declined, perhaps fortunately given the lukewarm reception that both Prometheus and Alien: Covenant received. Villeneuve proved an inspired replacement: collaborating with cinematographer Roger Deakins for the third time, his direction produces visually stunning results, building on the design of the original very faithfully and expanding on it entirely convincingly; special effects, sets, costumes, props and location filming all mesh perfectly to create a polluted, dystopian near-future world that is utterly believable. The decayed retro sets of the ruined Las Vegas are remarkable. The fictional technology in this world is genuinely looks as though it is based on that of the first film and then advanced thirty years.The excellent casting sees Ryan Gosling play the lead role of K, giving a not-quite human performance that depicts the character as a picture of repressed emotion, which emerges properly for the first time when he is lead to believe that he was ""born, not made"". The returning Harrison Ford reprises another of his most iconic roles for the twenty-first century as Deckard, and convinces as a quiet recluse who sacrificed everything of value in his life to protect the child he has never even met; the look of fear and wonder on Ford's face when Deckard prepares to great his daughter at the end is magical. Edward James Olmos also briefly reprises his role from the original film as Gaff, and although he only gets one brief scene, his appearance feels entirely appropriate. Jared Leto gives a typically impressive and restrained performance as blind, obsessive, visionary Wallace, whilst Sylvia Hoeks makes a memorable villain as Luv, a psychotic Replicant who demonstrates more than a hint of sadism (but sheds the occasional tear) as she kills. Ana de Armas is so endearing as Joi that it's hard not to share K's grief when Luv - literally - crushes her underfoot.One contributor to the original film who doesn't return is Vangelis, who composed the score for the original; rumour has it that he declined as he dislikes revisiting old glories, and so instead Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer riff off his soundtrack without simply coping it, and successfully capture its atmosphere. It is the final ingredient in a recipe for a film that manages the impressive feat of acting as a worthy sequel to one of the finest science fiction films ever made.",Blade Runner 2049
241,fciocca,"Slow burner, visually impressive, at times a little bit boring",7,5 May 2021,"""Blade Runnner 2049"" is a good sequel, with a solid story, full of twists that you do not expect. It is visually impressive, I really liked the representation of the dystopian future and I think that it is very faithful to the original movie. The cast completely nailed it, a lot of big names are involved, so rest assured that the acting quality is very good.It is a slow burner, building up things gradually, perhaphs sometimes too slowly, there are a lot of scenes where nothing happens: just stills of the main character watching to a detail on the ground, or outside a window. You wonder when there will be some progress in the Blade Runner investigation. Also, toward the end there are some sequences that are unnecessarily long and tedious.Apart from that, Villeneuve managed to create an amazing narrative, with grade A special effects. I liked that he focused more on the investigation side of the story, instead of going full blast on action sequences. I really enjoyed how he developed the relationship between K and his artificial intelligence Joi, that should actually raise some concerns on how romantic interactions are progressing on our society. I liked how he exploited how humans use replicants as their slaves and these, becoming self-aware of their own situation want to free all the AIs. There is a big ideologic fight between these two factions that become more and more violent, through time because of a specific event.The soundtrack is ethereal, very scifi and it fits perfectly with the movie. Hans Zimmer once again does not disappoint and contribute to create a dark mood the whole time. I really liked how he used synths to create a dreamy and mysterious ambience. We are talking about a real master.In the end ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a solid movie, but it could have been much more. A lot of things are not properly explained and sometimes you need to use your immagination, in order to understand what is happening. This is not always bad, but there a few aspect of the story that I wish were explained better. There are a few plot holes, and this is unforgivable for a film that is 2 hours and 45 minutes long.",Blade Runner 2049
242,shawneofthedead,"Cerebral, rich and gorgeous to look at, Blade Runner 2049 doesn't disappoint - but it doesn't really excite, either.",6,25 October 2017,"Who in their right minds would even contemplate creating a sequel to Blade Runner, easily one of the most influential and iconic sci-fi classics of all time? For all its flaws (from a glacial pace to a tendency to favour style over substance), Ridley Scott's 1982 film remains a thoroughly original experiment that deftly juggles genres (sci-fi, noir, thriller) while serving up philosophical musings on humanity, identity and authority. It was groundbreaking, and has served as the template for countless movies and television shows since.To be fair, Blade Runner 2049 actually makes a pretty compelling case for a sequel. Its pedigree is fantastic: Denis Villeneuve, director of complex and arresting films like Sicario and Enemy, is at the helm, with Scott's full blessing. The screenplay is co- written by Hampton Fancher (who dreamt up the original script almost four decades ago) and Michael Green (Logan). Harrison Ford has returned to play Rick Deckard, alongside some of Hollywood's best character actors like Ryan Gosling and Robin Wright.The resulting film, however, is... a mixed bag. It's clear in every frame that the creative team poured their hearts and souls into it. Their efforts are rewarded by the moments in Blade Runner 2049 that hum with the electric spark of old ideas made new again. Unfortunately, these don't happen quite often enough to justify the film's staggering running time. Unlike its predecessor, Villeneuve's movie too often feels like it's playing rather than changing the game.The world of Blade Runner is one marked by grey areas of the literal and moral variety. 35 years on from the first film, the increasingly self-aware androids created by the Tyrell Corporation – known as 'replicants' – have been refined by industrialist Niander Wallace (Leto). Unlike troublesome models of generations past, K (Gosling) is dutiful and apparently devoid of human emotion and entanglement. Indeed, his job is to serve as a blade runner – a cop who 'retires'/de-activates rogue replicants – for the Los Angeles Police Department. But, when he uncovers a buried box of bones on a seemingly routine mission, he's led on an odyssey of self- discovery... one that leads him to a blade runner who's long since gone off the grid: Rick Deckard (Ford).For the most part, Blade Runner 2049 does a decent job of channelling the spirit of Ridley's film without coming off like a completely soulless retread. In effect, it's exploring much the same territory – what happens when artificial life takes on emotional reality of its own? can androids be more human than humans? – with some clever twists on the ideas and moods that added such colour and depth to the first film. K's existential crisis takes us through the very heart of this dystopian world, as the audience begins to see how he has been weighing his own identity against his programming all along.There are moments in the film that work quite well, mostly in depicting the almost devastating loneliness of the human – and replicant – condition. There's something truly heartbreaking about K's encounter with Dr. Ana Stelline (Juri), one of the world's top memory designers. Immuno-compromised from a young age, she's lived most of her life in a sterile, isolated environment – but nevertheless creates memories for replicants that fairly explode with colour and comfort. The inevitable clash between K and Deckard, played charmingly by Ford in full gruff hermit mode, affords this resolutely grave film a few welcome beats of levity.The trouble is that Blade Runner 2049 borrows its air of philosophical mystery from its predecessor, but doesn't manage to sustain it. The film ends up laying practically all of its cards on the table – including some that stayed hidden from view in Blade Runner. There remains some ambiguity about Deckard's metaphysical condition (thank goodness!), but little much else. The questions it raises are uncomfortable ones too, altering some of the more intriguing dynamics in the first film - not necessarily for the better. It doesn't help, either, that Blade Runner 2049 is arriving in cinemas in a media landscape that has been so indelibly shaped by its predecessor. The inner dreams and lives of androids and artificial life, so thought-provoking in the first film, are now the stuff of popular culture. More than once, Blade Runner 2049 tries but doesn't find much more to say than the likes of Spike Jonze's Her and HBO's Westworld, which have explored the same themes with greater sensitivity and insight.At least Blade Runner 2049 has adopted a marginally more progressive approach to its female characters this time around. It's not great that they exist primarily to serve as catalysts for K's journey, but at least they're there – in the roles of mentor (Wright as Lieutenant Joshi), muse (de Armas as Joi), antagonist (Hoeks as Luv) and more.If there's one element of the film that deserves unreserved praise, it's Roger Deakins' absolutely jaw-dropping cinematography. Blade Runner 2049 is the most visually stunning film you'll see all year - every frame is composed with an artist's eye for the sublime, drawing beauty even from the bleakest of urban wastelands. Hopefully, his work here will finally win Deakins an Academy Award (he's been nominated 13 times and not won once).In Hollywood history, only a mere handful of sequels have equalled or bettered their predecessors. Blade Runner 2049 is not one of those select few. It's incredibly well and thoughtfully made and, thankfully, doesn't disgrace or destroy the franchise to which it now belongs. But, if you're looking for bold, brainy sci-fi that's quite unlike anything you've ever seen before (like the original Blade Runner), you'd be better served by Villeneuve's own modern classic, Arrival.",Blade Runner 2049
243,DeBBss,A Great Sequel...,9,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is one of those movies whether you love it, or you hate it, and I loved it. Blade Runner 2049 is unique, and the only movie similar is the first one.Story: 9/10Blade Runner 2049 continues 30 years after the first Blade Runner movie. The whole story is based off of Rachael and Deckard. Apparently Rachael and Deckard had a child, which is impossible, because Rachael is a replicant, but it was a miracle. K, a Blade Runner is assigned to kill all Nexus 8 replicants, but while killing one he finds Nexus 7 bones hidden, he does a test, and it reveals she had a baby. Lt. Joshi orders him to eliminate the child so no one can know Nexus 7 replicants can have children. While K is on his mission, he finds clues that hints he's the child, but he finds out he isn't and actually it's a girl. The story is good. You watch K find out and reveal things about this child, and at points you believe he's the child.Characters: 9/10K: The best part about K is that he's struggling to confirm whether he's human, replicant or the child, we do confirm that he is not the child, and we do get hints he is a replicant, but it is not fully confirmed.Lt. Joshi: Lt. Joshi is K's captain. She gives K orders, and K does them. There's nothing too special about Lt. Joshi unfortunately, Lt. joshi could have been special, but the movie doesn't focus on her too much.Joi: Joi is a hologram, she's basically a product that a consumer can buy. I don't see the purpose of her in the movie except for a romantic relationship with K.Deckard: Deckard is the father of the special child. I thought that Deckard was going to have more screen time, but he gets introduced near the end of the movie.Action: 8/10I honestly predicted it wasn't going to be action packed. Blade Runner 2049 is more of a thriller then an action movie, so be expected to be bored for a bit. The movie also drags a lot, there's scenes that get extended for way too long, if the movie didn't drag so much it could have been 20 or 30 minutes shorter. The movie suffers because of the constant dragging.Blade Runner 2049 tells a great story, but the movie is way too long, that's the only major problem, everything else about it is great. The cinematography is amazing, the colors and the futuristic feeling is captivating. The music has a futuristic vibe, and it has a eerie feeling.",Blade Runner 2049
244,jayjaycee,Some questions will always be unanswered...,8,1 December 2019,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a 2017 science fiction thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford. It took more than thirty years for this sequel to hit the big screen, decades after the genre defining classic questioned the values of what makes us human. Now we got a continuation to the story that famously sparked several discussions that fans to this day approach. Many considered it unnecessary, some hoped to get their desired answers. I can tell that both sides were probably disappointed. Like its predecessor the scenery is overall uncomfortable, rainy and filthy, it has the same infamously depressing and dismal tone to it. Ryan Gosling's performance of the Blade Runner K is tacitum, robotic and distanced, but all the while subliminally cool. It most likely appealed to me, because it reminded me of his character in the ingenious ""Drive"". Also, I personally liked how the film used the key elements and themes of the original and advanced them even more and adapted them to our ""modern comprehension"" of a futuristic society, such as the usage of virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Most of it comes alive by the magnificent cinematography of Roger Deakins, not unsubstantiatedly awarded with his well deserved academy award. The play of colours and visual effects perfectly support the visually stunning images and it was an even bigger treat for the eye on Blu-ray. Nevertheless, it still has some mild weaknesses: The film itself is extremely long and has a lot of quite scenes and the story progresses rather slowly and some characters lacked a specific depth (Jared Leto's Niander Wallace e.g.) and could've been more fleshed out. But that's just a small remark. The story itself is fantastic though. It offers a whole new level of cleverness and fits with the original story in a respectful way. With several clever and misleading twists it builds up a mystery that raises more questions than before and it barely answered the one you had already. It's also studded with plenty of references and connections to the 1982 film, such as cameos and small details - and of course the appearance of Harrison Ford in his iconic role of Rick Deckard. All in all, this thriller is a worthy successor to the classic, as it narrates a mysterious story that packs you. It might be slightly too long, but it's worth it all the while. Additionally, it might not be as deep and philosophical as the original, but it still delivers a great experience lead by a charismatic Ryan Gosling. Many fans might be upset that they will not get the answers they needed, but I think that has always been the concept of this franchise. Who is human and who is a replicant is a discussion that will never come to an end, and even more importantly: Is Deckard a replicant now? We will never know, except they decide to do another sequel, I personally hope not...",Blade Runner 2049
245,gregberne11,Not Terrible But Fails To Live Up - Light Spoilers,5,17 January 2019,"BR2049 is not a terrible film but it really fails to live up to the classic original Blade Runner (1982), even the inferior cuts of Blade Runner.It is far, far too long. The visuals are stunning but the story is very thin (yet still has holes) and does not justify anywhere near the screen time.The music misses the mark. The sound is good and hits the right notes with the music but Vangellis' score was a big part of the original that is sadly mostly absent here. And a lot of the sound cues are just brief and blasted at us as if to say ""HERE IS THE BLADE RUNNER SOUND!""The story like I said is very thin. The runner finds everything easily and we know what is going to happen. When we see the flower by the tree do they really need to drag that ""discovery"" on for so long? The discovery of the wooden horse takes forever too, even though we know exactly what is happening long before that. Everything drags in this movie and it's not like they are creating tension or anything. The emotion is also flat.They deliberately abandon avenues (the new corporate evil puppet master) and obviously are hoping to do more sequels.There are annoying nonsensical happenings too, logic holes and lots of questions unanswered.Here are some of my issues after watching this, and this is where light SPOILERS are---- Olmos does everything but say ""Deckard is a replicant"" but if so why does he age just like a human? Replicants can have kids now but they don't even explore how or why? Vegas is in a radioactive cloud but Deckard lives there no problem... even if it's safe now wouldn't all the food supplies there be irradiated? If it is safe there now why is he the only one living there in luxury? Gosling sure gets over the loss of his ""wife"" fast. Gosling's police chief just takes his word that he killed his target even though he is a replicant himself who fails his baseline test, when the stakes are a full-on war with replicants? Why is the police chief in charge of this hugely important security issue? The Lov/her boss issue is just abandoned. These are just the issues off the top of my head.Again the main problem is the ponderous run time for no apparent reason.In the plus column are good acting (Gosling's not great in this but doesn't have much to work with, same for Harrison Ford, other supporting characters are good).Also the visuals like I said are incredible.",Blade Runner 2049

And Harrison Ford as former Blade Runner Rick Deckard was a welcome surprise. I won't say where so I'll leave it at that. But it made a nice sci-fi action thriller. And I like cyberpunk too.

248,zeekwunlau,The warmth of the soul,8,4 April 2020,"Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of the original in my heart, but it is a deeper one. It will be full of details and humanity that have not been flashed underground. It is more silent than a strong and straightforward science fiction scene. Department's discussion of thought and true self. The reason why the Blade Runner is known as the ancestor of Cyberpunk is actually not very clear to me. On the surface, the Blade Runner 's architecture was inseparable from the beginning, but unexpectedly and clearly extended the depth of thinking and creation: fine The ""future"" sci-fi scene that is long, deep and unextensive, but ubiquitous. Compared with the rigid and direct display of the entire setting and the grand world view, the Blade Runner is like a monologue at the end of the film. It is a big The background story is a thin link, and this story is the corner of the torn page in this photo of ""Future"". Through the patchwork of details and scenes, we can find the blurry image of the entire future world. There is a beauty that wither itself. . Unlike the ordinary ""floating day"", the microscopic is essentially a complete and scalable image of fullness, but the prospect story of the Blade Runner is probably rudely cut off from the universe due to cost issues and shelved. Reflecting the resonance of the inside and outside world is the monologue in the rain, which is broken and complicated:""I've seen things that you humans can't believe. I have witnessed the battleship burning at the end of the constellation Orion. I watched the C-rays shining in the darkness near the Don Wyeth gate. All these moments ... will end with time Fading away, just like ... Tears disappeared in the rain. ""This paragraph is not bad when it comes to emotionally clarifying the human nature and thinking. After reading several translated versions of the monologue, I have to insert a blade runner and translate it into a silver wing killer. The translation is really affecting people's feelings. In Taylor RFI, the translation of ""Everybody knows that my love dies in the heart of contrasts"" is totally worth the money back to the album ... On the other hand, the memories of ROI also make a color fill for the outside world, despite the war Other than this corner, the space is still blank, but at least the world view is at least consciously connected with the whole story to form a thread. In addition to the hard sci-fi aspect of the world view, the Blade Runner preliminarily conveyed through ""De Card's pursuit of bionics and love for Rachel"" that ""machine life is essentially no different from humans"". Decader and Rachel have humanity and love, and can correctly perceive all the meaning brought by affection and time. Ridley Scott 's style is fusion and remodeling. The corners are rough but cannot change the madness of the core of the science fiction story. Although weirdly born in the crowd of people, the simplicity ca n't hide this exchange of thinking perspectives. The subtlety of unity.The surpassing of 2049 is not to further promote the world view and story plot. After all, in fact, the story script is bound to the bionic man K and it is a sequel. It is difficult to escape from the entrapment and shackles of the original Blade Runner original. The road is fully paved. Waiting for choice, it is reasonable for most of the sequels to be difficult to surpass the original. Science fiction is largely based on photography technology. The color and light sense are successively rotated in turn. Under the large scene, everything is like a poem without words, written by the wild. There is no science fiction story's most common desire and youthful warmth. In the final analysis, the second most touching part is its romance, hope, and self-seeking. This is a downright tragedy, but at the same time it really puts soft science fiction in The thinking of philosophical and human relations is rendered to the extreme of true feelings.The first soundtrack in 2049 is ""Almost Human"", the word Almost itself is a torrential rain, with a regretful temperature. The bionic man K and the virtual intelligent girlfriend Joi at the core of the story are another way of confirming the view that ""bionic people and people are really the same"". Compared with Dekad and Rachel who have firmly believed that they are human from the beginning of birth, The tragic colors and struggling traces on K and Joi are more obvious. A bionic person who thinks he is just a fake, a body that even entrusts himself with nowhere to look for. Joi is a broken neon in the virtual world that can be played by everyone. Ownership of all people occupies her and makes her extinguish, but this false emotion is forged by her, and even becomes the leader of all K's feelings and life. Believe it, the illusory heat and temperature when the steel body and the fluorescence touch each other will not make people sleep. K ... K's story is nothing to tell. His struggle is like chasing the sun on the wasteland. ""Covering the mountain, I found that the other side of the mountain is still the mountain."" Human nature burned more than fire in the steel body, hoping to burst, K's relief and exhaustion when he fell into the snow like a bird fell to the sea, pure white is the cold reverberation , Covering his monologue, and also giving him the echo of this world, struggling or falling, belief may be broken, but he poured all the regrets and shortcomings in the movie with heavy emotions, it is simply shocking to send out Sound.",Blade Runner 2049
249,shanayneigh,An hour too long,3,21 January 2018,"I don't know why so many filmmakers today confuse slow with profound and dull with visionary. The first two acts take up almost two hours of screen time. Would anything really change if you compressed it into an hour? Oh, I guess you would lose a lot of meaningful shots of Gosling staring glumly into the distance.If Deckard didn't want himself or the kid to be found and taught people how to hide their tracks, he sure did a horrible job at it considering how many obvious clues they left behind (good job carving a date into the tree under which the secret remains of Robomom were hidden). I know the smug fanboy choir will tell me to watch a Transformers movie instead. Hey, if you liked this movie, good for you. I thought it was a painfully boring pretentious mess without any kind of narrative drive or interesting characters to speak of. In other words, much like the original Blade Runner then. It's all glossy surface and pretty visuals.Denis Villeneuve is one of the most uneven filmmakers working today, in my opinion. I haven't been able to see any of his earlier work like Incendies or Polytechnique. The first Villeneuve movie I saw was Prisoners, and that was absolutely fantastic. I loved it.

Directed by Villeneuve ('Arrival') and only produced by Ridley Scott (why is he involved in his own sequel, but not directing?), it doesn't even attempt to answer the main question of the first film - is Deckard (Ford) a replicant? Why is it always raining? Why do Ford & Leto only have a total of about four scenes between them? Why does it go for over 2 & a half hours?There is some plot, with K (Gosling) being a replicant Blade Runner, tasked by Joshi (Wright) to track down runaway replicants, which leads to uncovering a mystery surrounding Deckard & Rachael. It takes 100min for Ford to even appear. In the meantime, Hans Zimmer tries to recreate the original's iconic score, but not as synth-y and sometimes a bit too overwrought. There's a lot of K interacting with Joi (de Armas), his 'Her'-like holographic maid. Most of this is handled quite well, with the CGI of Joi interacting with the light and her surroundings done excellently. But, it doesn't help move the film along at all.There is occasional bits of action/violence, mostly thanks to Luv (Hoeks), but not enough to sustain the first two hours, with the clues slowly unravelling and not much excitement. It does pick up in the final 45min and has a passable ending, but mostly I'm left with the feeling of ""it looks cool, but why do I care?""

True, it doesn't seem to add up to much or say anything, and Jared Leto is an incomprehensible mess, but for the first hour and a half you don't really mind, just because it's so nice to look at and the care and attention on display. It really only starts to go downhill once Harrison Ford appears on screen. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I can ascertain, Harrison Ford has not actually acted ONCE the past quarter century. And here, as with his shameful cameo in 'The Farce Awakens', he simply turns up, trembles his lip, looks like he's going to cry and then dodders about onscreen looking confused for about 10 minutes total, runs off with his big sack of cash and takes off to fly his plane. And as with that previous spin of the grave of Han Solo, there is nothing beyond the obvious surface physical resemblance to link whatever he is doing onscreen here to the character of Deckard in the original. The film is easily a good half hour too long, and way before the credits roll you realize it hasn't added up to anything, or said anything new, or done anything to equal the original. There was never any need to make a sequel to Blade Runner, but the first two thirds of this film did the best job of attempting it anyone could have hoped for. Yes, it all leads to nothing, but it's still an admirable achievement all the same, so how to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 I really don't know.",Blade Runner 2049
256,pkpera,"Movie, I wanted to like you, but you did not make it easy",5,26 December 2017,"Summary above is just a paraphrase of one of movies dialog part - in pretty much unnecessary and too long arguing (with fists, guns, words) scene chain. So, it started reasonably good, although was obvious that will be slow walk. 2h49min. All it could fit in 90 minutes, if not less. There was something new - scenes at his home with holographic Anna de Armas were best part of movie - at least something refreshing.
I thought: finally a good Denis VIlleneuve movie. Well, I was too optimistic, because things started to be just boring, predictable and not much sense in dialogs, bad pace, editing - too slow one moment, then just quick scene change.
What is wrong with today's filmmakers ? Although, I can ask it in middle of review - what was wrong with old way of review displaying here ? Now, if your review is not at top, so on first 1-2 pages, nobody will see it. Additionally, 'order by usefulness' - come on - who judges that ? Is some review with rating 1 for this movie really useful ? I mean, I'm not happy with it, but it has some good, mediocre parts, so deserves more than 2-3 at least. 
And to say here: some reviewers really don't get that it happens in another reality, not our. There is still Soviet Union alive in 2049, you may see large Atari advert, building (yep, they were strong in 1982).
Back to review. After some 40 mins it became quite predictable. I said at one moment - Harrison Ford will appear in 1 minute. I was wrong - he appeared after some 4 minutes - but that was just because so slow pace, stretched scenes. Reminded me on Heaven's Gate - another high budget failure. 
Dialogs: very sparse word usage, often just hard to get what they mean, what talk about. Worst was probably at the end, when Ryan Gosling said to old man something like ""I did, but you were dead out there' - that just did not make sense considering happenings before - concrete he was not able to let him die out there, because was not aware at all about him. 
There was lot of unnecessary and boring fight scene, some unnecessary 'F' words - typical for bad dialogs - if I can't write something smart, let it be f-dramatized :-) 
150 m. budget, and CGI was not bad, but far from impressive. Now, I need to watch original to have some comparison. They will earn some + money even with that :-) 
For the end, movie was shot in Hungary. There was some old lady yelling in Hungarian on stairs - OK. But why Edward James Olmos retired in Hungarian language ? :-)))) Is there Hunger Town in LA in 2049 ? :-)))",Blade Runner 2049
257,ayoreinf,"Nothing could compare with the original, but this is a decent attempt",8,16 October 2017,"Blade Runner is my favorite film ever, and as close to perfection as any movie has come. I deliberately didn't say the best film ever. ""the best film ever"" is an over used phrase that means nothing. I can think of at least 10 other movies which are as good as Blade Runner, even though I personally like Blade Runner more. No wonder Ridley Scott didn't dare touching his greatest masterpiece again as a director and limited himself to the role of producer this time.So I must admit, there was very little chance that the sequel will come close to the perfection of the previous film, and I think I can state this almost objectively. This blend of a brilliant original idea (Philip K. Dick is really without an equal on this department), a perfect script, great visuals, wonderful acting and just the right amount of Christian and Celtic symbolism to give the entire thing some extra depth. The choice of the very same script writer - Hampton Fancher, is certainly a must, and it does look and even feels like a straight forward next episode in the story we started following on 1982. Which is a big plus to begin with. And the story does make sense, it's definitely taking place in the same universe of its predecessor. The acting is still great, and the very same basic questions are still echoing all over the movie: What is it that makes us human? Will it make our creation human too? and what does it mean morally to create other humans, even if only manufactured ones?For me, all of the above are a very worthy list, which makes Blade Runner 2049 a great movie, even if it doesn't soar as high as the original.One last point has to do with the use of 3D. It's being used for one purpose, to make the world we see more real. Not for cinematic fireworks or any other form of directorial showing off, and I for one, liked it.",Blade Runner 2049

259,EvanKevelson,A decent editing job could shave 40 minutes off without cutting a scene,7,9 August 2021,"I'm a cult fan of the original and was not thrilled with a sequel 35 years after a cult classic.I thought this was a deeper film, but just as an example... Watching Bautista farm, and take off his helmet, and prior to that Gozzlings entry took 6 minutes before dialogue.Throughout this film there are periods of walking around that add nothing. They don't add suspense, nor do they make the find any more or less shocking, it's simply excess footage. Another example would be when Gozzling goes to the orphanage, once the man agrees to show him the records the viewer gains nothing from this long extensive walk, and the wooden horse could have been discovered as he was leaving.The one thing that wasn't elaborated upon was Joi who is pure AI not synthetic not genetically engineered so what role would that kind of being play outside of ""fantasy"" material?I simply wish that a lot of flying, moments of silence, exploring were reduced because again in not one instant did it build tension or suspense, just frustration and it ruined the fluidity of the story.More background on Litto's character would have been nice as well.Compared to what's out there this is a good film, but because of what I mentioned it simply doesn't reach the quality story telling of the original film.",Blade Runner 2049
260,kaptenvideo-89875,A worthy update to one of the most critically loved sci-fi movies ever,8,24 December 2017,"A young blade runner's (Ryan Gosling) discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down older colleague (Harrison Ford), who's been missing for thirty years. In the future, there are people whose job is to find and kill human-like robots, you know, and they are called blade runners.Also appearing, Jared Leto, Robin Wright, Dave Bautista, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Mackenzie Davis, David Dastmalchian et al.The original ""Blade Runner"" (1982) is lauded as one of the best and most important sci-fi movies ever. I have seen it, of course, even more than once, and read the Philip K. Dick's story it's based on, but never see the appeal, honestly. Was quite bored with it, actually.So why do they like it so much? I am too lazy to research it on the interweb, so I am just gonna take a wild guess and offer that when it came out, it was a long-waited antidote to all the silly sci-fi movies craze that had ruled in the previous five years.You see, throughout history sci-fi was always a ""serious"" and artsy cinema genre but then ""Star Wars"" (1977) came out and made huge amount of people want something different entirely.So ""Blade Runner"" was, for sci-fi geeks, a long-awaited return to form, with its moodiness, sombre atmosphere and deep philosophical questions such as what makes us ""real"" anyway, and is human life more important than artificially created one.""Blade Runner"" flopped in cinemas originally but over the years it has built an admirable cult following. And the fans are surely glad to know that the long-planned sequel is finally here and stays far away from mainstream fare, respecting its ""serious"" roots and everything.Yes, the trailers look spectacular and have plenty of rip-roaring action but the new ""Blade Runner"" is all about returning to the form, easily supassing the original movie in every aspect, at least for yours truly.Be warned: not only does it last for close to three hours, it's so artsy that you may feel the need to go grab some junk food later. Just to, you know, compensate.The story is slow, not too eventful, a few action setpieces, not much dialogue - and the existing sounds more like monologue than real natural conversation between persons.Filled with futuristic landscapes and environments, the movie looks gorgeous but there's a noticeble discord between viewer and characters/events. The experience is cold and disheartening by design, always keeping you at arms length, so to speak.It does have Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford starring, but the result is far from perfect date movie... unless both are big movie lovers and/or loved the original ""Blade Runner"".You may also have trouble with understanding the backstory and certain things about the characters. It is even difficult to say whether everything is meant to feel so ambiguous, asking us to offer our own answers, or the makers have tried to remain as ""artsy"" as possible. I think it's meant to be that hard to grasp. It's directed by Denis Villeneuve after all (""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"", ""Sicario"", ""Arrival"").To be honest, the movie does not have any good reason to last for close to three hours, but at least it's full of thoughtful and well-crafted material, not filler crap like many ""event"" movies.The main topics such as the future of artifical intellect and the value of life, especially human life versus the artificially created one, are intriguing if you are able to open up to the whole experience.And if you manage to open up already, you may admire how spiritual this bleak and cold futuristic story can be at its core. I dug throught the symbolism evident in the story and found out that it is really about the importance of feelings - this is all you really have to get through life. Just what the spiritual systems have taught us for thousands of years.There will be many who will feel turned offed by this approach, I am sure. For an expensive 150 million U.S. dollar movie, it sure tries its earnest not to be easily liked and digested.But it's gorgeous and after a while, you may notice that it really speaks to you. Some may dig the moodiness, or Gosling's face, but there's enough serious content beneath the surface.For all it's emotional distant-ness and terrifying length, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is not my cup of tea, but I think it's a noteworthy piece of modern art. Considering the hefty budget, it is also probably the most expensive piece of modern art ever made.All in all, for what it is, the movie could not be better in any aspect. Except for maybe giving Leto a bigger role.",Blade Runner 2049
261,CountJonnie,2017 style over 1982 substance,6,20 October 2019,"This sequel added nothing of substance to an already amazing and balanced original. Can't compete with the dystopian feeling of the original, aided by presence of a brilliant Rutger Hauer.The sequel tried to be chilling and original, by adding slow scenes, filled with nothing or forced symbolism and an uninspiring villain, awkwardly portrayed by Jared Leto who has nothing to work with.

262,WalkdenEntertainment,Sometime to love someone...you got to be a stranger.,10,9 January 2019,"Blade Runner 2049 is a Sequel to the well known sci-fi classic Blade Runner. The original Blade Runner was made in 1982 and was directed by Ridley Scott (Aliens, Gladiator). This time round we have a new director, and a new lead character and most importantly, a new story.For the sake of the film's plot and a request made public by the director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario), there will be no major spoilers in this review. Like seeing a new Star Wars film, there are many plot points that should be experienced in a cinema and not spoiled in a film review.The year is 2049 and this film follows a Blade Runner named K (played Ryan Gosling). K is assigned a new case and through the movie we watch him go from clue to clue. Each step he takes allows him to make new major discoveries and uncover mysteries. He also discovered that he will require the assistance of a man named ""Deckard"" (Harrison Ford), a man who was also previously a Blade Runner a long time ago...Within a matter of minutes, I loved how mysterious the plot was as we followed our new Blade Runner. The film doesn't take long to get the plot going and I was instantly invested in the new story.The world of Blade Runner is back better than ever. This is a film that is loaded with some of the best sci-fi visuals I have seen in years! With a runtime of 2hr and 43mins, I was very concerned that this type of runtime would have me yawning, but needless to say when the Visuals look as amazing as they do in this film, I personally had no issue with the runtime because the film looked just so damn good!Even when you have an idea about what's yet to come, I didn't want the film to rush its pace. Perhaps others may struggle with the runtime, but my response would be when it's this type of film, why rush it?The audio track, and sounds are also a major jaw dropper. Blade Runner 2049, like the original 1982 film, once again has a new, incredible, futuristic audio track. There so much tension and awe delivered by the music in this film. The sound design for all effects are again, amazing. Futuristic cars, tech gear, guns- are all alive. Like the Visual, the film's surround track didn't disappoint at any point!As far as the new plot is concern, I was blown away. This a sequel done right. The film doesn't try to make the plot bigger than the last, but honours and continues the experience of the previous film. In my opinion, the way this is done takes the story ""the next step"" up without being too silly in the plot department. I felt that the new lead ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) was fantastic and Ryan Gosling once again pulled off a great performance as he tackled all the big questions throughout the film. We also see many moments of depth in his character. And of course, for fans that have yet to see the sequel, you will be happy to know Harrison Ford's role doesn't disappoint either! The old man has still got it lol.Finesse Movie Reviews strongly suggest that cinema lovers watch the original film before viewing this new sequel.Overall, this is a film is a knockout! Loaded with some of the best sci-fi visuals and surround tracks, most importantly it takes Blade Runner to a new level and its story is told with perfect pace in each scene. The film at times will feel like it's telling the story at a slower rate, but when all boxes are ticked, I'm totally fine with that! For movies in 2017, this is a must see!9.7/10

Obviously visual effects were nice but is that the only thing that you want to put in the film. There was no good action, no good anything except the so called visuals. If you want me to praise this movie because of visual effects, then I am really sorry I can't find any reason to say it good.

About 90 minutes in, we all started checking out watches and talking about where we were going for dinner after. It was good, I won't be buying the DVD.

266,srdjan_veljkovic,"Over-hyped, not nearly as good as the original",6,10 October 2017,"It's not bad, mind you. It's OK. But, basically everything is worse than the original. Even the visuals, which are of much higher fidelity, still don't work as well as the visuals of the original.But, the most important distinctive features of the original, the music and Rutger Hauer with his exceptional ending monologue, are the biggest difference, as there's nothing that comes near it in BR2049.Other than that, the story and the characters are simply not as interesting as the original. The new ideas (like the shift from human vs replicant focus to biologic(human/replicant) vs artificial (AI)): again, not as interesting.If you're a fan of Edward James Olmos, you'll be glad to see him, only to be disappointed very quickly, as his cameo is very short and more-or-less pointless.And yes... it's waaay too long. Not only in the first half. Right up to the very end. It doesn't really have that much to say.On the flip side, Ford finally plays someone his own age (he was playing the ""I'm not so old"" guy way too long) and does a decent job of it. The ""hey, it seems possible Deckard is a replicant, but, it actually doesn't matter"" feel that you get from watching BR2049 is also an improvement over the original which has two cuts which show different stories in this regard (and distract the audience from other things that do matter).So, this is a strange mix. Although the story is a decent (if less interesting) continuation of the original, the movie as a whole isn't. That is, you're probably better of not watching it, it might spoil the experience. As a stand-alone movie, too many things in the movie seem to be too unconnected to its story (like ""why should we care""), so, it doesn't stand well enough on its own feet.",Blade Runner 2049
267,williampsamuel,The Rare Sequel That Lives Up to the Original,10,15 March 2019,"It's not easy to capture lightning in a bottle. Perfectly recapturing the look, sound, feel, and unique blend of elements that defined the original Blade Runner is no small task. Capturing its substance is harder still. And yet this film does it perfectly. Director Denis Villeneuve and the others involved have succeeded in creating the rare sequel that perfectly recreates the style of its predecessor while expanding on its story and themes.Ryan Gosling stars as Officer K, a new model replicant who works for the LAPD ""retiring"" unstable older models. He lives alone, except for his house's holographic interface, who gives new meaning to the phrase ""virtual girlfriend."" Like all of the new models he's very good at his job and never questions orders. At least until a ""routine retirement"" turns up a secret that challenges everything he thought he knew about his nature, and could change the global balance of power- or plunge what's left of civilization into war.The original Blade Runner asked intriguing questions about what it means to be human. 2049 goes a step further, questioning the nature of what's real. Characters struggle with whether their memories are their own, someone else's, or something entirely manufactured. The mutual affection between K and his holographic girlfriend raises the question of whether an AI can truly feel, or if there's any way for her to become a real girl. And the enduring question from the ending original Blade Runner is still very much open.Visually this film is a masterpiece of bleakness. LA is still the shadowy, run down megatropolis it was before, just a little flashier and newer. Endless sheets of rain still pour down on darkened streets as streetlights and flashing signs struggle to illuminate the perpetual gloom and holographic ads offer pleasures of every kind to passersby.Only this time the streets don't seem so crowded as before. Which makes sense given that anyone who can afford to has bought passage off planet. Because if LA is dystopian the world beyond its walls is downright post-apocalyptic. San Diego is a wasteland out of Mad Max; a vast scrapyard dotted with the ruins of old high rises and occupied only by desperate bands of scavengers and outlaws. Vegas is as quiet as a tomb; shrouded in a haze of cloud and dust, its casinos sitting as though frozen in time. And in between is only desolate emptiness as far as the eye can see. And it's all so artfully photographed and exquisitely atmospheric.Harrison Ford doesn't have as much screen time as the trailers might have suggested, but whenever he's on screen it's clear that he hasn't lost a beat. The weariness and slight grumpiness that seems to be his default setting these days serves him well as the reclusive old Deckard, gone semi-paranoid after so many years in hiding. He throws a mean punch for a man his age, and radiates a mix of anger, sadness, and tired resignation as he describes all that's transpired in the last thirty years. Gosling likewise excels in the frequent action scenes and gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as a man questioning who and what he really is.But Jared Leto might make the strongest impression. As ruthless industrialist Niander Wallace- creator of the new generation of replicants- he is a study in contradictions. His manner is eerily emotionless, yet his gaze exudes brilliance and obsession. He calls the replicants his children and speaks of their destiny and need to grow, but treats them as disposable. And his zeal to propel mankind forward makes him merciless to anyone who stands in his way. We're not entirely sure what he is either. He seems to be a cyborg, but it's unclear how far the changes go, or if he might be something more artificial altogether. What I do know is that this performance is enough to redeem him for his overwrought turn as the Joker in Suicide Squad.If this movie has a fault it's that it stays too faithful to the original's grating synthesizer soundtrack, heavy on reverb and distortion. But then again, I suppose that it does fit the film's mood and add to the sense of tension when needed. And while the fights and shootouts are very good, nothing can match Deckard's battle with Roy in the last film. Blade Runner 2049 is not quite the original, but it comes very close. And for a movie like Blade Runner that's high praise indeed.",Blade Runner 2049

I know that the pace of the original was also slow, but still it had some very interesting intensive drama and action, this movie feels way to much slow and blank with not a lot of dialog also and soundtrack that often feels more like just a noise than somekind of music. The soundtrack of the original was also amazing in comparison to this one which was maybe a bit to slow to match the pace of the movie.

1. The movie is 2.75 hours long and about one hour are drawn out sequences that did not add anything to story(five minutes looking at piano when 40 seconds would have had same effect). There are many multi minute scenes of staring and walking, it seemed the director did very little editing on the boring scenes while editing hard on the action scenes including missing some punches/gun shots.2. The movie obviously was created with a sequel in mind, meaning it left several major plots unanswered. If you are going to make me sit 3.0 hours, at least answer all questions.3. Jared Leto...who I liked and is a talented actor, but like Suicide Squad his entire character arch could have been completely removed from the movie without it losing any story.

271,darkreignn,"Honestly, over-hyped and mediocre at best",4,8 October 2017,"There's a lot to like about this movie. Ryan Gosling gives a fantastic performance, both nuanced and surprisingly emotional. The action, when there is action, is well filmed and brutal and fun to watch. The CGI is pretty much flawless, and I'm not joking when I say that while watching this movie, you'll think you're watching a real world. The film is interesting, it's well shot, well directed, it's visually stunning, it's pretty, and the score is very thrilling. But as a whole, this movie is just so god da*n boring. Look, I like slow paced movies, but this film is beyond slow paced. It's brain dead. It's literally like watching a person with no arms and legs try to crawl across a football field. I won't lie, at first I liked this slow pace because it built up a lot of tension, a lot of mystery, a lot of suspense, and I assumed that eventually the film would kick into high gear; it never did. The pace remains constant throughout the entire run time of this movie. It's excruciatingly slow. The movie is almost 3 hours long, and it feels like 6. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, I mean by the end of the movie I expected to look in the mirror and see that I aged 65 years. And also, the film is also overly convoluted. I'm not saying that this is a confusing film, because it's not; in fact, it's pretty straightforward and easy to follow. It just simply felt like this movie was convoluted for the sake of it being convoluted. At the time of watching everything felt important. I had to pee so badly the entire movie but I didn't want to get up because I felt like everything I was watching was super important. However, only after viewing do I realize that there were so many scenes that were totally unnecessary, that were there only to make the movie longer, more bloated, and more self-important.Unfortunately, there's just not much else to say. This is a simple movie, and it gets a simple review. Look, I wanted to give this a high score, but I just couldn't, and I don't understand why other people are because this movie is simply not enjoyable or entertaining. Yes, it's well made, a feast for the eyes and ears, but that doesn't make it a good film; it makes it a well directed and produced film, but not a good one.",Blade Runner 2049

275,Aly200,The 35 Year Wait is Worth It,9,6 October 2017,"It's been 35 years since Ridley Scott delivered his iconic sci-fi noir based on Philip K. Dick's novella 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and now director Denis Villeneuve has brought us a sequel that many fans have been anxiously anticipating. Was the three and a half decade wait worth such a lengthy hiatus? Honestly it sure as hell was in this writer's opinion.A brief plot synopsis: 30 years after Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) hunted replicants, Tyrell Corp has now been bought by wealthy financier Niander Wallace (Oscar winner Jared Leto) who now manufactures obedient replicants who don't question their purpose unlike their predecessors. However replicant Blade Runner 'K' (Ryan Gosling) soon begins to find bizarre clues that lead him to question whether he actually is a replicant or may have been human when he finds some bones at the sight of his most recent assignment. Soon the agent goes on the run in order to find the truth and it's a slow-boiling adventure that will make your mind race.Director Denis Villeneuve casts this film quite well especially with Ryan Gosling's portrayal of the new Blade Runner. Gosling's K is the character we stick with for the majority of the film's nearly three hour run-time and the actor is more than capable of commanding the screen and bringing a supposedly emotionless character to life. Gosling sticks to stone-faced expressions for the film as K is quickly revealed as a replicant and is extremely skilled at his profession (like Deckard before him), but when K finds the bones of a female replicant (a character from the original film) and as he probes further into the case K begins to question if he is actually human and Gosling's stony façade begins to crumble little by little. K begins to feel some form of love for his A.I. called Joi (Ana de Armas), he has a moment where he cries after finding a wooden horse that he remembered having as a child and even at the film's climax K smiles at Deckard and has a look of serenity after the old Blade Runner leaves K alone outside.Original star Harrison Ford doesn't appear until the film's final act which is beautifully built up. Not much is explained about Rick Deckard's thirty year absence except for hinting about his job being a main reason and who he took off with at the original film's conclusion. Thankfully not having the original film's star appear until near the end helps keep the emphasis on K and his mission.Sadly the most underused character in the film is the primary antagonist, Niander Wallace. Jared Leto brings his usual A-game to this blind mogul, but his screen-time is so limited that we never get to know much about Wallace other than his takeover of the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation and his mission to create replicants who won't question their lives like Roy Batty and company in the original 1982 film. What lead Wallace to create replicants who are subservient is never made clear, but it could be that Wallace is aware of what happened with Roy Batty and his group of rogue replicants in ""Blade Runner"". Leto's performance in the film is good as he has to use his voice and subtle body language as Niander is blind; his voice lilts from his trademark softness when close enough to another actor to a slightly raised when he enters a scene or gives a bit of a lecture. However Leto isn't wasted and makes the most of his brief screen-time and does leave an impression.The film's style is just as distinctive here as it was in the 1982 film. While Ridley Scott's visuals had a little more lighting in a mostly blackened landscape, Villeneuve's film is even bleaker as the cinematography (shot marvelously by Roger Deakins) with grays, dark yellow-gold and black for the shadows; the three leads, K, Rick Deckard and Niander Wallace are introduced in shadow when they each speak their first line of dialogue. With this sequel the new color palate makes the setting of 2049 L.A. even more dystopic than the 1982 film was and also capitalizes on technology that is now available in the film's time-line like the flying cars seen in the original, A.I. being a psychical presence (evidenced by Joi's hologram form) and of course our replicant hero. The film also has some subtle throwbacks to its predecessor like K eating Asian cuisine alone in a Chinatown-like district which is similar to Rick Deckard in the 1982 film. Another highlight of the film is the musical score (co-written by Oscar winner Hans Zimmer) which almost has a war drum feel to it as the pounding percussive vibrations are like a call to arms and echo heart-pounding anxiety.With a nearly 3 hour run-time the film does feel a bit tedious at certain points, but the action scenes help speed some of the slower sections up thanks to the relentless movement of characters and the driving musical score. The story is a potboiler of events; a slowly escalating chase between K and Wallace's replicant assistant, Love, as she is restless in her pursuit of our hero once he essentially goes AWOL. There are many emotional moments that might produce some tears or make you wring your hands.Go see this movie and experience a new adventure",Blade Runner 2049
276,austin0731,A visual masterpiece with a story line that is all too familiar,8,6 October 2017,"Firstly, Blade Runner 2049 is stunning to behold. The cinematography is insanely mesmerizing and leads to such intrigue that makes you just want to keep watching on. Blade Runner 2049 was a very interesting meditation of AI and technology and humanity, it does so very well. But I can't help but imagine how much better it would've been if these same ideas weren't explored in other recent works like 'Her' and 'Westworld'. To Blade runner's credit it was the original film that heavily influenced and inspired these works but I was just looking for something more and different to this highly overused genre. Nonetheless Blade Runner 2049 does it impeccably and probably is the best look and exploration into these ideas. Ryan Gosling does amazing work in this film and his role really allowed him to perform and to express these intense emotional scenes which is one major enjoyment of this film. Ana de Armas character I felt was very interesting I towards the end leaves audiences with an ironic twist that I enjoyed a lot. This was a very long film, almost 3 hours long and even though it feels like this lengthy epic I can't help but be slightly disappointed with the lack of action sequences. There surely was plenty of great ones but I felt that it needed a bit more of this sort of action flare to be a much more exciting watch. Now, I do understand the the story delivered was a subtle but mesmerising one but I still believe that a few climaxing fight scenes could really elevate this film especially because there is so much exposition and build up that essentially just ends up being rather flat. But, it cannot be denied that this is a great film and like the first is sure to spark controversy and discussion. So to summarise, Blade Runner 2049 was great, there were good performances and impeccable cinematography. However in terms of storytelling it somewhat seems like we've seen very similar stories before and even though there is an unexpected twist that adds some sort of a new flare to the genre ultimately I feel that I've seen similar things. I have to say I did go in with sky high expectations so unfortunately there were slight disappointments personally.",Blade Runner 2049
277,rlaine,Not quite sure what to make of Villeneuve,7,21 August 2018,"I was waiting for this movie, pretty much everything seemed to be in place for a good movie, even the ratings were good. When I finally got to see it I wasn't too thrilled.I've seen four movies from Villeneuve now, Prisoners, Enemy, Arrival and now this. Best of them have been Prisoners, which is a super solid blockbuster drama thriller with superb acting and Enemy, which is more of an indie curiosity. I wasn't blown away by Arrival like many, but thought it was just ""pseudo smart"" thinker sci-fi wrapped up in nice package. Bladerunner 2049 falls a bit into the same cathegory. Both seem to have deep characters and the slow pace makes the movies seem smart, but something lacks and especially Bladerunner feels shallow. Ryan Gosling is a good actor, but I felt zero connection to his character. Harrison Ford couldn't re-connect to his portrayal of Deckard either in my opinion. The characters just didn't work.The package is nice, no doubt about it, very very nice imagery. I may watch the movie again just for the pics, maybe I'll get deeper into the characters next time too. Overall I now feel that this was overly stylized and long where proper character direction was forgotten. It's kind of shame as Ryan Gosling pulls of very good scenes here and there, but they weren't enough to salvage the whole. Especially as the ending, in my opinion, isn't very rewarding.",Blade Runner 2049
278,RealLiveClaude,Villeneuve's great talent shows up here,8,24 August 2020,"Canada's Denis Villeneuve scores here with the original director Ridley Scott, telling the story on a dark and unstable world, where Humans exploit Replicants as slaves, however, one of them accomplished a ""miracle"" that might disturb mankind. It's up to K, a Blade Runner replicant, to discover the truth behind and undig the past...Stunningly visual, recreating the gloom world of the 1981 sci-fi classic.Villeneuve won his bet here, even with Ridley Scott's supervisition. Now let's see what he will accomplish with ""Dune"", who coincidentally was first directed by another cinema great, David Lynch...",Blade Runner 2049
279,asifahsankhan,Blade Runner 2049 molds an alternate dystopian future thirty years after the original classic,8,28 March 2018,"Being a fan of the original film I was not very optimistic that the sequel would be another cult classic. I also doubted that this would leave me feeling like I'd want to see it again just to understand what had gone on in its dark, mysterious and grim backdrop, as I had after seeing the original. Even if you have not seen the first film, movie goers can watch this and still understand what is happening and keep up with the storyline. It certainly is a joy to watch and well worth the 2 hours and 45 minutes viewing time.What began with Ridley Scott long ago has been vivified with new sharpness by director Denis Villeneuve. The last film I watched directed by Denis Villeneuve was the action-thriller 'Sicario' a film I enjoyed thoroughly and was visually excellent. Here he has directed a film that is just superb in every aspect from the acting to the visual effects and storyline, and leaves us thinking for days after watching the film. There is no doubt the cinematography and visual effects here are certainly draw dropping and stunningly gorgeous - there should be no doubt that Roger Deakins will be a shoo-in for an Oscar for best cinematography. I felt myself hooked from the get go even in scenes where there is no acting or storyline - just the backdrop and stunning visuals of the futuristic city make a truly awe-inspiring film.I don't want to get into any plot details at all and spoil the movie for you, certainly we would be here a long time and would reach no actual conclusion or 100% understanding of everything! However this is what made the first Blade Runner film what it was and again the director makes this a science fiction sequel that is also placed on that higher pedestal and would take some beating if there was ever anybody with the guts to make a third Blade Runner! Who knows, maybe in 30 years there will be another sequel!",Blade Runner 2049

282,brunovanael,Slow-mo,4,21 July 2019,"If this movie was just a tad slower it would come to a full stop. I'm sure the director had it's reasons to do this, as I have my reasons to rate only 4 stars. Maybe consider telling the story of your next film in only 1,5 hours?",Blade Runner 2049
283,daniewhite-1,Bland runner,4,17 December 2019,"Sadly this sequel is actually a deceitful attempt at rebooting a franchise for dollops of cash money. It doesn't in any satisfying way develop from the original; it is extremely poor as a sequel. Clearly this is actually the first installment of a legacy (money extraction job) trilogy of Blade Runner derived films. It's financial anemia will probably result in it remaining, entirely unjustifiably, as a direct delayed sequel to the original Blade Runner.I found the film to be utterly unconvincing as a return to the Blade Runner universe. Writing decisions regarding establishing a premise for this sequels events are awful...... Unbelievable. Unconvincing. Incredible. Unworthy.Do any of the actions and decisions which underpin this films plot scenario, and which orientate the behavior and opinions and ideas of the characters make any acceptable sense? To me, I can only say resoundingly 'no'.The obvious conclusion being that the utter deficiencies of the story treatment, when considering this film as a sequel to what has gone before, is because the actual writing concern is focused on the films that were intended to follow it.I deplore this kind of writing: if the first installment is bad or commercially unsuccessful then the emerging story strands and threads will never be seen; only an incoherent and unfulfilled singular film remains to testify to the creative intent.Over the course of a protracted and interminable run time this film deports itself upon a dystopian sci fi near future Earth tableaux of colour coordinated grunged physical decay of the lived in human environment and electric neo noir moral degradation of the living human ecosystem. Which, for a while, a short while, is visually and artistically interesting. But not for long enough. Eventually the production and artistic design follows the sound design and musical score into overstaying it's welcome.The best features of this film are twofold Imo:The first is the thematic interests which ARE directly referenced from the original; the memory/identity of individuals and individualism itself; the human-ness question on a world containing aware human inventions; human sexuality when it is fixated on, or by, 'artificial' partners.Indeed these thematic considerations are entirely in keeping with the wealth of literary sci fi that the original Blade Runner drew upon. Obviously the sci fi novella 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' for starters!
This is exemplified by the fact that, for me, the second most interesting character was a 'female' hologram.Secondly, and quite amazingly, the director manages to elicit the first actually good acting performance that I have enjoyed from Harrison Ford in several years (and a few reprisals of his most celebrated roles!) which genuinely surprised me. And thereby he provided the most interesting screen presence of the film for me.Ryan Gosling, however, plays a character so deliberately oblique and reserved that he reminds me throughout of his more effective turn in 'Drive'; in which film he illuminates his characters situation and orientation, whereas here he is unable to overcome the leaden weight slung onto his character by the requirements of a particularly severe version of the voluntary sacrificial martyr role. ""He grows to living and he is confirmed as living by his willingness to self sacrifice for others he cares for"". Fair play. But his willing sacrifice journey starts with him so stultifyingly inhibited, and for so long, that his unresponsive resting face is a useful visual metaphor for the whole stolid film.Of final interest, is that the (clearly never to be made) following film was probably shaping up to be a very heavily female lead film.....in the context of the desire to produce reproductive Androids by the antagonist the possible intended future shape of this franchise can probable be vaguely discerned.I partly enjoyed this film, but I was disappointed by the writing in all its facets and the shallowness of the visual, physical and audio production values when exposed to such a long run time......I give it a highish 4/10 to 5; but I regret deeply many of the creative decisions made and the business decisions that I feel underpinned the artistic direction.",Blade Runner 2049
284,dumsumdumfai,Subtleties of Emotions,9,14 February 2018,"There is a scene near the end, when K goes on his way after being informed that he is not who he think he is, to find Dekkard again. He stops in the middle and a gigantic hologram of Joi seemingly talking to him. He paused for a moment then went on his way. In that brief pause, to me, was a brief expression of realisation and sadness.
The realisation is that he was living a dream. Not a lie. But a dream that the world sold to him. But I am not sure I have that fully correct.This is a very thoughtful movie. It showed us what emotions everyone of us takes for granted, but ironically, place it onto the of makeup of a replicant. Dread, fear, loath, hope, anger, melancholy, grief, lost, happiness, frustration, confusion, elation, betrayal, loneliness ... you name it it's mostly there. Or at least the situation encountered presented these possible emotions. But how K is capable (or tried to) process these and express these is another question. More, what's more important , K the replicant is able to display that he is able to think on his own terms, make his own decisions, and ultimately find his own way. Which is more than I can say for some of us.And then, at the end, K makes a sacrifice - giving up the present for the future. The future of others. And this is significant - a magnanimous gesture to a degree. - and with his own existence no less. What a great movie.",Blade Runner 2049
285,carlos37andre,Gorgeous,10,9 January 2018,"WOW! I really don't know where to start here. This movie is stunning, an instantaneous classic. It's one of those films, that you really need to push yourself to find something ""bad"", or even ""not good"".The photography/cinematography of this movie is one of the most gorgeous that I ever see. Almost every frame here is amazing, beautiful, poetic. The scenario, the look, the production design, really, everything is fantastic. In my opinion, this is a movie that everyone who love cinema have to see. I was blown away through every minute of it.The soundtrack (as usual when you talk about Hans Zimmer's scores) is very raw and loud, alternating with some quite and calm moments, and, my God! It works wonderfully. I love the score, it's unique, simple, and powerful.Ryan Gosling's performance it's fantastic, in fact, ""K"" is probably one of my favorite character in recent films, he has so many layers, such a unique conflict (I LOVE everything on this part of the movie. He is such a broken character, just trying to find his place in the world, and OMG, his story through the movie is brilliant, and surprising), and a lot those things are amplified with Ryan's performance. It's powerful, engaging, and unique. In my point of view, he is doing a better job here than in La La Land.The last thing is the script, the story that the movie tells is at first odd, because at the end of it, you may think ""well, what about Wallace? The rebelion? What happens now?"", but, the movie is in fact just a story inside this big and dystopian futuristic world (like the original Blade Runner also was), at the end, this is the story that the movie wants to tell, the journey of K, trying to find his place in the world, but, at the end, realizing that maybe he doesn't have one as he thought he would have, he is not special, in fact, he is probably much fucked than the other replicants (he has real memories inside his head, and this isn't legal), this is sad, but at the same time also makes you sympathize more with the character, I simply love K.The movie also approach a lot of deep themes, that clearly are reflections of our own world. Do the replicants have rights? Is it right to do they in order to be slaves? Can they live a happy life? These are all very deep and complex questions, that add to the movie even more layers. The ""what is real?"" question that goes on and on throught the entire movie is also something that I love, and there also is in the original Blade Runner.In short, to me Blade Runner 2049 is pure art, an amazing film, that doesn't try to build a big, and new franchise from it, doesn't want to open a new world, and be something that everyone can see, and enjoy, in other words, he doesn't try to please everyone, it's a movie for film lovers that I think that everyone that loves cinema needs to see. It's one of the most beautiful, and well made movies that I ever see.",Blade Runner 2049
286,harrylosborne,"Good, nearly great",8,2 March 2021,"On paper, this should be my favourite film ever: once I'd heard Ryan Gosling with Denis Villenueve in a sci-fi film, backed by Roger Deakins on cinematography and Hans Zimmer doing music, what more could I really ask for?Unfortunately, Blade Runner 2049 still feels like it's missing a killer edge: comparing it to the almost incomparable Interstellar, a critical eye could have cut some weird dialogue and unnecessary scenes, sorted out the wobbly parts of the story and produced genuine magic. Ultimately, this makes the second Blade Runner film only a good watch, not a great one.As far as image and sound are concerned, there aren't many that can compare with this work: the environments are beautiful, detailed and full of moments to catch the eye. Even in the slightly more minimalist scenes, the quality employed makes them excellent to look at.The music can be described with the same superlatives, a dystopic, vibrating score that complements and dominates scenes brilliantly.Acting-wise, this is also a great watch. You can count Gosling's bad performances on one finger, and the supporting ensemble (de Armas, Wright, Leto, Bautista) are equally well-cast. What I think let me down was the story itself - not on its quality, but the ease with which one can comprehend it, alongside the questions left at the end.A lot of what is relevant is from the original Blade Runner that released almost 40 years ago, and this is a potential oversight in my mind. Further to this, some character motives are still not entirely clear by the conclusion; does this set up a sequel, or is this just laziness disguised as ""plot ambiguity""?These are, however, my own personal grievances: overall, Blade Runner 2049 is no doubt a solid film and worth a watch - I just don't think it is the world-beater I was hoping for.",Blade Runner 2049
287,PetarNeo,You'll be blown away,10,5 October 2017,"Remembering Ridley's masterpiece from 1982 coming into 2017 as new Blade Runner it had a potential that were in creation for 35 years and it was a magnificent picture that will shame even some of the best movies. Blade Runner 2049 tells a story of LAPD officer that is still picking up old Replicants and comes up to discovery of something greater. Words cant' describe feeling that Blade Runner constantly provides you with as it moves along expanding your understanding of Universe where it's placed. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Arrival) comes into this project as a refreshment and brings everything that is so special about his work into this movie with so powerful directing and bring's us to the edge. Alongside Roger Deakins as cinematographer with his ability to capture moments in such profound and beautiful way that will blow even hardest critiques away. Combination of them two and amazing screenplay that they were provided with created this new kind of movie that gives us new insight into film making and how good movies can be. From the start of year with such a great Logan that was dramatic enough to move us all but at the same time entertaining and now with this beautiful masterpiece that is Blade Runner 2049, movies started to adapt and evolve into a pictures that can in every moment be viewed as entertaining and imaginary as much as possible but with emotions and drama is just beautiful to watch. Without any doubt you may say that Blade Runner 2049 is the best movie of 2017 so far and there will be much trouble for movies to top this one. K/Joe (Ryan Gosling) was brought to play an amazing role and he gave an incredible performance proving himself to be a leading man that may lead to being one of the great actors of his class. Deckart (Harrison Ford) returned for his role and as usual he showed us that he can't be forgotten. As for music there is always Hans Zimmer with Benjamin Wallfisch that made a wonderful job in creating certain moods inside movie. You may say Blade Runner 2049 continues to be one of the movies that top it's predecessor and just take off into great universe that it may give. 4/4",Blade Runner 2049
288,Sonatine97,I Really Have Seen Things.....,9,17 March 2019,"Given the length of this film, coupled with the acclaimed visuals, I decided not to watch this at my local IMAX when it was released 2 years ago because I knew it would demand my complete and utter attention.As a consequence I waited a good year for the Blu Ray to be released and spent one evening totally absorbed and ""ready"" for the BR2049 experience via my TV and 7:1 sound system.During this time I had read many many reviews of the film, both from professional sources, fans and the general public. The consensus being that the film is indeed visually impressive, but was also slow, indulgent and not very involving. But then I recall reading similar reviews when the originally Blade Runner was released back in 1982, but that never deterred me from watching and later fully applauding such a marvelously constructed film on so many levels.So I watched 2049 at home, and yes, it blew me away visually! So much so that I completely lost track of time, and the 160 odd minutes felt more like 60 so engrossing was the film. However, when the final credits rolled I did think to myself: ""well what have I really learnt here? What was the plot about again?"" ""Who was that character and what did he/she do again?""So enraptured with the visual sfx and hardware that the story felt like an afterthought. So a week later I did the same again, but this time I wore wireless headphones rather than my sound system; and this time the story really began to make sense. I also realised how character-driven this film really is, and you really have to watch and rewatch the film to appreciate the nuances of each and every one of them.I have since watched the film from home at least 6 times, and I still learn something new. It is a truly amazing film, even if the plot isn't quite as complex as it tries to be; and I never really liked the fight sequence at the end of the film either.That said, Gosling, Ford,Armas,Hoeks and in particular director,Denis Villeneuve all do an exceptional job, as well as making BR2049 a worthy sequel to such a cult film.",Blade Runner 2049
289,Lewis_Heather787,One of the best sequels ever!,10,5 October 2017,"Personally I think the original Blade runner from 1982 is a really good film and I was interested to see what was in store for the sequel, especially considering the talent that is involved. Firstly Denis Villeneuve is quickly becoming one of the best directors around at the moment even before he had laid his hands on this film. From Prisoners to Arrival the man has a lot of talent and range in his filmmaking, and personally one of my favourite directors. Unfortunately though he hasn't made a good film............. He has made an absolutely fantastic film, this film blew me away from start to finish! The directing in this film is perfect, that is all you can say there is not a fault throughout. Villeneuve has had an incredibly difficult task in following in the footsteps of the first film that changed the film industry, but wow has he exceeded all expectations. Personally this is better than the original, even though this is nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it and not a second is wasted. Villeneuve is genius.Villeneuve is helped by the amazing cast that has been brought together, starting with the main character of Officer K played by Ryan Gosling. Gosling is tremendous in the role and is the emotional heart of the film, we get to see two sides of his character which really nicely done. One side is the blade runner, who is very professional, intelligent and plays by the book. Whilst the other side is a more gentle and relax side to the character when he is off duty at home with Ana de Armas' character. It is easy to see why Ryan Gosling is a lead actor and this performance only enhances his reputation as an actor. Harrison Ford once again is brilliant as Rick Deckard, he slips back into the shoes again like it was yesterday but also showing the age of the character, how he has matured.As well as Gosling, Ford is brilliant in every scene he is in, none of the cast miss a beat in this film all of them are incredibly performed. Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Jared Leto and Ana de Armas are all superb in the film however there is one more performance that matches Gosling and Fords. That performance is by Sylvia Hoeks who is amazing in this film, she is the true villain of the film and every scene that the character is in is a scene stealer. The marketing and trailers have done a brilliant job of portraying Jared Leto as the big bad guy, which he is to an extent but Sylvia Hoeks is such a more interesting and frightening character than his.The story of the film in fact is quite simple but has a smokescreen that layers the film is some many ways. There is a simple mystery/detective story at the heart of the film, however this then spreads into subject matters that are mind blowing and incredibly thought provoking. It is a very emotional film full of many personal struggles that are real easy to grasp a hold of and make you care as an audience member. The twists and turns in this film are an emotional roller coaster and some scenes are extremely poignant and heart breaking. All of the individual story threads throughout the film are woven together perfectly and create a story that is riveting from start to finish. Talking of the end of the film, it is extremely rewarding and is a brilliant emotional punch at the end with some more unanswered questions. Similarly to the original this film this does also bring up many more questions than it answers, let the debates begin and oh its much more than is Deckard a replicant this time around. Lets now bundle a few more positives of the film together, firstly the cinematography from the living legend that is Roger Deakins. If this man does not win an Oscar for this work then the system needs to be fixed because this is one of the best shot films that I have ever since. From start to finish this film is gorgeous to look at, sometimes the cinematography is simply outstanding you just want to pause the film and admire the visuals. Another positive is obviously the use of practical and visual effects, the world feels very much like the original film but shows age of the city really well. The blend of the practical and visual effects works really well with the incredible production design that is fantastic, it really shows that time, effort and care has been put into this film, truly amazing. Especially in the case of Ana de Armas' character the use of CGI is amazing and something that I have personally never seen before on screen, it was quite breath taking at first and was always amazing to look at. The final positive of the film is the score created by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, it takes the all the good qualities of the original score which is obviously easily recognisable and they add a new flavour to the mix that works perfectly. Even before the film has stated and the production studios titles are rolling you get the sense of the film even before it has stated because of the score, makes your hair stand on end.Overall this film is perfect 10 out of 10 or 100% for me this is everything that the Blade runner sequel needed to be and much much more. However this film will not be for everyone, this is not your typical Sci-fi film like a Star Wars or a Star Trek this is a different creature all together. This film may turn the general film audience away for things that are attempted and achieved in this film ,but this film definitely deserves everyone's time and attention. It is a masterpiece!",Blade Runner 2049
290,Dragonsouls,"A visual cinematic gem, but a jumbled story",8,5 October 2017,"Blade Runner is not only one of my favorite science fiction films of all time, it is one of my favorite films ever;-period. Blade Runner 2049 is a film that any Blade Runner fan would approve of. The atmosphere of the original film is matched in this one. The world is believable and feels lived in. Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. Cinematographer Roger Deakins makes sure to provide the surreal, dark, and gloomy ambiance that guarantees a brooding story.That being said, I will not go as far as saying it is superior to the original, though, it is superior aesthetically. This is pure sci-fi art. I'll even go as far as saying that even the cinematography exceeds that of the original, but the story was convoluted. As long as this film is, I still felt it could have used another 40 minutes or so because there was so many parts of the story that were undeveloped. The story felt like a collection of subplots, with no clearly defined central plot. There were certain parts of the story that I hoped Villeneuve would emphasize on a bit more;-mostly having to do with the Older Model Replicants.For those of you unfamiliar with the original film, Replicants, who are genetically modified humans, were built as slave laborers. But they were made too perfect and too human for their own good. ""More human than human,"" was the motto of the Tyrell corporation, the corporation of genetic designers that engineered the replicants. The replicants are designed to obey and never rebel or overcome the limits of their programming and if they should ever do so, a fail-safe is activated that would shorten their lifespan.As you know, it turned out that most of the Nexus 6 replicants were prone to rebelling and so all Nexus 6 replicants were to be hunted and killed by ""Blade Runners."" Blade Runners were Replicants themselves, except devoid of humanity and pure killing machines. They obeyed and were excellent at their jobs;--which was to kill or ""retire"" all Nexus 6 Replicants. In Blade Runner 2049 a new corporation figured out how to make new replicants that would obey and not rebel like the Nexus 6 Replicants. Any Nexus 6 replicants that remained in society, now called Older Models, were to be hunted and retired. But when ""Joe,"" a Blade Runner, played brilliantly by Ryan Gosling starts to experience breaks in his programming, he goes on a quest to find out if he is indeed like the Older Models, in that he is more human than the others of his kind. It turns out that some Older Model Replicants had the ability to reproduce naturally and so many of these Older Models hid their children in orphanages in order to keep them safe from being hunted by Blade Runners. Joe begins to think of himself as one of these children when he begins to suspect that his childhood memories were real and not implanted memories. His new mission causes him to lose his job as a Blade Runner and he risks being killed as he seeks to find out whether or not he had real parents. I always thought this whole idea of hunting Older Model replicants was allegorical of the holocaust, in that Jews were always prone to rebelling in religious scriptures.The film also picks up on the threads where Ridley Scott left, which is a monumental task, and it succeeds. The original 'Blade Runner' left us with many questions regarding Rachel and Roy, and it left us wondering if Rachel actually felt love for Deckard. And in 2049, we are presented with a similar question, from a holographic girlfriend that Joe is madly in love with;- and we are left wondering if the hologram was really in love with Joe?"", or was she just programmed to be in love?"", ""Is she capable of real emotions?"" I only wished we had more of the holographic girlfriend, and more of the Older Model rebellion against their makers, instead of focusing so much on Joe finding his parents, or Deckard reuniting with his replicant child. There were lots of subplots in this film, and in the end, I found it to be a bit anticlimactic.Blade Runner 2049 is fantastic movie nonetheless and a film I will watch again. But If you're hoping for action, be advised, that there is almost no action in this film, not until the last 15 minutes. Its a film that has more intellectual content than action so keep that in mind if you're hoping to see a popcorn film. This is not a popcorn film. Thank goodness for that!Final rating- 8/10 Beautiful. Haunting. Poignant.P.S. If you're not familiar with the original film, you might not enjoy this film as much.",Blade Runner 2049
291,Ziya90,"A fine effort, but it falls flat",6,30 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a movie which is stuck between being a low key art film and an entertaining blockbuster. It is dark, but also very colorful, it is moving filled with action, but also a slow paced, philosophical film, so this contrast itself disrupts the integrity of the movie. It tries to be sophisticated but in an artsy way. By the way, I have no idea, why some people almost force us to acclaim the movie and accept the fact that it is a masterpiece? No, it is not. However, probably the most disappointing element in the whole movie for me is Harrison Ford. We don't watch Deckart in this movie, we watch Harrison Ford like he just gets out of bed, wearing a t- shirt and comes to the movie set! I couldn't see any big difference between his character in Expendables 3 and here though. His ""updated"" or modernized character serves nostalgia, but he is just there.. Deckart and also Mr. Ford deserves a much better credit. I have mixed feelings about this movie, because it is not totally great as it is not a total failure. Opening scene is perfect, a cinematic triumph, Ryan Gosling shines and delivers perfectly, on the other hand, it is no more about replicants and a deadly pursuit, this sequel deals with some other subjects. This is good, because the movie isn't a bad copy of the original, at the same time, it is bad, because we move away from the ""essence"" or spirit of Blade Runner concept. There is also a sentimental relationship which I don't explain to avoid spoiler, but it is just out of place and it kills the atmosphere and the dark tone of the film. Roger Deakinks, the greatest cinematographer alive does a spectacular job here, but unfortunately, the movie cannot escape being a copy of Ghost in The Shell's live action version. Both movies have very similar visual images throughout. The final showdown is unfortunately pretty bland and boring instead of being epic. Jared Leto's anticipated and mysterious character is a blank shot in the film with almost zero motivation and purpose. Joi is a cry-baby and an uninteresting character with no sympathy. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 is a fine effort, but it is an ""ok"" film.",Blade Runner 2049
292,heisenberg12,"Well-Made, Thought Provoking, Imaginative, and Decent, But Something's Missing",6,31 January 2019,"I just watched this for the first time knowing nothing about it except who was in it and recalling the original I've only seen once.It's a well-made movie, but something was missing. In a movie like this, I want a strong lead actor, and Gosling came across too paper-thin and mediocre for me at key parts, almost like the material was a little too outside his intelligence or emotional depth. At times, he was good enough, but at others, not so much.On the other hand, Ford is the best actor in the film, and he really delivers and brings some depth and grittiness to the role, enhancing the film's quality from the moment he appears on through til the end.Overall, it gave me what I wanted, which was a movie that would take me into another world and be a challenge, immersive, and different, but most sci-fi films do that anyway. That being said, as far as Sci-Fi movies go, it was above average.I have to give a shout out mention to the dog, just because up until that scene late in the movie, there wasn't really too much to like about the movie outside of the visuals and some cool-looking effects.I just think it needed a better lead actor, which makes me long for the 70s and 80s, even the 90s, when most leading men for a film like this would be man's men, more manly, more charismatic, and be able to chisel the script down to become a star and own the film. Acting is a huge chunk of a movie. You can have great scenery, visuals (cinematography), music, and even a good supporting performance in a generally good concept, but the greatest movies of all-time usually have a stand-out leading performance from an actor or actress to go with it and make it stand out even more.Gosling doesn't totally fail, but he doesn't shine either, and that's a big problem in a movie that needed a stronger lead actor to make it more engaging, especially since the movie is close to three hours long. I might watch it again for the visuals and to try to decipher some information regarding the whole futuristic universe of replicants that I missed or couldn't follow very clearly to see if I would have enjoyed it more if I knew what was happening better at a certain scene, but I doubt it will make me like it more since the story wasn't anything particularly great, special, or moving.6.5/10",Blade Runner 2049
293,Christopher_Reid,"Bold, patient, moody - a worthy sequel",10,10 October 2017,"This is a great film, the visuals alone are incredible. But the thing that sets it apart is the same main quality that set Blade Runner (1982) apart - its unique mood. It's not uplifting but not depressing either. It cuts deeply, makes you feel something real. It isn't manipulating your emotions. It really captures that broken feeling of being a flawed human, looking for meaning in your life, lost in a dangerous world full of contradictions.The music is perfect for the movie. It's reminiscent of the Vangelis score for the original but doesn't just repeat it or rip it off. Its a continuation of the previous score, acknowledging it and moving on. A lot of it is loud rumbling or Inception-style BWAAARMS but it feels right. Then there are moments of near-silence. We hear things whirring past, slowly. As if some huge hovering spacecraft is visiting overhead. Is it part of the music or a physical sound the characters can hear? We can't tell, they blend together.There are interesting themes. It's a movie about cyborgs but delves into real questions about the nature of being human. How do we know if our memories are real? If there are gaps, does that mean that our memories are fake? Or do our emotions naturally cause gaps and inconsistencies anyway? If our memories have been implanted, then who are we really? Can our emotional reactions to fake memories be real and does that somehow validate them?Can you love a program? Can you bond with ""her"", become comfortable with each-other developing your own brand of playful banter, miss her when she's gone? Can love be reciprocated by a program? More importantly, does it even matter? Is loving someone really just a way to indirectly love ourselves?Will cyborgs ever be able to feel real emotions, reproduce, be whatever that combination of emotional/rational is that we call ""human""? Is human irrationality a strength or would cyborgs with absolute concentration be superior to humans in every way?The imagery is striking - like a collection of dystopian sci-fi paintings. A futuristic car, a man, a desolate landscape and a deadwood, for example. The film takes its time, letting the images wash over you. If you appreciate the style and the tone of the story appeals to you, you'll be in heaven. Others may start to get impatient. The movie isn't afraid to keep things hidden or vague from time to time, to allow rain to distort images, to dwell for a long time on a still frame before a character finally speaks. This movie exists outside the regular pace and tropes of what we've been trained to expect from typical movies. No one-liners, no obvious final looks or grimaces before cutting to the next scene. More like a loud, ominous build- up of music and then a bizarre panning shot into another scene - this movie has a vision.I saw Prisoners (2011) recently and was impressed by its patience, good acting and willingness to go into dark subject matter. I immediately wanted to know who the director was so I could see more - I could tell this wasn't a fluke, this was made by someone who knew what they were doing. There are too many pointless remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels these days. Numbers in titles become redundant, it's all about colons now. But when I found out Villeneuve was the director of Blade Runner 2049, I was suddenly very excited and this movie truly delivers. He's a serious contender for best current film-maker, second only to Nolan IMO.The acting is good. Ryan Gosling comes across as human but subdued. Not overly excited about the world he lives in or his job but with kindness in his eyes. We feel intimate with him but distant as well. He's doesn't really connect with his emotions. Maybe that's the point. We can sense they're there under the surface. It's certainly something I can relate to, feeling things but not always expressing it or understanding what they mean. Harrison Ford is given a dignified, meaningful role. He doesn't just have a cameo, nor is he merely lending his fame. This movie adds to Deckard's personal story and our fascination with it. Ana de Armas is equal parts sexy, playful, innocent and sensitive. I like when movies capture those universal, timeless, powerful moments in life - like looking into a beautiful girl's eyes the first time - it's a raw human experience and we are dwarfed by its power. In the movie, holographic attractive women the size of buildings tower over the people.Finally, the plot is intriguing if confusing at times. Its generally easy to follow but it can feel like some threads are missing at times. But the plot is secondary to the tone. I do like the mystery. We get to fill in many of the blanks for ourselves and its not too hard to do. It's more about understanding the characters, their motivations and how they're affected by the things they find out. Trying to piece the whole thing together seems unnecessary - there's no grand scheme, just individuals finding their way through the fog. Those expecting a completely coherent, dialogue-heavy movie will be disappointed.This must be a first. A sequel to a one-of-a-kind movie 35 years later which matches or even outdoes it. It respects the original but isn't bogged down in attempts to reference or imitate it. It continues the story in interesting ways. It captures something of that unique mood but in its own way. This is a movie that will age very well for a long time to come. Its contemplative, philosophical, ambiguous and enigmatic. It will only become more relevant as time goes on. But only time will tell quite how far ahead of its time it really is.",Blade Runner 2049
294,Sober-Friend,It Was 3 Hours Lon----------------g,3,31 December 2017,"The limited plot makes this follow up to ""Blade Runner"" seem endless. Now fanboys will thumbs down my review but I am correct. The film was too long for a plot that was razor thin. The same story could have been told had this filmed differently. The action moves slow and people seem to just go room to room in silence. Every scene starts in silence. In this film the Replicant's seem to know to pose a huge threat to mankind because they might be come life after all and thus eliminate the need for man! So goes the thinking of the people in charge. This film starts off with a discovery of bones that can be traced to Rachel. But what happened to her and Deckard? There is many theories why this film bomb. Mine is that the core fans of this film is over 40 and they hardly go to movies anymore. The running time is 3 Hours and that is too long for almost any film. The old film has a loyal following but it is small following. They are rabid but they are small in numbers.This film could have been better. If the pace of each scene was paced faster we would of gotten a much better film.",Blade Runner 2049
295,therskybznuiss,A worthy sequel but nowhere near as monumental as Blade Runner.,6,10 June 2021,"This movie provided closure I didn't ask for. One of the main thing's which is wrong with this film is that it panders to the modern trend of providing the audience (spoonfeeding, moreso) unnecessary closure - leaving no stone for the imagination to turn over, and more felt like a cash-in, sadly, than something which was organically -already- -there- in Ridley Scott (or whoever's mind)While not doing anything better than the first, it was still pretty good.",Blade Runner 2049
296,Jared_Andrews,A Visually Striking Sequel that is Well Worth Your Time,7,16 October 2017,"Visually the movie floored me. There's clearly so much intentionality and careful effort and planning that went into making that world. Villeneuve blended call backs to the original while still making this his own vision. I'll see anything he makes because I always feel like I'm in good hands with his movies, right from the opening scene.The music had a similar feel to the visuals in that they blended old and new. The iconic ""Tears in Rain"" melody receives a much-deserved return in a delightfully appropriate moment. I'll give the movie serious props for providing a comforting level of nostalgia without ever feeling that it pandered.Joi (Ana de Armas) and Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) were fantastic in their own very different ways. Joi, who plays Gosling's love interest of sorts, is essentially Samantha in Her, except she is a holographic projection instead of only a voice. Luv is Jared Leto's favorite replicant assistant and a total ice queen.Gosling was cool and dutiful, though kind of lifeless, which I guess was on purpose since he plays a replicant (or does he?) Juxtaposing him with Harrison Ford really made the subtleties of Ford's performance stand out in a way that was absent for Gosling. But Gosling was still very handsome and that worked well with the rest of the movie, which is striking and beautiful.Even though I didn't feel bored during any of the 164 minutes, I often felt like nothing was really happening. Even at the end I wondered what was the point. I know it was a character exploration of K (Gosling), like the first was of Deckard, and he clearly grew during the story. Still, the movie overall came across to me as heavy on striking visuals and light on substance.Perhaps I'm demanding too much. While I enjoyed the heck out of the movie and would watch it again in a second, it fell slightly short of the profound best picture level movie that I hoped it would be. Somewhere in the two hour and 44 minute runtime is a great two hour movie trying to emerge.All things considered, it's a pleasing complement to the original and is well worth a night in the theater.",Blade Runner 2049

298,TheOny13,Raises more questions than it answers!,5,31 December 2017,"And it's not like this movie is giving you any solid information so that you could try to answer them or make up your own plausible answer. It's just as vague and unnecessarily poetic sometimes just like its predecessor. Speaking of its predecessor... I was not a fan of blade runner when I first saw it (being about a month and a half ago, and I only watched it because of the hype this movie had here). What made me angry with both this movies is that they are ambiguous and vague just for the sake of it and so they raise more questions than they answers. In one interview Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford argued about Rick being a replicant or not. And it's weird to see a director unsure of what he's done in a movie that he'll argue with that character's actor over it's humanity. It just shows how stupid and without any intelligence the original movie was made. It would be stupid from me to point out again that that movie was made just to show the visuals... as if that's the most important thing in a movie. This movie is no exception from that and it's actually worst than the first one. I'll focus now on what went wrong and what was good in this movie.The story: is so sloppy that the first time I watched it, I fell asleep. So the way this movie is constructed is that scenes jump from one to the other without any real exposition as to why or how. The viewer is just supposed to go along with the story sometimes because there's no development towards some scenes or if it is, is JUST TOO SLOW! and you should be focused 200%, because again the movie is vague and you need to compensate that somehow. That's one other problem I had with this movie, it's way too slow. I understand that you need to show many beautifull scenes in order to make Roger Deakins win his first Oscar but that has nothing to do with how slow this movie is and why it is. Why? Because it's a Villeneuve movie and because it's a blade runner sequel. That's two times slower pace than usual and no wonder I fell asleep the first time. Then there are way too many ""how is this happening?"" or ""since when?"" moments or characters that sometimes do things without any purpose or reason for it and that really destroyed the enjoyment I might had with this movie. Let's not forget about the ambiguity and mystery this movie had and its numerous question... there are certain revelations that just raised more questions about that certain character or unexplained events from the past that are just mentioned at the beginning so you might know where in time you are with this movie's story but those mentions make all the events that happened between the original and this movie feel like what happened between episode VI and episode VII of star wars, to give you a strong resemblance.The characters: really no one stood out for me. And that's because there's little to no dialogue. That could work in a movie like ""Dunkirk"" where it's all about an evacuation and the urgency and realism of the situation, but here is a fictional world where you can be both realistic or artistic and entertaining, but the director chosed the first one. That's probably why this movie failed at box office too. Who would want to watch or rewatch a movie this slow and with so little motivation from its characters or little entertainment.Visuals: absolutely breathtaking and gorgeous to watch. The future displayed here is not how a future thought by a 2017 guy would look like but how the original blade runner's future would look like. The cinematography is one of the best ever and I guess no one can stop Roger Deakins from winning an oscar this year.Soundtrack: I uderstand why the director wanted a original-like music so asked Hans Zimmer to help... but this is one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard along with T2 Judgment Day. There is no musicality or depth to it. Neither is any suspense to it and it makes the movie experience all the more bad.Conclusion: Bad pacing, little dialogue, no strong character development of more characters (since this should be an epic), horrible soundtrack, great visuals, superb cinematography but overall very sloppy with it's storytelling which made me sleep, so I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. Only giving it a five for the visuals, cinematography and Ryan's performance, the rest is garbage. 5/10PS: This movie also tried to be the start of a universe of sequels and to give ideas and plots for other blade runner movies to come... but in doing so fails to be a proper sequel.",Blade Runner 2049

The sense of craft and detail that was put into this film is purley mesmerising and I find more ways to look at it the more times I watch it.Ryan Gosling plays a spectacular performance a Joe, a replicant trying to find the purpose of his existence as he spends his time walking through crowds, flying around in his space car, and going through countless psychological tests to prove that he is not insane. The production design in 2049 is visually stunning and beautifuly crafted creating an immersive world full of tone and atmosphere.The movie is stunningly and sharply shot with many awe inspiring sequences in a world that feels alive and breathing.

Joe played by Ryan Gosling is a replicant trying to find a place in the society he lives in with secrets to uncover about his past.The whole atmosphere this movie creates is bleak, pristine and stunning with production design so detailed and meticulously crafted with so much thought and planning going into the style and identity of the world of this movie. It has to be the best worldbuilding of 2017 in a movie that's for sure, and the musical score hits all the right emotional tones that the world of the movie conveys, bleak, cold, unforgiving. 2049 is a work of art in the Sci-Fi genre and is a new milestone in what can be done with it.

The film constantly gave you just enough information to know what was going on and keep you interested, but never enough to spell everything out for you .  I love that this film doesn't talk down to its viewers and it requires an active viewing experience. The setting and the futuristic world presenpresented in the film was amazing. The CGI was truly breathtaking and didn't feel fake at all.Acting wise Ryan Gosling did a outstanding job. He really did a great job playing the stoic silent role. He constantly used his mannerisms and his eyes to emote his feelings to add a extra dimension to his character.Despite how much I enjoyed the film it was not perfect. There were a few loose ends by the end of the film that would have been nice to tie up. I personally enjoyed the length of the movie and the pace, but I can see some viewers becoming overwhelmed.

304,ctowyi,Masterpiece,9,5 October 2017,"Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is a natural progression from the original film in terms of tone, themes and narrative. It deepens and expands on the original's narrative template to dizzying levels and in my book this is a much better film. From the opening establishing shots coupled with Hans Zimmer's intimidating score, I was awash in a bubble of déjà vu and 35 years whizzed by just like that (snap).There are many ways to tell a Blade Runner story – it could have gone by way of a regurgitation of the same old ideas or simply a re-boot, maxing out all the elements that made the original an enduring classic, but Blade Runner 2049 organically furthers narrative elements in the original to a deeper and philosophical place, making one contemplate over the theme of what makes a human being a human being.Like the original, there is a Neo noir element tied to the proceedings, and Ryan Gosling takes over where Harrison Ford left off. Gosling's deadpan expression is inscrutable, but behind the facade lies vulnerability. Some of the best scenes involved him and his virtual girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas oh la la). Watch out for a sex scene involving a surrogate that betters the one in Her (2013). It is at once scintillating and tender, but also profoundly sad.Harrison Ford returns in his original role and right now at his age he plays it marvellously, grumpy and tired, as it should be. His return doesn't feel like sentimental fan service and is woven neatly into the compelling narrative. Unlike, A Force Awakens, Ford does put in a shift.Narratively, Villeneuve doesn't pander or pays homage readily, meticulously forging his own mythology. Does Villeneuve even know how to make a bad movie? Characters speak little and mistrust in relationships is the glue that binds. The story feels opaque, filled with enigmas. The world is as bleak as the one 30 years ago, but updated to show a deeper sense of social disconnect. The CGI is outstanding – for nearly 3 hours, I was transported to a world that feels ""it could happen"". Cityscapes and landscapes, I have never seen before in all the countless sci-fi movies I have seen. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is breathtaking – please tell me this is his finally his year.The near 3-hour runtime does offer pacing problems, but I find it so easy to luxuriate in this emotionless dystopian world and look for fleeting instances of hope and glimpses of humanity. If there's another weakness, it is in the villainy of Niander Wallace's character, played by Jared Leto. He just isn't bad ass enough, but thankfully there's his bodyguard Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) who kicks ass.This is easily one of the year's best films. It aims for the sky and lands up in outer space, way beyond my wildest dreams. This needs to be experienced in IMAX and I don't even use the word ""seen"".",Blade Runner 2049
305,loco_73,How tedious and boring...please stop!,5,6 October 2017,"Saw this movie last night...and boy was it a tedious, overly long watch! This movie felt like having to do overtime at work. Dennis Villeneuve is a terrific director, loved ""Sicario"" and ""Arrival"", but this was a misfire in every possible way.An uninteresting story, the script is just muddled, highly convenient and disappointingly pedestrian. While the first movie retained, despite notable differences, the spirit and essence of Phillip K. Dick's amazing novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", ""Blade Runner 2049"" is at best an outlier, the story having been diluted to nothingness. Ryan Gosling is completely miscast in the role, as I knew he would, the guy just doesn't cut it. Harrison Ford just looked bored, bored with acting and bored having to revisit these characters he clearly doesn't want to but for the paycheque. Much like he was in ""The Force Awakens"".The problem is that Ford gets paid to look bored, whereas I have to pay to watch him looking bored. Maybe retirement is in order.Jared Leto is just awful and does nothing but look menacing or foreboding, the only expressions he seems capable of, either in the movies or music videos he makes. I am not exactly sure how and why this guy continues to be cast in anything these days.Losing Johann Johansson as the composer for the soundtrack was also big mistake. Hans Zimmer is usually a good, reliable, composer but when he misses, he misses big. The score is terrible. It's just noise...heavy, loud noise and when it isn't, it sounds like what would have happened if the soundtrack for ""Inception"" and Vangelis's original score for""Blade Runner"" had a baby.The use of 3D is also completely useless here and I think, it detracts from the movie and it's visual narrative. The visuals and special effects everybody seems to be applauding, were, I found, lost in an unnecessary murkiness and annoying, orange tinged twilight.Roger Deakin is one of the best cinematographers ever, and for example there were some shots in ""Sicario"" which took my breath away, not so in this movie. He missed the mark here. In ""Blade Runner 2049"", never for a moment did I experience the feeling of awe I did, and still do, when I watched the original, especially the opening scene. (Do a search on Syd Mead and then you will know why the original ""Blade Runner"" looked and felt the way it did.)The bit towards the end with Rachel and the use of the character and employment of the technology came off as cheap and an unnecessary add-on. Something like that worked very well in ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"", here it doesn't. It is not an awful movie, or one of those ""the worst I've seen"" types, but it cannot hold a candle to the original on any account. It is too long, too boring for long stretches and in the end it just left me with a headache as well as mostly indifferent.I never wanted a sequel for ""Blade Runner"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" proves why.",Blade Runner 2049
306,SPZMaxinema,"Mostly boring, only a few things saved this movie for me.",7,6 September 2021,"Aside from the special effects and CGI, Harrison Ford, and some of the fight scenes, this movie is mostly very slow and boring.

307,totalovrdose,Breathtaking - A Near Perfect Cinematic Achievement,10,5 October 2017,"I am going to offend when I write how the original Blade Runner left me disappointed. By the end, there were too many unanswered questions for me not to feel anything but jaded. Blade Runner 2049 on the other hand, left me riveted. Ryan Gosling is not exactly synonymous with action films, though from the opening scene, he proves himself to be a powerful, heroic figure. Unlike the original, which toyed with the idea that Deckard was a replicant, 2049 adamantly admits to K's (Gosling) status almost immediately. Though I could criticise Blade Runner 2049 for its anti-climatic finish, it does three things brilliantly. First, the film answers the burning questions the original refused to dignify. Secondly, the film captures the essence of the original's universe. The world feels lived in; where technology and the metal skeletons of architecture blend; where clear demographics and political allegiances exist, an 'us versus them' feel emerging that mirrors the world we live in today. Thirdly, the film immerses the viewer instantly with not just the mystery of its story, but with its score. The sound is thunderous and impactful, exploding across the screen with tremendous effect, while the raw, visceral musical score accompanies this perfectly, serenading us with themes that don't just resemble, in part, the original, but a unique cyber punk style too.The effects are phenomenal, from the fluctuating holographic interfaces, to the flying cars; from the impressive explosions to the dystopian backwaters which surround the spurring metropolis; the effects satisfyingly developing an imperfect future. Although the effects are a necessity in Blade Runner 2049, never does the feature become over-reliant on them, the film's leads been the driving force of this cinematic achievement.The film's introduction sees K completing his manhunt of Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), an older model replicant, who has found some semblance of peace. K however finds himself caught up in an even bigger investigation, the ramifications of which could be dire, his lieutenant, Joshi (portrayed effectively by Robin Wright), spurring her infallible asset on. It is here we are introduced to Jared Leto's Niander Wallace, the mastermind behind the new generation replicants. Despite been in only a few scenes, his calculated malice sends cold tones throughout the feature, and is further delivered upon by his assistant, Luv (Sylvia Hoecks), whose lack of decency for human life is frighteningly human.Much like the original, Blade Runner 2049 questions what makes us human, and why in the future we would attempt to differentiate ourselves from our creation, when they begin to adopt our traits. Though Gosling's K appears robotic in his movements at times, in his relationships, especially that with virtual intelligence Joi (the lovely Ana De Armas), we witness how human he truly is, their romance been as inventive as it is beautiful. The film takes itself very seriously when demonstrating the poignancy of machines sharing a connection, though the themes of slavery and child-labour, despite still been major topics today, are only briefly discussed.Acting greats like the always entertaining Lenny James, Hiam Abbas, and Edward James Olmos (reprising his role from the original) briefly appear, and despite portraying characters with barely enough screen time to be truly appreciated, their performances nonetheless propel the narrative forward. Furthermore, though Harrison Ford receives second billing, it is not until much later into the film that we are blessed by his on screen presence, his version of Deckard retaining the old 'shoot first ask questions later' routine of his character, yet being deeply melancholic and sympathetic. Blade Runner 2049 is at its core, a futuristic romance, about the importance of freedom, sacrifice and family; a film that gives me hope for the future of Hollywood. This feature is possibly the best film I have seen this year, Denis Vileneuve again proving himself to be an outstanding director.",Blade Runner 2049
308,tigerfish50,A Pedestrian Labyrinth,6,15 October 2017,"There's no disputing 'Blade Runner 2049' looks good - the vast decaying LA megalopolis, its futuristic interiors and surrounding desert wasteland are all portrayed with beautiful cinematography - but unfortunately the narrative arc doesn't match up to the scenery.This sequel starts off in familiar territory - just like detective Rick Deckard in the original movie, a replicant police officer called 'K' is tasked with terminating unreliable earlier models. In the film's opening sequence he's hunting down a target, and during the operation K comes across evidence of the birth of a replicant child. He's soon reassigned to find this offspring, and K's new mission obliges him to do a lot of zigzagging around the dystopian landscape in his flying police cruiser. He asks awkward questions of important people, and delves into the archives of secretive institutions. Occasionally K stops by his cramped apartment where he carries on an unsatisfying love affair with his hologram girlfriend. The detective work seems unnecessarily opaque and long-winded, even though it's punctuated by some sporadic violence, and clues eventually lead to an overwrought cliffhanger climax. The lasting impression - despite the film's visual impact, blockbuster budget and continuing references to the Theseus myth - is that it's all a bit underwhelming.",Blade Runner 2049
309,Padreviews,Not the classic the original has become sadly 5.5/10,6,23 October 2017,"Not a bad film , just not a great film , was it made for art or money ? I'd say definitely the latter . It could have and should have been so much better . But rarely are reboots a patch on the original they're simply cashcows and they know die hard fans will go and see them . The best thing about the film was the new reclining seats at the Odeon Taunton but a hefty £4 premium means the film has to be exceptional to make it worth it. This wasn't . It was too long , the first 30 minutes were brilliant and 8/10 but then it went downhill . Ryan Gosling is brilliant in the starring role but sadly Harrison Ford ( here comes the backlash from fans ) was below par and looked so tired in his role . The glamour came from humanoid cyborg to which the mystery was surrounded . The CGI wasn't as groundbreaking as the original . But it kept to its film noir roots but it just simply wasn't as good as hoped and it was far too long to be enjoyable . Pad.A 5.5/10",Blade Runner 2049
310,hunter-friesen,"Blade Runner 2049 is a remarkable sequel, furthering Denis Villenueve's status as one of Hollywood's leading visionary directors",8,22 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a slow and complex film that yet again tackles what it means to be human, lifting the Blade Runner series to new heights. The plot is new and doesn't follow the usual sequel tropes, the acting is superb, and the production is first class. Denis Villeneuve has performed the rare feat of making a worthy sequel to a beloved and influential cult classic. The plot of Blade Runner 2049 takes its time to unravel and demands strict focus to fully grasp every detail in order to piece the puzzle together. In the year, you guessed it, 2049, Officer K tracks down the replicant Sapper Morton, who is living out his life as a lonely farmer. While investigating the farm he finds a box with the skeleton of a woman. After examining the remains, we find out the woman died during childbirth and was a replicant. Replicants being able to have children wasn't considered possible and could potentially create a widespread panic in the population. K is sent on a hunt to find and eliminate the replicant child before anyone else finds out. His journey leads him to meet with old and new faces such as the enigmatic replicant creator Neander Wallace and retired blade runner Rick Deckard.The story plays out almost like procedural crime drama but is way better than anything you would find on television. We follow Officer K as he uses his detective skills and clues to figure out the history of the replicant child. We take breaks in between to see inside his private life and how his life experiences have made him who he is. The one problem with the plot is the pacing for the final third of the film. The film carries a 163 runtime and slowly feeds you information and builds the plot for the first two hours. It then feels like the final act comes too quick and leaves too early for us to fully comprehend and appreciate what is going on.Just like the first Blade Runner, this film questions the idea of what it means to be human. We as humans in the real world see man as rational and capable of making the right decisions for the common good. In the film we see man coexisting with replicants, with some replicants exhibiting more human traits than the actual humans. You feel more for them than our own kind because of the situation they are forced into and how they must deal with their short and hopeless lives. Fans and appreciators of the original will certainly enjoy this sequel as it dives deeper into the dystopian future and builds upon the ideas Ridley Scott proposed to us way back in 1982. Denis Villeneuve continues this question flawlessly and keeps the mystery and intrigue flying the whole way. You can feel the influences and connection between Villeneuve's last film Arrival as we follow the main character as they struggle to grasp and understand the different world around them.The biggest and best thing about this film is the masterful cinematography done by the legendary Roger Deakins. This is the third collaboration between Deakins and Villeneuve after Sicario and Arrival. Each shot is beautifully crafted and contains a whole story about the world we see. Seeing this film in IMAX will definitely be worth your time and money. The most memorable shot comes when K is slowly walking through the red desert of Las Vegas and we see the destruction and unknown landscape he is entering. Deakins will definitely receive an Oscar nomination (would be his fourteenth!) for his work and be in contention for his first statue. Complementing the breathtaking visuals is the amazing score done by Jóhann Jóhannsson, Hans Zimmer, and Benjamin Wallfisch. These three composers have created a soundtrack that not only perfectly fits the futuristic setting, but also philosophical ideas presented during the film. The music is made for you to think about the world we live in and the things surrounding us. The highlight of the soundtrack also comes from the looming desert walk scene, where a string of booming noises disorients us from the world and we are exploring with fear and intrigue just like K. The acting in this film is remarkable and outperforms almost every action blockbuster. Ryan Gosling gives a career-best as Officer K, a character having trouble figuring out his place in the world and coming grips with his investigation. His performance here is comparable to his character in Drive, brooding and mysterious, but still, a very interesting character that we enjoy watching. While Deckard isn't as interesting as Officer K, Harrison Ford does a solid job as a supporting character bridging the gap between the two films. Jared Leto is also great as the dark Neander Wallace. He barely gets any screen time but leaves a great impression for his role in the story. Great supporting performances also come from Robin Wright, Sylvia Hoeks, and Ana de Armas. Blade Runner 2049 is an excellent sequel to a cult classic that carries the story forward while keeping the same ideas and themes fresh and exciting. This film should be experienced and appreciated just as high as the original. Villeneuve has entered the highest realm of great 21st century directors alongside Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, and other visionaries.",Blade Runner 2049
311,keelhaul-80856,"Good film, but lacks greatness.",7,5 April 2018,"This film was very interesting, exploring the existential questions and dilemmas of the first one. It does a lot of things right, but it also left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. The acting and run time are a bit slow, as noted by others. The film really could have been condensed to about 2 hours, with a little more action or emotional depth, instead of long panning scenes for the sake of trying to appear thoughtful or true to the original. The meeting between Gosling and Ford near the end felt forced and the fight scene with them is ridiculous, as is the part where they leave Gosling alive and take Ford away. Gosling's female boss is very bland and flat, as if she is more of a replicant than anyone else in the film. Leto was interesting, but then the whole plot ends with the focus on his female lackey, which deflated this one compared to the awesome Rutger Hauer character and Tyrell in the original. Even the opening scene with Dave Bautista was a bit stupid, and very risky for Gosling to undertake in such a dumb manner. The plot is interesting, and genuinely caught me off guard with some plot twists, but it is lacking a few things that would have sealed the deal for true greatness and vision.",Blade Runner 2049

313,adrian-43767,A relatively 'happy' ending to a depressing 163' of film,6,5 October 2017,"BLADE RUNNER 2049's qualities are the acting, direction, unremittingly bleak photography, great computer-generated effects, and female beauty to die for.The film's main weakness is the plot, which rambles on and on and on. Yes, androids want to be more than electric sheep, that was obvious to Philip K. Dick when he wrote the novel that became the BLADE RUNNER of 1982. But Gosling's character's odyssey to track down Deckard (Harrison Ford), supposing that he is his father, is just too far- fetched to make any real sense, even if one appreciates that the android desperately wishes to feel human emotions. The memorable sequences are Gosling's lovemaking with a melding of two women, and Sean Young's brief return to the screen in all her beauty. The disappointing sequence is the climax underwater: In such a polluted world, you'd expect that water to kill you if you came into contact with it. Surviving all that time while fighting killing machines is just too improbable.Robin Wright's talent is sadly underused and the presence of a dog is truly mystifying - unless it, too, is an electric sheep.By the end of it, there was a bittersweet reunion between Deckard and his daughter, making for a relatively ""happy"", if rather pointless, ending. Sadly, by then my life was 163' shorter with very little to show for it. Disappointing 6/10.",Blade Runner 2049
314,asage19,Excellent,10,29 May 2020,"This is Ryan Gosling's movie. He is suberb. Ana de Armas is so good in her role. The scene between these two at the end of the movie is startlingly good watching. I didn't find Jared Leto convincing; I can't find an explanation for how much it seemed to me that he was in a different movie. I expect, given that I've read that Denis Villeneuve was very detailed in his instructions to the cast members, that this might be on him :\ Harrison Ford was fun to watch, a pleasure to watch, because he was actually acting, and not being Harrison Ford ;> Big shout-out to Dave Bautista :D Another actor I've been watching lately. He's great, intelligent, always believable. He's well on his way to being a really good character actor.
I've put off watching this film for a long time, only recording it because I felt I should, that it would be *good* for me to watch it. I finally watched it and am blown away. It's so perfect, so well-acted, put together so carefully and sensitively...
Loved the soundtrack - it's never intrusive, always there as part of the acting, almost? Some of the songs and 'bits' of music are amusing, but never gratuitous (I'm thinking the Las Vegas scenes.)
I'm becoming a big fan of Denis Villeneuve, having seen a couple of his other films, and truly hope that he will direct the next Blade Runner sequel, if there is one.
I've seen Blade Runner, and feel that this movie towers above the original. I feel that the original was so much a movie driven by Hollywood values, star actor values, values of its audience at the time. Maybe it was too 'self-conscious'? This sequel is its own movie, with its own story, it must have the previous story to make sense, but stands on its own, and is true to itself. It doesn't ever feel like it's giving a nod-and-a-wink to the audience.
Something I really liked about this movie is the snow :) I'm Canadian - snow in movies and in literature was central to my education. The scene at the end is beautiful. Even more, is how he put his face up to the sky, to the snowflakes, as we all do. A very human thing.",Blade Runner 2049

It has it's moments, but on the long way to the end it's to long-winded. It sure is a good movie for having a nap with special sounds in background. But i feel, the whole storie is dull. I thought that when the first came out and it's like a dejavu, feeling the same by looking the following part. Beside the dull story, there are logical errors, one can't fail to see. I'm glad to not have spent time in cinema. I just rented it from Amazon and that's enough for me. If there was an urgent flow in the plot, i could turn a blind eye. But so I hold the opinion, that ""Blade Runner 2049"" is just over-rated. This should be nearly as good as ""Alien"", ""Interstellar"", ""2001""? No, sure not! :(",Blade Runner 2049

319,Radu_A,"A ""keep it to the essential"" review",7,5 October 2017,"Is this a worthy sequel to one of the greatest films ever made? Yes.Does it achieve or surpass the brilliance of the original? No.Are there surprises compared to your usual Hollywood blockbuster? Yes.Are there surprises comparable to Villeneuve's Francophone films? No.Will this likely win Academy Awards for F/X, cinematography and camera? Yes.Will this likely win Academy Awards for any of the actors? No. Liev Schreiber and Robin Wright make a lot out of very little though.Why will some people love this movie? The optics. The sound effects. Nostalgia. There's nothing else worth watching on the big screen - don't wait to watch this at home, you'll probably be disappointed.Why will some people loathe this movie? The story makes very little sense. The plot holes are as deep as the Grand Canyon. It drags in the middle for about 30 minutes. The villains are comic book material. From a female perspective the women in here may seem written awkwardly.In short: It's definitely worth seeing, but not an epiphany. There's a chance for another sequel, but I hope they'll give it a pass.",Blade Runner 2049
320,gcsman,Science fiction film as art,9,11 October 2017,"In the last few years we've been treated to a string of superb sf films that have totally penetrated into the mainstream: Inception, Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian, Arrival, and now Blade Runner 2049. (Notice that two of these are by Christopher Nolan, and two by Denis Villeneuve. No coincidence!) These are exceptional -- not just the idea-driven stories that good sf films usually are, but high-production works with first rate actors that in some cases are nothing less than works of art.Blade Runner 2049 fits ""work of art"" very well indeed. For me the essence of it was not the story line so much as the ambiance of this doomed world and its visual presentation. The original Blade Runner (1982) had the same emphasis, but this new one spends more time away from the ugly, crowded ground-level city streets, in favor of bleak landscapes and overwhelming Metropolis-style architecture that the shadowy controllers operate from.And bleak it certainly is. The city-scapes and landscapes are about as dystopian as you can imagine from beginning to end: supremely ugly ruined factories, bare fogbound lands with dead trees, red windswept deserts. The only change of pace is not much help: geometrically clean and superficially beautiful interiors where this society's rulers carry out their genetic programming with the Replicants that they hope will save the future. A single scene of a sunlit green forest turns out, agonizingly, to be a simulation, and it just drives home the point that simple greens and blues are almost totally absent from the color palette of this movie.The music score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch is similarly monumental. Landscape scenes in which nothing is really happening are accompanied by massive, foreboding music that becomes a feature in itself. This reminded me a bit of Arrival, where Villeneuve uses Johan Johanssen's score for similar purposes. (A surprisingly fun contrast to this persistently grim mood is offered, oddly enough, by the ring tone on K's phone, which we hear several times when someone is trying to contact him. It's a cheerful little six-note tune that is from Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"" -- the start of the theme for the young boy Peter. What that means, I don't know. Maybe it's what Villeneuve uses for his phone and it's just a little inside joke??) Parts of this film are like Arrival, parts of it like 2001: A Space Odyssey, other parts like Interstellar (all good comparisons). But above all, it's most like its own predecessor, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. In that sense it's not the totally original vision that the first film was, but it's a worthy successor to a classic.I'm rating this ""just"" 9 out of 10 because I thought the plot line was just a bit unclear at times -- why were the characters doing what they were doing and how did that fit in with what happened earlier? Moment by moment the action holds your attention but it was the longer arc that was a bit muddy. Maybe it will clear up with a second viewing. Still, that gives you lots to talk about later, which a good piece of art ought to.",Blade Runner 2049
321,PotassiumMan,"Brooding, visually rich sequel diluted somewhat by running time",8,15 October 2017,"The long-anticipated sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic is definitely something you should see in theaters. The visual effects and cinematography alone are enough to make this a movie event that should be watched on the big screen to get the full effect. The film's storyline is slowly hashed out in a smoke cloud of mystery, futuristic dark humor and dystopian milieu. It's Villeneuve's admirable achievement and a worthy sequel.Ryan Gosling is solid as a latter-day Blade Runner, whose job is to hunt for a diminishing number of replicants from an earlier era. Gosling's cop begins to struggle with the question of his own identity and ponders whether the memories in his head are authentic or artificial implants. Ana de Armas is captivating as his artificial flame, who takes on many different forms. Robin Wright is sharp in a smallish role as Gosling's iron-willed superior. Jaret Leto is well-utilized as a creepy industrialist whose bleak vision for society is being implemented. Sylvia Hoecks is effectively menacing as Leto's ruthless enforcer. Unfortunately, the film could have used a bit more of Harrison Ford, who returns to his role as Rick Deckard, Gosling's predecessor from 30 years back. Ford's work in this film amounts to little better than a cameo appearance. But thankfully, Gosling and everyone else mostly fill the void.The film's emotional core is real but very cold and deeply embedded. And some more editing probably would have helped. Although there is a storyline here that you do care about, the film's aloof, almost Lynchian sense of mystery keeps the viewer at a distance for a long stretch. There is a deliberate build-up in the labyrinthine investigation through which Gosling pieces together a macro scale of criminal activity. Villeneuve is able to sustain the film's gripping crescendo just enough that the film reaches a well-executed, well-earned catharsis. Strongly recommended.",Blade Runner 2049
322,Tehmeh,Villeneuve did it. He actually did it.,10,6 October 2017,"Imagine a bunch of corporate hacks making a sequel to Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"". Imagine the horrible dialogue, lack of expression, pointless action, telegraphed plot, soulless acting, generic score with mind-numbing pop songs, quick cuts, forced political messages, setting things up for another sequel...imagine those boxes being ticked in a boardroom, in order to make something truly meaningless and offensive to any sentient being. This is not it.""Blade Runner 2049"" is fantastic. In a time where every movie franchise is butchered in the name of lowest common denominator in an effort to turn them into brands only, this is almost too good to be true.I'll describe this movie without spoilers. It's not an action movie. It's slow and takes its time. It isn't trying to cynically impress you. It's not interested in making the same movie again but it's still very familiar. It's not about grand happenings, it's surprisingly confined. It honors the original, works very well with it and also without it. It respects its audience enough. It's a thematic, long ride full of atmosphere, making you feel like you're in a trance. It downplays blunt-force emotional drama almost to the point of disconnect, but it really does have a heart. For a sequel that never should have been made, there's something genuine about this film.I noticed something great in almost every scene: they're really intimate and tight. Most of the time we have only one or two people sharing a scene, and they're shot in a very personal way, elevating the themes. The dystopian world is just the background for the story, not the whole point of it. When a movie makes you think about humanity, individuality and soul, you want to have those moments without distractions and feel the scenes no matter what. ""2049"" absolutely nails this and the actors can really focus on their job and immerse the audience. The amount of restraint shown throughout this movie is remarkable. Less is indeed more. Technically, ""2049"" is a triumph. Roger Deakins is a master of his craft. Yes, you get plenty of ""Blade Runner shots"" where light, shadows and reflections dance beautifully, but this movie isn't content in only mimicking the original. You'll see so much wonderful stuff here that film school students will have plenty of material for years to come. Cinematography, sets, designs, editing and effects are all superb and most of all elevate the story and its themes. It's an absolute treat to the eyes, it's majestic. Hats off to the entire production crew.It's easy on the ears too. Vangelis composed a superior score before, and while I prefer a more melodic approach in general, the music here is a vital part of the experience. That powerful Zimmer noise gives us some ""oomph"" while the dreamy synths create an atmosphere. I'm not sure if it works outside the imagery, but it does capture some of the Vangelis mood without losing all personality. It's not afraid to stop either; silence is used effectively, and it has an impact every time. Let's not forget about the sound department - they deserve a round of applause. Whatever you hear is carefully thought out, mixed and produced. And once again it's not there to show off, it's there for a reason. The cast was great. Gosling was a perfect fit and so much better than I hoped, Ana de Armas was a beautiful revelation (as was her character), and Harrison Ford clearly cared about his role. Jared Leto was a bit of a distraction for me, but I fully acknowledge that's my own fault: I have a habit of seeing Leto instead of a character. I snapped out of it soon though, and he did a good job. I liked Sylvia Hoeks, and even though Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis and Carla Juri also distracted me at first for whatever reason, they were great too. Everyone (including Dave Bautista) delivered, even those with small parts. I left out some names because I consider them spoilers.Director Villeneuve, writers Fancher (welcome back sir!) + Scott + Green, cinematographer Deakins, the cast and the production crew pulled it off. ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a product of love and far better than it has any right to be. It works so well as a sequel and somehow still stands on its own legs. It made me appreciate the original ""Blade Runner"" even more in the process, and helped me to make peace with some of my old gripes about it. If ""2049"" handled some of the exposition (and narrative flow) a little better and had a few more happy accidents here and there, I'd give this a 10 in a heartbeat. Perhaps - in time - I will.""Blade Runner 2049"" is expertly crafted and a wonderful film. I can't believe it exists, because just like the original, it's not a product of its time and it will be shunned by many. It's not quite art-house, but has a huge artistic quality to it. It allows you to ponder, sink deep into a mood and soak in every bit of the atmosphere. It's amazing how many things it got right, considering it's a sequel to one of the most loved movies of all time. It could've gone wrong in so many ways. It's got some rough edges and it isn't wholly original (and at times doesn't even want to be), but it's still true cinema and definitely worth seeing in a theater. My theater experience was great: charmingly small room, not too crowded, everyone was quiet, volume was up high. And when it ended, most of us just sat there quietly, still feeling that wonderful trance.Is it better than the original? Doesn't matter, it's not even interested in such vain goals. If you're new to these movies, I envy you. You get to experience these masterful films for the first time.",Blade Runner 2049
323,steve-667-10190,I have to see it twice. No spoilers,7,17 October 2017,"My all time favorite movie is Blade Runner. My all time favorite bad guy (not really a bad guy) is Roy Batty. The words, the mood, Vangelis' music, the look of that movie was unique and I think, a masterpiece. Ridley's sequels have been a disaster to my mind and when I heard this sequel was to be made I had mixed feelings. 'Don't screw this up like you did the others' I thought. Then I learned Scott wasn't to direct, I thought,hmm, a fan might do more justice to a Blade Runner sequel than the original director. Look what Peter Jackson (a massive fan) did with LOTR. Plus the pressure would be on from devoted fans. I was hopeful but like I said, my feelings were mixed. You know what, they still are. I went from bored to stirred, from impressed to depressed - got home, gave the movie a 7 and then regretted it.I thought; a movie should play your emotions and it did but most of them were bad. I felt that the depicted future of 2049 was too ruined. It's so bad that it shouldn't support life and I can't imagine what sort of economy could fund the technology on show.So, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go see it again. The effort they put in (and it's obvious they tried hard) is worthy of a more thoughtful analysis than what I dispensed when I gave it a 7. It's one of those movies that, the more you think back on, the better you remember it. So I'm heading back and you should too.",Blade Runner 2049
324,AnishMisra,Blade Runner 2049 review,9,17 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a film directed by Denis Villeneuve. I had watched the 1982 film in January and remember loving the film. It was a different kind of sci-fi film that I had seen. Watching the teasers and the trailers also excited me a lot but I had a certain fear for this version. But all of that went away as the first shot came in.Plot: In 2049, LAPD Blade Runner K discovers some truths regarding replicants that lead him to Rick Deckard.Story and direction: The fear I had that this film would commercialize every thing that made the 1982 film so distinct was all removed as I saw the opening shot of this film. This film is dark and not pleasant in any way. The production design was so authentic. I could go on with that. The VFX for this film were so seamless. I felt so associated with the characters of this film. Normally for an R rated film which involves quite a lot of violence the blood is normally CG-ed which takes off your experience. But this film didn't do that considering it had quite a budget for it ($150 million).Camera Work is top notch. All the scenes are filmed with so much perfection that it was difficult to differentiate whether it was filmed on set or natural environment. The score - Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch - deserve a clap from my side. To integrate Vangelis' wonderful score of the film that was famous in 1982 along with an existing modern score is not an easy task. And finally, the story. Bringing Hampton Fancher (the original writer) along with Micheal Green (Logan) was a great job done. The themes that are dealt in this film are very rich and deep. Many people would be having the issue of connecting with the film being 163 minutes long. But the story was so much engrossing that I couldn't take off my eyes from the screen for a minute. Denis Villeneuve has assembled such a talented crew, so how it's possible that this film will not be top notch!!!! I happen to watch this film in 3D (my first R Rated film in this format). And it was an other worldly experience for me. The fault for this film is very minute for me, Harrison Ford. I hated the amount of screen time he got for this film. If you put a person on a poster, put him for the right amount in the film too!!!!!! Performances: Ryan Gosling stealed the show for me. His performance as K, was fabulous. I could get associated with his character in the film. Harrison Ford shined through his role considering the screen time he got. Jared Leto was quite the character. His eyes (the white contact lenses) got me chills. Ana De Armas was also good as Joi. Robin Wright was also great as the Lieutenant. Sylvia Hoeks was ruthless in her role and carried it effortlessly. It was good to see Edward James Olmos too. A special mention to Dave Bautista. I saw him for the first time in that kind of role and I was impressed.Favorite Scene: I guess the scene where Deckard hits K in a dance bar that's fully vacant and stops suddenly saying that the Elvis Presley song that is playing is favorite. We too have a Elvis Presley hologram. This scene got many laughs from my side. And was a standout because it was the only of the few comic scenes in the entire film that was dark.Verdict: If you loved Blade Runner and you love the sci-fi genre, this film is a must watch.

326,bastille-852-731547,Villeneuve's Sequel is Ambitious and Well-Made,7,7 October 2017,"I really enjoyed both the original ""Blade Runner"" as well as director Denis Villeneuve's previous films, and had been highly anticipating this long-awaited sequel. I thought it was a well-made but imperfect sequel that must be greatly commended for its sheer ambition and aesthetic quality/overtones, but also a somewhat flawed one that does not manage to top the original film in terms of quality.First of all, the film's visual effects are nothing short of astonishing. They are oddly both simple and highly complex in design, and look truly gorgeous on the big screen. Ryan Gosling is excellent as the protagonist, a blade runner named Officer K. Fans of this franchise will also be delighted to see Harrison Ford return to the screen as Deckard. Jared Leto is convincing as the villain as well. While the film's story is generally well-done, the flaws that are inherent in this sequel pertain to the structure and sequence of the story in some way. The film's pacing is not bad, but the film does drag a little bit in the middle. Also, the way the plot is organized sometimes makes the film feel rather dry, and the script cannot quite offset this feeling. I realize that it will be hard to conjure up a scene quite as potent and powerful as Roy Batty's famous ""tears in the rain"" monologue near the end of the first movie, but for a director so seasoned at generating genuine emotion and tension, it's very slightly underwhelming that Villeneuve had difficulty adding some density to the soul of the movie.Overall, this is a solid sequel, although not as good as the original or Villeneuve's other films. Recommended. 7.5/10Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The exceptional visuals and special formatting for the IMAX release made seeing the film on such a screen well worth the additional cost.",Blade Runner 2049
327,deastman_uk,Special K,8,8 October 2017,"So Blade Runner gets a remake, the hero is called K (and indeed he is partly on Trial) and we still don't know or care whether Deckard is a replicant. But the journey is wonderful.Of Hollywood directors, I thought it was only Tarantino who believed that film making was more art than business. While all the narrative is in service to the story, the film has enough space to lets things unfold. (Yes, it is bloody long too)The first 10 minutes of Blade Runner 2049 are already better than most films I've seen from that last few years. It focuses on no more than a cooking pot. The cinematography throughout is stunning, but not in the hamfisted throw it at the screen way of the remake of Ghost In The Shell for example. The budget and the imagination are actually in sync with visions of vast desolate eco corrupted landscapes and cityscapes. It was a reach in the original, but in this film it is complete.I'm not actually a big fan of the original. It was far too stagy even with the bits of philosophy sewn into the action plot. One thing the remake manages well is not to keep digging into the original source for meaning. Where they do meet the remake comes off better. The signature Voight-Kampff test for instance has a truly unsettling equivalent. K's sexual relationship is embarrassingly modern, not noir romantic.The most pivotal scenes are all brief and between women (though they all fail the Bechdel test quite dramatically) and in fact the plot revolves around birth giving the film a kind of Children of Men vibe.The elan showed by the film is remarkable even for such a high profile remake. Everything has a heft and quality. The design is great. We get a few glimpses of other sci-fi hits (a lot of Matrix type scenes, a few Minority Report fixations) but all in service to something, not just a fancy trailer. The film drops hints, but then muddies them leaving quite a few things mysterious. Another film could follow, but there is no feeling of incompleteness to power a franchise.A remake is a remake, but this has enough about it to be a classic.",Blade Runner 2049

330,arishsankar,One of the best Sci-fi movie this decade,10,21 August 2018,"BLADE RUNNER 2049 NOT ONLY SUCCEEDS AT FEELING LIKE A NECESSARY FRANCHISE REVIVAL, IT ALSO MAKES FOR A CAPTIVATING STANDALONE WORK OF SCIENCE-FICTION.
Thirty years after the events of Blade Runner, the Tyrell Corporation has gone under and since been bought and re-branded by one Niander Wallace (Jared Leto): a scientist who pioneered advancements in genetically-modified food and now manufactures a more obedient type of replicant on Earth, known as the NEXUS-9. The older NEXUS model replicants that were produced by the Tyrell Corporation (including, those programmed with open-ended lifespans, aka. the NEXUS-8) are hunted by a new generation of Blade Runners. Among their ranks is a Los Angeles-based police officer codenamed ""K"" (Ryan Gosling), as well as his superior Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright).Following what is otherwise a routine mission, K and Joshi stumble upon a dangerous secret that, should it become public knowledge, could destabilize the already-fragile world as they know it. As K investigates the situation in an effort to prevent that from happening, he comes to realize that there is a key figure who ties the whole mystery together: Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former Blade Runner who retired and subsequently vanished many years ago. It thus falls to K to track down Deckard and find out the truth, before other competing forces do. 
The long-awaited sequel to director Ridley Scott's touchstone 1982 science-fiction film Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 serves as both a continuation of Scott's original movie and an expansion of the themes and mythology first established in author Philip K. Dick's landmark 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (itself the basis for Scott's adaptation). Rather than indulging in a trip down nostalgia lane, Blade Runner 2049 looks to the future of the franchise at the same time that it enriches the ideas and narrative from its predecessor. Blade Runner 2049 not only succeeds at feeling like a necessary franchise revival, it also makes for a captivating standalone work of science-fiction.Taking over as director from Scott (who still served as an executive producer), Blade Runner 2049 helmsman Denis Villeneuve delivers the same combination of moody atmosphere, striking visuals and thought-provoking subject matter here as he has with his previous genre efforts, including last year's sci-fi offering Arrival. Reuniting with his Prisoners and Sicario collaborator as well as overall legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, Villeneuve retains the practical sci-fi meets classic Noir aesthetic of Scott's film (making heavy use of precipitation, fog, smoke and other such elements) and gives it a modern CGI-era polish. As a result, the futuristic, neon-lit urban landscapes that were first envisioned in the original Blade Runner look just as gorgeous here, even as fresh elements are incorporated as part of the sequel's world-building process (see how the rising ocean levels have impacted Los Angeles in the film). Blade Runner 2049 doesn't manage to break new visual ground for the Blade Runner property the way that, say, Mad Max: Fury Road did for the Mad Max franchise, but it does reaffirm Blade Runner's status as top dog when it comes to depicting a stylishly bleak future on Earth. 
As beautiful-looking as the film is, in some ways Blade Runner 2049's screenplay is more ambitious by comparison. The script written by original Blade Runner screenwriter Hampton Fancher and Michael Green (Logan) effectively pushes its predecessor's ideas about the nature of emotion, consciousness, and what it even means to be human/alive forward, in a way that makes sense given the pre-established ""rules"" of the Blade Runner universe. Blade Runner 2049 even has some things in common with Scott's Alien prequel Alien: Covenant, when it comes to its perspective on artificial intelligence and the nature of evolution (something that makes all the more sense, seeing as Green also co-wrote that film). While there are noticeable parallels between certain characters and elements of the story in Blade Runner 2049 and its predecessor, the Blade Runner sequel never feels like a calculated recycling of what has come before, plot-wise, for these reasons.
That being said, the one issue that Blade Runner 2049 does have from a storytelling perspective is that of pacing. Like in both the original Blade Runner and his own previous directorial efforts, Villeneuve prefers to use slow-burn drama in Blade Runner 2049 as a way to build up tension (aided through very precise use of sound and silence) before delivering more intense bursts of action and/or violence. While this approach works exceptionally well for the majority of the film, there are other segments that drag and could have benefitted from having either more forward momentum or a little less room to breathe. Couple that with a pretty long runtime (even by modern tentpole standards) and Blade Runner 2049 seems destined to divide people in the way that its predecessor has for decades: between those who find it an excellent sci-fi mood piece and those who agree that it's lovely to look at, but a bit pretentious and overly drawn out. 
Emotions run even colder at times in Blade Runner 2049 than they did in the original Blade Runner, though for the most part that is by design here. In a world where artificial beings are sometimes (often?) more empathetic than the flesh and blood humans around them, the Blade Runner sequel's cast manage to instill more warmth and humanity into the proceedings with their performances. Ryan Gosling and Robin Wright are both excellent in roles that call for nuance and subtly, as is Harrison Ford as he returns to play an older and much more experienced, yet in some way more vulnerable version of the Rick Deckard character that he previously brought to life over thirty years ago. Actors such as Ana de Armas, Dave Bautista, Mackenzie Davis, and Sylvia Hoeks are strong in their respective supporting roles too, with performances that compliment the film's questions about just what it is that defines human behavior. Jared Leto's acting style, on the other hand, is a bit too theatrical for the film's purposes (even given the theatrical nature of his character), but doesn't go fully over the top either.
Although Blade Runner 2049 works as both a self-contained narrative and a continuation of its predecessor, it also leaves some plot threads dangling for a future sequel (or more) to pick up down the line. While the movie does pave the way for another worthwhile installment or more in the Blade Runner franchise, there is reason to wonder if Blade Runner 2049 is too much like its predecessor (itself, a cult hit with a very loyal following, but a cult hit nonetheless) and won't be able to achieve enough crossover appeal to get a followup, as a result. With that out of the way: Blade Runner 2049 is a great piece of intellectual science-fiction beautifully painted on a large canvas and an example of how to revive/relaunch a beloved property the right way on the big screen. Hardcore fans of the original Blade Runner should by and large be equally taken with the followup (from its visuals and story down to Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's score channeling Vangelis' iconic Blade Runner leitmotifs), and many of them will almost undoubtedly come to rank Villeneuve's movie as being one of the best sequels ever to boot.",Blade Runner 2049

With the story itself and to give a description of it, I'm going to have to keep it short and spoiler free as this (much like the first one) needs to be watched and an knowledge of the first film is essential but I feel that 2049 can be enjoyed as a standalone film. Set years after the end of the first film, a new blade runner named K is assigned to hunt down Replicants but only to discover a secret that will change the course of the future. The greatness of it comes from its visual effects, cinematography, music and fantastic cast. Legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins does what he does best, creating incredible images and shots of the gritty futuristic world, with touches of darkness and colour to bring beauty out of the dark future.Overall, BR2049 is indeed a great example of a sequel being truly great and respecting it's roots, avoiding the reboot method and going off the rails. With amazing visuals, neo-noir cinematography, sound mixing, direction, music score, acting and a worthy script, this film is destined to win fans and audiences but indeed aim for Oscar consideration in the coming awards season. 5/5 - The Autistic Reviewers.",Blade Runner 2049
333,cdjh-81125,One of The Best Sequels Ever Made - A Masterpiece,10,8 October 2017,"This movie was not going to disappoint me, all the marketing for Blade Runner 2049 had me thinking that this movie was gonna be incredible, it had one of my favourite directors working today at the helm, the same writer as the original and looked like a faithful continuation of the original, as I had hoped this movie was absolutely incredible.The script for this movie was perfect, it made the world still feel like the one we knew from the first one, like it's been through so much since the first one only worse and it always felt like a gradual development. Every character in this movie has a good motivation and backstory, no one felt like they didn't have a purpose to play and I really got invested in all of them, even if some of the more villainous characters. The mystery that weaves this film together was really well done, so compelling and I really wanted to know the answers to the questions raised. As soon as I heard that Denis Villeneuve was going to direct this movie I knew he would be a perfect fit, Arrival was my favourite movie of 2016 so I knew he could do Sci-Fi and like everything else in this film it lived up to my expectations. There aren't a lot of action scenes in this movie but when there is he is very good at making them look realistic and gritty which gave them real tension, he used lighting very well to sell the location and state of the world and he gave this film such a good tone, a dark yet hopeful one. At this point Villeneuve could take over any franchise and I'd be convinced it was in perfect hands. All the performances in this movie were fantastic and I could not have imagined anyone else playing the characters in this movie. Ryan Gosling was brilliant as K, you knew he had a real moral complexity to his actions in this film and he really play his characters isolation very well. Harrison Ford was phenomenal as Deckard, he played him as a very traumatised man that Ford made sympathetic and it felt as if he was playing the same character as he did in the original not just someone else entirely. Ana de Armas was a real surprise in this movie, she wasn't just a love interest but a real character with depth that I really cared about. Jared Leto could have been in the movie more but he really played this morally grey and mysterious character very well and always kept my attention when he was on screen. The look of this movie was jaw dropping I loved that they really expanded on the world not just through dialogue but visually as well. The different environments all look distinctive and sell the off balance system of the planet rather than just telling the audience that it is. A lot of this has to do with the cinematography, everything looks incredible, the rainy city streets, dusty landscapes and snowy locations all look immaculate but never like they are in a film but part of a larger world. All of the special effects are amazing, they weren't used to an unnecessary degree but only way practical effects weren't an option and they always looked real like they should be. Blade Runner 2049 was a masterpiece, if it's not better than the original it is at least equal to it. Everything from the direction, characters, performances, special effects, cinematography and world building were perfect for what they needed to bring to this movie. It's the best movie of the year so far and is proof that sequels, even ones that took as long as this, can be every bit as good and though provoking as there originals. 10/10: A+ (Incredible)",Blade Runner 2049

It is illustrated through (at least) temporal far-fetched settings and concepts that brazenly delve into an anthropological and sentimental exercise of human nature, solitude, feelings, discrimination and perseverance. 2) It is virtually impossible not to feel completely overwhelmed and positively oppressed by the opulence of the settings, the inexplicable beautiful and haunting cinematography of the ever genius, ever graceful and ever superior Roger Deakins and the bleak, heavy and complex eye of Denis Villeneuve.3) This is a film for the ages, the same way as the original Blade Runner was in the sense that all the aspects pointed out in 1) and 2) are mere allusions of how truly poignant 2049 is. Despite having its faults (the pacing is, at times, stale and some scenes and plot points are either redundant or unnecessarily overlong) it is a film that defies definitions; that does not invite convincing into liking; that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Blade Runner 2049 is visually stunning, philosophic and strong movie. Not even it's length (almost 3 hours) feels too long. It satisfy all the expectations and in some parts even fly over them.

344,samyoung-82648,Fairly solid when most movies are poor,7,7 October 2017,"** This film is politically correct ** Starting with the bad. The film's music is far too loud. This is most probably done to break up the scenes in the movie. Some of the characters were mediocre, however, i'll put that down to constraints from the directing/writing. In particular Sylvia Hoeks (alias Ninja Warrior Cliché, alias Luv) who is your 100th super powerful ninja warrior you've seen in cinema this year and Jared Leto (alias slow talking villain Cliché, alias Niander Wallace). Granted, neither of these actors had a lot of scope to move with these warn out archetypes.On The plus side, Ryan Gosling and Robin Wright played their parts superbly. Without these two, there would have been no core to this movie.Many people have commented on the visuals (they are impressive). The story spends plenty of time to build up to a climax. Despite what others have said, I found the twists sufficient and the ending quite satisfactory. In some ways, it reminds me a little of Artificial Intelligence (starring Haley Joel Osment).Hollywood desperately needs to get over itself. While it didn't have the usual dialog (""all men are sexist, all women are oppressed""), it keeps on playing the ridiculous ninja warrior card (which wasn't cool to begin with). In this instance, the credibility of the ninja warrior is somewhat feasible. It simply shows that Hollywood is a one-trick pony to appeal to the niche audience who love their identity politics.The film is worth watching. If they skipped the political correctness and archetypal villain, the movie would have been much stronger. Villeneuve certainly has a unique style, he just needs to lay off the political correctness.",Blade Runner 2049

The sound design and cinematography are just masterful with a story so pompous and boring it might have fallen out of missing pieces of Battlefield Earth. Dennis Villeneuve's movie certainly looks and sounds the part, but it's trying to play someone else's music that was mostly an accident to begin with. This is a deliberate, austere film where nearly every single scene goes on for about 10 minutes longer than it needs to. People walk slowly ALL THE TIME for no reason. And yet at nearly three hours running length, Blade Runner 2049 manages to tell us nothing at all. Despite the narrative lapses - and the original had similar story problems itself - this aural and visual odyssey absolutely immerses you in a world. Yet interiors are over-lit and the production design is occasionally lifeless. When the credits roll and you walk out of the theater, there's an odd feeling when you don't see giant fluorescent Kana signs and endless streams of rain. At some subconscious level, Roger Deakins and all those Katkana signs own you lock stock and barrel. The film is so visually correct and so audibly satisfying, you'd swear Christopher Nolan had a hand in it all and decided to make a terrible and goofy mystery almost as dare or a joke.Know what you are getting yourself into when you buy a ticket to Blade Runner 2049. The movie goes from stunning feast to laughable drivel in a moments notice, time and time again - for three hours.

Frankly, the movie is a full hour longer than it should have been. The cinematography is great but the story is weak and not well developed. There is no exposition on why certain characters do what they do and most of them, including the villain, are very one-dimensional.
It does not have the feel of the original Blade Runner. There is no compelling mystery, nothing scary, and nothing that really hooks you. The action is minimal and it is so devoid of energy that were it not for the occasional blasts of loud audio one might sleep right through it.
For those who buy movies rather than just watch them, the rationale is that the movies will be watched more than once. For this reviewer, this film does not make the cut. The prospect of enduring such a painfully lengthy film for so little payoff makes a second viewing somewhere down the road very unlikely.",Blade Runner 2049
350,Svenstadt,"Saved by the visuals, gritty and sensual; but not enough to recommend it.",6,10 April 2018,"It is hard to recommend this film. I had high hopes for this. I could sum this film up by parsing about the last 4/5th of the way through this film: it felt like the old fart Harrison Ford 'handing off' the blade runner role to a younger guy who could do more with it. In that sense it felt kinda like in Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning. 
That's not the only aspect of the story that was old and cliched. The film basically revolves around the 'humanitarian mission to save innocent life'. It is all about finding this girl who was a 'miracle child' born of both human and replicant which should not be possible. The corporate CEO who sells the replicants, played by Jared Leto, wants the child for his own purposes, while different factions argue back and forth. This is very Big Lebowski-esque in that it is a complicated back-and-forth changing storyline (which I hate), and I felt that, like Terminator: Salvation, at a certain point the plot just fell apart. 
The good of this film is that it has a very 'techno-punk' feel and gets you into a deep, dark mood. It has an almost trance-like essence in every scene. BTW, there is quite a bit of nudity and adult content, some gun violence as well as physical violence. 
I did however become a fan of Ryan Gosling after this. I could see his works again and in my mind he has a Bruce Willis / Arnold Schwarzenegger, leading-man quality to his performances.",Blade Runner 2049
351,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This Is a Great Movie and it should have made more money but it didn't because for some reason not enough people saw this movie at the Cinemas.Why? I have no idea.,10,23 February 2018,"I loved this movie I thought it was A very Emotional and well told story and it is The second best SCI-FI Movie of 2017 in my opinion.Kong Skull island being my favourite.There are a lot of things i liked about blade runner 2049 and one of the things I liked the most was the cinematography, the movie has great cinematography and it is a very good looking movie.The movie has a very beautiful and visually stunning look to it and I found myself captivated by the movie, and I felt very immersed into the world of blade runner.call me crazy but I actually liked this sequel more than the original movie.
The original movie is pretty good and is also visually stunning and I like it but I just preferred the sequel.This sequel to blade runner may be longer but I didn't think that was a bad thing and it didn't bother me that much and that's because I really enjoyed the story to the movie.if I find a story interesting then the length of a movie does not bother me as much as it usually would.this movie held my attention from start to finish and I was never bored.
I should also mention blade runner 2049 is Not an Action movie it's more of a Sci-Fi Mystery Thriller and it focusses more on telling a good story instead of action.There are some action scenes in the movie as well as some chase scenes but for the most part this is a movie that focusses on story telling and character development and I thought it was done very well and the movie is very well made.This movie really surprised me and I did not know I would end up loving it as much as I do, I was worried about the running time too just like a lot of people were but as it turned out the movie was still Great despite the running time.
The movie is two hours and thirty minutes long with thirteen minutes of End Credits.I thought The time went by pretty fast if I'm honest and I think that's because I was so immersed in the story and captivated by the visuals.
I also really liked Ryan Gosling in the lead role as a Replicant called K.i thought he did a great Job and he's a great actor and I liked him a lot in this movie, he was Great as the lead Man.His acting was great and his character was interesting and I found myself empathising with him and rooting for him, he was definitely a character that the audience wants to see succeed and I Like movies that have strong likeable characters like that.Harrison Ford also returns as Rick Deckard and he also does a Great Job in his role playing a likeable and cool character.Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling have a fight about half way through the movie which I thought was fun to watch and then they end up working together which I thought was a nice twist.
Most people will probably have a problem with that but I Didn't, I liked that they worked together and helped each other to fight i thought they were a cool team.This movie is not a remake so i have no idea why People are saying that.It references the original movie but it also does its own thing it was its own movie, and to the people out there that say there is no build up? What are you smoking? This movie has plenty of build up and Ryan Goslings character has a character arch and his character was built up throughout the whole movie!.Also the relationship between Ryan's Character and the hologram joi was very touching and that relationship was built up too, so why are People saying the movie didn't build on stuff??? On the contrary it did the complete opposite, it built on a LOT of stuff.I thought Ana de Armas was good in her role as Joi she plays a virtual Hologram kind of like artificial intelligence and she has feelings just like people do and I thought her character was interesting and I liked the emotional aspect of the movie, i liked How Ryan Goslings Character liked her and had feelings for her even though she was only a hologram,I thought that was kind of sweet and their relationship was nice.Now getting to the Villains there are two main Villains Luv played by Sylvia Hoeks and Niander Wallace played by Jared Leto.Jared Leto does okay as Niander but I do feel he was underused and could have done a little bit more.
As For Sylvia Hoeks she was Great and steels the show as Luv Who is an Evil killer and works for Niander.
I thought Sylvia Hoeks was Ruthless in her role as The killer, and she felt like the main Villain of the movie even though Jared Leto was supposed to be.Jared Leto came across as creepy but Sylvia came across as downright Evil and ruthless and she seemed to have no heart whatsoever and I thought she was the better villain.I liked the fight she had with Ryan gosling at the end of the movie too i thought it was well shot and quite exciting, I actually found the whole climax to the movie exciting and it had me on the edge of my seat, the last part of the movie felt like a Brutal survival Thriller and I really enjoyed it.I Have no problems with this movie and it did pretty much everything right.The special effects were good the directing was solid the writing was solid the story was interesting and captivating,the movie was able to be emotional as well as entertaining and Low and behold it has A GOOD Ending! where Harrison Ford's Character gets Treated with RESPECT unlike star wars The CRAP FEST AWAKENS.The story to blade runner 2049 was well told and emotional and By the end of the movie Ryan's Character gains a soul because he did something that was good and that's a Great and touching way to End the movie.Overall Blade Runner 2049 is one of the Best sequels of all time and I respect this movie even more for respecting the Rick Deckard Character, watch the movie and you'll know what I mean.I can see this movie becoming a classic in years to come.",Blade Runner 2049
352,joshbarton15,Denis Villeneuve... making sci-fi great again,10,8 October 2017,"Los Angeles, 2049. Thirty years have passed since Deckard and Rachael fled the city to make a life of their own. The futuristic cityscapes created by visionary director Ridley Scott were the perfect backdrop for one of the most influential science-fiction films of all time. While the creative team may have changed for Blade Runner 2049, the cityscapes remain for one of the best experiences I've had at the cinema in 2017.When K (Ryan Gosling), a young blade runner, uncovers a long-buried secret that could change the future for both humans and Replicants, he tracks down former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) for answers.It's no secret that audiences didn't take to Blade Runner straight away upon its release in 1982, people not seeing the mark the film stamped in the genre of sci-fi or film history until the years after. Several versions of the film and over thirty years later, Denis Villeneuve brings us Blade Runner 2049, a direct sequel and continuation from Scott's final cut of his original film.Villeneuve, who I'd have to describe as a visionary, is one of the most exciting directors working today and he brings his A-game to Blade Runner 2049. It's always risky making a sequel after such a long time, especially for a film as renowned as Blade Runner however, from the very get go, it's clear that this film is being made by someone who is incredibly indebted to and respectful of the original.This is a beautifully crafted film, visually stunning and utterly engrossing in its narrative. I was worried about how they would take the story forward but knowing nothing about the plot and going in blind worked wonders because I was gripped from the opening shot to the very last. The runtime could have been an issue but when the film is of such a high quality, it ultimately flies by and finishes too soon if anything.The work from Roger Deakins on the film's cinematography is nothing short of masterful, surpassing Jordan Cronenweth's work on the original which is no easy task. Deakins has never won the Academy Award and if he doesn't for his work on Blade Runner 2049, I'll lose hope in him ever picking up the award. The music from Vangelis in Blade Runner was mesmerising and while both Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch ensure this film has an impressive soundtrack, it never comes close to topping Vangelis'. Coming to the performances, Blade Runner 2049 features a cast intent on making this as memorable as the original. Ryan Gosling leads the film with an impressive performance where the subtlety of facial expressions are as important as the delivery of lines, leading to arguably Gosling's best performance to date. The returning Harrison Ford is as gruff as you'd expect as a Deckard who's been in hiding for thirty years, his pivotal role in the film surprising yet incredibly worthwhile.The supporting roles, ranging from minor to major, are filled by plenty of capable actors, whether it be Jared Leto's mysterious turn as Niander Wallace or Robin Wright's authoritative showing as Lt. Joshi. The pleasant surprise was Ana de Armas, who I didn't think too much of as an actress prior to this film.Blade Runner 2049 is a heavy dose of pure science fiction that will leave a lasting impression on the genre for sure. With this and Arrival last year, Denis Villeneuve seems to be on a one man mission to make sci-fi great again.",Blade Runner 2049
353,1bilbo,Boring,1,30 November 2017,"I was so disappointed in this film.For me, this has very little to do with the original Blade Runner and even less to do with the book. If only Hollywood wasn't infested with accountants.The story and editing are so disjointed with the film lurching from one CGI drama sequence to another.Ryan Gosling spends every clip gazing vacantly into the distance so much so that the first half of the film is spent waiting for Harrison Ford to show up.The point of the book is that humanity doesn't value animals until they are all gone - it seems that nobody involved with this franchise has actually read any Philip K Dick book. Tripe.",Blade Runner 2049
354,barbagvido,All those generic movies will be lost in time like tears in the rain. This is not one of those movies.,10,17 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel to a 1982 dystopian sci-fi classic Blade Runner. It's directed by incredible Dennis Villenueve (Arrival, Prisoners, Sicario, Enemy, I think I said enough) and stars Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto and Harrison Ford who is returning here. I'm not going to tell you anything about the plot because I find it better going into it blind, so I will get to my thoughts on this.I've heard a lot of people call the first one overrated, but I love each and every cut of it, so I guess you can say I was pretty hyped for this. And with the talent attached to it, my expectations were nothing short of great. And this movie actually managed to live up to those expectations. I've had a blast watching this. I have so much more respect for Sony now because it took bravery to put this much effort and money in what's essentially a big budget art film. Don't go into it expecting an action movie. The trailers might sell it as one, but there is only one longer action scene at the end. I'd say even the first one had more action. But, that doesn't take away from the movie. I just sat there in the theater and sunk into this gorgeous movie. If you love neon lights with a soundtrack filled with synths like I do, just go for it, you will love it. Visually, it's one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen, if not the most gorgeous. It also gave us more of this world that's disgusting and so beautiful at the same time and one that you can just get lost in. Loneliness and isolation are one of the major themes here (as the depression that comes with it) and the world is like a reflection of that. It's very slow, but the slow pace adds a lot of depth here. Honestly, I wish it was longer. There's quite a lot of ambiguity (don't expect to get much answers to the questions from the first one) and some loose ends left in the plot. But they are left by the subplots. And those subplots are not our lead's story. They only helped drive his story and it makes sense that they were unfinished. It might bother some, but it didn't bother me. It's like that for a reason. Who knows, we might even get another one. If they continue like this, I'm all in for it.I wish they make more movies like this. Because this was brilliant and now it left me wanting more. I still don't know if I prefer this or the first one because both are kinda their own movies and I love them both equally in different ways. It's a slow- burn, but a very enjoyable and beautiful slow-burn.",Blade Runner 2049
355,steveo122,Villeneuve: I'm ready to hand all my sci-fi needs to him.,8,12 January 2018,"Again I say, as a pessimist, being wrong means good news.
I fully expected to be disappointed. Early.
After an hour, I relaxed.
My first thought as it started was that they had made the clever choice to tie in to the first film through the soundtrack rather than through visual re-creations of settings from the original. But I don't remember the distinctive sounds of the first being so 'heavy handed'. Essentially that's my only complaint.
I have issues with the third act developments but nothing that drags down the overall effect of the film.
Very well made, thought out and controlled. I found the story-line compelling and the 'savor it' pace fitting.
This is seriously one of the best sequels made.
I was well pleased.",Blade Runner 2049

357,robert3750,"Interesting visuals, but story falls flat",3,8 January 2018,"All the story really mounts to is that Deckard and Rachel had a child. That's nice, but it doesn't really make a difference in the world of the movie. Rachel was a unique creation of Tyrell's, and it's made clear that the big corporate baddie (there's no more prevalent stereotype in Hollywood than the evil/amoral businessman, but I digress) can't duplicate it, nor presumably, can anyone else. Furthermore, the fact that the child has to live in a bubble means she's essentially a genetic dead end. Also, Rachel dies after giving birth via c section, implying that it wasn't exactly good for her health to bear a child. In short, there's no basis for thinking that this is going to trigger a wave of replicant self propagation or cause any other fundamental change in the Blade Runner ""universe"". There's talk of a ""revolution"" among the replicants, but they hardly needed this particular development to motivate them for that, given how they're treated.The entire movie feels like what I feared--an unnecessary exercise that doesn't really add anything to the story.",Blade Runner 2049

A beautiful film with a of lot complex interactions.Roger Deakins' cinematography was great. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is the same guy that did 'Arrival' which I thought was good but not as good as other people thought and 'Prisoners'. He may be someone to watch. The direction in this is very strong.They avoided the 'let's do a scene like in first movie but make it BIGGER' ploy that flaws most 'sequels'. And it really doesn't feel like a sequel. It's a different story and while it builds on the the first it goes in a really interesting direction. I liked also that Deckard's role wasn't tacked on as an after thought. It's really sort of poetic and I'd like to see it again so I can get some of things I didn't get in the first go around. I gave it a 9 but I'm pretty sure that's going to change to a 10 with a little time. It really holds it's on in comparison with the original and if this is the approach they want to take with a possible 3rd movie I'm totally on board.",Blade Runner 2049
359,themovieparadise,Actually Improves Upon the Original,9,12 October 2017,"It's a testament to how great of a sequel a film is when it can entirely reshape the first movie, and make you think about it in a whole new light. While watching 2049, I began to think of Blade Runner in a whole new way, a way that made me appreciate the film more. We always talk about sequels detracting from the original movie, but here Denis Villeneuve made a sequel that actually enhanced the original. There is also a lot of added context and background information that puts this world into perspective, and gives more clarity to certain things that happened in the original. When you look at all the intricate puzzle pieces at play in 2049, it's a miracle that Villeneuve was able to put it all together and make a truly engaging film. Ryan Gosling delivers a subtle but powerful performance, one that fills the screen. While the supporting cast doesn't get as much screen time as Gosling does, they do give great performances. Harrison Ford is at the top of his game with this movie, and especially shines in a gut-wrenching scene between him and Jared Leto...",Blade Runner 2049

I loved the dystopian world and the concept of replicants but found the movie very poorly pulled off. Because of this, I was looking at the sequel with hope that it would improve on the original. I would say that it does for the most part. The cinematography is excellent and the story does provoke thought about human vs artificial life. The best acting is done by the supporting cast. Harrison Ford pretty much sleepwalks through it. I also laugh at the concept that Earth would be so different in only 30 years!!! Flying cars. Perfect replicants. Environmental catastrophe. They may unfortunately be in this planets future, but 2049 seems too soon. The title should've been Blade Runner 2149. All in all I rate it a 7 out of 10. Good but not great",Blade Runner 2049

363,svhot,"Best Sequel Ever , Great Acting, Great Direction, NICE Story-Screenplay",9,11 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is definitely one of the best and most outstanding sequels ever made in the history of cinema / movie-making. The basic plot is about a new blade runner known as K (Ryan Gosling), who is given the task of locating and ""retiring / executing "" the child of a deceased replicated being. His hunt for the replicated-child leads him to confrontations and interactions with various ""people"". This includes his interaction with the original veteran blade runner Deckard (Harrison Ford). Deckard is the father of the replicated-child.The story is told mostly in a thriller-style and the real child's identity is revealed towards the end of the movie.Firstly, I have to write about the outstanding work done by the director Denis Villeneuve. Denis has managed to accomplish a rare feat in movie-making ; he has connected the plot with the story of the original Blade Runner, while creatively taking the plot forward with a fresh style and intriguing elements and characters. Denis has maintained the intense and dark atmosphere of the predecessor movie, while the "" thriller style "" of taking the story forward will keep viewers interested and involved till the end of the movie. Wow, you are really one of the best directors ever and your name should definitely be mentioned in the ""top 10 directors of all times"" records.The acting of the entire star-cast is great in this movie. Ryan Gosling has played his role to perfection as the ""new blade runner "" agent known as K. His mannerisms,and the intensity displayed by him through his eyes and expressions are simply outstanding. Harrison Ford is impressive once again as the veteran blade runner Deckard. Mr Ford is a natural actor ; he always tries to react how people would in real life, if put in certain situations and circumstances. This is the best thing about the legendary Mr Harrison Ford (Cheers Sir, and thanks for reprising your role as the iconic blade runner !!!!) The visuals and special effects are also of good quality and look genuine. The story and screenplay are also well developed and quite intriguing. However, the only thing that I did not like was ""allowing the new blade runner K to die in the end "". It would have been better if K had stayed alive. I would love to become a ""story-screenplay "" writer for movies, because interesting stories keep developing in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth - literally !!!!).

364,rdvljunk,Very descent indeed,8,28 October 2017,"As die-hard blade runner fan (I was blown away when it was in the theaters) I of course had to see this movie. However I admit I did not expect too much from it. The trailers were to me uninspiring and critics reviews I read also not too positive. So I prepared myself for a long, but not too exciting, sit. I was pleasantly surprised however. The movie managed to capture me from the start and kept my attention. It has an interesting story line with some nice surprises in the plot, which of course I will not give away. But also some holes in it like how did K know when/where Deckard would be moved? Now I also directly admit it can't compete with the original Blade Runner. It is a very descent sequel, absolutely, but it lacks the more almost claustrophobic and tense atmosphere from the original. Specially the scene's where Deckard is on the crowded streets (The Zhora chase is stunning) are dearly missed in this movie. It has more distance, it is cleaner, less detailed. Compare the apartment of Deckard with K's, The office of Tyrell with that of Wallace, the office of Bryant to that of Joshi, etc. Basically that sums it up when it comes to atmosphere. Together with the soundtrack which is less intense BR 2049 simply can't match up, though good as it is. It is absolute fun to recognize the sometimes hidden references to the original. Some music notes that it based upon/or edited from the original, some scenes, The fact that a dutch actress plays the bad ""guy"" in this case, hooker Mariette who clearly resembles Priss, etc.Again we see a movie that is not valued for the high quality it has, but this time I do not expect a cult status. It is in the details.",Blade Runner 2049
365,rusoviet,The film had potential but sadly the script given to a fine....,7,24 May 2018,"....ensemble of actors/actresses was 'wanting'. Mind you there was an intriguing plot line but it was strung out way too long chewing up precious minutes that could have been better served with better interaction amongst both protagonists and antagonists. I found Harrison Ford' 'Decker' poorly used and that entire final hour reeked of a director unable to have a more meaningful dialogue that would have made the final 3rd of the film worthy.Sad actually because the film had a solid start and, not a big Gosling fan, but Gosling was not the problem. The director let the intriguing start begin to meander into a slow moving slough (meaningless discussions with Robin Wright Lieut. Joshi) rather than explain much deeper the role played by the monster 'Niander Wallace' aka Jared Leto.This was the error. In fairness the director did have Leto discuss his dream of complaint 'slaves' and his demonic referral when he says ""We could storm Eden and retake her!'That was the remark that fleshed out who Niander Wallace is - Lucifer incarnate. Had the film focused more and delved deeper on how he came to consume the Tyrell Corp. and morph it into the empire it was and most importantly a deeper discussion of 'why' - this film could have been as good as the original.Acting was very very good I esp. was focused on 'Luv' aka Sylvia Hoeks. Sadly her talent was wasted in the scene as the vehicle fills with water. It was a waste of time consuming nearly 10 minutes and predictable.",Blade Runner 2049

Well, alright, I really have no further time than the 163 minutes that I already gave this dustbin to understand it. For the first time in life that I felt so bored in the cinema that I would've literally shot the screen had I had a weapon!

The movie does go a little off at a tangent 2/3 in but quickly pulls it back on track.For me questions that were raised by Bladerunner were re-enforced in this and only confirmed my thoughts on what and who Deckard is. There are nice and clever cameos by Edward James Olmos and Sean Young.For me I still prefer Bladerunner over 2049 but 2049 is a worthy sequel and does need multiple watches to take it all in as dialogue does drop off a tad but this is a minor irritation and you will find yourself waiting and waiting for Deckard to appear.To those who hate the film I guess this is because they are part of the Rabid fanbois who for 35 years have been wrong about Deckard and still can't accept the glaring obvious nature of what he is. Their score and reviews reflect this out. For some this movie is far too intelligent for them, I liked the misdirection and this sequel nails home what most of us felt about Bladerunner from the release of the Final Cut version",Blade Runner 2049

A sequel worthy of its titles, simply great. The scenes are extremely special and full of visual wonders, a spectacle for the eyes with excellent performances by the whole cast, full of tense moments and a solid and followable script.Despite the bad fame between the movies and their aftermath, 2049 is an exception to the rule. It breaks any expectation and I'm sure it satisfies with passion the fans who longed for a second part. The film is special to admire, full of emotional scenes and with subliminal messages to different ideas or philosophies, once again, returning to the intelligent evidence or hidden messages with double meaning based on ideas greater than those we perceive in a moment. The shots in this movie plus the beauty of his fantastic and futuristic soundtrack (an epic that does honor to the first) we get moments extremely enjoyable and rich to admire, Gosling makes an excellent raw and rude performance of his main character, showing us a new protagonist damaged from the center of his feelings but with hope in his eyes. The relationship between the characters makes us feel the sadness of this dystopic future full of plastic and neon, where we no longer distinguish from the real motives and false pleasures.A phenomenal film, despite the fact that its narrative seems to have tried to cover many themes or extra characters at once and is left without enough time to explain them all, this also opens doors to possible future projects of new sequels.

The director this time is the great Denis Villeneuve who made Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival, all terrific movies. I'm actually a big fan of this director. It started with Prisoners and Arrival really sealed the deal for me as far as this director is concerned. I was excited for this movie because of him. I'm also a fan of the original Blade Runner. I did see it, more than one version and I enjoyed the hell out of it. This movie is absolutely beautiful in its darkness. It is sumptious in the color scheme and the look of the movie. It is one of a kind. They spent a good chunk of money on this and it shows in every single frame of it. It is masterful in that regard. It also brings some interesting questions about AI and what a world like that might be like. This is a fairly simple detective story shrouded in mythology, background information and existenial questions. The violence is brutal and intense but comes in short bursts. There is so much more to this world than just what we're seeing. This is a marvelous movie but it has some issues. It's definitely too long. It feels it because it moves at a fairly slow pace. There are times where it feels like the movie is going nowhere. It is quiet and Ryan Gosling is so stoic that he's virtually silent as well. It does make you live in the moment. Live in the world with little to no light. It is a very good movie but if you don't have the patience to stay with this film, avoid. It is a very slow burn but worth it.

It is clear that Villeneuve has great passion for the Scott's work, which is shown through the sensational craft of Blade Runner 2049.The critical significance about Blade Runner is its eerie arty atmosphere unlike any science fiction thriller. Its not a action packed blockbuster, its a steady thought provoking neo noir. Villeneuve absolutely understands this and has continued this course remarkably in the sequel. What Villanueva and writer Hampton Fancher successfully produce is a progressing exploration into the stirring narratives of what it means to be alive and memory that drove the first film. Carrying more heart wrenching depth into these matters, 2049 provokes stronger spirit into the concept of Blade Runner. As the story of humans and replicants progresses more mind boggling and moving threads are revealed in this next chapter.The most marvellous achievement of 2049 is the breath-taking scenery of the same dark dystopian Los Angeles in sensational colour schemes exhibiting the amazing realism of the Blade Runner world. So many moments of beautiful set pieces and design show the wonderful art that cinema really is, furthermore presented through the enchanting cinematography of Roger Deakins. A perspective into the Blade Runner world identical to the first vision in magnificent presence of vibrating terrain. From the towering lens flare city buildings in L.A, to the desolate orange wastelands of Las Vegas.Of course one of the most memorable traits of the first film was Vangelis's shivering yet absorbing score, which again is brilliant revived through the work of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfirsch replicating (no pun intended) the startling and momentous sound of the captivating future.Ryan Gosling again proves his brilliant talent, in a authentic performance of pain and humanity carrying the soul of the film through his character's journey. Jared Leto's scene chewing creepy Ninader Wallace is a disturbing display of character that will stay with you for a ages. Ford's returning presence was an impressive display especially in his first contact with Gosling (A reprisal I found much more credible than his performance in the recent Star Wars) Blade Runner 2049 is the cinematic spectacle people have been waiting for years and is arguable the most significant film of 2017 and is most defiantly one of the most mesmerising. The most perfectly executed sequel to a loved classic I have ever seen. The original Blade Runner for me will always be on top, but Denise Villeneuve's work is an exceptional accomplishment.",Blade Runner 2049
373,anupapu8,A one of a kind Big Budget Art Cinema,9,10 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 - Waoww. I have often stated that Roger Deakins is a master Cinematographer and often his Oscars were stolen by other cinematographers. Even after 13 nominations (highest by any Cinematographer in the history) and yet not a single win. This is the time. For the first time hi was working with an enormous budget of 150m$ and for the first time he was creating a futuristic world. And he has hammered the nail perfectly. He should and must win this time. And I am saying this after considering the exceptional cinematography done by Hoyte Van Hoytema in Dunkirk with IMAX camera , because even the word 'Exceptional' falls short what Deakins has done here. Each and every scene will make you 'Awe' towards it..That being said , the movie is not doing well till now at the box office. Its opening numbers were very low and trade experts were saying the only way this movie could be not at loss , if only it will be saved by China , Japan and Korea , where it is still to be released .The reasons for its box office failure in America were 1. U have to see the first part before watching this one. It a compulsory requirement. 2. The plot has been superbly kept secretive , which is great for the audience like me who were interested in the movie even before the trailer came out , but creates distance from the audience who wants to know about the movie before watching it. 3. It's very noncommercial. Too lengthy , very serious , less action scenes , very artful , which makes it vulnerable at box office.But I don't want to talk about the box office , it's making me sad , as m very happy after watching the film , and it would be a very big lose for Hollywood if this film doesn't perform well. Because then no other studio will try to do this thing again. It's one of a kind film , I don't remember any other movie which priorities the AMBITION over its COMMERCIAL Prospect so much and still made with a budget of 150m$ . The movie totally builds on the story-line of the first installment. Answers some questions from that film , raises some new questions , which will be answer in future movies if ever made.But the best thing about the film(apart from Cinematography obviously) is writing. We don't get to see such brilliant writing in such a big budget film (again except Christopher Nolan movies). There were so many genuine surprises that you can't stop praising the writers. The surprises keep on coming. They never stop. And the movie end with giving you the feeling that you want more.Acting wise there is only Ryan Gosline to talk about. He was the only character in the whole movie. All the other actors just come and go. Dave Batista got one scene , Jared Leto got two. Harrison For comes in the last 45min of the movie although utilized very nicely. Ana De Armas gave a very emotional performance . But Ryan get much more emotional and vulnerable , with each shock he gets in the film. It's such nice to see him in a big budget film. It would be so nice if it becomes a franchise. The score from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch is heart pounding sometimes and goes total silence in rest of the part.Denis Villeneuve is a very good director. One of the best working right now. I have liked his Prisoner , Sicario and Enemy , and liked Arrival a little less . People keep comparing him to Nolan . Which I think is wrong. Villeneuve doesn't have the business sense of Nolan. The failure of Blade Runner 2049 at the box office after such awesome reviews proves it. Nolan knows his audience and also knows how much budget he should inject in his film to make it a hit. He just don't goes on spending money without analyzing the commercial prospect of this film. That doesn't mean Nolan is not artistic. Rather you can say he is the artist who sales most . Villeneuve should learn this single talent from Nolan and then he could be as successful as Nolan in the Box Office.Some more action scenes and slight editing here and there could easily had raised its commercial prospect . Also we needed some more scenes of Jared Leto as the Villain.Like I said , m hoping that China , South Korea and Japan will save this film from drowning , and m also expecting this movie to bag almost all the technical awards in this Oscar like Mad Max: Fury Road did.8.5/10 By ANuP APu KuMaR.",Blade Runner 2049

375,mitchell5954,A truly worthy successor to one of the great science fiction films ever!,10,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is the long awaited sequel to Blade Runner, over thirty years in the making. Blade Runner is not only my favorite Ridley Scott film, one of my favorite science fiction films, but one of my favorite films period. Rarely enough, it was a movie I initially hated, due to my faulty expectations. I went in thinking it would be a sci-fi action piece, like Star Wars or Total Recall, but Blade Runner is not that at all. It's the same with this sequel. If you go into this thinking action you will be soundly disappointed.I went into this film expecting a sequel to Blade Runner, and got exactly that. This might be one of the best sequels ever made. That's difficult to say, as there are a lot of amazing sequels out there, but it makes that list of greats. I still like the first Blade Runner more, but this is for sure a worthy follow-up. Virtually everything works about this movie.2049 does what a great sequel should do. It maintains the feel of the first, but does its own take, as opposed to rinse and repeat. It also expands on the original in every aspect; the world, story, characters, and the theme of what it means to be human.The effects are astounding. You can tell the budget is on the screen. This film looks as good if not better than the original. It's bleak and atmospheric, as a Blade Runner sequel should be. The score is also great. It's not quite as memorable as the first movie's score, but it still fit the film beautifully.The cast is great. Everyone gives an amazing performance. However, the standout performance is Jared Leto, in my opinion. The only other film I him from, off the top of my head, is Suicide Squad, of which he did nothing to impress me. I thought he was the worst on-screen Joker (in live action) to date. However, he truly brought his a-game. That was the one thing I wish there was more of in this movie; more Jared Leto.The fact that this movie exists actually makes the first Blade Runner an even better movie. 2049 took the one thing I did not care for in the first film and built its narrative around it in a very creative way. One thing people might not like is that, while Harrison Ford is in all the marketing, and has second billing, below Ryan Gosling, his character does not appear until more than halfway through. I actually prefer this though, as this story does revolve around Ryan Gosling's character. This film manages to be its own contained story, while also leaving the door open for future installments.I'll admit, the movie's run time did worry me at first. I thought this would not earn its length, and be too loaded with filler, and the pacing would suffer. Some might feel that way, but I did not. Every scene in this film felt necessary, either for the plot, or expanding on the theme and/or characters.Like I said before, between the two, I do prefer the original slightly more, for a couple reasons. First of all, while the music in 2049 is amazing, I found the music in the first Blade Runner more memorable still. Secondly, the first film had one of the greatest, and most iconic, villains in movies. While Jared Leto was great he was not the main threat. The main antagonist of 2049, to me, did not measure up. That does not mean the villain was bad, just not as good.Overall, if you love Blade Runner like I do, 2049 is an outstanding sequel you should definitely go see. If you don't like the first film, then don't bother with this, as it's very much the same in terms of its feel and tone.",Blade Runner 2049
376,bluepink,Overall rating is a lie - painfully slow movie,1,30 May 2021,"I've never seen an IMDB rating so far from reality. It must be the original bladerunner fans giving a 10 because they liked the first movie (which I haven't seen btw). The main issues are:*painfully* slow. The movie literally feels like it's in realtime.consequently too longAfter an hour of minimal progression in the storyline, I had to turn it off. I couldn't sit through another 2 hours of that. No way! I wasted my money purchasing it.If you really feel the urge to watch it, look for a free version.",Blade Runner 2049

379,youthandyoungmanhood,Excellent show but a slow burn,8,24 June 2018,"I can see why some people didn't like this film, it is incredibly slow at times. It looks amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and some of the performances are excellent. The story is hard to follow at times and it needs a few watches. Be patient with this one!",Blade Runner 2049
380,Dello_,"Fantastic visuals, slow but engaging",9,12 February 2020,"I had some problems with its predecessor even though I liked it, instead I found this one very remarkable and it was great. The aesthetics is phenomenal and the settings are outstanding. I wasn't a fan of the design of the 2019 Los Angeles but the 30 year gap made me appreciate a lot the 2049 version. Probably it's because the newer one is closer to the modern taste but whatever. What I liked more about this ""Blade Runner 2049"" was the plot itself: it was interesting and slow (but this wasn't a problem). Instead the lower paced rhythm was great because it served the narrative better with a slow but inevitable going forward, which leads to more and more dangerous situations. And I also found that this sequel is a lot more symbolic than the original. An example is the figure of the child that is talked about as Messiah, resembling Jesus Christ or the Virgilio's ""puer"". And finally I also really appreciate the action that is grounded and brutal, very distant from the superhero standard.
Overall ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a great movie but it's not for everyone: if you are able to appreciate the slow pacing it will be very enjoyable and worth watching, but if not this movie will bore you extremely.",Blade Runner 2049
381,evan_harvey,It's okay,7,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049. Saw it Saturday night in Xtreme screen at Hoyts Woden. No spoilers.Short: It was okay. Long, slow, with some gorgeous visuals. An interesting plot that extends beyond the original film in a new and inventive way. Ryan Gosling is a terrible actor. Zero facial expressions or emotion. Harrison Ford is old. Musical score is way, way inferior to Vangelis' work on the original. It's a good sequel, but an average film.Long: The story is interesting, and expands on the original film in a good way. My friend found it predictable at times, but I was intrigued for most of it. It's a long film, and I'm not sure that was a good thing. It really fails to build the world that the original created, although there are a few throw-back shots that you'll recognise if you're paying attention. Aside from a few random sparse scenes, you never get a feel for the larger universe. The original did. This one doesn't. It lends itself to a very lonely feel, maybe designed to reflect the main character's state. This is a good thing, but it still feels empty.The characters are a bit half-assed. The main villains are pretty one-dimensional, although their motivations make sense. There's no lines as profound as Roy's final dialogue from the original to be found here. In fact, there's very little depth to be found at all. Ryan Gosling brings no emotion to the character at all. As far as the rest of them, at least one character dies and there's zero repercussions. That makes the story feel kind of slapped together for convenience's sake.The cinematography is great. Wide shots, great colour palette. Looks brilliant on the big screen.The music, as before noted, is vastly inferior to Vangelis' score. This one is loud, chair shaking, a tad instrusive, but also lacks character and memorability.Overall? Yeah, it's okay. It's not great, but not bad either. It'll appeal to some and not to others. I am happy to recommend it, but not enthusiastically. Apparently they're planning a sequel, and if it's good, this will be a great bridge between the two. If not, it's an oddly thin romp through an unexplored world.Finally: Is Deckard a replicant?",Blade Runner 2049

383,Brevin_Campbell,A surprisingly enjoyable flick,6,4 November 2017,"So I did not like the original Blade Runner. I saw it a bit ago before I saw this movie. I kinda thought it had some cool ideas in it and I enjoyed the characters, but I never loved it the way I wanted to as a big sci fi fan. Along with that I have never really liked Dennis V's film I did not like Prisoners or Sicario much at all, but at the same time as a sci fi junkie I knew I wouldn't be able to help myself and with the recent Ghost in the Shell movie that came out I knew I had to see after that. And Im glad I did cause this movie is pretty enjoyable. I did not think it was the greatest film ever like most critics say it is, but it deals with a lot of interesting ideas and Ryan Gosling dies a exceptional job as this new replicant character who we have to follow now. Also you do not need to see the first Blade Runner to like this movie. The movie does a great job catching new viewers up on the events of the first one so that you can enjoy this one as its own movie. It doesn't feel like it is trying to set up a franchise either. It is defiantly its own thing and as that I kinda really liked it. I thought Jared Leto also did a fine job in his scenes. He was not playing the Joker in this movie. His role was pretty intense and pretty contained. Defiantly found it to be a solid performance from this star. Also Ana de Armas who plays the AI has a really emotional relationship with K that I found to be really good as well. It was a really interesting bond that I wanted to see more of throughout the film. And Sylvia Hoekswas like OMG. She was probably my favorite performance in the whole film. She was truly frightening.Overall I highly enjoyed this film. Did I think it was the greatest thing ever..no I did not, but with so much against it I felt it came out on top for me.",Blade Runner 2049
384,boe_dye,Stunning: An aural and visual experience,10,24 October 2017,"The best way to start off with understanding Blade Runner is to point out that it is not for the casual sci-fi goer. This isn't Firefly, or Doctor Who, or whatever flavor of the month generic cosplay, comic-con, fanboy chic pseudo wannabe nerds get excited about. You have to be patient, you have to pay attention, you have to be intelligent and understand the themes that it is trying to present. You can't be playing it in the background or be distracted by your phone -- you are either watch, or you waste your time.This is deep sci-fi that envelops you and challenges you with a deep and engrossing story. It builds the world in a way that takes time and patience. It is a labor of love, and you can tell simply by it's use of models and miniatures, and not relying on CGI gimmicks (though there are elements of CGI, it is more like makeup on an already beautiful woman, and not lipstick on a pig).The other wonderful thing about this film is that you don't have to know or understand anything about the previous Blade Runner as this movie is it's own entity. It's not a sequel, at least not directly, but more on the order of what The Next Generation was to The Original Series.Unfortunately there is an element that does pull one out from the fantastical world, and that is Jared Leto. Leto is hit or miss for me, and while he is pretty to look at and I very much do enjoy 30 Seconds to Mars, his portrayal of Wallace was rigid and forced. David Bowie was originally slated to portray Niander Wallace however Bowie's untimely demise put a small hiccup in that plan. I almost feel that they should have replaced Bowie with an older British fellow, maybe a Peter Capaldi or even better, Jude Law, instead of Jared Leto who perpetually looks like he is 20 to play someone who has seen some years.I'm not terribly surprised that this movie did not break box office records; I believe world wide it broke a little more than even. In a culture where you almost need to have political statements, social justice, and lens flares just to keep people's attention for more than 10 seconds, how do you sell a masterpiece when all people are used to is pop-art? To be sure it did not ""do well"", however I can almost guarantee that in 30 years no one will be talking about today's new Star Wars or Marvel Movies, but like the previous Blade Runner 30 years prior, people will still be talking about this and that is what makes a classic, that is what separates consumers and connoisseurs.",Blade Runner 2049
385,nzswanny,Futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars.,10,4 October 2017,"To be honest with the reader of this review, I had never seen the first Blade Runner however it had been near the top of my ""must- watch"" science fiction movie list in my head for a very long while now and I decided to watch this movie expecting an exciting sci-fi blockbuster with action-packed car chases rolling in all over the place. Surprisingly this film was not the ""good action-packed popcorn fun for the whole family"" that I was expecting and the film actually takes the slower, more patient and realistic approach with it's storytelling rather than a lot of car chases and rushed editing. This is a very similar film to the likes of A Fistful Of Dollars because the main character, Ryan Gosling, resembles the personality of Clint Eastwood's character in A Fistful Of Dollars, the musical score carries away the movie like A Fistful Of Dollars, the pacing remains slow however manages successfully to keep our interest like A Fistful Of Dollars and the film carries an incredibly dark, bleak tone much like A Fistful Of Dollars. I'm glad I saw this movie earlier than most people because then I can write a good review for this movie so that more people can consider watching it before the negative remarks start coming in. Before those come in, let me remind you that this movie is pure, bleak, raw and dark science-fiction to the core that goes with the dedication to telling a story rather than the dedication to kill as much people as possible. It goes with the more slow approach which some people may find a bad thing but others like me will find a good thing. But I think something all viewers will respect here in this movie is the intense cinematography that is common in a lot of other Denis Villeneuve movies and the fascinating special effects as well as the subtle performances by Ryan Gosling who understands the character he is playing and doesn't overdo it. Ryan Gosling's character is an interesting one because although he is emotionless and straight- forward we, as the viewers, can detect that there is more to this character and throughout the movie we slowly start to see a bit more of his own self. Blade Runner 2049 focuses mostly on the main character and if you are going to see this movie expecting Harrison Ford to have a lot of screen time that is similar to the length of Ryan Gosling's screen time, you're very wrong because Harrison Ford only plays a minor role in this movie which is, although important, not the main focus of the movie. Even if someone can view this movie as a science-fiction movie, someone can also view this movie as a character piece instead depending on their preference because of how much dedicated focus is on the main character.When the movie was finished and all was done, despite the reasonably long runtime I still felt that the movie should of been even longer. Because I don't like to be sentimental I gave myself thirty seconds and then I got up from my chair and walked out as the credits rolled despite me still being in a very deep emotional zone however I want you to know that the emotional zone was almost impossible to get out of. As I was walking out I still saw a person watching the credits in his chair and I understood that he was also in a very deep emotional state and people usually do that so that they look cool to their friends, but the person I saw really was in an emotional zone - I could tell. I could also tell that I wasn't the only one that enjoyed this movie in the room and I was relieved because I was a bit afraid that people wouldn't like it because of it's more slower approach than other science-fiction movies. I was incredibly glad that someone else understood the style of the movie.I'm not going to spoil any more of the movie but I will leave a last note to say that Blade Runner 2049 is an incredibly dark and intense movie that is probably one of the best science-fiction movies I've seen that has been made in the last five years so it very much is a masterpiece. If a futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars sounds bloody good to you, then you'd be killing yourself if you didn't pay this movie a visit at your nearest cinema. In my personal opinion, the film was most definitely a masterpiece and it has me even more excited for seeing the original starring Harrison Ford in the main role.",Blade Runner 2049
386,hooma814,Great movie even for someone who isn't a fan,8,18 December 2020,"Blade Runner is one of those movies that has a very strong cult following with people who are disgusted if you haven't seen it or don't like it. For that reason I'd stayed clear and being someone born in 1990 it also was past my time (although many people born after the original Blade Runner have of course enjoyed it), many of the strong followers grew up with the original. It also carried with it the uncertainties of what the 2000's might bring in this balance of dystopia or utopia. It's quite a different experience watching the original in the year that it was actually set knowing full well what 2019 looks like. This is totally different from what watching it in the 1980's would've been like. In the same way the movie quality has improved so much that these movies can struggle to hold their own over a 40 year period. In saying that I did enjoy the original, not as much as others clearly have. For many of the same reasons others may have enjoyed the original I really enjoyed the next instalment in Blade Runner 2049. It was much more relatable for my experience and watching it in 2020 rather than 2049 makes a big difference not knowing what 2049 will look like. The music, acting, costume, CGI and world design itself were all excellent. Great movie.",Blade Runner 2049

388,margulanabutrlov,Blade Runner 2049 Review,9,23 March 2019,"Officer KD6-3.7 (Gosling) is a Blade Runner: a specialised detective/assassin tasked with hunting down bio-engineered humans known as replicants - mainly the old, discontinued but long-lived Nexus 8 models still at large. After encountering a Nexus 8 (Bautista) on a protein farm, K discovers a buried box of bones which reveal a potentially world-shaking secret. One which requires him to hunt down an entirely new kind of quarry...
There are tears in Blade Runner 2049, and there is rain. In its sunlight-starved Californian megatropolis, luridly haired denizens eat East Asian street food, brandish transparent brollies and are dwarfed by adverts promising a new life in distant colonies they can't afford to reach. Eyeballs feature prominently, as do obscurely distressing psychological tests and vocally controlled analogue gadgets. Identity and memory, meanwhile, remain as questionable as the concept of humanity is fluid.
It may be 30 years on from the events of Blade Runner, but we are still very much in the same murky, unsettling and engrossing world. One that was teased from the pages of Philip K. Dick by David Peoples and Hampton Fancher (the latter returning for script duties alongside Logan writer Michael Green) and beamed indelibly onto popular culture by Ridley Scott (now executive producing), with the significant input of visual futurist Syd Mead (back on board, too) and synth-soundscape crafter Vangelis - notably absent here, but faithfully channelled by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch.
Much has changed during those three decades, though. Earth's ecosystem has collapsed, with the world crippled and reliant on replicant-tended protein farms. And the Tyrell Corporation - responsible for those renegade ""skin jobs"" and the remarkable Rachael - has long-since gone bankrupt, bought out and reskinned as the Wallace Corporation, which keeps the Terran underclass sustained with synthetic gruel and titillated by sexy holographic companions.
Things have changed behind the camera, too. The '82 dream team of Scott and DP Jordan Cronenweth has made way for Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and master cinematographer Roger Deakins, who collaborated to such impressive visual effect on Sicario and Prisoners. While the aforementioned continuity ensures that 2049 jacks in directly to the first film - far deeper than the much-heralded return of Harrison Ford as original skinjob-retirer Deckard - Villeneuve and Deakins (along with production designer Dennis Gassner) provide an invaluably fresh set of peepers. The colossal opening vista, for example, presents a rural dystopia in mist-pale daylight, rather than the black-skied urban Hades of Blade Runner. Officer K (yes, as in 'Philip K. Dick', Easter egg fans) has to follow his troubling trail of synthetic breadcrumbs outside Los Angeles' distended city limits, into a San Diego reduced to a rust-crusted shanty junkyard and an irradiated Ozymandias-eque necropolis that was once Las Vegas.
His investigation - both philosophical and physical - is slow, deliberate and arguably ponderous. This is not an action film. We are not here to witness balletic, vertiginous action sequences - leave that to the far shallower Ghost In The Shell. When violence occurs, it is brief and brutal. And with the movie running north of two-and-a-half hours, 2049 requires a robust attention span as much as it does concentration. It is uncompromising and uncommercial; the original, after all, did not earn its esteem by smashing the box office. Its audience did not rush to Blade Runner, but once they arrived they were smitten for life. And it's clearly for them above all others that the sequel has been made.
So unlike the recent Alien universe instalments, it is blessedly free of ham-fisted, Ridley-knows-best revisionism and thick-headed characters driving the plot forward with bad decisions. Sure, it's a homage, shamelessly repeating Blade Runner beats and echoing familiar scenarios, but it's done respectfully and delicately. And beautifully, too. In fact, it's unlikely you'll see a better-looking film this year. As a must-see-on-IMAX experience, it's the equal of Dunkirk. Every stop on K's swerving, bruising, bewildering and occasionally surreal journey is a towering work of art. That vast screen will swallow you up and draw you deep into an impeccably envisioned black-mirror reality that you'll not want to leave, for all its deadly and unsavoury peculiarities. It's so sensually impressive, it's hard not to gush. If Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this, then the universe is clearly broken.
However, it's not quite a perfect product. Gripes are sparse, but do include an inessential cameo that feels too much like tacked-on fan-servicing, and Jared Leto as God-complex-suffering, monologue-prone industrialist Niander Wallace. The scenery's just too gorgeous to have him chewing on it like he does.
More happily, we can report that Gosling is perfect casting as K, Villeneuve optimising the La La Lander's reluctant charisma and half-smile, just as Nicolas Winding Refn did for Drive - though K is far from a blank presence. And if you think Ford is on easy territory as yet another timeworn version of a classic character he could play in his sleep, think again. This is possibly the best performance of his career, Deckard's situation testing the veteran actor in ways we've rarely seen before.
Villeneuve must be fearless, to have been willing to push Ford like that. In a sequel to a movie that we thought was untouchable, no less.

389,Field78,This is how you make a worthy sequel: by expanding it in every direction,9,16 October 2017,"Blade Runner has long been tough love for me. The first time I saw it I was almost bored to death by it, but since everybody kept saying what an absolute classic it was, I kept revisiting it. Somehow, there was this nagging feeling that I was missing out on something great. Of course I could see that it was superbly made on the art direction level, but I estimate that it took me about 5 or 6 times before I fully grasped the pure sci-fi themes at its core: what makes us human, and what excludes an artificial human from that qualification? Like all truly great art, Blade Runner has many layers and different qualities, and doesn't reveal its secrets all at once.It is not hard to imagine why Denis Villeneuve was daunted by the task to make a worthy successor to this cult movie. It is also easy to see that he succeeded incredibly well: Blade Runner 2049, like Aliens, Terminator 2 and Empire Strikes Back, is one of those rare movies that isn't just a great movie, it's also a great sequel. The best compliment I could give would be that it feels like a completely organic and logical follow-up to its predecessor, a natural second chapter, as if it were already conceived together with the original, rather than afterwards. Both Villeneuve and producer Ridley Scott said they were won over by a great script. Now this is something every filmmaker says before delivering a sub-par sequel (Wes Craven reportedly said the same about Scream 4), but in this case, it couldn't be more true.Good sequels use familiar parts, add some new, and in exceptional cases, they create something that casts a different light on its predecessor(s). Unlike The Force Awakens, Villeneuve doesn't rely on the classic elements from the very start (apart from he close-up of an eye). He opens with brightly lit shots from greenhouses on the countryside as opposed to a dark city skyline, and he even resists temptation to use the familiar sound from the flying Spinner cars. After re-introducing us to the harsh world of the future where humans have de-humanized and Replicants have no rights, he occasionally allows himself some familiar iconography, with sweeping shots of downtown LA, its seedy underbelly and the Tyrell pyramid; even Harrison Ford is sparingly used with maximum efficiency. The makers show remarkable restraint in a film that could have easily ended up becoming a quick re-hash; instead, it differentiates itself starkly by visiting the uncharted territories, both in its story and in the art-direction. The main plot deals with detective K trying to unearth a long-hidden secret, but again, those who read between the lines will see the implicit theme being explored here: is denying a race of Replicants their fundamental rights as beings on the grounds of the fact that they are manufactured instead of born not akin to slavery? Hampton Fancher and Michael Green did a superb job of including two survivors from the previous movie into the story, not as a fan service but as a logical extension of their journey. K (Ryan Gosling) becomes a reluctant player in the story, and part of his journey is finding out what exact role he plays in it. Another part is how K must find his place in a world where 'real' seems less clearly defined than ever. In his delightful scenes with Ana de Armas as his companion Joi, the human side of his stoic persona comes out, and it puts an interesting spin on the concept of 'what is real' when even Replicants seem to struggle with it. Some of the more touching scenes are pleasantly reminiscent of Spike Jonze's 'Her', and themes from Children Of Men, another superb movie inspired by Blade Runner's grim version of a dying future, are also quite overt. It is good to see that Blade Runner's spiritual successors have influenced its sequel in turn. Like true world-builders, Villeneuve and director of photography Roger Deakins show us the stark contrasts between the overpopulated city, the worn-out industrial outskirts and the almost surrealistic remains of Las Vegas. Combined with the slow-paced editing, this creates a sense of immersion that is rare in today's cinema. The sets and surroundings almost become like secondary characters in this set-up. Some might complain a bit about the excessive running time of over 2.5 hours, and in some scenes (especially the ones that focus on K's personal life), the tension sometimes trails off a bit too long at the expense of important subplots. But kudos for a director and a studio who dare to deliver a product much like its predecessor: an expansive, subtle, humane, cerebral, slow-burning blockbuster that feels no need to cater to audiences longing for lean, action-packed storytelling wrapped up in a neat climax. The satisfaction from 2049 not only comes from what it shows, but just as much from what it leaves out; not in the least in its beautifully subdued epilogue. 2049 is a work of art that may even surpass the original, although I say that with some reservation, recognizing the amazing groundwork that the first film laid down. It's just that 2049 feels more complete, whereas Blade Runner, despite its many versions, sometimes seems enigmatic in the sense that some crucial parts still feel missing. The ending of 2049 can work on its own, but it could also be an opportunity for a successor that elaborates on the parts that are now merely subplots. The disappointing box office may crush that hope in its early stages; again, it may show that the popularity of a movie reflects the passion of its fans, and not necessarily the size of its audience. The overseas markets may give the film the success it deserves, but even if this is the final word, this makes 2049 a more than worthy companion piece for the fans.",Blade Runner 2049

The first time I saw it was about 10 years ago. I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I like to watch some of the older classics that came out before I was born. The first was iconic and was a great movie.I honestly thought this one was better. The story was great. It had the same vibe with the dark music and the rainy LA streets. A world with Replicants. What a great story. Ryan Gosling was amazing in this movie. Anna De Armis too. Phenomenal sequel. I don't understand why people thought this was boring. It was excellent.,Blade Runner 2049

Ford was outstanding.If I have one complaint about this film, it's that it's a bit too in love with its visuals, so its pace is too deliberate and plodding for me. When Ford's Deckard character finally makes his entrance the film picks up the pace, and I perked up a bit. But it might be too late for some people.This Blade Runner world is as rich and engaging as the previous '80s film-- complete with dreariness and grayness galore. It has its regular scruffy-looking replicants and even deeper questions about what it means to be human.I like Gosling, but he was usually devoid of emotion in this film. Ford picks up the slack and adds more than enough flesh tones to reel in that slack. The supporting cast is great, and the story is immersive.

395,fdbjr,Lacking Intelligence - SPOILER,2,7 October 2017,"No complaints about the casting, performance, or any of that, and special kudos to Ana de Armas who is luminous. The special effects are persuasive. So what's the problem?Like too many of Villeneuve's movies, this one is incredibly . . . dumb. NONE of the projections made about the world of 2049 make any sense at all. (This was not a problem with the original). Between now and then, we are asked to believe society will create an entire race of replicant human beings, the climate will be uniformly gray and dreary, all traces of urban sophistication or beauty will disappear, and all of this (of course) accepted without a whimper I'll leave the absurdities about climate and environment and focus on one thing - artificial intelligence. We DO have it, right now, and it has nothing to do with human DNA. It takes the form of robots made of plastic and metal elements, doing repetitive mindless work that human beings used to do, which is great for the time being, but poses a problem for the future. There aren't replicants now, there are never going to be, which makes the whole futuristic scenario an exercise in futility.SPOILER - by miles the worst scene is when the replicant detective (Gosling) stumbles in to an orphanage in which these poor little tykes are working in dark, claustrophobic conditions. Are you kidding me? Not only are these Dickensian scenes 150 years out of date, but any manufacturer is going to find regular robots far more efficient than a passel of children.All this may sound picky, but it's not. I love science fiction, but you have to have premises that relate to realistic social or human conditions. These don't. I strongly suspect Villeneuve came up with this implausible scenario so we can be told that 'no society ever succeeded other than on the basis of enforced labor' - dead wrong - and other holier-than-thou statements. The picture ends up having the same, narky feel as 'Incendies' or 'Prisoners', which is not where you want to be,Dystopian drama? Sure. Dystopian fantasy? Who needs that - which is why this movie is a grossly miscalculated boondoggle.",Blade Runner 2049
396,texshelters,Blade Runner 2049 doesn't Completely Disappoint,6,19 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049: It wasn't the terrible replicant I expectedBlade Runner 2049 is too slow for some, too confusing for others, and too repetitive for many. But few argue that it doesn't look fantastic! BR 49 packs in a lot into one film; it could have been two installments. My film-mates said it could have been a series, and that West World covered a lot of the same themes, but more in depth. I, however, don't want to watch a full season of a series to just get mildly interested, i.e. West World, Ozark, Game of Thrones, at the end of the season. And of the three, I will watch GoT one day. It's not going anywhere. Strangely, some of the same people that sat through hours of characters yapping at each other while posing in costume thought BR 49 was slow. I like that BR 49 got right into the plot and was full of philosophical ideas about what makes one human and if replicants can evolve and are a separate species. Until you see the film, you won't know exactly what I mean. For my money, two films would have been better to fully develop the complex story and characters. A series would have been milking a dry cash cow. Profitable, sure, but entertaining? Not for me. The major premise that the film poses is that replicants are designed to be a slave work force for humans. We see that in the trailer. One problem is that in many ways, the human body and shape makes terrible analogues for workers. Look at a factory producing cars. The arms are not imitations of a human arm, just levers that can grab and place parts where needed. And, the arms have none of the rest of the useless parts humans have: torso, heart, lungs, legs, head. The other major problem that drives the plot is how to produce more replicants, faster. For what, we aren't sure, so I couldn't spoil that plot if I wanted to. They explain next to nothing about how replicants are produced in 2049, which could have been added in part one of a two part series, a duology. The 'evil' Tyrell corporation is gone, but replicants abound, newer versions. Also, there are holograms, very real holograms. And a fantastic, trippy ménage à trois scene worth the price of admission. Moreover, there is more AI in BR 49 than at a sci fi comic book convention. While BR 2049 put too much in one film, there are things I am happy they left out. There wasn't a huge battle for the survival of the planet at the end. There wasn't a huge shoot out where our hero 'K' kills eight-hundred of the enemy bare-handed or Decker is rejuvenated and kills nine- hundred replicants or... You get the point. There wasn't a sappy ending nor a happy ending. It ended in a thoughtful, somewhat predicable, manner. The music was excellent, but there was too much of it and it was often too loud. Yes, you can have too much of a good thing. The acting was mostly flat, though the human emoting wasn't horrible. The one dynamic combat replicant was the best character in the film. She has a nice set of action scenes. Did I say how fantastic the film looked?Another problem is that the film was way too depopulated. Some of the film occurs in urban Los Angeles, but the people are missing. However, there are enough buildings for millions of beings, both human and replicant. Was it too hard to find extras to dress up in futuristic fashion and mill about? Next time, call me. Rating: Matinée See it on the big screen to get the full effect of the visuals.

398,SpoodermanDerp,"""I didn't feel like I wasn't in the Blade Runner world even for a second""",10,14 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a triumph in atmospheric filmmaking, breathtakingly stunning visuals, and big-budget films in general. Director Denis Villeneuve has created a rare specimen of a film that knows how to take its time while having nuanced philosophical subtleties along with a huge budget at his disposal. It doesn't just build on the fully realized world the original in 1982 had, instead it builds its own living, breathing, and naturalistic world that leaves so much for the imagination to consume.Set 20 years after the original, 2049 manages to bring in wonderful performances and a distinct perspective to the world Ridley Scott first brought. Ryan Gosling plays a Blade Runner that provides a parallel to Deckard in the original film, but his performance brings in a subtle nuances that show the tangible implications of being a Blade Runner. Another important character in the film is the bleak, vast and lived in world of Los Angeles in 2049. The world in the film presents a deeply characterized lens that makes us question the so called humanity that resides in it. The characters of Joi and Lov, the former being a virtual holographic girlfriend and the latter being a straight up menacing badass add so much more to the mood and world that they live in. Their presence begs questions like what is the role artificiality plays in the duty they should partake and whether that is something that is real to begin with, and what is their position in the world and does it make them inferior to begin with if they can make us feel emotions? Despite all of this, at the center of it all is a mystery that truly taps in to the gray area of the wall between humanity and artificiality. The unique point of view that the film dispenses with its protagonist, Agent K, is one that drives home the messages and themes the original Blade Runner was known for but with enough new style and substance to bring in to the table. A lot of liberty was made to meticulously craft each detail and narrative beats in this movie. It's obvious from the get go that it wants to immerse you into the world and aesthetic that is 2049. Roger Deakins's cinematography is top notch and really revolutionizes the concept of atmospheric filmmaking. Details such as framing characters from windows showing how alienated and disillusioned they are in reality, breathtaking color palettes that fill up the cold and quiet nature of the scene, limited lighting to construct an almost dream- like feeling, and much more. The world of this film is absolutely fully realized, not for one fleeting moment in this 2 hour and 43 minute film did I feel like I wasn't in the world of Blade Runner.It's without a doubt that if the first Blade Runner wasn't for you, then this one won't be either. It's one that's rooted in philosophy and themes that aren't presented the same way this does compared to modern blockbuster films. It's a lot to take in, and it's been a week since I've fully come to terms with this review. It's definitely not yet time to call it a masterpiece, but soon enough it will be. There are themes, questions and performances from this movie that will be discussed for years to come and will definitely transcend this review. The story, without going in to much detail, is one that is worthy of multiple viewings, and that's a good thing. Films should strive to make audiences think about it for many years to come, and this film does it with flying neon colors. Verdict: 5/5",Blade Runner 2049
399,williamsonandcompany,How high do you have to be to watch this?,4,24 February 2020,The visual effects are great but my gosh this movie is so slow and pointless. 2 hours in to this as I write this and trying so hard not to turn it off.,Blade Runner 2049
400,Joejoesan,"Wait a minute, replicants can do... WHAT?",8,5 October 2017,"In science fiction the viewer must believe in a certain fantasy in order to enjoy the story that will be presented. In Back to the Future you must accept the fantasy that it is possible to travel through time. In E.T. you must accept the fact that aliens from other planets do exist.In Blade Runner 2049 the main story is all about a certain ability the replicants seem to have - and it's a totally absurd and unbelievable one. That and a few plot holes almost wreck the whole movie.In the end Blade Runner 2049 is saved by the incredible visuals and the love director Denis Villeneuve has for the original. There are many big and small scenes that refer to characters and situations in Blade Runner 1. The film brings back two characters from the original (beside Deckard) and the second one is actually very well done. The now famous Vangelis soundtrack also plays a major part at the end. The first encounter between Gosling and Harrison Ford is an absolute delight, just like the performance of newcomer Sylvia Hoeks (who makes us Dutchies very proud). The film is long - almost three hours - and could have used a shorter cut. Blade Runner 2049 certainly does not surpass the original, but it's a courageous effort that's worth seeing in the cinema, especially in 3D IMAX.

401,delightful-life,If sinthetic humans could breed?,7,19 January 2018,"The plot - In the first 10 mins of the movie Ryan Gosling who is a police officer (a synthetic/artificially engineered human which obeys orders without exception) who is tasked with killing very old synthetic humans (synth) that have not been programmed to obey orders (without exception) finds that such a synth had given birth to a baby. This is almost a miracle and the rest of the very long (almost 3hr) movie is about following leads to find that baby.The sci-fi technology in this movie is what I liked best. It has been done in a very natural manner and this movie is worth seeing just for that.The visuals, though very nice, somehow I did not like that much. It felt like they were too full of themselves, forced, and a little too much.They should not have bought in Harrison Ford, somehow he was looking pathetic. He even has a fight with Gosling, which was so awkward and had no meaning to the story.Gosling is his regular self (cool acting), but the other characters were trying too hard to be sophisticated.And the ending is not good (atleast for me). It was incredibly anti-climactic (its here that I could clearly see that the primary purpose of this movie was the visuals and to use the 'Blade Runner' name to make a little money, it was a forced story, that they somehow concocted and and use visuals which are now mainstream to somehow hide that there was no real story.There are not many good movies nowadays, so I still recommend watching it.In time this movie will come down to a 7.5 rating (now 8.3).

402,robertmaybeth,"I'm still conflicted about this wonderfully dark movie and that's okay,",9,15 June 2018,"I wasn't a fan of the first Blade Runner. The context was too ambiguous, the rules and customs of the mythos too dark and too mysterious, the characters impenetrable. What even ARE ""Replicants""? This was a question ""Blade Runner"" never really answered. Are they robots? Are they people? Are they mutated humans? Deckard has long conversations with Rachel, a Replicant he's in love with, I didn't quite know how to take that. Was Rachel just a very sophisticated robot, a hybrid, or human? If Replicants are just ""genetically engineered humans"" why do they have no rights and no social status? Is Deckard even human, and if so, what's he doing falling in love with a being he's supposed to be in charge of ""retiring""? ""Blade Runner 2049"" answers none of those questions, and in fact raises even more - but I loved it anyway. Despite not really being a satisfying depiction of the world of ""Blade Runner"", this movie works. There is of course, lots of things wrong with this movie that kept this film from being a box office hit. But I have to admire Ridley Scott and company for not taking the easy route and just making a dumbed-down film just to make a blockbuster. This movie had a whole lot of thought behind it, and it shows in the pacing and deliberately murky story. The movie raises a whole bunch of questions yet answers only a few of them - the rest is left to your imagination, and a few small clues you can glean from the minimalist dialogue. I can't describe it any better then the other people have already done - but I'll add that this is a movie you have to be in just the right mood to appreciate. ""BR 2049"" does a whole lot with very little - so little it is downright frustrating at times - and leaves the story wide open for another sequel. Unfortunately, we may never get it - but if Ridley sees fit to make another I'll be first in line to see it. Once seen, the world of ""Blade Runner"" is not easy to forget.",Blade Runner 2049

Nothing ever happens in it and every character is pretentious as cr**. But mostly that scene where Joe pretends that he is banging Joi, the hologram chick when in fact he is banging the hooker. Joi and the hooker actually sync up before the bang and I do not mean their menstrual cycles but it involves some AI stuff. The one thing that separates said movie with The Handmaid's Tale is this movie does not have the weird feminism propaganda. I am all for feminism and girl power and all that but do not go about hating all men except probably the director of this film cause he has it coming. The film was horrible and I think he knew it so he just added female nudity to distract us men from said fact. I mean he went so far as to erecting (The pun was a happy accident) giant statues of naked women. He pretty much exploited Ana de Armas who is damn hot by the way and naked half the time in this movie (Sorry Ana de Armas for objectifying you like that) and not in the West world kind of way which is sexy at first but you get used to it like an art assignment. This movie is two hours too long. Also it took a cult classic like the original 1982 Blade Runner (Please go watch that movie instead folks) and made an unnecessary sequel without vision.

I thought his performance here was listless and wholly without passion. He can do much better than what he gives us in this broken-down wreck of a movie.

411,pazu7,An elaborate fan-fiction that somehow manages to completely miss the point.,7,8 January 2018,"The thing is, Blade Runner didn't need a sequel. And even if it did, this wouldn't be it. It's not a 'bad' film. It's actually very scenic. Beautiful to look at. And the story is interesting. It's just not good enough to be a continuation of Blade Runner. Like Omar sez, 'if you come at the King, you best not miss'. If you're going to follow up on a classic like BR, you'd better bring it. Blade Runner is a poem. BR 2049 is a lengthy essay with liner notes. I've read a some people saying that BR had a complicated story line. No. The setting was complicated. The story is actually rather simple when you deconstruct it: (lite spoilers) Harrison Ford is a bounty hunter who wants to retire. He's forced in for one more job and meets a girl. For all the sci-fi it's still noir. Everything else is the setting BR 2049 however has a complicated and, imo, cumbersome storyline. I will not spoil it because, in spite of my criticism, I think it's actually worth a view. But the story is elaborate and there are twists and turns which provoke a lot of unnecessary and awkward exposition. In the original, except for the narration in the theatrical release (which was dropped in subsequent versions) the dialog did not get stuck in expositional meandering. But BR 2049 loads twists on top of complexity and misdirection and even after all that, it really never captures what was great about the first film. You will find nothing even close to Rutger Hauer's iconic death soliloquy in this new film. The dialog is borderline rote.The real beauty of the original is Ridley's Scotts visual and sonic poetry. It has genuine and original atmosphere which is strange and familiar at the same time. Scott's use of light and shadow creates haunting scenes. It's so beautiful you could watch it with the sound off... (but then you 'd miss the wonderful Vangelis score, which produced a hit, ""Love Theme from Blade Runner"".) BR takes its future setting for granted, and instead spends its theatrical energy introducing you to the people who occupy the realm. BR 2049 looks good, but seems to be constantly reminding you 'this is the future! Look at all the cool gadgets."" And that sets you outside the story. Last note: the original Blade Runner has no villains. Everyone is caught up in the currents of their various situations. They're all doing what they think they need to do to survive. Rutger Hauer is a bad guy... until you really understand his back story. And there is a underlying tone of tragedy to all the violence. But BR 2049 features a psychotic villain who everybody wants to see die. There's no nuance to that character. There's no tragedy in any of the violence.In a weird way, BR 2049 is itself a 'replicant'. It looks like a Blade Runner film, even has a couple of the original characters nestled into the storyline... but it doesn't feel real. Not awful by any means but doesn't have anything like the creative fire necessary to bear the title 'Blade Runner'. It was enjoyable but ... 'unnecessary'; continued the story in a way that was complex and clumsy and not needed. The fate of the original characters was better left to the imagination.BR 2049 is like an elaborate fan-fiction that somehow manages to completely miss the point.",Blade Runner 2049
412,shivamt25,Probably the best we have seen this year,9,15 October 2017,"For me this is the best this year. And yes, I have seen Dunkirk. Denis Villeneuve is the new rising star who has constantly surprised us with exceptional direction. Blade runner, just like Arrival, seems out of the world. It's almost 3 hours long but I just didn't want it to end. It reminded me of Gravity. I didn't want to miss even one scene. It was captivating. It was new in all sense, but there was a hint of the original which made it memorable. The cast was well suited, with Ryan Gosling giving a ravishing performance. This creative venture is going to stay for long in people's mind as it is definitely a classic. I urge everyone to go and watch it in theatre as it is an experience worth your time. The movie is struggling on box office as it does not appeal to mass audience. But still I will ask them to give it a chance for the shear pleasure of watching stunning visuals which this film has captured and also, the music, which is the soul of this movie.",Blade Runner 2049
413,DVR_Brale,Visually magnificent drama with complex narrative,9,23 April 2018,"Most of the SF movies I've seen so far don't put enough emphasis on what an everyday life would look like in the near or far future. Blade Runner 2049 is different. Besides developing a story suitable for academic debates, Villeneuve really draws you in the futuristic world with punctilious detail. Depending on how much you're able to notice and appreciate those details will determine how much you get to enjoy the movie. And depending on how much you're able to scrutinize philosophical elements in the narrative will determine how much you appreciate it in the long run. So, if you want to get a full experience of BR 2049 you first have to carefully watch it and afterwards give your self some time and think about the story and problems it raises. That explains why there are so many cursory reviews with bad rating here on IMDb. Let's face it: this movies simply isn't made for the masses. BR 2049 is slow-paced, dark, visually absolutely stunning SF drama set in Brave New World type of setting. Story is of course connected with the original so despite others claiming otherwise, it's important that you first see the original. And that's all you have to know about it. Let me only mention that a lot of debates concerning neuroscience and what is called neurophilosophy are in front of us. That being said, this movie is only going to be more and more relevant plus we can expect more movies like this one. If you're interested in those topics, equip yourself with patience and be sure to give this movie a shot.",Blade Runner 2049
414,M0vieL0ver,"You better watch the first Blade Runner before seeing this, and even then...",7,9 October 2017,"If you did not see the first Blade Runner, this movie just will not make sense to you.Like the first one, it is a very simple storyline with a lot of fat wrapped around it. Fat as in a lot of time, slow-pace, scenes without dialogue, moody scenes and far-reaching horizons, and on and on. It worked so much better in the the first, something was off in this sequel.The mood of the movie was about right. The visuals were decent.You weren't as engaged as in the first, and the actors weren't convincing. Like they were all just reading their lines. You had no connections, not even to Gosling, who I like very much normally.The music was mostly okay, but then every once in a while the loud odd grunge-like noise would hit and it didn't seem to fit. When you are interrupted and actually stop to think ""hey, weird music there"", it's not working.You can easily fall asleep during this movie. I NEVER fall asleep in any movie but amazingly nodded for a few seconds in this one. At an early showing. Make sure you are wide awake and caffeinated. The movie is way too long.The other oddity is the number of breasts throughout. From naked avatars to prostitutes to newborn replicants to statues from an old ""Vegas"", what was the point? Replace all the breasts with just the male package and think what the movie would be like. Odd. Gratuitous and dumb. (and not good timing given the Hollywood news headlines these days)The evil guy didn't work either. I don't know why I'm giving this a 7. But I couldn't give it a 6.5, which may be too generous. We can be happy there was a real story here and the overall mood was set, otherwise I would have given the movie a zero. The ideas and concepts and themes are worth thinking about and discussing with friends or family.The 3D doesn't matter and hardly contributes. It's just a bit of fun here and there.",Blade Runner 2049
415,sujanfaster,Visually stunning. Emotionally Brilliant.,9,20 October 2017,"Making sequels/reboots of the famous movies can always have a risk factor of its own. Especially if the first movie was a decade ago or much older. Only Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a successful example of such case in the recent times. But it was heavily backed by some good publicity and loyal fan following. Blade Runner 2049 came with huge expectations and it risked it all. Although the first movie had a cult status, it didn't necessarily have a great storyline. But the sequel stands out to be one of the best movies of the 2017 (also a critics' favorite) with hard hitting screenplay and brilliant storytelling.Come 2049, the whole scenario around the replicants and humans have changed again. As the new Blade Runner, K a replicant himself is on a mission hunting down old replicants. However K, has a bit of his own feelings too although he tries to avoid them most times. Things start to take a turn when K digs too much deep into a case on his own and starts discovering some unusual things. As the Replicant making corporation Wallace (yes, its not Tyrell this time) and LAPD try to hunt K and also look for some answers things start getting messy. In his quest for answers, K meets the former Blade Runner Deckard who is living isolated and does not trust anyone. Many answers and some shocking truths reveal themselves as the Wallace corp continues to hunt K and Deckard. It might seem like a regular revenge action plot as K and Deckard meet, but it is much more than that.Running for almost 150 odd minutes this movie is quite lengthy for modern day standards. However there is an absolute attention to detail given to every frame of the movie so as to make it look very intense and beautiful. The movies shows no matter how futuristic the technology can be, the problems that everyone has deep down is very human. The movie resembles the tone of the old Blade Runner initially with the location and cinematography but after a while the movie slowly catches onto a different tone. Ryan Reynolds completely drives this film with his stunning performance as the Replicant/Blade Runner, K. This character is tailor made for someone who doesn't need to express too much but can still convey a lot of emotions. Other top billed actors Harrison Ford, Robin Wright and Jared Leto do justice to their roles. But it's the two different female characters which steal the show along with K. K's holographic girlfriend Joi played by Ana De Armas and Wallace corporation's Assassin/assistant Luv played by Sylvia Hoeks. Both of these characters are very different in their own way and are very well written and exceptionally performed. Hats off to director Denis Villeneuve for creating such an emotionally sound masterpiece.Blade Runner 2049 is a must watch if you are true lover of the cinema as an art and appreciate every little detail of it. It is not just another action sequel of a previous blockbuster, but it is cinema craftsmanship at its best.",Blade Runner 2049
416,chiguy17,Why blame Ridley?,2,8 June 2018,"Ok, I didn't care for the film, either. For all the boundless options a sci-fi future world holds, there's no action or imagination - just a few cool gadgets. The one thing I found funny, and this is more a critique of the reviews here than the actual movie, is how everyone is blaming Ridley Scot for basically the downfall of cinema. You have IMDb, but somehow didn't notice that he wasn't involved in writing, directing, or producing the film? Yeah, it's a boring, pointless movie, but the only connection Ridley has to the film is his involvement with the original ""Blade Runner"".

417,randomStuff101,Sensitive New Age Blade Runner,6,31 January 2018,"Seen it twice. It's flawed with nice sound design and music that sounds great with sub woofer.Nice visuals at times. Thankfully the camera is steady not hyperactive, although sometimes the cutting is a bit too frequent where the editing jumps around for small bits of action.They aim for intensity and atmosphere, and often satisfies, but not without a few stumbles. In terms of plot and pace there are some laborious scenes, drawn out, or overemphasized with futuristic theatrics. Story is interesting, but there's a certain 'forced' narrative at times. Some elements seem packaged.It's enjoyable, but design at times is too theatrical and overdone. For example, the water reflection walls, and drama in those scenes is overdone. They should make a TV series, it would allow things to be explored in more depth.There's also contradictions to deal with, which will cause confusion for many on the first viewing who have not followed closely the connections between characters.",Blade Runner 2049

My expectation was high but it surpasses my expectations to become the best film of the year after ""Dunkirk"".The visuals are brilliant and worth watching.The score composed by Benzamin wall-sch and Hans Zimmer are appropriate.Ryan Gosling suits to the role with his reaction less eyes and his chemistry with Jo the artificial female companion is one of the best things in the film.Harrison Ford reprises his role perfectly .The film is nearly three hours but you will never feel like it's extended .Jared Leto played his role as villain quite good but his role can be more extended.Robin wright also played her part efficiently.At the fag end of the year the film is able to give cinema lovers all they can expect from a film..it is perfect and to my opinion better than the original",Blade Runner 2049

Gosling does very very good work carrying this movie, that, let's be honest, is 20 years too late in appearing. So much to like, but as Scott says himself, possibly 30mins too long and was in need of scene cuts. I expected Ford to be lazy on this cameo - but he stepped up as best he could (Ford is not a skilled Actor) I would guess this movie is an absolute wonder if seen on a gigantic Screen with great sound.

420,tyson-hunsaker,A modern science-fiction masterpiece that builds on its predecessor.,9,19 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a sequel to the 1982 cult classic ""Blade Runner"" by Ridley Scott. It's a stylistic film focused on ideas as the narrative follows Ryan Gosling's ""K"" in an investigation that links him to Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford); a former Blade Runner. ""Blade Runner 2049"" may be called one of the best sequels of all time because of it's incredible narrative, astounding visuals, and a memorable and thought-provoking story. Building on the themes of it's predecessor, ""Blade Runner 2049"" asks the audience what it means to be human. What constitutes an individuals soul? Memories? Emotions? Personal conviction? It's a brave picture not afraid to allow the viewer to think instead of spoon-feed information on a surface level. This is large in part due to Hampton Francher's incredible script which he spent over two decades preparing. The director, Denis Villeneuve, has a made a strong case to cement himself as a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. His sleek style is apparent just like it is in ""Prisoners,"" and ""Arrival."" Visually, it's impossible to not mention the mind-blowing cinematography and production design which work work effortlessly together to create a one of a kind fantastical, yet believable world. Every shot is a breathtaking piece of art and much praise should be given to both Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption) and Dennis Gassner (Skyfall, The Truman Show, Big Fish).In the case of editing, many casual moviegoers might not jump on board with the slower pacing and longer shots. Having a runtime of nearly 3 hours probably doesn't help in that regard. After watching the film twice now, I can confidently say the rhythm is pitch perfect (no reference intended). Each shot is just as long as it needs to be and while we still have every opportunity to soak in each beautiful moment, the film still skips over parts we know we don't want to see and gets right to what we want to see. Crucial and tense moments are drawn out while mundane scenes seem to have been omitted in the final product.As expected, performances are top notch, especially from Harrison Ford. While his screen time may not live up to expectations, he gives a layered and complex performance in the scenes he's in. I dare say he tops his original performance in the '82 version. Ryan Gosling gives another cold but thoughtful performance quite similar to his character in ""Driver"" (2011) which may make it difficult to feel deeply for the character. However, this does play into the story so too much criticism on that front may not be warranted. Who really steals the show is Sylvia Hoeks as ""Luv."" Her presence on scene is both exhilarating and terrifying as she presents an antagonist whose ruthless nature exceeds the originals Nexus 6 leader. ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a masterclass in filmmaking and science-fiction story-telling. It certainly will be hailed as a classic for years to come and certainly becomes more satisfying to watch with each viewing much like its predecessor. For anyone who has the time and temperament to watch and appreciate this fine film, it is well worth the sacrifice.",Blade Runner 2049

A movie also has to be entertaining, that's why it's a movie. No wonder this movie tanked at the box office.

422,trevor-82944,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,4,13 October 2017,"What separates real from machine? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Do we still think that humanity will someday crumble into a robot dystopia? Why do we still ask ourselves these obvious questions?Blade Runner 2049 brings us to thirty years after the 1982 classic. If you love the original Blade Runner, then you may appreciate Harrison Ford as he reprises his old role, this time as a motivator for the supposedly replicant protagonist, detective K, played by Ryan Gosling (Drive, La La Land). Similar to his previous project, Arrival, director Denis Villeneuve attempts a philosophical study on the worth of humanity, except now resulting in a pointless anti-fantasy with no true knowledge about civilization.Most of the film's praise focuses on production designer Dennis Gassner's (Bugsy, The Truman Show) creation of the sunless Californian city's atmosphere, which it deserves. Between the desolate hell-red wasteland riddled by statues and the neon shades of evil corporations, immense spectacle commands the screen. The use of symbolic holograms within the city is particularly noteworthy, as a ballerina hologram three stories tall parades through the streets, and a nude pink hooker five stories tall rules over the solitary life; even inside the city walls, an Elvis concert juxtaposes a fist fight. Although more so than the visuals, the sound design sucks you into the experience the most—in the first scene, Villeneuve utilizes his silent storytelling skills with K at work in a protein farm, where the hard murder of a replicant takes place. Once K enters the city, the IMAX surround sound creates the big, unfamiliar world accompanied by a shrieking musical score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch (Hidden Figures). You indeed feel caught in this cyberpunk future.However, the visuals hardly redeem the flaws, due to little effort made to modernize the decades old material. Villeneuve draws no inspiration from our current values, with social media and all, in turn making the original look more dated in its incorrectly predicted philosophical ideas. In fact, this whole city exaggerates our lesser-prevalent problems to improbable levels without explaining precisely how human error led to the ecosystem's collapse. ​ The excessive three-hour runtime contains 15% beautiful imagery and 85% chitchat in standardly lit sets; the average person might be able to follow these overused slow conversations without a single yawn if the villains were more multi-dimensional. The screenplay ironically says, ""memory is feeling,"" yet no feeling exists here, so you too will fail to remember whatever it tries to communicate. ​ Part of the problem to the atrocious boredom goes to the lackluster dialogue—after a standard text straight-forward tells you the backstory, everyone acts as a tool to spill out philosophical rambles. Since no tension builds, our mindset identifies these individuals as human shaped phone apps rather than expressive minds.The entire production crew overall showed little respect to regular moviegoers; cinema should never be about self-satisfaction, but about telling a great story that speaks to anybody at a spiritual level. The ego stroking of the picture primarily shows in its character motive: a fatherhood subplot gets thrown in without enough prevalence, and a significant other for K arrives and leaves without any resolution, so the entire subject of love, both familial and romantic, needed much more presence. Humanity and love complete one another, so why would such a heartless directorial approach impact our souls?Even more ironically, a heartthrob actor, one who has embraced materialism throughout his career, plays the lead. Consequently, he was a dreadful choice for the uncastable role: Ryan Gosling never reacts to the miraculous events around him, he just stares blankly as he recites his lines off a cue card.One last detail disproves Blade Runner 2049 as a sci-fi masterpiece: it plagiarizes. If you already saw this movie, then you might have noticed that K's name, a codename assigned to him at birth, resembles Star Wars: The Force Awakens., or that it ripped off a true modern sci-fi masterpiece, Her, when the holographic girlfriend uses a flesh-and- blood girl to sleep with K (essentially telling girls to submit their control to technology). So sorry, nothing new is said other than we people deserve to feel discouraged.Now, to answer my starter questions: People are real, machines are inanimate, androids never dream, because only people dream, and humanity can never crumble to basically resemble robots. Look at Facebook: things still look pretty dang expressive compared to the original Blade Runner's incorrect theories, so the future seems more hopeful than we give ourselves credit for.",Blade Runner 2049

425,J-bot6,A big movie,8,8 October 2017,"Finally, a major motion picture for a change. There are very few films that get higher than a 7 out of 10 from me. Hence a rating of 8 indicates films that I highly recommend.The big challenge for film makers these days is that the production levels of TV have gone up so much that a lot of movies seem like just one big episode of a television show. There aren't many films that are able to impress the viewer with the feeling that they're watching a classic big motion picture. Thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 succeeds in putting itself into the Motion Picture category. This is a film that takes you places and makes you think. The acting's nicely done and all homages to the original are subtle enough to come across as sophisticated instead of cheap. There are plenty of nice glory shots in here and the scenes take their time. They even allow the ends of scenes to linger for a while in order to immerse the viewer in the material. This is something that the director of The Empire Strikes Back highlights as an important technique and one that less experienced directors often forget to do. He should know, since he used to teach cinematography. You see this technique also used extensively by Tarkovsky (1972's Solaris). The editing is good and you get a lot for your money with a running time of almost three hours. The pacing is surprisingly well executed, considering the long duration of the movie. It uses a very interesting sequence of scenes ranging from medium to slow to fast to slow again. Seriously, there are meetings that film makers have just to figure out how to properly pace a film and what sequence to put the various intensities of scenes in. Topping this off is a sound track that is true to the original material and also calls back to the 1982 film's score. Nicely done. Something that certainly helps this movie feel enough like the original is the involvement of the director of the original (now in a producer role), one of the producers from the original movie, plus one of the two main writers from the 1982 feature. All of this pays off and is coupled nicely with the style of the new director (kudos to him for handling the material properly). In conclusion if you enjoyed the 1982 Blade Runner movie, then there's a very good chance that you'll like this one as well.",Blade Runner 2049

427,badoli,Style over substance.,8,6 October 2017,"This was the worst Villeneuve movie i've seen so far, which is quite a testament to his work. Compared to his previous outstanding movies Blade Runner 2049 is only ... good.Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship. The imagery is mesmerizing. Alas, the story just can't hold up. For once the main ideas of the script, even though executed quite well, didn't really thrill me. While that isn't killing the mood on its own, the characters were far from convincing. Several times it was far from plausible what motivated certain actions of the protagonists. At times it felt like scenes were in the movie for the sole purpose of feeling cool while not having any influence on the advancement of the story whatsoever. I'm okay with a little red herring here and there, but with this i was left puzzled far too often.The worst offenders here are all scenes with Jared Leto. I like him, but stop casting him as a villain! All his scenes come across as pretentious and over-styled. While he is portraying the head of a business conglomerate which produces replicants, a kind of Elon Musk personality, he comes across more as a spaced off bond villain. A stark contrast to the through and through business man Tyrell from the first movie (""More human than human - that's our motto!""). He's an unpredictable evil, yet his unpredictability serves no purpose throughout the story.My favorites were Dave Bautista and Robin Wright. Both of whom should have been given more screen time as they actually pushed the emotional curve properly. Ryan Gosling portrays a lifeless machine far too lifeless for my taste, i liked him a lot more in ""the nice guys"". Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford, he never really disappoints. The rest of the cast is rather forgettable.This movie not the big disappointment it could have been, there is plenty of reason to be entertained and it sorta keeps up with its predecessor. But neither is it a masterpiece. It tries too hard on various ideas and fails. If you're a real Science Fiction buff, rather watch Arrival. It shows far better what Villeneuve is capable story-wise in this field.",Blade Runner 2049
428,o_s_k_r,my bladerunner 2049 questions...,9,15 January 2018,"I can believe that Tyrell DELIBERATELY made the replicants sterile, but it's not credible that Wallace, with the technological power at his disposal, is unable to create reproducing replicants.Secondly, why does Wallace want reproducing replicants? Surely this is going to make them more independent and difficult to control? He claims that it is too slow to create replicants. But the replicants he creates are FULLY GROWN. It takes 18 years for a child to be raised and grown the normal way. Surely it is in fact MUCH SLOWER to create replicants by sexual reproduction.Further, if it is so difficult to create replicants, why does Wallace kill two brand new perfectly good replicants during the movie?Why does Luv need to kill Joshi in order to find out K's whereabouts? K snaps a tiny antenna which incredibly seems to be enough to make him invisible to Luv. But his whereabouts are apparently still being tracked by Joshi's database. How come Luv/Wallace can't access the same database? What are Joshi's motives in apparently hiding K?Is Steline telling the truth about her childhood? How did she get from the orphanage to the virtual reality chamber where she says she has been since the age of 8? Did some incredibly rich parents adopt her and buy her a bubble and presumably nurses and nannies to raise her?Why would Wallace send Deckard off world? Why can't he make him talk / torture him / analyse him on earth? Where Wallace is? What advantage is there in sending him off world?How could K know where Luv and Deckard are in order to shoot them down? As a bladerunner does he have access to some database that tracks every other replicant in the city? If so why would Luv be so stupid as to leave him alive? How come it is harder for Luv to find K than it is for K to find Luv? (She had to kill Joshi in order to access the database)? Are Wallace/Luv directly in control of the police force (bladerunners)? (It seems not, otherwise they wouldn't have to kill Joshi). But if they're not in control of the police why would they follow and protect K with aerial drones? Wouldn't this be of concern to K and Joshi? K doesn't seem particularly bothered by the drone attack.Why does K take Deckard to see Steline (his daughter)? Isn't he afraid that he will lead Wallace directly to the child? How can he be certain that Wallace won't access the same database that Joshi has? Obviously Steline can't leave her bubble, so once Wallace knows he was there then she's got big problems.Ok those were my main questions.I LOVE the soundtrack. And the art direction is amazing!

429,StregaAsuka,A fantastic (unnecessary) sequel,7,8 October 2017,"we have waited 35 years for this movie. So either you watch it because you are a fan of the first one or you watch it because you are curious about what is going to happen/what is it about. And you want to watch it with your no replicant eyes. So please watch.As the tittle itself explains, 30 years have gone by since the original Blade Runner movie; which was set in 2019, which is in 2 years time, and no one believes our world will be like that, but let's get back on track. Year 2049 and we are presented with the same idea as before: replicants are being chased and now not only by humans but by other replicants that are aware of what they are.Following Ryan Gosling's K character we are drawn into a kind of police movie: while doing his duty, K discovers something that was hidden for 30 years and that might change the world, for real. While the movie carries on, we are presented with new characters like Joi, another AI that K is using as companion, which presents some of the greatest sci-fi scenes (like shown in the trailer) and Harrison Ford's character also appears, as the movie poster gave away, and he is exactly like we remembered him but with some wrinkles. One cannot but feel nostalgic. Then the story starts to get complicated and deeper, and as in this kind of movies happens, the audience might have one theory about what is going on but it could not be that, and of course then there is the end, that like the original movie will make you keep thinking about it for a while after exiting the theatre.We are presented with marvelous visual effects that are accompanied but a wonderful movie that it will remind you of ""Arrival"" the director previous work as the style is similar. Some of the visuals are really, really, fascinating, everything recalls the original movie but instead of having a dark filter it has a brighter one where the colours are more alive in contract with what the story is telling. The only down I might find in this movie is its length. Being almost 3 hours long you really feel it is that long, something that didn't happen with the previous one, which was ""only"" 2 hours long. Some scenes are way too long and maybe unnecessary, but nonetheless they are beautiful.This movie follows the canon of the director's cut, so you better use your memory or either watch it again in order to savour all the tiny (and not so tiny) details that appear on this one. It is a really good movie that maybe we didn't need at all but we are enjoying anyway.",Blade Runner 2049

Officer K (Ryan Gosling my man!!!) unearthed an extraordinary yet terrifying fact that will shake the entire foundation of society to its core and disturb the coexistence between real humans and the fake ones : Replicants. can. get. pregnant. as he journeyed into the heart of the mystery, Officer K was disturbed by the fact that child could be himself and the fact that all these years people told him that his memories were only made up and that he never had a childhood like a normal humans got him mad like hell. Up to this point, I thought that I already knew what the ending would be and the rest of the movie is no longer a puzzle that needed solving. But then, Rick Deckard (The Man, The Myth, The Legend : HARRISOOOONNNNNN...... FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRDDDDD......!!!!!) showed up and ruined my entire goddamn speculation of the story. This, this kind of turning point of event that kept me on my seat inside the theater for more than two and a half hours ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that I needed to go to the bathroom thanks to the air conditioner, but hey, I made it to the end!! no disappointment, no unanswered questions, no what-the-hell-did-I- just-watch moment as I entered the bathroom. It was pure satisfaction and worthy of every bit of my praise to the point that I dare to say that it will be hard to find a movie as good as this one for the next decade. Just like what Hollywood is doing right now to the new star wars trilogy (which also featured Harrison Ford), ""Blade Runner 2049"" is pretty faithful to the original movie : the music, the setting, the art, and the poetic line of one of the characters that will make all Blade Runner fans and critics alike fall in love with this masterpiece of a franchise. Denis Villeneuve, in my humble opinion, is ready to put his name among greats like Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg. whatever genre of movies he directs, as long as it has his name on it, will certainly be one of, if not, the best movie of the year (the same applied to the like of Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino). So for all normies out there, just enjoy watching whatever the hell Marvel Studio or DC Entertainment produces while I, excuse me, rewatch the first blade runner movie.",Blade Runner 2049

432,lale-ba,Beautiful and empty replicant,5,22 December 2017,"Some movies are just not to be touched, revamped and continued, since they represent cult features that changed cinematography, redefined entire genres and influenced the entire pop culture.
One of those revolutionary stories and unbeaten representations of the future is the Phillip K. Dick's and Ridley Scott's masterpiece SF-noir about the robots and artificial intelligence as the ultimate frontier of mankind, ''Bladerunner"".
Unlike the many similar contemporary cash driven desires to continue the story and finally give some of the much needed answers to the 80s classics, the production team for ''Bladerunner: 2049"" lead by the creator of the original, Ridley Scott, did their homework and did it well. 
They chose one of the best directors in Hollywood right now, Dennis Villeneuve and casted one of the more stellar crews in recent history of SF making (Gosling, Wright, Leto and of course, Harrison Ford). 
The visual result was just stunning, since gifted director meticulously solved every single detail in each scene. Transferring the legendary atmosphere of the first part of the (unfortunately) saga was just done with flying colors and that deserves every appraisal.
However, this is where the good things top and give way to the cancer that's eating 21st century Hollywood.
Lame scripts.
Just to be clear, the original ''Bladerunner"" was probably the weakest script of all the Top 10 movies of all times it rightfully belongs to, but was also the revolutionary insight into the future, offering some of the most intriguing and so exploited concepts that followed it.
''Bladerunner: 2049"" doesn't have any of those things, since it offers neither new concepts, neither viable characters, nor acting or even some decent answers. It just wanders off, not showing any signs of life and driving the stellar crew into the average, while making the script look blunt and unfinished.
''Bladerunner: 2049"" is a beautiful replicant of the original movie, with some great camera, color, production and light, but also with a mediocre script unworthy of the name it continues.",Blade Runner 2049
433,rayres0708,Masterpiece,9,15 December 2019,"If you enjoyed the original Blade Runner, you will be impressed by this film. I was blown away. The plot, the acting, the aesthetics - everything is executed to near perfection. The pacing slows a bit at hour 2, but picks back up for the conclusion. The story is compelling and beautifully rendered. The theme is sewn throughout in a way that isn't overly simplified or explained constantly with dunbed-down dialogue. Ryan Gosling impresses with his consistent acting, and Jared Leto is consistently creepy. Harrison Ford shows he's not done yet.The truly amazing part of this movie is the fact that they have captured the look and feel of the original. The music, cinematography, and scenery are all beautiful homages to the original. Yes, they're updated (naturally-it's been 30 years in Blade Runner world). But not in the way the Star Wars prequels pissed all over the originals. And the CGI is flawless.Watch this movie. Put your phone down and actually take in every scene.

434,bgsmall,A worthy successor to the original,8,19 July 2020,"This was a big ask of Denis Villeneuve. In my estimation 'Bladerunner' was very probably the best sci-fi movie (movie?) of the 20th century. Recapitulating, the set, storyline, dialogue was a great challenge; but I'm pleased to say I think '2049' lives up to the expectation.It doesn't eclipse the original, but certainly updates and extends the storyline in a coherent and plausible fashion.",Blade Runner 2049

Although not explicitly mentioned in both movies but left for the audience to acquire, is about the sole which a non-human can develop. Some reviews mentioned that it lacks deep dramatic reactions, but this is in favor of the story, considering the main objective is not about picturing emotions' depth, but about existence.It is a throughout story where some of the scenes in the movie need pages to be described, and some events that took no more than 10 seconds in the movie will be stretched out in other sci-fi movies for 20+ minutes, and all came in a continuous sequence here. Visual effects are state of the art by all means. The music in this movie has a character by its own, it has a very strong presence just like in the classical (previous) part. All actors made their roles perfectly - except the role by Jared Leto which is kinda draw back in the whole momentum of the movie, thankfully it was a minor role. There are too many good things to be mentioned which made this a very entertaining hard-core science fiction movie, such as picturing the future of some regions, the yet-to-be nature of complexity of human beings in the next few decades, the expected environmental effects on everything, the unstoppable power development of political systems, very possible future gadgets and accessories, etc. This leaves one asking himself: if this is not The perfect sci-fi movie, then what else is?Highly recommended for everyone, and I am sure I will watch it again.10/10.",Blade Runner 2049

437,dagallop,"Wow! Just wow! great, great movie. Enjoyed every minute..",10,22 November 2017,"I had high hopes for this movie. I was a massive Blade Runner fan, probably watching the various versions of releases at least two or three times a year since its release. I watched the trailers, yep all of them, including the ones that weren't even in the movie?! And with the sort of expectations that I had I really worried that the movie would be a disappointment. It was so far removed from that it actually exceeded my expectations by vast amounts. Ryan Gosling was absolutely brilliant, in fact, he was more deserving of an Oscar for his acting than any of the recent winners and frankly that is sad because this sort of movie doesn't even make the consideration stage. His role led me into a myriad of questions and ultimately left me realizing that only he could top the end play in the original, which I might add he did to perfection. Harrison Ford was great, he mirrored some of his previous performance and some of the scenes he was in left you feeling you could be looking at earth in 2049, certainly the tech side and the way older people, even today, try to hold on to some of the old traditions, styles and lifestyles. As for the special effects; they were exactly what was needed to give the same look and feel as the original, although I believe that the number of times running water, standing water and rain, was present may have been a tad over the top and certainly doesn't help with a longer movie for us older folks who pine for the return of the intermission (AKA bathroom break!). A masterpiece of cinematic brilliance which not only compliments the original, takes a story that is 100% plausible (sort of) and makes it work. My only criticism would be that there is no way that a digital release could do either the cinematic or audio the justice that it rightly deserves.Final comment: where did all those trailer segments go? I assume that there will be a number of special releases just as there was for the original?",Blade Runner 2049
438,pootc,This was special,10,4 October 2017,"It's amazing after repeated viewings the lack of patience or inability moviegoers have to simply follow a plot. The lack of concentration throughout the cinema, the talking throughout and some of the comments I have read is downright disturbing. This movie is high art and some people need it spoon-feed to them. If you're not invested from the get-go, just go home.Blade Runner 2049 is not your typical movie and it was never meant to be. There are no superheroes or giant robots. Explosions are scarce and it's not funny either. It's about emotion and memories and like the original Blade Runner (1982). It poses the same Philip K Dick inspired questions about humanity - what does it mean to be human and are we just the sum of our memories? It now raises questions about artificial intelligence and real love.It is a sequel 35 years in the making to one of the most thoughtful and provocative movies ever. The original movie was a box office flop which later developed a cult following and and has since been hailed a masterpiece. Ridley Scott created a multilayered world which seduces you into a nostalgic like trance for a place which never really existed and a sequel to a film held in such high regard is rarely ever a good idea but Blade Runner 2049 is a rare exception. Think The Godfather Part II, Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgment Day before it.No spoilers. We follow Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a new character and a new breed of Blade Runner on the trail of an old model replicant but what he uncovers along the way is so much bigger and threatens to shift the balance of what is left of humanity.Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) and his crew have crafted a beautiful looking film which pays homage to the original without trying to copy it at all. The same rain-soaked, neon-lit streets are present in L.A, only the Eco-system is even more shattered. Sustenance is scarce with protein farming a way of life and while there are obvious nods to the first movie 2049 relishes the opportunity to avoid the familiar and takes us outside the city limits.The cast in 2049 is excellent. Ryan Gosling carries the main story with ease, playing his detective character with an ice-cold calm until...Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, the original Blade Runner delivers a highly emotional and raw performance which I found very surprising. Not because Ford is not capable as an actor but Deckard was played so dryly in the original, especially next to Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty. Clearly time and circumstance have clearly changed him here and it's a refreshing approach.The casting choices of side characters in limited roles such as Dave Bautista, Robin Wright and Ana De Armas in her very unique role were fantastic. Jared Leto gets only a few scenes as villainous creeper Niander Wallace, the corporate tycoon with a god complex but his best 'angel', Luv (Sylvia Hoek) gets plenty and rightfully so because she's excellent.If I I had to choose any negatives from 2049 it would be need to spoon-feed the audience in scenes by adding a small flashback here and there which I thought was unnecessary. The score was clearly not Vangelis who did the first movie and made up so much of the nostalgic atmosphere in it. While good I did miss the sadness, the piano keys and blues of Vangelis for a time but could tell the score was aiming for something different, more urgent, a sense of dread which was probably more appropriate anyway with 2049 being much larger. That's not to say there aren't hints of Vangelis because there most definitely is.It has been 35 years and the need for a sequel can be debated forever. Was it necessary? No. But was it good. Yes, really good. Is it a masterpiece? I would say that it's an extremely satisfying conclusion to Deckard's story and having seen it it's made the original even better.A movie like this does not come around very often. The world needs more movies like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Ex Machina... and Blade Runner 2049. High praise.Best movie of the year!",Blade Runner 2049
439,rioplaydrum,Over Baked,6,5 December 2017,"I waited for a while to go see BR2049 because I didn't want to stand in line with the un-washed hordes.I am a big fan of the original, and I had high expectations that just weren't met. There are glaring differences between the two.First of all the original had a plot line that was easy to follow and moved along at a good clip.The sequel does nothing of the sort. While I admit every scene is masterfully crafted and the sound track excellent, the film is so over packed with minutia I frequently could not follow what was going on.It was fun seeing Deckard again, but his role seemed odd and pointless. That being Deckard is now a paranoid hermit and why Agent K would seek him out at all made no sense to me.And the biggest problem as I see it, the film is TOO LONG. The production is just 16 minutes short of three hours! Who has the patience for that? I ended up walking out early and missed the ending. At some point I grew incredibly restless and bored and could take no more.A fine production but one I think most people will not have attention span to tolerate.",Blade Runner 2049

I think the most impressive thing about it was its commitment to building on the mythology set forth by the original. It managed to expand on the original and give us answers to what happened to characters after it in ways that felt clever, fresh, and still faithful to it. It manages to be about the continuation of certain events in the first film while creating a new fascinating character at its core and manages to tell the new character's arc brilliantly. To reiterate, it's very well written, managing to avoid the clichés that usually transpire in films like this. Villeneuve has quickly become one of the best filmmakers currently working and this is only another example of his talent. However, the original was much better.",Blade Runner 2049
441,stroggos,"Slow movie, but worth the patience—has to be seen in cinemas",9,9 October 2017,"As a fan of the original, I was skeptical with the new Blade Runner. Although Denis Villeneuve is a very skilled director, Blade Runner does have such cult status, almost sacredness... so people naturally had lots of expectations about this one. I think in the end, the new installment certainly delivers!The atmosphere is super thick and the movie makers went a lot in the world building direction, using the story to put in a lot of important sci-fi / cyberpunk ideas that should definitely inspire you and that definitely ask some deep questions, just as good sci-fi is supposed to do. The cinematography is indeed stunning, it's a one-in-its kind thing that you won't see in anytime soon. Hyper-stylized, yes, but distracting from the apparent realism of the world, no. As a fan of electronica, the soundtrack stood out to me in particular. It managed to be modern and unique while at the same time staying true to some of the tunes of the original.Now, a lot of people are complaining about the movie being slow and the story perhaps not living up to the visuals. I see where these folks are coming from as the movie is indeed slow—but that's in part at least because modern audiences are used to rapid plot developments and quick cutting sequences. In fact, let's remind ourselves that the old Blade Runner was really slow as well, and perhaps some things are better not be updated!If you have the patience, I think you are in for a really emotional ride. Perhaps even more so than the old Blade Runner, this one is filled with sadness. Ryan Gosling does a perfect job at balancing his calmness with this intense feeling of pent-up anger and despair. There's existential dread without an army or a massive fight. The big themes discussed in the movie hit on the theme of identity and one's purpose in life. Each character is struggling with their identity or purpose in some form or another. I admit that I cried at the end of the movie as multiple of the themes and metaphors that were explored throughout the movie converge on what I see as a beautiful conclusion to a truly epic story.So, expect a slow ride, expect to be sucked into a truly compelling word, and don't miss this one while it's running in the cinema—it's definitely not going to be the same on your average home screen. Go and watch it!",Blade Runner 2049
442,johnplocar,Denis Villeneuve is a mastermind behind the camera...,10,9 October 2017,"I needed a few days to let this movie settle with me. Not that I thought that any part of this film was bad, actually I believe it to be a great film. Even at the very moment the ending credits hit the screen I just felt that I had seen something truly great. I loved ""Blade Runner 2049"" and I hope that this gets just as much love and attention as its predecessor has gotten over the years since its 1982 theatrical release. Everything about this movie I thought was executed so insanely well; from its haunting visuals to the meticulously thought out story, the editing, the acting, the direction, character development, all of it was handled with such an obsessive amount of care that I couldn't believe what I was witnessing half the time. The only reason why I hesitate to give this film a 10 out of 10 is because I'm still debating in my head whether I dreamt this up or not, because I swear there are times I felt hypnotized by Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece here. The premise about an investigation being run by a Blade Runner named 'K' (played by Ryan Gosling), who is trying to figure out and cover up certain events that were perpetrated by a small group of replicants (machines made to appear human, but serve humans in their day to day activities) which may have also included involvement of the Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). From there, I can't say too much more without risking any involuntary reveals. For anyone expecting an action film then I am sorry to say, but you are heavily mistaken. This is a detective noir with a slow burn mystery, very much so like the first ""Blade Runner""; only add about 45 more minutes to the run time. This is no joke of a film, it is a long movie and it takes its time to unfold its plot while simultaneously building upon the world of ""Blade Runner"" and the individuals that inhabit it. There are moments of action and suspense of course, running in the same vein as Ridley Scott's original, however they are just as sparsely placed as well; but it works. It all somehow works because there was not a single solitary second of this film's run time that I felt bored or had my mind wander off mid-scene. I was fully engaged in its plot and its characters and I wanted to know exactly where it was going. Sometimes the script is cryptic and vague about what is really going on and other times it is completely concrete; the filmmakers knew exactly how and when to be one or the other. Supplying enough solid answers to keep the viewer satisfied, but also leaving plenty of room to let people interpret specific aspects any way they may see fit. Which is much more difficult than it may seem to achieve.""Blade Runner 2049"" isn't afraid to ask questions that are similar to its predecessor, but severely expands on those themes to all new heights. What does it mean to be human? At what point do we as a society finally see machines as close to being human without being human? When the line is so blurred, how would we be able to tell the difference between man and replicant? Could we get to a point with technology that it surpasses even us in how human someone can be, while humanity could become as cold as machinery is? Is it love that defines having a soul or is there something more to it? The film flawlessly brings these themes up without ever feeling forced or out of place, even once. Characters that go through their own personal arcs can also be interpreted as being one thing, but after some time to ponder could be perceived in a whole new light. The entirety of this film is carried solely on the back of Ryan Gosling and he knocks it out of the park. He has given performances that are definitely reminiscent of his role here, which there have been times in the past where it was problematic for him. Whether not supplying enough charisma or intrigue in order to reel the viewer in, luckily that isn't the case here. Yes, he gives a stoic and deadpan performance but I always felt like there was something to him. He wasn't brooding for the sake of brooding or what have you, he gives a layered performance here that is equal parts cool, funny and intense at times. He did a terrific job and I'm glad to see him, along with the rest of the cast, at the top of their game. Especially Harrison Ford, who gives his reprisal of the role as Deckard all that he's got. There are so many more things I wish I could talk about, but I think I've said more than enough. ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a great sequel. It is a great film. I sadly feel that it may suffer the same fate as the original did with not being accepted right away by the mainstream audience and not doing all that fantastic financially either. Which is a shame because we don't get many great movies or sequels like this, yet when we do they bomb at the box office. We hear all the time how people want more than just another Michael Bay explosion fest, but when we are finally given a true science fiction epic with originality to spare...no one goes to see it. Hopefully in the years to come, this will be appreciated and studied alongside the first ""Blade Runner"" by many who see it. Preferably sooner rather than later so I'm not 55 when another long awaited sequel is released.",Blade Runner 2049

Ryan Gosling also gives an incredible performance as a man struggling with his feelings and humanity. He is the main character that I wanted Deckard to be in the first movie. In conclusion, this is a science fiction epic that has the distinction of being one of the rare sequels that build upon its predecessor, and that's why it's incredibly sad that this movie isn't doing well at the box office.

448,taryllsbaker,"""A stunning sequel that truly belongs.""",9,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Ryan Gosling, Ana de Armas, Robin Wright, Jared Leto, Sylvia Hoeks, Harrison Ford, Mackenzie Davis and Dave Bautista.A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years. (15 cert, 163 mins)The year is 1982. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner has been poorly received in its theatrical run. Jump forward to 2017. Blade Runner is widely regarded as one of the most skilfully crafted world-building sci-fi achievements in film history. A sequel is upon us. Blade Runner 2049 is here. But how does it perform? Does it require you watch the original? The answers I give you are simple and will not spoil a thing.Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors working today. Arrival. Sicario. Incendies. Prisoners. Enemy. He has an incredible body of work to fall back on. When I heard the news of Villeneuve directing a new Blade Runner, I was intrigued. I knew that he could create something truly brilliant, and he has. To answer the questions above; it performs extremely well. Not only does it continue the story faithfully, it's perfectly able to stand on its own. However, I'd highly recommend watching the original before seeing this. Like it or not, it acts as the foundation for this sequel. Despite the huge gap between the two films, the story and characters feel consistent. It hasn't been tacked on just to earn money, in fact the box office numbers prove otherwise. This is a worthy sequel that truly belongs.Ryan Gosling leads with what looks to be a simple, single-shaded character but as the film unfolds, the layers of his performance do so too. By the film's end we are totally connected to Officer K, just as much as Deckard, played by Harrison Ford in a surprisingly strong and brilliant returning act. Alongside the aforementioned are a talented range of actors who each bring life to their wonderfully textured characters. Robin Wright is remarkable. Jared Leto performs with complexity, creating the strange yet fascinating presence of Niander Wallace. Sylvia Hoeks is the menacing Luv, and one of my favourite performers in the film. Ana de Armas and Mackenzie Davis are both delightful supplements. This cast is incredible.Just as before, the futuristic vision of Los Angeles is intricately created and every single set and location looks the part. I'd liked to have seen more of the dystopian city, but I have to admire the direction to delve into the unfamiliar and expand the world of Blade Runner. It's been 30 years since Deckard disappeared, so you'd expect some advancement in technology and whilst there may be slight improvements, the world is at a stand-still after the 'blackout' 27 years prior.After working together on two projects previously, Villeneuve enlists Roger Deakins as director of photography and the result is stunning. Each frame tops the last. Even in its state of stillness the camera feels very much alive. Somehow, Deakins manages to capture the bleakness in such a way that it's simply beautiful to look at. Even when the film reaches its slower moments you can rely on the cinematography to keep you invested. Paired with this is the incredible sound design, tearing through the frames like a knife to a painting, but in no bad way. This leads me onto something very important; music.The music was such a huge part of the original Blade Runner, with Vangelis' beautiful synth-driven score. In order for 2049 to fully return us to that world, it required a worthy composer. Given Villeneuve's relationship with Jóhann Jóhannsson, it was no question he would take on the challenge. However, as the film neared completion the music wasn't capturing the feel intended, and so Jóhannsson was out. With very little time, Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer stepped up and provided the film with some of the best synth work I've heard in years. It's dark. It's gritty. It's loud. Most importantly, it captures the sound of Vangelis' work on the original, but takes it in a whole new twisted direction. The duo have delivered something that may split audiences. It's not as melodically pleasing as I'd hoped, and I could wish for more cues like 'Mesa,' but I truly believe the score fits perfectly in the atmosphere of this film. It doesn't shatter what was created before, that goes for the music and the film itself. It simply builds upon these creations and provides a faithful continuation. Here's how I'd put it; Vangelis created warmth, Wallfisch & Zimmer created coldness. Watch both films with that in mind and you'll start to notice it.Without saying too much; I found it to be better than the first, most notably in the storytelling. Beyond a few moments of slow-pacing, I can't fault it. This will go on to be a sci-fi classic, without a doubt.Verdict; Blade Runner 2049 is a stunning sequel that truly belongs. A careful continuation, yet standing on its own. This is one of Denis Villeneuve's best works.Blade Runner 2049 – ★★★★★ (9/10)",Blade Runner 2049
449,palacerevolution2000,"Looks great, Dialogue and Story are lousy",3,3 June 2018,"I was very excited to see this film. I was under the impression that it was not so much a sequel, but more of a continuation. I was wrong. I wonder now if I should have only given it 2 stars. It is so bad. The good - visually it is stunning.
The dialogue is ridiculous; just laughable. Jared Leto, a fine actor, is given lines that no one could make sound believable. Also isn't his character supposed to be older?
Robin Wright ruins every scene she is in. I don't know if it is the terrible lines she is handed, or the way she mishandles them. She hasn't delivered a performance that hasn't been steeped in self suffering sap in years.
The original was elegant in it's plot development. You had to think, it was a story told in veils. With 2049 we get everything spelled out for us. Points that move the story along are immediately revealed, usually in a clumsy fashion.
This sequel has 'Hollywood' stamped all over it: trying to cover every base, and please every demographic, offend no one for heaven's sake, and therefore saying absolutely nothing.I have since rewatched it, and maybe the second half is a bit better; (except for plot holes) mainly because it features Gosling and Ford.",Blade Runner 2049
450,kira02bit,"Ambitious, but flawed sequel to a well deserved classic",6,31 October 2017,"As someone who was around to see the original Blade Runner in theaters back in 1982, it is undeniable that it was a classy box office bust buried under the onslaught of the more emotionally accessible E.T. It did, however, even at that time have a strong critical and cult following. I myself found the noir-ish sci-fi effort initially beautiful to behold, but rather slow. It improved dramatically for me on subsequent viewing as both its screenplay and characters proved to be more intellectually revealing with each visit, until I came to regard it as an undervalued classic. A view that many seemed to reach as well.The sequel is suitably set decades after the original and focuses on Ryan Gosling's K, a blade runner/replicant who hunts down and kills older models who apparently do not know their place. In the opening mission, he stumbles onto a secret that threatens the very fabric of the dystopian society in which the action is set.There are many commendable things about this sequel and also suitable reasons to carp. Director Denis Villenauve recaptures some of the tone and feel of the original and kudos for taking a stab at branching the universe out. However, as visually captivating as the sequel is, it never captures the breathtaking kaleidoscopic awe of the original. The original set its action in a nightmare neon-filled landscape, while too much of the sequel just seems to be set in white and gray foggy daylight. Villeneuve also abandons the noir detective tone for something more philosophical with decidedly mixed results.The length of the film is almost absurdly self-indulgent. While I was never bored, there were a lot of snoozers around me and people checking their watch. Entire passages are wasted on misdirection and stabs at universe building which are hit and miss. This is also the first film since Meet Joe Black where there are so many pauses between lines that you want to shout at the characters to speak already. Also, I get that the relationship between Gosling and Ana de Armas as his virtual reality consort that he gets to take around with him is supposed to hint at his loneliness, but both the character and subplot take up too much time for too little payoff. Those looking for edge-of-your seat action would do well to look elsewhere.Gosling is adequate in the lead - solid yet unspectacular. Too much time is wasted on him brooding. We already suspect from the start that there is more to him emotionally than the surface dictates, but need it take so long to reveal it? The supporting cast is largely strong, even when not used to the best effect. Robin Wright is pitch-perfect as Gosling's no-nonsense human boss. Jared Leto overacts ridiculously in two lengthy scenes as the villain of the piece, but Sylvia Hoek is first-rate as his kick-ass majordomo. Ironically Ford, who was accused by many of sleepwalking through the original, kicks the film into high gear with a rugged, droll and sympathetic performance that comes late in the film (perhaps a bit too late?).Some of the motivations seem murky to me. I get that Leto is a loon with a God complex and I have a hunch that he would like to dissect the film's McGuffin, but I was never sure what Hoeks intentions were towards the same. I think some of this could have been developed more and other things could have been eliminated entirely without impacting the film.Also, I was less than thrilled over the depiction of the majority of the female characters in this film. The original featured a smidge of nudity from Joanna Cassidy's replicant stripper, but both Sean Young and Daryl Hannah are captivating and iconic in their parts. The sequel is awash in gratuitous female nudity from start to finish and it seems that most of the women are some kind of pleasure fembots or underlings onhand to do the bidding of the male characters. Ironically, when Gosling showers twice, the camera is very careful to stay above the waist and there do not seem to be any male pleasure bots for the female population. Are human women largely extinct in the future? This sequel is ambitious and sometimes fascinating, but I never felt the wonder I did when watching the original film, so I am uncertain that this sequel was necessary. It says something that the most inspiring moment is when an iconic character from the original film makes an unexpected appearance for a brief cameo and literally jars you from a stupor.",Blade Runner 2049
451,wlee08,Not Aging Well,6,3 September 2019,"I liked this the first time-around because it's mysterious, but you keep expecting a lot of action and fun and that never really happens. Watching it again a few years later it seems, ah hmm...perhaps a bit boring. It has some good moments,(I'm thinking of Elvis serenading Han Solo as he repeatedly punches Gosling harder than Pine punches Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness. I take that back. After watching it again its clear Kirk beats on Khan ten times harder in Star Trek Into Darkness, a movie that came out four years earlier. They should have got the same special effects team to oversee the beating) 2049 tends to stay in the key of Slit your wrist - this future world is void of trees and smiles, and even the hookers are trying to pull a fast one on you. The dreary minor music adds to the lonely ambience. All you have is your fake hologram girlfriend and existential questions. Ending seemed rushed and didn't really address Wallace or the issue of knocking off expired androids.",Blade Runner 2049
452,parleon-thedon,Blade Runner 2049 - Review: Obviously,7,8 October 2017,"I watched the directors cut of the original Blade Runner (1982) a few years ago. Blade Runner (1982) has been considered a cult classic by some, even though it bombed at the box office during its initial release. Throughout the years Blade Runner (1982) has gone through a variety of changes. Many different cuts of the film have been released for the moviegoers to consume. When you ask a fan of the original Blade Runner, they will tell you that the Final Cut of the film is the definitive version. I haven't seen the Final Cut of the film, but I will get around to it. 35 years have passed since the original Blade Runner release. French Canadian film director and writer Denis Villeneuve had some successful films on his resume. Arrival, Sicario, and Prisoners were highly successful films during their initial release. Villeneuve's success has put him on the director hot seat. Blade Runner 2049 is Villeneuve's first attempt at creating a bankable big-budget studio film.Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful film with a mesmerizing score, and that's pretty much it. Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Robin Wright, Jared Leto, and Ana de Armas are all terrific in their roles. Mackenzie Davis's character is predictable from the beginning. Sylvia Hoeks's character portrayal lacks conviction, but she's intimidating in the role. My initial intrigue for the film started to decline during its second act. The plot of the story exhausted itself and overstayed its welcome. Nothing of any real interest held my attention other than the musical score, the acting, and the visuals. Blade Runner 2049 is a dry film that lacks any real intrigued for the viewer to grasp onto. The initial part of the film is good because it sucks you into its world of wonder, music, violence, nudity, and bright neon colors. There's a mystery/puzzle at the beginning of the film that keeps the viewer engaged, but that all falls apart during the second half. By the end of the film, I was bored with the story because it wasn't moving forward. During the second act moving forward, the film had slowed down tremendously that by the time it all ended, I had already checked out, I was dissatisfied with the ending, and I thought the film was okay.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N68nRFGxyaI",Blade Runner 2049
453,ksheimsoth,The Hero You Wish You Had,7,29 October 2020,"-Characters, plot, world, all were super interesting.
-What ruined it was making the child the girl who showed up for 10 minutes, not the main character we have been following and we've seen grow. It feels unfair to him.
-The prostitute didn't feel necessary and the main character sacrifices everything (including his wife) thinking he had a higher purpose, and now his purpose is cleaning up after the TRUE CHILD. That's not satisfying. It's irritating.
-Gotta be the most tragic side character protagonists I've ever seen, and thus the movie becomes tragic.",Blade Runner 2049
454,mocaler,A good sequel,8,27 December 2017,"I always thought that Blade Runner deserved a high quality sequel in either movie or novel form. However, the books which were done some years after the movie were rather bad. I enjoyed Blade Runner 2049 very much. I do not mind the occasional slow moments. The movie has levels of complexity which make it as rewatchable as Blade Runner, maybe even a bit more. The only issue I take and the reason for taking off 2 stars is that the ending leaves the need for a continuation for the story. It's not quite a cliffhanger but still feels incomplete. It's OK that the complex themes of the story are not spelled out since that can further engage the viewers if done well, which it is done here. But I wish that the ending did not feel quite so much like sequel bating. I hope that it doesn't take decades for the story to continue. I may not be alive in 30 years.",Blade Runner 2049
455,Nobody-27,"Absolutely, without doubt the worst film I have ever seen",1,10 December 2017,"I still remember seeing the original Blade Runner. The theater was empty, and I knew nothing about the film. Yet, even though I was concerned that I made a poor choice, I was immediately drawn to the story, or rather - hooked into it, and could not help but fall in love with that film. What a relief it was to find that over time many others realized that original Blade Runner had a true value - which was missed by most reviewers at the time. Exact opposite is true of the Blade Runner sequel: it gets decent reviews and that only solidifies my belief that all new releases by major studios get reviews ""made to order"". It does not matter any more whether a film is good or bad; the only thing that matters is - how good is your PR campaign, which often means - dirty PR such as buying votes and positive reviews. Why is this film bad? There are many reasons, and I hate to give away spoilers, so I will tread gently. But before I start, I will just say that around 30 or 40 min mark I wanted to walk out. The only reason I did not, is because I had to see this film. But it was way too painful.The first problem with this film is simple: lack of a good or at least watchable story. The film starts with some guy growing some fat, ugly larvae in a pool. Film-making rule #1: do not start a film with repulsive imagery. At least not before you set a tone. Film-making rule #2: make sure you show us what the main protagonist is after - and why. No such a thing here. Even when in the end we find out what is going on and so on, we are never really convinced about the importance of it all. Again, I have to refrain from giving away too much, but if you watch it, you will see. To put it mildly: this film is a ""story"" (for lack of a better word) about some bladerunner who is trying to solve a problem which does nothing for me or anyone else. It is also about 90 minutes too long. To add weight to feather light story, there are looooong drawn out scenes of nothingness, and most of the information is given in little snippets hoping to make it look like the story is smart, only you are dumb. Didn't work on me. The story is as dull as a sack of hammers. And then the worst offense of all: there is not a single scene, action, line of dialogue, or anyone's reaction that is based on proper motivation. Nothing. Zero. Nada. Zilch. The whole thing was written from the point of ""Oh, this is act three, better get the energy up - OK, lets have these guys fight!"" or ""OK, here we have nothing, so lets throw in some nudity!"" At one point someone is a dear guest; next scene, they are about to get killed by their host. Everyone behaves like they are beyond psychotic, and completely alienated. No emotion, no rhyme or reason, no motivation, no goal, nothing. Just emptiness mixed with some boredom for good measure. There are a few films I really hate, and I usually say I would rather watch Miley Cyrus than those films. In reality, I'd probably only pretend to watch Miley Cyrus because I cannot stand her ""performance"". But, in this case, I can say with my hand on my heart that I would truly beg to pay to watch Miley Cyrus in place of this awful thing, sorry - ""film"".",Blade Runner 2049
456,sanjidparvez,A damn good sequel! This is how a true Sci-Fi masterpiece should be made!,9,8 October 2017,"Loosely based on Sci-Fi maestro Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", in 1982 Ridley Scott created an amazing neo-noir cinematic experience, titled BLADE RUNNER that has been improved with ages. And that's just not only because of those numerous cuts, edits and improvised versions produced by the studio over the years but more for its one hell of a thought provoking story line...What defines us as Human & our identity? In what sort of 'better future"" we are actually heading as a specie? A dream like technology driven world where reality will depend on our improvised senses or implanted memory, trying to hide an absolute dystopian nightmare beneath all of that?! In that bleak, polluted, morally & environmentally degraded world, a Blade runner get hired to track down & 'retire' a group of androids ""who have seen things"" that eventually made them more human than ever where they movingly throw a question mark to our known concept of humanity at the end. After 35 years, Denis Villeneuve not only just honored the legacy here, he also remarkably extend that epic tale of human enigma where another young Blood Runner is trying to solve a mystery that planted its seed years ago. Through a deep emotional journey, Villeneuve took it to another level of cinematic excellence that convincingly outshines most other contemporary, so called Sci-Fi masterpieces (even including his 2016 film ARRIVAL!). Actually we couldn't bargain & get better than this, a perfect combination of the finest talents of current Hollywood that you'll find here in almost every department of the film, resulting a damn good sequel in compare to today's Hollywood standard. But I guess, for its slow burn nature, dark tone & the overall aesthetic value, only the ardent fans of the original going to get it properly & they'll love it for sure.",Blade Runner 2049
457,verminhater,Excellent though not perfect sequel,8,27 October 2017,"Let me say I'm a massive fan of the first film so this film is measured to exceptionally high standards. For the most part this sequel meets those expectations. It's visually stunning and has a great atmosphere. There's just three points of note that let it down slightly. I say slightly as they don't stop me scoring this an excellent 8/10. I'm not quite down to the level of nit-picking but these are certainly not major gripes.Let's get those minor negatives out of the way. It's overly long. A lot of it is setting that great atmosphere but it overdoes it. Secondly the ending doesn't reach any great conclusion leaving the viewer somewhat frustrated. The third point being the lead character is a replicant and shows little to no emotion, at least at the start and middle of the film. It's hard to empathise with an emotionless character and care about them. I said three points but I'll raise a fourth, though it didn't bother me being a bloke, but I'm sure more than a few women will find this film misogynistic. A large percentage of the women are portrayed as boys toys.The pros. As said it's a visual masterpiece and a wonderfully atmospheric setting. It ties in nicely with the first Blade Runner and is a worthy sequel. Will it reach the cult status owned by the first - only time will tell. I suspect not as few films ever do but this is certainly worthy of bearing the name of the first and highly recommended. Just exercise some judgement if taking a female friend to see it.",Blade Runner 2049
458,Lost_In_Translation_,Does a 30 year on sequel dream of being better than the original?,10,15 September 2019,"Coming into this movie I honestly was not excited. The original is of course a classic and sequels decades apart usually don't end up well. The only one I can remember recently was Tron Legacy, but even though I love that movie, it's not perfect by any means, even the original doesn't hold up well.So when I heard there was going to be a sequel to Blade Runner, I was extremely skeptical. Ridley Scott wasn't the director he used to be for a long long time, despite a few gems like Gladiator and The Martian. But when I found out it wasn't him directing, I became a bit more excited. Denis Villeneuve was a director's style I liked, but I was not a huge fan of Prisoners or Sicario. Visually they were stunning, but they never got to me.I was still on the fence until the critical acclaim started. So I bucked up and went to see it. It has been a long while since a movie had moved me like this one did. ""Her"" and ""Drive"" were probably the last two that I adored top to bottom like I did this movie.It got everything right. It felt exactly like if the original was made today. The slow a hell pacing, the dirty future, the gritty lead.A lot of people who I know at the theater I worked at did not like it. Their main gripe was ""there wasn't enough action. ""This is NOT an action movie. Just like the original it is a slow burning character and atmosphere piece. No one should go in expecting it, but unfortunately the trailers make it seem like a futuristic action movie like Minority Report or Star Wars (which are also good in their own right).Nope, this is a slow sci-fi movie that goes much deeper than shooting lasers or robot battles. The action is sporadic and when it does happen it feels real as if you're in the movie.Gosling is easily one of the smartest actors when it comes to choosing projects. From Drive, to Nice Guys to this, he is really selective at picking projects that usually end up being some really fantastic stuff. He shines here, despite being pawn in a bigger picture. Like Drive he is a silent, sulky type who knows what the hell to do when everything goes wrong. He is perfect for the lead in a future dystopian world.If I do have one minor gripe, it is that Deckard maybe didn't need to be in this movie at all. I was glad that his stuff is minimal and at the end, but the past decade or so has felt like Ford is doing a tour and showing up as his most iconic characters. Some work, The Force Awakens; other don't, Crystal Skull. He does a fantastic job showing us what a 30 years on Deckard would be, but the story would total have worked without him. But his minimal role still allows the other characters to be the focal point.As with the original, the cinematography and world building are the main draw of the movie. Seeing this one the big screen is a MUST, so it's a shame it was barely in theaters for 3 weeks. I so badly wish I had seen it again and possibly on an IMAX screen. There's not one bad shot in this movie, every frame is beautiful. I go back and forth on Hans Zimmer's work, but this is some of his best. He emulates the original Vangelis score, but makes it his own. Synth blares from all sides around you as you sit and bask in the godly cinematography.I still have yet to go back and re-watch the original. I didn't watch it leading into this as I didn't want to spoil my expectations. So I need to see it again soon for sure, but this might be a better overall movie? Maybe not. The original will always be cemented as a classic, and this one too might be, but we will have to see how it is revisited through the years. As with the first this one still has a cult-ish following. Probably more fans than the average cult movie, but Blade Runner is never going to be a name you hear as much in public like you do Star Wars or Avengers. But that's how I like it.I'm glad that some studios still let filmmakers take risks and make movies like this. They're few and far between thanks to producers mainly caring about the money aspect In this day and age it's great to see that someone greenlit a $100+ budget slow cerebral sci-fi movie. Sure it was a sequel, but a sequel to a cult movie.It will be interesting to see what Villeneuve will do with Dune. The original Dune is a mess of a movie, mostly ruined due to studio interference and not because of David Lynch. So maybe he can re-invent Dune as he did here with this. I do hope this doesn't get forgotten and is remembered as well as the first movie.",Blade Runner 2049
459,influxtwo,Modern classic,8,5 May 2021,I really love this movie. It has a lot in common with the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep that it is loosely based on. I love the music cinematography and the story.,Blade Runner 2049
460,nikxatz,Time to live,10,7 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels of all time.Visually captivating and full of deep philosophical questions about the importance of human existence,it is a spectacle that nobody should miss.The universe is created really well and includes new ideas and machines beyond our imagination.That makes the film more intriguing and original.The performances were really good,especially Sylvia Hoeks and Harrison Ford,and Ryan Gosling's character was deep and well- developed.The directing by Denis Villeneuve is breath-taking and proves that there are still directors that can make movies the are close to becoming masterpieces.The tone is the same,the visuals couldn't have been better and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is a total blast.But,most of all,Blade Runner tries (and achieves) to answer not only what makes us human but also what makes us feel,love,remember and understand what is real and what is not.It'a film not only with a mind.It has a heart(if we can define what has a heart and what doesn't).When you live the cinema you want to keep all these beautiful images,these mixed and complicated feelings and the spectacular experience inside you.Sadly,all those moments will be lost in time,like tears in rain.Too bad they won't live,but then again who does?",Blade Runner 2049

The music threw me off completely. Horrible job. The visual effects were nice, the acting from Ryan Gosling was very nice too. Harrison Ford was lacking throughout his whole part.
I was happy to see Ana de Armas perform so well, so props to that.
The storyline didn't have any depth either. So 2/10.",Blade Runner 2049
462,Akira-36,A sumptuous sequel to Blade Runner that is in love with its own aesthetics but missing the soulfulness of its predecessor,7,21 October 2017,"I guess my expectation was a little too high for Blade Runner 2049. I enjoyed Sicario and Arrival, and was excited to see what director Denis Villeneuve would bring to the classic sci-fi world of Blade Runner.My expectation was further built up after watching the three excellent short stories that the studio released on YouTube. They were wonderful short-films themselves. The narrative, the mood and the acting of the three shorts were nothing short of astounding.Now I'd like to point out that Blade Runner 2049 is a really well made film. You can feel the passion and respect of the film crew and cast in revisiting the dystopian world first written by Philip K. Dick decades ago.That story has been further expanded with intriguing new characters, both humans and replicants. However, at 47 minutes longer than the original movie, the film felt protracted. It seems Villeneuve is in love with his own storytelling as there were too many lingering shots over barren landscapes, the horse sculpture scenes and conversational points that felt somehow hollow. Although the visual aesthetics is gorgeous and the production design is top notch, I feel that 2049 couldn't decide if it wants to be Blade Runner 2.0, or Ghost in the Shell. The first is an existential study of identity and memory wrapped in neo-noir detective story in a dystopian retro-future. While the latter is an existential study of soul/consciousness wrapped in an action hi-tech thriller.Maybe Villeneuve or the screenwriters wanted 2049 to be both. Certainly, there are more and frenetic action sequences in this movie that for me, feels jarring when juxtaposed with the slow and contemplative sequences that almost drown the narrative flow of the second arc.It didn't help that the soundtrack was heavily post-industrious with mechanical clanking screeching over nostalgic synthesizer of the original's. While, the overall cityscape and gears in 2049 are kept retro-futurist looking, this sequel has lost the neo-noir feel of the original. Contemplative scenes and longing gazes of the original are replaced by emotionless look and disconnection between the characters.While the sense of mystery kept me engaged in the first half of the movie, the slow burn sequences in the middle and last part of the movie didn't really build up enough tension nor immersion in the story. So when the revelations of beloved characters showed up, they didn't feel so much as rewards but empty shells of their former selves.I agree that both Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas are beautiful to look at, but there is something mundane about them that kept pulling me out of the futuristic world. Perhaps someone like Armie Hammer would have been a better choice than Gosling. There is also very little chemistry from K towards Joi, and I'm not sure if it was written to be that way. Because K's interaction with almost all the characters in the movie were cold and disconnected as well. He posed and fought well throughout the movie, but when it comes to the investigative or character building portion, he didn't feel natural.I guess I found Detective K's character too stoic to sympathize with. More at home with his digital girlfriend than with humans, this blade runner does not exude enough emotion for me to understand his anguish outburst at the memories facility, neither did he hint at any stirring emotions that would make his character arc felt satisfying.In the end Roy's tears in the rain was more poignant than K's tears in the snowfall. If Blade Runner was haunting and dark, 2049 is tragic and sleek. I do enjoy the plot twists and revelations, but wish they had substituted some (but not all) of the lingering shots with more character building, especially building up Bautista's Sapper and Leto's Wallace characters. I appreciate the nods to the original movies with a slightly updated Spinner design and cameos from both Gaff and Rachael.In the end though, I'm glad they made this movie with such fervour and respect to its predecessor and to the original fans. It's just a pity that 2049 in my opinion lacks heart and soul of the original's. Who knows, perhaps like the original, I'll come to appreciate 2049 upon second or third viewing. Perhaps this movie is truly ahead of its time, much like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.One thing for sure, Blade Runner 2049 deserved to be experienced on the big screen. And it's a leap above Rupert Sanders' Ghost in the Shell.",Blade Runner 2049
463,andrewnmiller,Sci-fi cinematic perfection.,10,22 April 2018,"Given my deep-seated love for Ridley Scot's seminal '82 sci-fi noir classic, Blade Runner, I was over the moon when I heard a sequel was being made and when the first trailer dropped, I grew even more excited about seeing the movie, so I went to my local movie theater with a few friends and sat down to watch it. Once the film ended, I was left in awe and puzzlement at what I had just watched and after doing some deep thinking, I understood what the movie was doing and conveying to me. From it's themes and visual look to it's acting and musical score, Blade Runner 2049 is a wondrous work of modern sci-fi that doesn't pander to or take down to it's audience.The movie takes place in Los Angeles in the year 2049 and follows a replicant named K works for the Los Angeles police department as a officer or ""blade runner"" who hunts down and murders replicants that have gone bad. After retiring a replicant named Sapper Morton, K discovers a box entombed under a tree. Inside are the remains of a women replicant who died during a C-section, showing that they can reproduce, something that is thought to have been impossible. K then visits his superior and informs her of his discovery, she is worried that this could lead to war between the two races and commands K to find and destroy the child to bury the truth Along the way, K pays a visit to the Wallace Corporation head office where the dead replicant is identified as Rachel, the romantic interest of former blade runner, Rick Deckard. Now, as K begins to put the pieces together, he must enlist the help of Deckard to assist him in uncovering the hidden truth before society falls apart.While my love for Blade Runner came from watching it several times over many years and a whole lot of understanding what the movie was saying to me and deep thinking on what certain things meant, I came to realize just how much of an artistic impactful Blade Runner had on the genre of sci-fi as a whole and how it altered filmmaking as we know it and due to that, the movie has been seen a masterwork of cinema which is why it's so important to watch the first movie before you watch Blade Runner 2049 not just because it'll be difficult to follow what's going on but also because of Blade Runner's importance and how it shapes 2049 and turns it into one of the best-made movies of the decade and one of the best sequels I've ever had the pleasure of watching.While this movie may not float ever moviegoers boat, it would be impossible for even a casual movie fan to not be blown away by what Denis Villeneuve has given us or how significant the film will become in the future even if some viewers will find the movie boring, lacking any action, witty dialog or bizarre aliens while others love the movie for what it is and what it's telling them. The movie is gloomy, perplexing, bleak, miserable, dismal and empty, set in a future where humanity is clinging on while on the brink of catastrophe so while the movie might be a bit depressing, it's so cleverly put together by Villeneuve and his team that the only other filmmaker that did something on that scale was Stanley Kubrick and given how many of his movies have been despised by so many when they were first released such as 2001: A Space Odyssey which is a perfect example of this as it has magnificent visuals, but it failed hard with a lot of moviegoers and professional critics back in '68, but Kubrick always did what he did best by establishing a second thought in the viewer's head as many left the theaters feeling baffled and even a bit down-beat, but the film sowed the seeds in people's minds that eventually grew over the years. The first Blade Runner archived this to perfection and Blade Runner 2049 is no different. The movie will definitely live on as one of the crowning achievements in the world of sci-fi movies and will continue to be explained, evaluated and talked about for decades to come.Now while the story does carry on from the first movie, it manages to stand on it's own two feet and tell it's own story that does directly link up with the first movie but doesn't rehash the plot of it instead opting for a genuine follow-up set within the same universe. Much like the first one, Blade Runner 2049 is a artistic film encased in a tomb of atmosphere and while several other movies have addressed the issue of what it means to be human and our humanity, there are only been a few that have been able to tackle the subject as well as Blade Runner 2049, but it doesn't stop there. When the viewer begins to explore the themes of both Blade Runner movies, they discover certain allegories, motifs and clear jabs at racism, sexism, exclusiveness and commercialism as well as the misuse of the world's natural resources and neglect of the environment, breach of a person's privacy, disregard for those around us, extortion of the police force and the corruption of power in our government. It's a terrifying sight of what we could become in the future, at our individuality, at our worries from prejudice to temporary insanity to fears that haven't even been named yet but the viewer may also find brilliance, artistic feelings, virtuousness, and the need for compassion and fond memories when watching the film, all that is lost like tears in the rain.The pacing of the movie may be slow but there's a reason for that so the viewer has time to take in all the eye candy and all the symbolism being fed to them while the music, sound and the visuals keeps you focused on what's going on onscreen. While the story of 2049 continues on from the first movie, it grants us a much more diversified glance at what's outside the metropolitan waste-cage and the clamp of overpopulation but there's no change to be found outside of the cities as it still feels like an empty and lonely place even without hordes of people. The bleak desert sands, the enraged ocean waters, the garbage piles of San Diego and the immoral ruins of Las Vegas certainly don't feel any better and yet you are pulled in by it all as your eyes take all the visual splendor one frame at a time. The attack on personal space, unchecked commercial advertising and decadence sticks to the viewer like tar and is set in a blatant comparison with an apparent loneliness on the outside, not enhanced nor inferior, and all connected with superb sounds. Both Blade Runner films feel like an on-going clash between flawlessness and faultiness: our battle to build an ideal world for ourselves leads to a world that is clearly flawed as this is a world created on precarious ground composed of natural, intellectual, scientific, and mechanical disgraces, the kinds we tend to not notch or pretend aren't there. Watch this movie and the viewer soon finds themselves covered by feelings that miss the mark or don't come out right: suffering a nervous breakdown, passing away, decaying, feeling damaged, scraped or kicked around are all feelings shown in the movie and reflect what we as human are and how the future will effect us.When it comes to the filmmaking side of things, Blade Runner 2049 is nothing short of majestic. Denis Villeneuve who also directed Arrival and Sicario goes above and beyond with this movie, giving the viewer a deeply thought-provoking and gorgeous film that carries on from what the first movie set up and improves on it in every single way, in fact, I would place Villeneuve right up with Nolan, Coppola, Kubrick and Spielberg in the near future. The screenplay by Michael Green and Hampton Fancher is superb and emotional in its execution while allowing the story to go in new areas but without losing sight of what made the first one so wonderful in the first place. The photography and the visual look of the movie is amazing thanks to Roger Deakins who has already left his creative mark on such movies as Shawshank Redemption, Skyfall and The Big Lebowski just to name a few. The various settings all look different and provides the exposition though the visuals rather than just dumping it on the audience and the cinematography is key to telling that aspect of the story as everything looks absolutely stunning from the drizzly city streets and the eerily dirty landscapes to the snowy locales yet they never like they're part of the actual movie but instead part of a bigger world. As for the visual effects, they are just as spectacular as a mix of both real and CGI effects was used to create the world of the futuristic Los Angeles and it works incredibly beautiful when paired with the excellent production design, it truly does show the time, effort and care that was put into making the effects look as believable as possible and they look absolutely fantastic when they are seen on screen. Much like what Vangelis did for the first Blade Runner in terms of the musical score, the score for Blade Runner 2049 is just as perfect if not superior thanks to the composing talents of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Their gloomy yet amazingly heart-pounding score fittingly mirrors the themes and tracks that Vangelis used in the first movie while developing a soundtrack that has the complexities worthy of such a movie. In addition, while the musical score to the first movie can be repeated and listened to without having to see the movie, the score for 2049 is so thickly interlinked into the film that it's impossible to have the same replay mentality as the first one. The computerized and manufactured characteristics of the score builds on the wild shock of the human aspect on the Earth long before any of the visuals kick in. Another accomplishment in terms of the film's musical score is the creepy usage of a short but familiar fragment from Peter and The Wolf which adds to the dreariness and bleakness of the movie and disjointed songs by Sinatra and Elvis are just as frightening and exotic when set against the apocalyptic landscapes. Truly one of the clowning achievements of film scores in the last decade.When it comes to the acting, it",Blade Runner 2049
464,FabledGentleman,One of the best sequels of all time,10,3 October 2017,"Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!I have seen this film three times in the cinema, in 3D, 2D and 4DX.And one of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it's not the time in the cinema that takes up my time, It's the hours upon hours in between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer. This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape. And I've gone back to the cinema twice to be ""tortured"", but it's worth it.It's a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a possible near future where the human race is hanging by their fingertips on the edge of doom. So it's quite depressing. But it's so brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.Many Stanley Kubrick films were also ""hated"" by many when they first released. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for example, which had gorgeous visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers back then. But what Kubrick did best with his films, was to create afterthought. People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, this movie will without doubt live on to be interpreted, analyzed and discussed for decades to come. The story continues from the original, but stands completely on it's own, it tells a new story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to be a copy, it's a natural continuation in the same universe. You don't have to see the original Blade Runner first, though i do recommend it, see the final cut.BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league entirely. It's confusing to look at something so gorgeous, whilst painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides with your senses, your eyes say it's beautiful, your mind say it's depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean? At least don't confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is bad, it's nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then you will know how it feels to be a replicant that's trapped in a caged mind.BR2049's story happens 30 years after the original, and there is three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019 and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of the things going on. But the underlying theme is the same as it was in the original. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have memories? What is a soul? And so on.The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control, almost all animals and plants have died. People are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is looming just around every corner. Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049 takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been able to perfect, and that's what the main story is all about, and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the ""technology"", which will result in him becoming many hundred times richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself, and he calls his replicants angels.And of course he also uses replicants to do his ""dirty work"". In 2049 we meet his right hand ""girl"" Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks, if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it's her). Luv is a ""handygirl"" so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can't spoil anything, but look closely at Luv's character arc. All the other actors also do an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can't talk about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.Be prepared going to see this film, it's depressing and heavy on your mind, and it demands your full attention. It's one of those rare films who dares to challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155 million dollar risk at that. The film isn't perfect, but it's close, and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting, every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.I loved this film, it's the best film I've seen all year, It is a must see, a monumental triumph of a film that's just as good (possibly even better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!9.7/10 - MasterpieceAnd BTW Villeneuve's next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I'm going to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn.",Blade Runner 2049
465,SebMoz,A phenomenal sequel,9,19 March 2021,"It's very rare when a modern sequel/reboot is equal to the original in terms of quality, but this movie is that rare one. It carries over the sweeping and hypnotizing cinematography, it continues the storyline in a natural way, it references the original, but doesn't rip it off, it introduces new concepts without ruining the continuity, it expands on the themes presented in the original in a very natural way, it doesn't drag nearly as much as said original and it's got a more compelling protagonist. I have a feeling I'll just enjoy this movie more and more as time goes by, and I already love it a lot. It's a movie with a lot to unpack, and I have no doubt it will improve even more on rewatches.",Blade Runner 2049

Although I am a bit pessimistic that in 2049 the situation will be like the movie described since until this year, a year before the background used by the first blade runner (1982), still no signs of human clones will be legalized.
The only problem is the cast of ""K"", Ryan Gosling face is too soft for a mean, heartless blade runner. He acted good as usually he does but his face not tough enough for the character. Harrison Ford is more representative for becoming a blade runner. For the next Blade Runner (If there is), I suggest the director find someone with figure like Harrison Ford.",Blade Runner 2049

The story is a slow burner, but it kept me hooked right to the end. All performances were extremely good, with Ryan Gosling showing a vulnerable side to a robotic android. Harrison Ford too, showed a depth of emotion we so rarely see from him in his other films. All in all a visual stunner which was worth waiting for.",Blade Runner 2049
468,willeasyer,loved it!,8,28 January 2018,"Did you spot the reference to Spike Jonze's Her?
This movie is a treat, one of the rarest sequels that surpass the original and like the original, it will live for many years to come and age perfectly like a nice bottle of wine. Visually it's a masterpiece like a space-time colorful LSD trip, the cinematography is beautiful, outstanding and ecstatic thanks to the work of Roger Deakins who succeeds at creating an apocalyptic, empty and lonely future at the image of our protagonist. Plus this movie learned from its predecessor faults; it gave us characters with depth and struggle and a nicely built up story full of turns and twists something the original movie lacked I don't know if it was on purpose or not but it took off from it, but in 2049 we dive deep into the characters lives for example, we see joe at home, joe the human and Joe the lover unlike Deckard in 1982 we see joe outside work, and we feel his struggle, loneliness, and identity crisis and this adds to the complexity of the plot with its thematic about the search of meaning and love, and its universal question ""what makes us humans?"". I really loved it even if it was long and the ending is just outstanding one of the best I've ever seen so rather than focusing on the special one (the girl) they focused on a simple copy, its identity, and its the existential crisis in the middle of a replicant revolution! and this is one of the points that bothered a lot of fans who wanted to see more action and more time, but this movie isn't about action nor rhythm, it's a study of life through the Joe and if you're looking for a simply entertaining action movie this is not the one for.",Blade Runner 2049

471,soundoflight,Disappointing... but still worth seeing,7,28 October 2017,"This film had so much potential. It has great acting, wonderful and innovative special effects, lavish and imaginative environments, unique science fiction elements, it feels realistic, the music and tone are spot on, the cinematography is the kind you can watch for days... they only forgot story, and unfortunately that's kind of important. I was secretly hoping that they would have gone back to the source material, the original source material: the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep."" The themes explored in that book are compelling and fascinating and include morality, religion, and what it means to be human. The original ""Blade Runner"" adopted some of these themes. This film abandons them. Because of that, it feels soulless, nothing but a pantomime of the original.I think that the primary plot failing is that ""Blade Runner 2049"" lays itself bare. We know right from the start who is a replicant and who is human. This strips out the heart of what (to me) makes Blade Runner special: the questioning of what it actually means to be human and the juxtaposition of humans acting like androids and androids acting with selfless humanity. Very little of that is to be found in this film.Walking out, I was left scratching my head at what themes they actually were trying to get at here. None are readily apparent. So it ends up being a cool looking, atmospheric action/sci-fi flick. That's makes it a good movie, but doesn't make it a ""masterpiece.""People still talk about the original ""Blade Runner,"" 30 years after it's release. Nobody will be talking about this movie when the year 2049 actually rolls around.",Blade Runner 2049
472,NotMoreMovies,"Yea, um, no",5,24 January 2018,"Ok, first off, if you loved Dances with Wolves, then just stop reading now, and mark my review as unhelpful. For everyone else, or those who didn't like Dances with Wolves...you're in for the same crap.This is a very well thought-out and well-scripted movie, but it's so slow, and damned confusing. The plot moves with the pace of a political convention. It's hard to keep your attention span active, this movie will literally lull you to sleep, just like Dances with Wolves did to me back in 1990.So, honestly, I'm at a loss here, I don't know what to tell you. Go ahead, watch it and find out for yourself. But I swear, this is one of those expensive movies where they pumped money into boosting public opinion so that it would be ""uncool"" to say that it was ""bad"". It's not the first time and it won't be the last.I'm tired and this movie made me fall asleep, night everyone. :)",Blade Runner 2049
473,bobbyelliott,Decent but a shadow of the original,6,8 October 2017,"Few sequels match the original. Successful sequels, such as Terminator 2 and Aliens, rarely introduce new ideas. Instead, they build on the original plot - and have good plots themselves. Blade Runner 2049 definitely doesn't introduce any new ideas. New ideas are hard to come up with. A good plot isn't but 2049 doesn't have one. That's the difference between a movie based on a book (Blade Runner) and a movie based on a screenplay (this one). But, in spite of that, I enjoyed this movie. It's at least an hour too long for it's paper-thin story line but it's a sumptuous movie in terms of its cinematography and music. You don't even have to watch it on a huge screen (I didn't) to get drawn into it. I think anyone who enjoyed the original would enjoy this movie. The story line is sparse but, at least, it's serious science fiction and avoids sentimentality and silliness (I'm looking at you Matrix Reloaded). So, not bad. Decent science fiction. Wonderful visuals and music. Weak plot. Wasted opportunity.",Blade Runner 2049
474,conannz,Replica movie about replicants.,6,5 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner movie was slow moving, a bit clunky in parts and the acting was wooden. But then again that is what we expect of replicants. The set design and special effects were stupendous. Attention to detail right in the original Deckard flat which used designs from Frank Lloyd Wright were appreciated by many. Of all the story elements in the first movie the one that didn't make much sense was the romantic one. Sure Deckard made a connection with the replicant Rachel but by modern standards his encounter looks more like a rape than a romance.Fast forward to the 2017 version. The new team have successfully captured the tone and the look of the previous film. They even got a musician who can match the style although I kept looking around for a train or some other traffic at various times due to the extra ""horn"" sounds. Not sure what they were but they didn't add anything to the film. I believe it was something called a Shepard tone which is an unneeded gimmick.Tyrell is gone and replaced with some weirdo called Wallace who appears to be blind. He appeared to kill a new ""replicant"" for no reason other than to look creepy. His sidekick is a kind of anti-Rachel replicant who has her own mission. I don't think we even learned her name which is a bit disturbing if anyone was hoping that a strong female part meant something. Apparently her name is Luv which must be ironic.What is less ironic is that the very core of the movie hints at something only a woman can do but for the whole movie we see events from the ""male gaze"" and none of the women are treated as anything more than slaves. The politics of the replicants and humans is part of the narrative but there is no self awareness here at all.K the blade runner who is the central character appears to be having some kind of identity crisis but since he doesn't feel pain it is hard to tell. I was confused as to why a replicant has a holographic girlfriend but maybe that is part of the general confusion over identity. However it is problematic that so far the only human we get any airtime with is a police woman who does make a grand speech about the significant of a particular plot element. That speech is more coherent than most of the talk in the film. I understand the use of a MacGuffin. I'm not sure it is necessary to have the MacGuffin get so much screen time but it is the Deckard character. The whole wander around a deserted casino seems like it was cribbed straight from another '80's movie called Cherry 2000 which featured similar subject matter. Apparently this is what happens to Las Vegas and the giant statues of women that we see toppled over leads one to think for a moment that perhaps they worshipped women in some kind of long gone world. The film makers could have done something with that but it is clear that the statues were just props like women are in the rest of the film. After the baddies find Deckard and K the plot lines get thoroughly scrambled. It might also be because that would have been about 2.5hrs into the story. There is an attempt to wrap up some loose ends but in my opinion by then I'd had enough. There is an action sequence near the end featuring 3 replicants with no real emotional heft which adds to the confusion. It felt like an attempt to rescue the story. Ironically Roy in the first Blade Runner movie was much easier to make some kind of emotional connection with. Sure he was extreme but he wanted to live and he offered up a range of emotions.The characters K, Deckard, Luv and Wallace were hard to identify with. Maybe that is the price of mistaking an idea for an actual living thing. It very much seems to me that what we have is a replica of a movie. Something that could have happened in a holo deck but hard to take seriously otherwise.I really wanted to like it and perhaps if one was to edit out 30 or so minutes it would be much better.",Blade Runner 2049
475,Jona1988,Does the original justice but also dares to be more than just a rehash,10,25 November 2017,"Blade Runner is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It may be my favourite ever actually. So, when after years of rumours it was confirmed that a sequel was too be made I was mostly sceptical. Long overdue sequels fail more often. For every Mad Max: fury road there are a lot more Indiana Jones 4 or ones that fall somewhere in between like Prometheus. When it was announced that Ridley Scott would not return as director some fans probably reacted disappointed, but I was actually positive. If he had really wanted to make a sequel he would have made it earlier. Denis Villeneuve was an excellent choice to take the reins. Prisoners and Sicario were great and I mostly enjoyed Enemy. Then the release of Arrival just made me more confident. I happy to say that Blade Runner 2049 managed to more than live up to the amazing original. What is so great about this new movie is that it does the first one justice while it dares to be more than just a repeat. The story, characters and even the look of the film differs quite a bit from the original. A new filmmaker doing a sequel to a classic might feel pressure to just try and imitate the original creators. But having seen other movies by Villeneuve one sees clearly that he has made the movie like he wanted and not tried to make a Ridley Scott film. I think that even if one did not know you could see that the two movies are made by different filmmakers. The plot is excellent and has the same types of themes as the first one, such as questions of humanity. But the actual story is of a different type than the original. It takes quite a number of twists and it turned out not at all like I had thought it would be. Compared to the first movie this one actually has more plot. The movie has many big actors and they all do great some even with kind of limited screen time. Ryan Gosling is great in the lead. You really feel for his character. Also he is not simply Deckard version 2. Ana de Armas performance deserves mentioning. Everyone knows Harrison Ford is in the movie it's no spoiler. His performance is great and especially it doesn't feel like he's just in the movie for fan pleasing. He seems to put more effort in this role than he has in a long time. The last couple of movies he has felt like he would rather retire. He also doesn't just play Deckard like before but he plays Deckard thirty years later. Things have happened since we saw him last. Enough cannot be said about cinematographer Roger Deakins and his role in the creation of the experience that is this movie. It looks amazing and also amazing in that it's a continuation of the world we saw in the first but still not the same thing again. They have put great detail and thought into the technology in the world. They have really focused on the continuity that the world really feels like the world we saw in the original but thirty years later. I'm so relived that the movie also does not get bogged down in references and call-backs to the original. This movie creates memorable moments of its own not simply by reminding you of all that was great in the first one. I heard there was some problem regarding the composing of the music but none of it shows in the finished movie. Hans Zimmer has created a brilliant score that has the same feel and style as Vangelis but without just reusing his melodies. Some have complained about the length of the movie but that was never an issue for me. There are parts that slow down but I can't see how they could have cut it down without losing stuff and making stuff feel rushed. But some modern audience not familiar with the first one might very likely be bored. This movie is made by people who liked the first one for people who loved the first one. I have already seen it more than once and like the first one it really benefits from more viewings. There is so much more in this movie than meets the eye.OK so finally which movie is the best? Like I've repeatedly stated the movie separated itself form the original enough to be judged just on its own. But if I must choose then the original is still the best. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels I have seen. It lives up to the original Blade Runner while somehow managing the feet of feeling like an amazing movie just on its own.",Blade Runner 2049
476,reisen55,Death of a thousand cuts,2,8 October 2017,"There should be an award for the Todd Ramsey School of film editing. Remember him? If you do not, venture back before the original ""good"" BladeRunner to the cold winter of 1979 when all SciFi fans trotted into theatres to see STAR TREK: THE MOTION(less) PICTURE. Remember the editing? What there was of it. Well, just lasted an hour and 40 into this thing, an emotionless creature of a film. Did not even get to see Harrison Ford. Other reviewers have said "" slow "" and that would be a good thing. THIS film is not slow, it died ages ago and is trying to be an alive thing. Scenes are soooooooooo long and drawn out they starve the mind for creativity. Frank Capra once said the cardinal sin of making a movie is to be BORING and the old master was spot on. BORING and I walked out so consider this a partial review. If you can stand it to see Harrison Ford - my blessings unto you.Acting? The ONLY interesting performance that I saw was Robin Wright and that just because I am a Claire Underwood fan.Story? If you see plot points of significance 30 minutes BEFORE they happen, then you have a bad story. And the editing, see above.Music? Only occasionally a hint of the old, wonderful 1982 score. Mostly the music is noise. Other reviews here have said they have mastered the sudden LOUD sound to wake the viewer up. WHY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT if the film was not so freaking SLOW!!!!! I loved the film noir effect of the first film and it's variations over the years till Ridley Scott got the 2007 version he liked. I love films in general and even find good stuff in the 1979 Star Trek of a kind.There is no joy in this film, no emotion, no urgency, no nothing. Warner Bros. blew $185 million (!!!) on a memory from 1982 and it is far from that. Do not wait for it on DVD either - why waste 2 Hour 44 Min of a nice evening. Find a good restaurant for a good dinner instead.They did not even have fireballs exploding over the Los Angeles of the future!!! Can I report something good? No. Honestly, cannot do so.

477,alanpgini,"Had a hard act to follow, but, still good",7,13 January 2018,"It's good, but not great. A little convoluted and gets a little too tricky with assumptions and suspension of disbelief, but its worth a 7 out of 10. This is a case of a movie that could never live up to the original, due to the great effects that were made for the original and its dated time frame. it's a practical impossibility to follow up a classic, thus an impossible act to follow. However, it is definitely worthy to call itself a good sequel. In my mind. Very very rarely, is a sequel equal to the original. Examples are the Godfather part 2, and, coincidentally, a sci fi film starring Harrison Ford The Empire Strikes back, can be said to be better than the original. Ryan Gosling is somewhat wooden in this role. I get that he is essentially portraying an android, but a more inspired actor could have done something better with it. It was a treat seeing Edward James Olmos ,though you have to wish for something more than an extended cameo. Overall though, it's definitely worth the watch, and I highly recommend it.",Blade Runner 2049
478,a666333,"Don't fall for the hype, this is a thin patchwork of incoherence",4,15 June 2018,"Let me start with the length. I like long movies, properly done, they give you an extended, hopefully rewarding experience. But first, that experience has to be generated. I am not sure what experience this sequel is working toward. It is very vague and amorphous and extremely patchy. The patches do not work toward a cohesive whole. It is as if they will need another movie of equal length to make it coherent and to finally find some meaning (I am sure that idea was/is being kicked around). A slapped together, disjointed, virtually incoherent mix of settings, characters, images, dialogue, etc. sums up the essence of this movie. This is amplified by how these elements are obviously borrowed from other films. 
 
Considering the visuals, we get some interesting tricks that are amusing for a moment but they serve as distractions from the thin, hazy plot. 
In the original, the viewer is allowed to immerse them-self into the dystopic Los Angeles and get a feel for it. That dystopia was absurd and beyond unlikely in many ways but the richness and consistency with which it was presented made it easy to accept it temporarily. Not here, instead we get absurdity for sure but internal logic is not even attempted. We get a very strange place that is never explained and never makes sense. Are we so dumbed down as viewers that we just accept any mishmash of extreme images wrapped in fog as a coherent and believable vision-of-the-future? 
 
Dialogue? Being vague and pseudo-cryptic with some cynical clichés does not equal being profound or meaningful. 
 
There are very few characters of any kind here and by the end, I did not care about any of them, even Ryan Gosling's ""protagonist"". There is leftover sympathy for Harrison Ford's Deckard but they don't help it along much and there is not much for him to do. By the time he shows up, one is momentarily hopeful that something interesting will finally happen. But instead he just passively folds into the slowly swirling mess. The dog that hangs out with Deckard for a while might have been the most sympathetic creature. At least he/she might have been a creature. Keeping track of who/what might be human, replicant, or hologram is not easy. Again, this is a huge contrast to the original that had a large number of substantial characters. 
 
Another symptom of the patchwork is the number of wasted clichés and theatrical name dropping. For example, Dave Batista had a small part that he does well but which was incidental at most. Edward James Olmos was back from the original just so they could say he was there. These bits attempt, but fail to paper over the fact that very little actually happens. We don't even get any good fight scenes. (one tries to find a silver lining and fails) 
 
If you missed this movie, please don't worry, there are better ways to use the time. In fact, you will be better off as your memory of the original will not have the shadow of this cast over it.",Blade Runner 2049
479,therapeuticsuicide,"A worthy, albeit unnecessary, successor to Blade Runner.",8,14 March 2018,"Where Ridley Scott's original film was visionary, Denis Villeneuve's re-imagining lives up to its predecessor in terms of film as art, as well as remaining faithful to the cyberpunk film noir style Scott first pioneered with regards to its deliberate, patient narrative and visual presentation. For certain we could have asked for more, but the film makes the grade, unlike other reboots in Hollywood with detrimental results to the foundations laid out by their predecessors. Upon first viewing it was difficult not to draw unfavorable comparisons to Scott's film, however, when viewed a second time, particularly with a more open mind and willingness to accept that not every wish you could imagine of a sequel over a span of thirty years could possibly come true, the film's texture and narrative find more appeal. Speaking as a matter of fact, this film, had it not been overshadowed by the presence of Scott's original masterpiece, would surely have been classed a masterpiece of its own, but alas, such is not the fate of any work or thing which finds its place under such a massive shadow as is cast by one of the greatest works of possibly the very greatest director to ever walk this Earth.",Blade Runner 2049

481,elcoat,Depressing with too many questionable questions.,2,26 June 2019,"More than one person has wondered why this has such a high rating. I suspect it is ballot box stuffing by the studio's friends ... or bots ... which I have seen for other recent, poor movies.Didn't Rachael and Deckard head up to Alaska at the conclusion of the original? What were they doing back in Los Angeles? Why would they have wanted to return??At the end, how was Joe able to take Deckard to his daughter without Wallace stopping them?Much cruelty and blood-letting.I liked Olmos being in the film, so I'm upping it to a 2.But it is a very depressing film showing a future from - in - Hell.And I think there will be many more real humans left alive in 2049. 1984 wasn't in 1984, although we seem to be sliding into it now.",Blade Runner 2049

That's not ""Blade Runner"" film.

483,Instant_Palmer,Ugh...A Tedious Mess,2,17 October 2017,"Two words of advice to Denis Villeneuve on directing upcoming Dune redo... Story-Boards.There seems to be no planning involved in BR-2049. Just LONG drawn-out dreary scenes with occasional meaningless dialogue delivered in mumbled whispers by a talented, but poorly utilized (and clearly bored) cast.Roger Deakins' cinematography is the only ""bright spot"" in this tedious film, and for his brilliant (as usual) work, the movie goes from a 1 to a 2 rating.Perhaps Dennis was thinking at some point in making this film ""just let Roger do his thing, and perhaps the audience will overlook the unengaging scenes and dialogue.""But even Deakins cannot save this film. which begs to be cut down by 45 minutes (another word of advice to the Director - EDIT!)I am certain many will rave about Blade Runner 2049 - I am just not one of them, and calling it like I see it - I cannot fathom how any critic can honestly give this movie a good review.This is pure dribble and now my ""worse movie of 2017"" choice. Not an easy feat as this year has been one of the worst for new production releases. I just hope there is not another release this year that ranks lower. 😑",Blade Runner 2049
484,aquascape,A welcomed expansion to Scott's universe,10,28 March 2018,"Back when I first saw the original sci-fi classic ""Blade Runner"", I never thought I'd get to see a sequel to it. Slowly times were changing and sequels, remakes and reboots were at the front-end of Hollywood's production line and by looking the quality of said sequels, I feared that a continuation of ""Blade Runner"" would be a bad idea. Well, I am glad to be wrong! Not only ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a masterpiece of film making, it's also one of the best additions to the science-fiction genre in the past decade.Denis Villeneuve's class is remarkable, after his first stab at a sci-fi with ""Arrival"", the French-Canadian director manages to push himself even further and re-imagine the dystopian universe created decades ago by Ridley Scott. Partnering up once again with famed cinematographer Roger Deakins, the two expanded Scott's neo-noir classic to greater distances, sweeping up an abundance of awards just for cinematography alone, include an academy award.The story takes place 30 years after the events of the first movie, where a young Blade Runner, played by Ryan Gosling seeks out the truth about himself, leading to the search of Rick Deckard, played by the same tireless Harrison Ford. Having Ford on board was crucial to the development on the script, proving that his grouchiness was essential to the character's current beaten down state of mind.
Another solid point is Dave Bautista's knack for playing supporting characters who won't steal the show, but will add plenty to the scenes they're in.""Blade Runner 2049"" has a long running time, almost reaching 3 hours and yes the pace was slow at times, but that should not make you leave the theater or fast-forward the movie at home. It's not surprising that it didn't perform beyond expectations at the box-office, slow paced gritty neo-noir aren't for everyone and certainly not for the ""Transformers"" era of cinema.While it does top it's predecessor, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is an example of a sequel done right, just like ""Terminator 2"" and ""Aliens"".",Blade Runner 2049
485,Bek204,"""I want to be real for you""",9,7 May 2021,"To be able to do a sequel of a film that is well known since 1982 and it ends up being as great as the first one (or even better for some) is INSANE. And there is one person who can do that and his name is Denis Villeneuve.Denis Villeneuve was put in a very difficult situation. Because he had to make a sequel for one of the best (if not the all-time best sci-fi films ever) Blade Runner (1982). A film that a whole generation grew up watching and after many decades they get to see a sequel of it and the most important question was will it be good or will it ruin the whole ""BLADE RUNNER STORY""? Denis gave us what many might call ""the best sequel ever"". He proved to everyone that if in the future you see that title ""directed by Denis Villeneuve"" don't worry at all and be sure that it will not disappoint. The directing is one of the strongest elements in the film. It's full of details and ideas that aren't just crazy or unique but they will make you ask ""How is it possible for a director to do that?"" And ""why and how didn't anyone think of those ideas?"". The visual effects in the film are going to blow your mind. They are so unique and different.The cinematography might be the strongest element in the film. Roger Deakins deserved an Oscar FOR SURE. The camera movements and angles were able to capture the beautiful, futuristic, (sometimes dark/depressing) world of Blade Runner in an unbelievable way that I have never seen and will never forget. Every shot in the film will stick in your head because of its beauty.The production design worked perfectly as well alongside the cinematography to capture the futuristic world of Blade Runner.The music that was composed by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch was perfect and did fit every scene. And the great thing about the music in ""Blade Runner 2049"" is that you can hear some of the beautiful work that Vangelis did in the first film ""Blade Runner"" as Zimmer and Wallfisch did use some of them and mixed them with their work and they gave us a beautiful/futuristic result.Many people complained about the story and said that it isn't as interesting as the first one and to tell that story in 2h 44m is a lot and could've been shorter especially that the build-up was so slow. Now I agree that the film is long and the build-up is slow and for those who hated the film I totally get their point and I could see what they are saying. But, in my opinion, there are many other elements that really saved the film and made us (me at least) forget about the long runtime the film has. I also saw the story as very interesting and was very curious to know where it was taking me scene after scene. The characters are really interesting as well and the acting of each was well done. Ryan Gosling as K was more than good. Ana De Armas as Joi gave the film a different atmosphere (especially her character). The dialogues and energy between Joi and K were beautiful and sometimes even deep or dramatic. And that's thanks to the chemistry between Ana De Armas and Ryan Gosling. Jared Leto's performance was so good but unfortunately, his screen time was short. But, for him to be able to give us a great performance in such a short time means that he played his character perfectly. And like I mentioned, the rest of the supporting cast was great as well like Mackenzie Davis as Marietta, Sylvia Hoes as Luv, Dave Bautista as Sapper, and of course Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard.To me, Blade Runner is a true and entertaining masterpiece that I enjoyed from beginning to end. I wouldn't argue with those who disagree with me and totally get their point. Great film, great cast, great cinematography, great music, and most importantly great directing.My rating is 9.5/10.",Blade Runner 2049
486,janoffpeter,A true masterpiece,9,4 August 2019,"I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this. That's what I said about the original Blade Runner.It was long but none of it felt wasted. It held nearly true to the iconic original yet technology escalated the visual aspects far beyond what seemed cinematically possible. The soundtrack all important was equally as mysterious and the brutality of the future was brought to the forefront in a way that didn't disappoint. Harrison Ford nailed it in his sequel roll and Ryan Gosling proved an effective successor to the beloved Daekert. Edward James Olmos was there as well however fleeting, which delighted me. I could have delivered a full 10 if it t were a bit lower tech and there had been more memorable a script. The first delivered more iconic sound bites yet for what this was I am totally blown away by each and every character and each and every gorgeous reference to the original version. A beautiful and thoughtful film and an enormous success no matter how you slice it. This deserves to be watched and studied. I have seen the original about 10 times or maybe more.",Blade Runner 2049

488,theoriginalantiblonde,I bet Androids don't dream about Ridley Scott - not anymore,1,2 September 2019,"Now I didn't even bother watching it after luckily reading the bangon reviews here about the need for Hollywood to constantly remake the standards from before instead of coming up with something new. But I almost did after a quick check of it's rating here (and before reading any actual reviews). Hollywood needs to take a time out and think about what they have not been doing. Thanks to reviews by wrt-47222, k-57670 and zvh-82397 to name but a few, that caught my attention with their wittiness and/or common sense, and for stopping me from wasting my time watching it even on Netflix, let alone at a theatre! Man, to think I almost spent two and three-quarters hours watching Ryan Gosling smirk by choice... I just feel sick.I'm giving it a 1 cos I don't give a good (or bad) gawdamn about pretty girls, especially when they're praised for just being pretty and thin. And because if there is something such as sin, then scoring a weak remake like this higher than an amazing classic like the original, then this defines it. And because no one should ever take advantage of an author like Philip K. Dick when he's not around to defend himself! Shame on you all.",Blade Runner 2049
489,CinePendejo,"Beautiful and faithful, even if a bit far-reaching",8,9 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner is one of those films that left me cold at first but got progressively better the more I watch. It had a very dreamlike ambiguity that fit well to its futuristic noir setting but needed more dissecting to fully appreciate. Considering the many cuts that it had, director Ridley Scott couldn't muster with what he had either. It wasn't until the then-unsuccessful movie got a final cut that Scott found the soft balance between artistic dreamscape and science fiction in the film, which ultimately was declared a classic upon many film nerds. It was purely a unique and meditative experience which, like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, told a complete story that questions our sense of reality and how far can we as man can reach beyond it.The new sequel, BLADE RUNNER 2049, with ARRIVAL and SICARIO director Denis Villeneuve, aims to both expand and pay faithful attention to the original film and what it stood for. Updating the scenes while blending with the original, expanding the philosophies of our existence and our persistence to recreate it, continuing the story of Rick Decker rather than rehashing it, and even mostly replicating the Vangelis score. Its bold, far-reaching, and tightly restrictive sequel filmmaking, one that Hollywood cinema seriously needs considering the franchise-sequel-remake dreck we are forced to live in. Even though there are some elements that overreach its grasp, it mostly gets the job done as a worthy successor.One thing it does right is get right down to humanizing the replicants. Now centered around Ryan Gosling as a replicant hunting other replicants, the film puts him on center as a guide to the films themes about how these beings cope with reality. Some small replicant details from the original get blossomed here, as they cope with their love, anger, memories, nostalgia, and the quest to find existence. The key difference is that it puts the themes to expand and even humanize the life of a replicant rather than leaving them illusive. We get brilliant techno ways in which our titular character finds love, identifies memories, copes with his existence, and ultimately comes to term with it. The whole subplot alone with Gosling and his robot love interest (Yeah yeah put HER joke in here) makes for easily the most emotionally resonant moments in the film. Its a film that fully branches from the foundation of the original in ways other sci-fi films in the past decade failed miserably on their own.The sole caveat, however, is that it sacrifices the one key ingredient from the film; subtle poetry. Whereas the original felt ambiguous and transcendent in exploring our humanity, 2049 could not help but feel too modernized and accessible. The bloated run time, sudden swell of percussion of the score, fairly streamlined plot, expository dialogue up the wazoo, and a little too much of slow pace made it clear that the overall film could try so much while also keeping a modern blockbuster aesthetic. Much like the replicants, 2049 could only go so far for achieving the real thing.Still it doesn't mean it totally falls apart. Even if the films ambitious reach is only as good as its grasp, the movie does have one hell of a reach. The set pieces are amazing, the small amount of action scenes puts me on edge, the acting from Gosling, Ford, Robin Wright, Ana De Armas and even freaking Jared Leto was phenomenal, and the story pays off relatively well. May not be the masterpiece everyone else says it is, but I'd be glad Hollywood takes notes from this rather than from JURASSIC WORLD, AVENGERS, or another STAR WARS spin off.Definitely worth your time.More reviews: https://letterboxd.com/Itachisan125/",Blade Runner 2049
490,xmike-25541,I was expecting more,7,10 October 2017,"First movie by Villeneuve which didn't blow me away.. after insomnia or prisoners or arrival he decided to make a scifi sequel which is visually great, perfectly casted but the story itself or more accurately the ending isn't mindblowing, honestly there isn't a thing what you would thinking about after the movie..everything is good but i was really expecting more.",Blade Runner 2049
491,lhunt-9,"Blazing new ground, despite the (now obligatory) dystopian vision",8,12 October 2017,"Well, Blade Runner 2049 certainly lives up to the hype, and did anyone mention the soundtrack? Wow. I should, however, expand a little on my recurring critique of dystopian science fiction, since it's about the only kind of scifi you can find at the movies, and Blade Runner 2049 falls into the genre like almost everything else in the scifi category these (unimaginative) days. Dystopian visions of the future abound, but overlook (1) that a lot --- if not most --- of our present problems will be solved --- even in the intermediate future a few decades hence, and (2) that the problems of the future (apart from human nature, which basically never changes) will most likely be substantially different than the problems of today. It's hard to see how a fusion-powered, robotics and biotech-enhanced future is going to be characterized by poverty and homelessness, just for example. Overcrowding? Yes. Few jobs for unskilled workers? Quite obviously. Human nature? The same as ever, as mentioned above. So, despite its slipping into the #dystopiaasusual category, Blade Runner 2049 may possibly be the greatest science fiction film ever produced. Surely there has never been another soundtrack quite like this one, and I'm ready to award the set designers every prize on the shelf. Ryan Gosling is talented enough to carry the lead, and he was very well- supported, including by a re-energized Harrison Ford, who has pulled himself back from the edge of the abyss. Denis Villeneuve has now established that he can do anything (he's now talking about revisiting the Dune narrative; and somebody should actually introduce him to Heinlein and Asimov if he's drifting towards the classics in the genre). So, despite some caveats, this production burns so much new ground that my call is 10/10.",Blade Runner 2049

493,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Plain and simple if you hated Blade Runner. You will hate this movie.,10,5 October 2017,"This really was a sequel to Blade Runner. And damn was it near perfect. It could've been trimmed just a little bit and it would've easily been a 10/10 for me. Above all else this is a beautiful looking movie, Denis Villeneuve definitely knows how to make the shots look good. Every single frame is just stunning to look at. Had the pleasure of watching it on the British Film Institute's IMAX theatre which is ""One of the biggest scenes in all of Europe"". There are so many twists and turns in the story you almost have to avoid everything about it to really embrace the experience. If you didn't enjoy Blade Runner you will hate this movie. But if you loved the first movie, you're in for a ride. It honors the original and still manages to stand out on its own. I'm so glad it turned out as well as it did. I think when people go to see this movie they'll walk out disappointed, but like the original years later it will be remembered as a great accomplishment in filmmaking. I'm also thankful it didn't have any scent of a franchise around it, no setting up sequels or spin offs it was just one movie. Regardless if you like it or not, you can't deny how they went all out. They finally got the Blade Runner sequel made and it was made by so many talented people who clearly show how much love they have for the original. You can see the passion put in to every technical aspect of this movie to make it feel like before. That alone is worth seeing on the big screen, to be immersed into that world again. Can't wait to pick it up on 4K blu ray along with the original.",Blade Runner 2049
494,CarmaChan,The most intriguing threesome in cinematic history,10,7 October 2017,"It's Saturday morning. Blade Runner 2049 officially released last night, the reviews are in, my husband tells me a headline written by someone who is clearly disappointed--in the money that came in? I can't imagine being disappointed in the movie!I can imagine a slow build at the box office for this epic scifi sequel, because young people with whom I've spoken were utterly unfamiliar with the fact that Blade Runner is one of the top 3 scifi films of all time. Scifi doesn't get better than Blade Runner and 2049. I told two colleagues yesterday that I'd seen the movie on Thursday night and restrained myself from hyping it too much...I hate to hype it up and ruin it for others. I hate spoilers. I hate reading reviews before I see a movie, and more often than not I hate reading reviews after I've seen a movie because it taints my experience. I write reviews when I feel strongly about applauding the work of a great crew and cast, or explaining where it lost me for the artisans of future movies and series.Let me just say that not only does BR2049 feature the most intriguing threesome ever filmed--which is saying something--it also moves and twists in mysterious ways, in plausible ways, in deliciously gritty and dirty and sensual ways. This is film noir at is utmost best.I love that it starts out with minimalism and slowly builds with perfect foreplay and a climactic ending that I will not forget. I love that Ryan Gosling is the star, the protagonist, the leading man, the blade runner of 2049, and I love that I had to wait to see our beloved Mr. Ford until exactly the right moment in the telling of a complex, rich & believable plot.I love/hate this world. I adore the cinematography, the characters, the way they're portrayed. I rated this movie 10 stars because I find no fault with it. It is a magnificent work of art, it is a great movie, it is everything we want a movie to be. And it is rare that an almost 3-hour movie doesn't feel like one. At no point while watching did I feel restless, bored, irritated, impatience, or ""that's ridiculous"". Solid plot. Outstanding performances. Excellent dialogue. Perfect audio, visual, special fx, makeup, wardrobe, music... it's all so smoothly blended, one doesn't notice it while watching, one is simply, blissfully engaged.",Blade Runner 2049

All I can say is that 2049 went well and beyond my expectations.This film blew me away in every way humanly possible. Despite the fact that this was release over 30 years after the original Blade Runner, the link between the two is so seamless and the universe is expanded in such a beautiful way, with certain things being simply so intuitive and well done. Additionally, the futuristic setting is no longer hindered by the limited abilities of 80's CGI, meaning that the visuals in this film are mind-blowing. In fact, please don't attack me but I actually prefer 2049 to the original Blade Runner.The storyline is fascinating, managing to be complex and developed without making things over-convoluted. It was better-explained than in the original as well as being more interesting and thorough. Throughout the entire thing I kept trying to find out what was happening, something that was often being changed due to how much information was being disclosed to us. 2049 is a little on the long side, and I feel like there were definitely some things in the middle that could have been cut, but I think that you couldn't have had such a masterpiece if it was shorter.This has joined my list of the top science fiction movies of all time.-Sasha",Blade Runner 2049

503,javi-y-se-acabo,"Captivating, Stunning, and Emotional. A Modern Masterpiece",10,8 October 2017,"Just wonderful, what Denis Villeneuve did with this movie is fantastic. He did a sequel of the science fiction masterpiece that is Blade Runner, and he did it well. Not only well, but on the same level of the original, without a doubt.This movie tells the story of K, a Blade Runner of Los Angeles that discovers a secret that could bring the whole world to war. This is not a very good summary, but it's better you watch it without knowing too much about the story. Well, the first movie treated themes like what makes us human, our own identity and the ethics of robotics and so. This movie goes even further with this topics and develops them more, introducing many questions about the meaning of the characters and all this things, and it leaves you thinking a lot about it.Ryan Gosling is the main character K, and he is fantastic. I still have to watch a movie where he is not good at. He carried a big part of the movie, and you really connect with his character and his motivations. Then there is Harrison Ford, who reprises his role of Rick Deckard from the first movie, and even if he does not have many screen time, when he appears on screen, he owns the scene. Ana de Armas plays Joi, a mysterious character that I won't spoil anything about, but she has a really powerful performance. Sylvia Hoeks also has an important role in the movie and she is really badass and brings a great performance as the assistant of Wallace played by Leto. And now about Leto, he has a small role in the movie, even if he is in all the trailers, but he is really great. There are also some minor roles payed by some great actors like Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Dave Bautista and even Edward James Olmos. They all don't have a really big role, but they add a lot to their characters and their scenes.Now, let me talk about the visuals. WOW! Roger Deakins deserves the Oscar just right now, because the visuals of this movie are really amazing. Not just Los Angeles city, but all the environments, the deserts, all of it it's just a beautifully crafted shot. This with the magnificent directional work of the great Villeneuve, creates a fantastic landscape that will captivate you for more than two hours and a half and will keep you staring at the screen with your eyes open looking at this stunning movie. Also I have to mention the also captivating and powerful score that Benjamin Wallfisch created with the help of Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack is really near the same level of the one Vangelis created for the first movie and together with the stunning imagery, the powerful performances and the captivating story, you have a really great piece of cinema art, that will come down as one of those classics of the science fiction..I would recommend this movie to everyone in general, but specially to the fans of the original, the fans of this director or the fans of science fiction, because this is truly a great achievement in the genre of the science fiction and in movies in general.

504,aleksandarsarkic,Some good moments but generally looking totally unnecessary sequel,5,19 October 2017,"Original Blade Runner was always one of my favorite movies. I still remember the first time i watched it and how i was left totally speechless for next one hour when it was finished. The movie totally changed my life perception and some believes, it was like spiritual experience to me, and still it is every time i re-watch it. I always felt that the movie is unique and that they should not make some reboot or even the sequel in the future, but Hollywood is totally out of ideas these days and they decided to made a sequel. I was skeptical from the beginning of the idea, but when is saw it that it will be directed by Dennis Villneuve (really enjoyed Arrival) i decided to watch it. And my impressions are generally mixed. The first half of the movie is generally okay but the second when Harrison Ford appeared is total mess. Really nice visuals through the hole movie but they are without the soul like other things in the movie, it can't be compared to the opening sequence in original movie, that experience, that visuals will never be beaten. Also the same case is with the music, it sounds like bad replica of original soundtrack i really don't understand why they didn't hired Vangelis to do again soundtrack, i suppose it must be some kind of lobby because Zimmer is composing every second movie from Hollywood, don't get me wrong he is also great composer but Blade Runner without Vangelis is not Blade Runner. Cast in the movie is nothing special, no one is worth mention, Gosling is generally okay, but others especially female crew totally disappointing. Everyone complained about Jared Leto, yes i also don't like him but in the role of Wallace was totally solid. But the most i complain is the ending, they made it that we can expect now ten more Blade Runner movies and it will look at end like some Marvel nonsense franchise at the end. But i must admit that i enjoyed some parts, had a great time, and it is definitely better than new Star Wars movies. If you go to theater with nothing to expect and to watch it as a totally different movie not Blade Runner you will have great time, if you expect some deepness, message and uniqueness you will be disappointed. My grade 5.5/10.",Blade Runner 2049
505,ToneBalone60,Utterly disappointing. Dreadful score. Ford struggles to stay awake.,4,12 February 2020,"Where to begin.
this could have been so much better but clearly nobody involved really was that interested.
The musuc score was an assault on the ears. None of the iconic Vangelis of the original. I kept waiting for that uplifting euphoric score that defined the original. (Apart from the initial dam scene and a brief resurrection of the Vangelis original theme during the snow scene which is quickly blotted out.)
Gosling does the best he can but he knows he's fighting a losing battle, on his own, with this slog of a plot, clunky script, predictable direction and overly pretentious minimalist cinematography.
In parts it feels like a budget warehouse movie. The CGI ruins it, nothing feels genuine, too many pastiches of the original that aren't necessary, other and to remind you that it's Blade runner.Robin Wright is still in her Clare Underwood role I'm afraid.
Jared leto is unconvincing and underutilized.
Harrison Ford has clearly been brought along against his will, in order to add box office $$ validation to the movie.
He looks like a tired aged captive in this movie. He's meant to look old and reclused but its evident he's unfit and bored with acting and bored with this role. Its agony to watch the shoots he clearly struggles to get through.
There is a remarkable performance by Carla Juri however and Mackenzie Davis is always fascinating. Excellent casting here and their work should not be lost in the overall weakness of the movie.
The ending us weakly inconclusive because I guess they hoped for a few more sequels with the underworld resistance of the replicants. Unfortunately its a tired old trope that has been used too often before. ( underworld resistance v. wicked corporation v. benign but shady government...think Maze runner etc etc). I doubt however that we will be seeing BR 3 anytime soon.Sadly they should have left it at Rutger Hauer's parting shot.

Even in it's grimness it's style shines through, minimum action, just one well made scene after another leading to a bit of a crescendo finale.

508,littleging12,"One of the Most Beautiful Looking Films Ever, but it drags",8,26 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 successfully captures the essence of the 1982 original classic. Denis Villeneuve was the right man for the job as he brings his maturity, ingenuity and passion, whereas a different director (including Ridley Scott) might have sacrificed quality for nostalgic fan service and superficial storytelling. Villeneuve deepens the world and storyline of Blade Runner in only a way Denis knows how: by being super artistic, visually stunning, mind-bending, and very slow.Blade Runner 2049 attracted some of the most talented and beautiful people in the world to bring this story to life. The film bleeds with mastery, from the directing, to the acting, to the gorgeous production design, to the techno ambient soundtrack, and to the Oscar-worthy cinematography. The lavish and stunning visuals are so incredibly beautiful that if films were graded based on visuals alone this would hands down be the best movie ever. But obviously they're not, so I can't make a statement that bold.Blade Runner 2049 is a little less entertaining and more artful than mainstream audiences were probably hoping for. The storyline builds upon a mystery and slowly unravels throughout the long runtime. It bounces off of one startling revelation to another while subverting viewer expectations in the process. The film picks up on themes from the first and expands upon them in a deep, philosophical, and sometimes confusing manner. Jared Leto's character Niander Wallace talks in such deep metaphors that it's hard to follow everything he is saying. Also since there was no studio interference, the film didn't have a spoon-feeding voice-over narration like the theatrical cut of the original. This allowed for the film to be more artful and less heavy-handed.Clocking in at 2 hrs. and 44 min. makes this nearly an hour longer than the original. The film had many scenes that seemed unnecessary or could have been trimmed down like Ryan Gosling walking around broodingly, weird robot sex scenes, or mundane everyday activity. The pacing was even slower than the original mostly due to the long runtime and the compulsive need for extended shots. The original was quicker, less boring, and had a much stronger conclusion with the most epic monologue in film history.Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece and a good sequel to an untouchable film. It's so artistic, beautiful and detailed that a single viewing wouldn't do it justice. It's just that siting through certain scenes again will more than test the patience of some. 7.5/10",Blade Runner 2049
509,rphanley,The original didn't need a sequel but they did it right!,9,12 December 2020,I loved this sequel and enjoy the slow pace and the hopelessness vibe from the very beginning.

510,t-81966-84968,a brief evaluation,8,22 April 2020,"The story of blade runner 2049 is pretty much intelligible, but it's not easy to really understand the movie's theme. It's a 160-minute movie, and there's a lot of information, and villeneuve has a problem with telling the story too clearly, hiding the clues and information behind the storyline. The slightest indiscretion misses a key point
To be fair, blade runner 2049 isn't exactly a commercial movie, though it's not obscure, it's still arty and slow. However, the visual style of the film was unanimously affirmed",Blade Runner 2049
511,cschultz-2,"Glacial Pace, Ponderous...But Seamless Continuity",7,9 October 2017,"Occasionally a major motion picture will be modified by a film studio based on the criticisms of test audiences prior to the movie's release, and without the creative participation of its director or screenwriters. Such a movie was 1982's ""Blade Runner,"" directed by Ridley Scott and released by Warner Bros. At last count, ""Blade Runner"" existed in some seven different incarnations, including the original version, the studio-modified version, the restored version, one with narration by star Harrison Ford, another with the narration removed, and others with scenes either augmented with additional footage, or removed entirely.Set in a bleak and hopeless Los Angeles in the year 2019, ""Blade Runner"" imagined a future in which human-like androids, called replicants, are manufactured to toil as slave labor in off-world colonies. Mostly indistinguishable from actual humans but with superior endurance, intelligence, and strength, a group of replicants escape to Earth from their off-world settlements. A burned-out LA police detective is assigned the task of hunting down the escaped replicants and destroying them. The term ""blade runner"" describes a hunter of replicants.Despite its troubled production history, many consider ""Blade Runner,"" in either or all of its incarnations, to be among the best science fiction movies ever produced. And in the thirty-five years since its original release, fans have been clamoring for a sequel.""Blade Runner 2049,"" released on October 06, is that long-awaited sequel. Set thirty years after the original, ""Blade Runner 2049"" follows yet another blade runner, now investigating the remains of a replicant who displays postmortem evidence of having produced a child— unthinkable to their technology. The officer is assigned the clandestine task of locating the child of the replicant, if it exists, and destroying all evidence surrounding the pregnancy and the birth.Produced by many of the same people responsible for ""Blade Runner""— Ridley Scott returns, this time as a producer, leaving the direction in the able hands of Denis Villenueve—the sequel is a worthy follow-up to the legendary original, although the picture is not without problems. Presumably because so many versions of the original picture exist, the sequel seemingly attempts to embrace them all. And as a result, the movie displays a tendency to over-explain even the most rudimentary points, accounting for both the picture's glacial pace and its mammoth running time of nearly three hours.As a means of compensation, ""Blade Runner 2049,"" with an estimated budget of some $180 million, is also bigger than the original in every way possible—visually stunning, filled with sometimes astonishing optical effects, and with a booming synthesized music soundtrack strongly reminiscent of the popular Vangelis-composed original. Much like the music from Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" from 1968, the ""Blade Runner 2049"" soundtrack emphasizes music tones so low on the chromatic scale that they're often felt rather than heard, underscoring the audience's frequent sense of awe.Actor Ryan Gosling, playing the 2049 blade runner, is appropriately conflicted by his assignment, and eventually troubled with dividing loyalties. Harrison Ford also turns up somewhat late in the picture to reprise his role from the 1982 production. And to the filmmakers' credit, the continuity is nearly seamless even after a thirty-five year hiatus.Despite his prominent billing in the picture's advertising, Ford's role is relatively small, but the resolution of the film's plot relies on his character's participation. Which begs a question—since Ford's participation in ""Blade Runner 2049"" was far from a sure thing until almost the beginning of production, what would the filmmakers have done had the actor declined to participate?",Blade Runner 2049
512,jaapeelman,Too long sequel of the better original Blade Runner,6,13 October 2017,"You need at least read something about the original Blade Runner to understand a bit what is going on in BR 2049. The story in this sequel is very thin and it is all about the miracle that if you have sex with a replicant you can make her pregnant.... Well if you believe that in the near future something as replicants are possible you probably also can believe that they can get pregnant. I liked the original BR very much not in the last place due to the brilliant role played by the dutch Rutger Hauer. In BR2049 Sylvia Hoeks, also from the Netherlands, plays a very good role too and the same goes for Ford and Gosling. But the movie is way too long, too slow and the stupid scenery with the artificial girlfriend are really stupid. The sphere is dark and pessimistic, the special effects are great and so is the sound (sometimes the sound created a dark atmosphere as well although nothing was happening...) but the story, is as said before, not good and the movie should have been not longer than two hours. I saw the movie in the cinema but a few times had to fight not to fall asleep because of the slowness of the movie. Could have been much better and the 8.6 on IMDb.com is absolutely way too high!

It is first a piece of art before being a means of revenue, and was the best and only approach to the classic film that anyone could have asked for. It not only answers dying questions but presents news ones, and is a great addition to the beautiful landscape of the Sci-Fi genre as probably one of the best films that the genre has ever seen. The acting is superb, the visuals are to die for, and the story is unforgettable. Sure some might argue that the pacing of the film is slow at times and some characters are left underdeveloped, but Blade Runner 2049's negatives come with their trade offs. Both Zimmer and Wallfisch bring back Vangelis' iconic score in a new and creative way, and Villeneuve has solidified himself as one of the greatest directors of our time. In the end I decided to give Blade Runner 2049 the highest rating I could possibly give it, as it won itself The Golden V as well as ""Straight V's"" on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10.

514,iNickR,Is It Ready To Be A Classic Film?,7,5 February 2018,"Blade Runner 2049, in short, takes place in the year 2049 (yep, it's true). Killing replicants is still a viable job and tasked with that duty now is a young stud named Officer K (Ryan Gosling). One stormy afternoon while minding his own business killing a minding-his-own-business replicant, K unearths a secret. A crime was committed 30-years-ago but the only evidence that's of any help is an old piece of carved wood and some numbers scratched on it. The suspect in the brutal crime may have been a replicant, and it's up to K to bring the skinner to justice the only way a good Blade Runner knows how: retirement. Enter old stud Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who disappeared 30-years-ago with the last known replicant ordered to be executed (let's call it what it is). Deckard knows how to hide - being hunted for decades will teach you a few things about that. It's K's hunch that Deckard may have a little insight into this mystery that's been slowly eating away at the young Blade Runner. Now he needs to find the old man before someone less friendly does.Blade Runner 2049, IMHO, is a nice companion to the original 1982 masterpiece by Ridley Scott. I've pretty much said all I can without getting into spoilers, so I'll touch on the technical side. A movie like this requires strong, believable CGI. There must be attention to detail and it absolutely must look realistic - about as realistic as you can make fiction, I suppose. Blade Runner (1982) left us in awe with the special effects (winner of two Academy Awards® in that category). We've sort of become accustomed to great CGI now, and, for the most part, we know what CGI is capable of, so it's pretty hard to blow us away. Thus, CGI heavy movies also need a good story and good acting to hold our attention. Blade Runner 2049 has most of that. Director Denis Villeneuve (how sick was Sicario, right?) puts it all together and makes it sing beautifully, but not perfectly. It's too early to tell right now whether Blade Runner 2049 will become a classic like it's daddy; there will be plenty of nerds arguing about that - both for and against.I just like watching movies; I'm a fan not a critic, and this movie is enjoyable to watch. One that I could probably see again without getting bored. Chances are, you'll feel the same way if you made it this far.",Blade Runner 2049
515,rnixon1974,Blade Runner 2049,5,8 October 2017,"When the original came out in 1982, I was a kid. The movie was probably a bit advanced for an elementary schooler, but as the film moved along, I found it to be all but mesmerizing. In the ensuing years, I have watched that film at least 20 times. It holds up better than any other science fiction movie I have seen to repeated viewing.Looking back, that had to do with the script more so than Ridley Scott's direction. The actors were well cast and they gave excellent performances (except for Leon).Fast forward 35 years. Denis Villneuve is the director of the sequel, and Ryan Gosling plays K, a replicant blade runner. Gosling (and Ana de Armas, and Mackenzie Davis, for that matter) spends long periods of time in this film's rather lengthy scenes gazing meaningfully at the camera. This does nothing to move the plot forward, or show the audience anything about the character. I don't blame Gosling and the other actors for this pseudo acting. I have seen Ryan in older movies, where he actually performed, as opposed to gazing meaningfully. This movie simply is poorly edited, and poorly directed.I also noticed a bit of disjointedness among all of the meaningful stares. I have a feeling there were a few rewrites in the course of the filmmaking. The scene in Las Vegas when K meets Deckard seemed haphazardly thrown together.The original film was based on a Philip Dick novel, and it is admittedly slightly reductive to say Dick's book had a bit of a philosophical bent.In my opinion, the sequel tries a bit too hard to show, with visuals, how deep it is (the love scene with Joi comes to mind). I blame the director for this as well.As for the sound, other reviewers have described it well - The sound effects are probably the worst feature, loud, grating and unnecessary. Multiple scenes of gratuitous violence and gore add nothing to the plot.Including the eardrum-bursting ""Music"" Sitting at the back I could watch as people's heads slumped to one side, only to be jolted awake by an especially loud synthesizer swell.The movie's music is sometimes too loud. It reminds me of the movie Interstellar. It's hard to appreciate certain scenes when the music is too loud.To these comments, I can only concur. Vangelis' score from the 1982 film was much better than this discordant, heavy handed attempt.This movie was advertised heavily for months (Sony fully intends to make that $180 million back quickly, judging by all those commercials/trailers). Denis Villneuve's sequel is barely worth two and a half hours, and is not worth the price of admission.",Blade Runner 2049
516,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,A superior sequel that stands on its own.,9,7 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner I have more respect then fondness for. Similar to Ridley Scott's latter philosophical sci-fi film Prometheus, I admire the movie's ideas, themes and world-building but as a story I don't really care for. Where as the original asked lots of questions about human identity, Denis Villeneuve's sequel explores the answers posed by those questions in very emotional and psychological ways. The answers may not be ones you would expect but show how the famous question, ""what does it mean to be human"" is one not defined by our own creation or sense of destiny. He takes the many common sci fi plot tropes in many blockbusters and constantly turns them on their head. Similar to his previous film Arrival, Villenneuve uses the themes of memories to act as the driving force of the narrative. Unlike the original, 2049 feels fleshed out with compelling characters and multiple unique locations. It goes beyond just futuristic LA, which has gotten even bigger and more hi-tech to reflect how technology today has evolved since the release of Ridley Scott's film 30 years ago. The events and actions of the story are defined more by the impact of character's choices rather then the characters going along with the events. Despite having a longer run time then the first, 2049 feels like it moves at a better pace because more is happening then just a simple detective story. But Villenueve doesn't get lost in the plot of the mystery. He makes this story feel personal by following the blade runner K's journey as a character.There have been a lot of sci fi masterpieces with stunning visuals but I would say Roger Deakins kept stealing the show with the best cinematography I have ever seen. Nothing against the directing, writing and performances but the shot compositions kept me constantly in awe and distraction in an almost hypnotic ways. Not only are the shots and lighting atmospheric but they also feel almost like a character itself as they change to reflect the mood and tension of the scene. And they fit perfectly with the Vangellis-inspired score by Han Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch that makes you feel you are transported to that world.Gosling shows that he is perfectly suited to Villeneuve's style. Similar to Drive, Gosling's performance is very much quite and subtle. His character K does not say much as he does not feel the need to speak his own voice to question or challenge his way of life. But once he is put onto a mission that questions how his world actually worked, his quest becomes one of self-discovery. This leads to his journey intersecting with Deckard's. One of the issues I have with Blade Runner is the fact that Deckard is not really a character that you can connect with or feel sympathy for. One of the biggest improvements 2049 does is giving Deckard a tragic backstory. After a lot of build up to meeting Deckard again, it doesn't disappoint. Ford shows a more broken and human side of Deckard that the original did not. We see his isolation is one not of choice but forced to protect the only really human connection he has in this bleak world. Other great performance are Ana De Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright and especially Dave Bautista who has the least screen-time but probably gives the best performance of his acting career. The one performance I thought lacked subtly was Jared Leto's philosophical antagonist Niander Wallace. His character had some compelling traits but I felt the least connected to.While there have been a lot of genre classics revitalized to capitalize on nostalgia, Blade Runner 2049 does not feel like one that is forced to make you remember the past. Instead Villeneuve uses the original's story as way to tell his own story about choice vs destiny. By the end of this movie, you feel like it has been a satisfying conclusion to what the original Blade Runner started as opposed to being a setup for another franchise or cinematic universe. While many die-hard fans will argue about this, 2049 surpasses the first Blade Runner by giving a resolution instead of leaving it open with another question.",Blade Runner 2049

518,cjs6547,"Certainly Beautiful, but What Else?",5,13 October 2017,"This film is breathtaking in its slow minimalist artistic shots combined with a wonderful soundtrack, and it knows it. It works that to its advantage, like a beautiful bimbo at a Las Vegas strip club, but 2 hours and 40 minutes are a bit of a stretch to spend in that company. You soon realize that there's little else beneath the surface, that your mind is always at least one step ahead of the plot instead of trying to keep up with it, and that the film is using cheap emotional tactics which is a real shame considering they weren't necessary in the 1980's. The real shame is when you realize that the 1980's version holds its ground even when it comes to cinematography.The first hour and a half are devoted to invoking empathy for the subservient existence of new replicants. At some point it's a bit too in-your-face, and any intelligent audience would agree that here in 2017 we shouldn't need constant reminders about why dehumanizing humanoids is painful. From then we take painfully slow steps to uncovering the single mystery our replicant is in charge of. It is disappointing how many missed opportunities there are for a true, multicultural, futuristic, populous society and some fast, wowing action scenes. Our protagonist is - granted - a simple guy, but with exquisitely prehistoric tastes in his ladies (read 40's doting housewives). I think suggesting that even the most under educated of males would desire that type of partner in the 2020's is setting women's lib behind a lot. I am all for equality, and a man is free to desire a dumb slave if that is what he wants, but the protagonist of this franchise and in a romantic way? Hell no. Also, I do not recall any scenes where he is mingling with a multicultural crowd or even if there are more than one flying cars in the environment, which is an outright sin.Being a recent devotee of cyberpunk, I wanted to love this film. I wanted to feel the leap we have made in 3 decades. The leap, however, seems to be entirely superficial, with maximum focus on the visuals and sound, and otherwise assuming that your audience are a bunch of pre-pubescent kids who need everything spelled out for them and long periods without fast action to huddle and whisper about the plot.

519,f-rabit,Awesome Soundtrack!,10,17 October 2017,"The original ""Blade Runner"", back in the eighties, is one of the best movies ever (It features in my ""top ten ever"" list). Not only the mood, visuals, effects, actors, story are good, but the music....all of the sound tracks are absolutely amazing. Again, in my opinion Vangelis - ""Blade Runner"" is the best Soundtrack ever, the best vangelis album and the best electronic album ever made! That could be the reason why Vangelis didn't participate in this ""2049"" sequel. A masterpiece like that couldn't be beaten. I figure it must have been hard for the director to chose the right composer for the sequel. Maybe harder than to chose the leading actor - Gosling delivered very well, by the way. So, I was in a very high expectation state about this aspect, but when the movie started I immediately relaxed, because you could feel the same ambient and deepness which facilitated the immersion in the movie and eased the link with the previous one. I loved the soundtrack. It's absolutely majestic and great and one of the most interesting aspects about this film. It's also very present, from the beginning to the end, and you feel that it is vital to the movie that it happens that way. I watched it in an 3D IMAX Theatre. The image was astonishing and the sound....incredible. The Perfect setting for the Perfect movie. About the story and the asthetics, I loved the visual effects, the wardrobe, the city ambient, the light, the pace, the actors, everything. And I must highlight, that I'm not a R.

522,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,A visually stunning film that keeps the spirit of the original,8,9 May 2018,"This film has a lot in common with the first film. Like Blade Runner, this film is visually stunning. It's beautiful in that same bleak sort of way. It moves along at a very slow, methodical pace. While often that's a death knell for a film, that's not the case with this. It lulls you into the story and you find yourself fascinated by what's happening. I'd heard very mixed reactions about this film going in. Many people who I heard complain, complained because there isn't enough action. Which makes me wonder if they've ever seen the first film or forgotten what it was like? There are moments of action, but like the first film that isn't the primary focus of the story. If I had any issues it was the fact Ryan Gosling isn't as engaging as Harrison Ford was as the lead. Don't get me wrong, those are some huge shoes to fill in regards to being a leading man, and I doubt many could pull it off. He's solid but doesn't quite have the gruff charm Ford's Deckard had in the first one. I fully understand why some people might be leery of checking this out with the close to 3hr runtime. It's a reasonable fear, but if you enjoyed the first one it's worth it. Even if you have to break it up into two viewings to accomplish the task. Like the first film, you need to pay attention to what's going on. Maybe even more so with this as there's a lot more to take in and process. I'm glad I gave it a watch. I'll eventually buy it and sit down and view it again, but it will be awhile. Despite liking it a lot, as with most any film of a longer length, the time commitment is going to push me away more often than not. Still, it's a damn solid film.My Rating: 8/10",Blade Runner 2049
523,rblenheim,A worthy masterful sequel to the original masterpiece!,10,17 March 2018,"It was the long-awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction classic, ""Blade Runner"" that grabbed me unlike any other film in 2017. As I accumulated four theatrical sojourns watching ""Blade Runner 2049"" I found a deeper and richer experience with each viewing, one that, to me, even surpassed the original as serious art. The reason for this was undoubtedly due to Scott entrusting the renowned Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve (who had made ""Incendies"", ""Prisoners"", ""Sicario"" and the previous year's ""Arrival"") when making his version to honor the original film's world and philosophical themes while laying claim to his own poetic vision and personal style. Taking place 30 years after Deckard and Rachael had emerged from the elevator to leave the smog and overpopulation of 2019 Los Angeles, this new film follows a recent model replicant (with a normal human lifespan) called 'K' (played perfectly by an appropriately imperturbable Ryan Gosling) as he investigates a growing uprising when he unearths the remains of a once-pregnant replicant, something that leads him not only into mysterious territory in which he discovers the now reclusive Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford in one of his most nuanced performances), but also leads him through a journey into his own identity. Darker and more sparse than the original, ""Blade Runner 2049"" dives into a more nihilistic milieu where the earth's digital and technological systems have been wiped out from an ecological disaster known as the Blackout, and the air and water have become toxic, plants and animals have gone extinct, and there has been mass migration to urban centers with the rich moving to off-world colonies. Even sunlight is only visible through thick layers of smog and clouds, and various cities like San Diego have become large garbage disposal areas. Villeneuve, now at the peak of his directorial powers, moves us inexorably throughout this elaborately-detailed world for a full 164 minutes, something for which the film's cynical detractors have criticized, but I praise him for having the courage to allow its story to develop in a carefully measured fashion, taking the time to allow its willing and patient viewers to be engulfed into its world view. I liken it to turning over one's self to the listening of a Wagner opera like ""Parsifal"" in which time seems to stop as one is encompassed completely by another place, another time -- and after its long viewing I seemed to awaken as if having submitted to a dream, emerging somewhat reborn and more enlightened with knowledge of the human experience. And that is what this and the original film are really about. Underneath its marvelously detailed science fiction trappings with its state-of-the-art production design and special effects (often eschewing CGI for authentically-constructed sets and realistic miniatures), and heightened to a level of unmatched beauty by the cinematography of Roger Deakins, the film is really a thoughtful meditation on what makes us human.",Blade Runner 2049
524,Bigweight66,Good idea wasted.,4,3 January 2021,"The producers and directors of this movie were very self indulgent in trying to create their own masterpiece. At 2 hours and 44 minutes it's just way too long for what it delivers. It needs to be an hour shorter, it took me 3 sittings to watch it all, as it was slow and boring in many parts. They could have saved lots of time if they reduced that amount of time spent on long slow walks and vacant stares. Also a lot of the actors seem to talk very softly, which makes it hard to follow the plot.
The story itself is good and flows well from the original Blade Runner movie into this movie. The story is, many years after the event, Blade Runner K must investigate and track down the possible child born to a replicant and former Blade Runner. There are a few twists and turns in the story, but it takes far too long to tell the tale. Blade Runner 2019 is no where near as good as the original Blade Runner. This newer movie was a good idea but wasted on trying to be a masterpiece or better than the original.",Blade Runner 2049
525,creator301,Check my Ratings,9,23 October 2019,"I look for problems, plot holes and general dissapointments. The only dissapointment for me was that this movie ended. Similar enough and different enough. Perhaps its not an exact sequel to an amazing film, one that made me hate modern movies more than I already do upon viewing, but its a true gem in the toilet that is hollywood today. A lot of reviews saying there is no emotion makes me wonder about the human race.",Blade Runner 2049
526,yoyopa,Beautiful and Interesting BUT...,7,10 September 2019,"Three hours? Really? The length of this movie had to be due to hubris... I appreciate Denis Villeneauve but this film was unnecessarily long and I have to imagine he thought everything he included was not just necessary but also interesting. It wasn't.However, the visuals and some of the plot were enough to keep me engaged throughout. I've never seen the original(ya I know. relax.) but I appreciated that it wasn't necessary to understand what was happening in this sequel made so many years later.I honestly thought the story really had something going right up until the director tried to subvert our expectations a la Game of Thrones style. The ""twist"" was lame and I immediately lost interest and missed the time I spent watching the film.As for Gosling, he's never been a favorite of mine but I really enjoyed his performance here.Harrison Ford was Harrison Ford. The movie didn't need him in it but whatever. Jared Leto was there... being weird and not much else. The script really didn't give him anything to do.It was clear that the producers let Villeneauve run with this one when maybe they should've reined him in a bit but hey -- there are only a tiny handful of really talented directors working right now and it's fair to count him among them so I get it. 7/10 enjoyable but far from a sci fi game changer.",Blade Runner 2049
527,n-m-bertin,You haven't felt like this in front of a film in a long time,10,9 October 2017,"I was a huge fan of the first film, it aired in Europe with the director's cut, I never saw the other cut. It was dark, violent, transporting. The new one is different. It is by all means Villeneuve's baby. The symbiotic between the music (or the absence of it) and the visuals is stunning. It is akin to what you see in Interstellar, and if this is the future of movies, I like it. It is not the same emotions as Interstellar though. Blade Runner 2049 feels incredibly lonely and powerful, even more than the first one. By making it bigger, by showing us how the world is, you actually feel even more lonely and sad.There are scenes where the tension is so vivid you can hardly breathe. There is the violence you don't expect, even just the emotional violence. For some reason I felt the most powerful scene is Luv's last scene, her will to live was just incredibly powerful, especially next to K/Joe's implacable resistance. There is so much to this movie... First of all it doesn't betray the first one. I liked how it was faithful yet went beyond. You still don't know whether or not Deckard is a replicant. And that blackout even, with Wallace not able to make replicant as good as Tyrell's was very well written. It basically means replicants today are even more faulty (which is why they need constant baseline checks, and why K is so faulty and human, most people seem to miss that).Some people will say Deckard isn't there for 2 thirds of the movie. I didn't mind. This is mostly about K. I thought it was even better that he wasn't Deckard's child, it made his character more powerful. I didn't expect it to be so well written, but I can't find a single plot hole... And people who do are mistaken. Why did Stelline implant real memories in replicants ? So they'd find her parents.I think this movie is a rare case of everything working at once : the perfect director, whose style is now so vivid. You feel the gigantism, loneliness, and tension you felt in Arrival in Blade Runner 2049. The casting is amazing, especially the female characters (Gosling being great of course). The visuals are stunning, especially in relationship to the music. The music doesn't work on its own I think it just works with the images. Also it knows when to go away. So many powerful scenes where there is no music yet it's deafening.Not doing well in the box office ? You bet you ass it's not. It's 2h40 of raw emotions, visuals, sound and acting. People believe you can see it without having seen the first Blade Runner. I believe you NEED to see the first one to appreciate it to the fullest. So many Easter eggs it's unbelievable. That makes it even more powerful. It's a movie that, like the previous one, will last for a very long time. No one believed this sequel was a good idea, they did it anyway. Thank you.",Blade Runner 2049
528,anthonymichaelbangert,"Blade Runner 2049, A Sequel Worth Waiting For",10,17 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel to the Ridley Scott directed 1982 masterpiece Blade Runner. This movie, starring Ryan Gosling takes place 30 years after the events of that first film. Nexus 8 replicants (replicants with advanced artificial intelligence and an open-ended lifespan) have been made illegal due to a series of rebellions in 2022. Few survived and went into hiding shortly after. Years later, in 2036, a new line of replicants was created. The Nexus 9 models are complacent and made to never turn on humans. Ryan Gosling plays one of those models, a Blade Runner named K. His job is to investigate cases of Nexus 8 models in hiding and retire (kill) them. After one such mission, K makes a discovery that turns everything he knows completely on its head. I will not go into any specifics, as any spoilers would ruin the movie's mystery.This film was an incredible feat. After 30 years, many would consider a sequel to be unwarranted and frankly, unnecessary. For Denis Villeneuve to captivate his audience, he needed to establish that his film added to the mythos, not cheapened it. In short, he did so extremely well. The cyber punk meets noire style that had made the original film so iconic was well represented. Every shot was masterfully crafted to hint at the mystery without giving it away. Blade Runner 2049, like its predecessor, requires multiple viewings to start to put together all the finite, masterfully crafted details. The soundtrack adds just enough atmosphere to allow the audience to essentially enter the movie itself. The new tech designs and pieces felt like they belonged in the world, and didn't feel tacked on. The acting was superb. Ryan Gosling does a fantastic job as K, though the true best acting comes from supporting actress Ana de Armas who plays Joi. Her role was simple, yet the actress brought so much life and depth to the role that I couldn't help but be captivated by every moment she was there. In all, Blade Runner 2049 is a fantastic movie that hits the aesthetic of the original while still being a fantastic movie on its own. I only had one slight problem towards the end when the movie had a flashback to explain everything to the audience. One of the greatest things about the first movie is that nothing is spoon fed, it takes multiple viewings to piece together the whole story. While there are moments that are better understood through a second viewing, I felt that the flashbacks slightly cheapened the movie, which is why I can't grant it a perfect score. 9.8/10.",Blade Runner 2049
529,oragex,OK Science-fiction movie on it's own. This is not related to the original Blade Runner from 1982.,5,8 October 2017,"First and foremost the title is a scam. This movie is called ""2049"", not ""Blade Runner 2049"".This is not a sequel of the Ridley Scott's 1982 movie. It is a different Sci-Fi movie.Ridley Scott has done a one time wonder. He proved he can do a REAL movie, something which was rarely reproduced in the commercial film history. He knew he was spending with his movie both in money and time much more than it was normally allowed for a commercial film meant to make money. Therefore, his 1982 movie was something like a handmade custom build car ordered by a wealthy magnate. Or think of a very expensive, single production handmade timepiece watch. This is why the 1982 movie was never and will never be reproduced, until some oligarch and big fan of the Ridley movie will dispose $1B dollars in actual money to order a new Blade Runner just for his own liking. The 1982 movie had real characters (with the exception of Ford) something specific to the independent movie industry or to foreign films with truly talented directors and actors. It also had this extremely rare quality of pulling yourself from your sofa or theater seat, and literally bring you in a completely new universe and keep you right there almost physically to the point of smelling the running water for the 2 hours of the movie.As for the ""2049"" movie, it has nothing like the 1982 production. It has superficial characters - OK play overall, but a few miles away from a quality acting and a further few light years from a remarkable performance. All the actors from the Ridley movie are absent, with the notable exception of Ford - which was actually the single problem of the 1982 movie. So basically they kept the single worst aspect of the 1982 movie and put it in the 2049 movie. The power of transporting you in another world from the 1982 movie is absent, the music of Vangelis is absent, the almost 4D sets are absent, the striking characters are gone. Like ... tears.. in rain.",Blade Runner 2049
530,huntersmithx,"One of the best sequels ever, and a Sci-Fi milestone.",10,31 May 2019,"On October 8, 2017; my first viewing of ""Blade Runner 2049"" had me at it's mercy. This hotly anticipated sequel to the 1982 classic ""Blade Runner"" was met with critical acclaim despite an underwhelming box office run. However; 2049 and it's predecessor, unlike tears in the rain, shall not vanish in Cinematic history.This film is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's everything I could hope for in a movie and more. Say what you will about Hollywood churning out sequels to milk off nostalgia; but not all of them are just cheap cash grabs and have stories worth telling, and 2049 is a fine example of that.This has all of the qualities that has made ""Blade Runner"" such a treasure among movie buffs and Sci-Fi fans alike, and dials them up to 11. Dazzling and majestic cinematography and special effects- both computer and practically made mixed with dynamic set designs. A bruising and immersive score by one of the best composers, Hans Zimmer, will have you listening to it on repeat.It's artistically inclined storytelling will keeps you hypnotized by every frame, in spite of a slower pace. It's pacing, while some were turned off by it, is similar to films like The Godfather and even the original Blade Runner in how it allows you to soak in all of the awe and detail (not that there's anything wrong with fast paced movies either).This film works as a worthy tribute to the original, while expanding the Blade Runner universe and taking it in bold and powerful directions. It continues to explore the question of what it means to be human in a world that has lost most traces of humanity, which makes it bleak and at times tragic, yet astonishingly beautiful and hopeful. It demands every second of your attention yet rewards it to it's fullest while leaving you hungry for more.All of the performances are pitch- perfect. Ryan Gosling steals the show as Officer K, a detective with an emotional arc unique to Hollywood protagonists. His cold swagger, subtle charm and empathy keeps you rooting for him and waiting to see what he does next. Harrison Ford, in spite of whatever problems he may have had with ""Blade Runner"" in the past, is on fire as Rick Deckard. Rick may be jaded and rugged, but he's still the same human character we knew from 1982.All of the key cast, from big stars to smaller characters and surprise cameos, are all a wonder to behold. Arguably the star of the show here is director Denis Villeneuve; who first earned massive recognition for his work on 2010's ""Incendies"", has continued to marvel me and gets me excited for ""Dune"" in 2020. He directs every scene with precision, energy and sheer passion.I could probably make a long, spoiler-filled essay describing why each scene of this makes it a work of art; but I'll leave it at this- In the year of 2017; there were many great films (""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", ""Coco""); and arguably 2049 stands among them as champions for why Hollywood continues to do good, whether or not these films made a billion dollars or not.

531,secrective,why would you give a robot slave an apartment and a girlfriend?,1,17 November 2017,"i'm reviewing this film on its own merits, not comparing to the first film at all.I do not get it. If you are building robots to do jobs that humans do not want to do, or like Wallace says, expanding civilization on the backs of slaves... why would you give them the ability to drink alcohol and have girlfriends? it makes about as much sense as a welding robot that drinks and lives in the suburbs and commutes to work. what ? i'm supposed to connect to a robot protagonist. but why ? K is a bad character. K kills off innocent robots who are not doing anything wrong except existing. K is the bad guy, doing bad guy work.explain to me how you can walk into a police department , kill the coroner, steal robot bones, leave, come back and kill the police captain, and get away with all of this? as Wallace's hench girl does.i was not impressed by the cinematography. instead of a real world it just feels like a few foggy sets. too many closeups of detective K.Hans zimmer just needs to stop. whoever is mixing films with his music turned to loud volumes while all of the characters whisper, it is getting annoying and tedious.riveting dialog. extremely quotable lines that one will remember for a generation. such as ""what is that smell?"" ""garlic, you want some"" ""no"". or ""where is he?"".acting i thought was passable. gosling was fine, robot girlfriend good, hench girl had a bit of bite, leto was cut again from the film and only had one scene? even ford does better in this film than his last decade of work, although probably because he only has a few minutes of screen time.plot / pacing? no plot to speak of. a detective is sent on a job, and an old man is reunited with his daughter. i felt like there was no urgency or tension at all. the blackout they constantly talk about sounded more interesting than this whole film. plot problems are possibly due to the filmmakers splitting up the film and putting clips out as marketing instead of part of the film???? pacing didn't bother me although i understand the frustration some people have with the lingering shots. there are a lot of lingering meandering shots.characters? none to speak of with no emotions at all. all characters are robots except deckard and the police captain and Wallace, who get about 20 minutes screen time combined. WALL-E had more emotion! and that was a kids film! the only emotional part of this film came when they played a clip from the 1982 blade runner. which made ford's character cry. if your only emotional scene is playing a clip from a previous film i think its time to quit.as a sequel its 0/10 for me. about as worthless as the ""happy ending"" ending to the first film. maybe it will be saved by editing later with a final cut? one can only hope. there are many unanswered questions in the film , the unanswered questions do not affect my rating. if they ever make a sequel to this, i hope they do not answer the questions because i'm afraid ridley Scott would just make up terrible answers as he did with Prometheus and alien covenant.one interesting thing this movie made me think about is if deckard is a replicant then i will stop liking blade runner 1982. because those scenes of him eating and drinking would annoy me to no end. robots do not need to eat food.",Blade Runner 2049

Interesting story but nothing that captures your attention beyond the fan service.This can be a good thing, as the original is also inundated with the same, in my opinion, flaws.This movie lacks balance between the ""art"" it's trying much too hard to be, and the rich and beautifully potential-filled world it's set in.Also... could have done without the ""comic book"" villains... less is more, more is annoyingly cheesy.This was like batman forever meets dune.

This movie is basically a ""I did my job, now let me rest"" type of movie. There were no real happy endings except for the end. Like officer k ( joe ) looses the only thing that matters to him. Due to protecting Rick. And that is his hologram girlfriend who is not real but is real to him. The movie ends with joe dying after successfully delivering Rick to his daughter. Over all loved this movie a whole lot and was very satisfied to get to watch it again. And enjoy it all over again",Blade Runner 2049
534,imdb2-5,"Great visuals, not so great movie",7,7 October 2017,"While you don't need to see the previous movie to be able to make it through this one, you will need someone involved to explain the big plot holes that exist so that the story can conclude the way it does. And that is really the biggest problem with this film - some characters acting very much out of the character from what you've been shown.In short, K is a replicant himself, who is of a model supposed to obey his master humans (this is not explained well) and as a police officer blade runner is supposed to hunt down and kill all the old models that could actually think for themselves. And when retiring one at the beginning of the film, K discovers something that leads him to believe some connection with the replicants he is retiring and the need to investigate.Is the film beautiful, yes. Does it feel dystopian... somewhat. Everything is too clean to actually be gritty. What the original got right was everything felt run down. This version felt like everything is depressed in a very visually beautiful way, which is a trademark of this film - gorgeous visuals. In that you can enjoy for 2.5 hours.The story plods along although it is not boring. I looked at my watch a few times, very surprised. Part of it was because they tried to fit in pieces of the original but it just didn't work. It happens a few times such as the forced ""skin jobs"" term, a denigrating way to say ""replicant"" but it's forced and there only for the audience. As if K's long time boss forgot he was in the room and it never happened before? But what really bothered me were the huge plot holes I will not reveal which existed solely to move on the story. The characters just didn't act the way you were shown at times. And this happens more than once, more critically a few times in the second half of the film. And they are done because there is no way the film can reach the next parts it needs without these huge departures in conduct that we are supposed to believe.Some characters could have been cut out of the movie entirely, including the silliness that is K's companion, whom you'll be introduced to early on. The explanation about how she exists is also preposterous, and which later turns out to be a key point in the film. Some of these notions, like a relationship with an artificial, robot life form were better explored elsewhere as is a very critical plot point in this film - the most critical of them all. And when it is revealed, you'll known what film I am talking about.In short, it is an interesting, overly long ride. It's very pleasing on the eyes but do not expect the masterpiece you're being led to believe. By the end of the film, you'll be wondering about Hollywood's inability to end anything and hoping to create yet another franchise. Wait for the director's cut if you must see this film, which is definitely not needed for those who appreciated the original for the statement it was.",Blade Runner 2049
535,paultreloar75,Early retirement for this one please,3,6 October 2017,"Well, let's get the obvious thing to say out of the way and say, ""It's not as good as the original"" (whichever version of the original you want to take that to refer to). Not even close.So taking it on it's on terms, is it any good? It's alright is about as far as I can go. It's starts off reasonably promisingly, with Ryan Gosling retiring a replicant on a dusty farm. So we've already left the claustrophobic confines of the smoggy city already and you'd hope that would give the director lots of avenues to explore and unpick. And initially the idea of Rachel and Deckart having produced a successor, along with Joe's virtual affair offer some brief optimism. In a slightly gloomy way.Ryan Gosling plays a good emotionless cyborg. The problem begins when he's supposed to show that he's also developing emotions, and even potentially, a soul. That's tricky and requires range. Of which he has not a lot. The music crashes as it tries to wash around you but it's all a bit bombastic and overblown. The photography is serviceable but doesn't come close to Ridley Scott's world as in the Final Cut, despite the 10 years have passed since that version. The attempts at homage just feel like cheap and shoddy imitations.Then the story starts getting preposterous, as Joe finds two crucial characters by some form of laser guided internal radar system or something. Certainly, he manages to locate Deckart simply by finding a horse and then wandering into the desert, something which the evil Corporation hadn't managed in 30 years of trying apparently. We get a stupid diversion into an orphanage that is supposed to be Dickensian but simply serves as a giant PLOT DEVICE!!! Then an even more ludicrous fight scene in so much water I feared Kevin Costner was going to turn up. The finale was toe curlingly cringey.About half way through, someone at the end of our row started snoring. This went on for about 20 minutes. I don't know how he managed to sleep cos this is about noise and bangs and crashes in general, no subtlety whatsoever. Oh and lots of punching and stabbing or strangling woman mainly. Joe gets stabbed and doesn't flinch cos he's hard. And when the virtual love of his life gets killed, he doesn't flinch, despite this seemingly having been built up into a key strand of the story before. There's some half-arsed ""come the revolution"" interlude that looks like a Duran Duran video. I'm starting to rant now aren't I. Did I tell you that Bladerunner was my favourite movie ever. This isn't....wake up, time to die.",Blade Runner 2049
536,guskeller,Everything a movie should be,10,1 November 2021,"Blade Runner 2049 is perfect. The ambition of a pop culture epic met with the detail of high art; this film has everything. The story is grand and philosophical, but captures significant emotion with a bittersweet hero arc. The characters are motivated. The setting is extravagant but extremely relevant. Meanwhile, the imagery is striking and packed with meaningful layers. Color, lighting, texture, and composition are all optimized to orchestrate a shower of visual artwork. Working in tandem with the masterful soundtrack, this produces a mesmerizing experience that teleports viewers to a brand new world.On that topic, the production design is genius and creates an atmosphere that is fantastically futuristic yet hyper-real. Decaying yet sleek, decrepit yet beautiful, modern yet primal. The world of Blade Runner 2049 seamlessly highlights its class divide. This is driven home by the array of visual effects. Modern CGI mixed with tangible miniatures pushes those united feelings of old and new. Lastly, the acting brings everything together. Ryan Gosling appears stoic at first, but his portrayal of deeply repressed emotions that suddenly explode is exactly needed. A dejected protagonist fit for his dejected world.

537,blownwideopen,Better than I expected,7,20 June 2018,"I have come not to expect much from any reboots or remakes or re-imaginings these days. It always seems to come down to a total lack of new ideas which results in horrible, lazy writing & terrible scripts. I see that a lot of reviewers here have bashed this movie for the above mentioned reasons. But, for me it came down to the visuals. One of the reasons the original Blade Runner was so astonishing was due to the stunning & ground breaking visuals. So, even though the overall story & feel of Blade Runner 2049 fell short, the visuals totally transported me back in time to the original vibe. A fine homage in my opinion!",Blade Runner 2049
538,i_ianchev,Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner,10,7 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is out and it might be even better than the old one...OK, so first of all I'd like to say that I very much like the 1982 first ""Blade Runner"" by Ridley Scott. But I don't think it's flawless. Actually it was a very good attempt at mixing film noir and sci-fi, maybe the best example to date. But it had actual blank spots in some characters and plot wise it was nearly, but not completely perfect.Having said this, I am really happy that a script like Blade Runner's got a sequel and I must say - a rather good sequel. In fact I am very happy that again Denis Villeneuve has proved himself an able director and a true visionary with an own voice and soul, beautifully presented on the silver screen.To be able to give you an idea of what a movie you should expect to see, when you go to ""Blade Runner 2049"", I will tell you that maybe you must not think of the original as the thought provoking film many people think it is. At least not in the way I see it. To me this title is really a mixture of a perfect example of genre movie. A detective story, a sci-fi story, a humanistic story, an internal cosmos story.Blade Runner was never about logical and consequential plot and it never feeds its themes to the viewers directly. But it is subtle. Subtle in its character development, it its relationships intricate details, in the way the story asks questions, but does not provide always answers. Story wise this new movie is minimalistic, and though it has its small problems in some side scenes and decisions seen in them, the film is a lesson in presentation and evolution of characters. I am personally touched by the way Villeneuve shows us the relationship between Joe and Joi. It is realistically unnatural how we humans can accept AI and its manifestations. And the human brain works on so many levels that it seems even we cannot absorb what is possible and not, what is real and what is not. These thin visual and mental lines are for me one of the life threads of this film. Actors playing (mainly Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford) do a stunningly good job. Almost all supporting actors and actresses fill this unreal world with life and rhythm. So overall I can say - the teams behind the script and the technological representation of ideas on the screen have done a magnificent job.What it means to be human. What makes us happy. What puts meaning into our hearts and minds. All these questions are asked anew. The difference is this time, I feel much more connected to ""K"", than I did before to Deckard. The lead character has a very hard path, but it is filled with wondrous happenings, which I believe come from very personal experiences behind the script. The connection between ""K"" and Joi, between Deckard and ""K"" are thought provoking and really a master class in cinema. I dare not say more about them, as I have to learn how these beautiful constructions work, so that I can dissect them and implement them in real life better. It is amazingly beautiful to witness such depictions of humanity in characters whose sole existence is so robotic and meaningless. I am truly astonished of the actors' play, of the emotions behind the gestures and words. Genius!So, I better get to the other astonishing part of this movie - the futuristic look and sound of this film. Again the creators Roger Deakins (cinematography), Hans Zimmer, Benjamin Wallfisch (music), David Doran, Bence Erdelyi, Lydia Fry (art direction) have done a perfect job. Also costumes, set decoration and makeup are on a very high level. One can feel the future when witnessing this movie. It is so real and ambient.So I really appreciate this gift from Villeneuve and recommend it to anyone with a taste for cyberpunk, thrills and sci-fi. But most of all, I wish that we all could learn more about how important it is to do our work with passion and everlasting hunger for individual creation and love for freedom in expression.

542,born_naughty,Emotionless,1,14 May 2018,"I never liked Blade Runner, I also never liked similar movies about the same subjects. Androids act emotionless, that's the point of the story. Can things that aren't born but manufactured have souls and emotions? There's plenty of movies out there that ask this question. But without physically showing emotion and without hearing any kind of intonation in the voice, I as a viewer don't feel anything either. And without emotion, what is the point of any story really?",Blade Runner 2049
543,Deathstryke,Beautifully bleak,8,16 October 2017,"Bladerunner 2049 is a faithful successor to the original in that it doesn't try to appease the 'fidget spinner' generation who need fast cuts and yappy dialogue to sustain their limited attention spans.Its languid, methodical pace allows the viewer to soak up every ounce of atmosphere in each gorgeously rendered frame, to feel totally immersed in the haunting bleakness of it all. As the camera rises through colossal cityscapes permeated with smog and glowing neon, as the synths ebb and surge like waves, there is a sense of desolation and ruin, a consumerist culture turned cancer that has driven humanity to a dark place figuratively and spiritually.The plot unravels slowly, with no great urgency, but it is nonetheless intriguing, as Bladerunner K's world is shaken by the discovery of a replicant's 'miracle birth' and his road to finding the child leads him to experience the emotions and value decisions which ultimately make us human. These existential themes are what Bladerunner has always been about, rather than explosive, pounding action sequences -though there are sporadic moments of action, it's not the emphasis. So if you go to this film and encounter people yawning, chances are they had the wrong expectations.Gosling and Ford are as watchable as always, but the female characters are particularly engaging. Robin Wright oozes authority as the tough as nails Lieutenant Joshi. Ana de Armas has a difficult task in trying to make her character, Joi (K's perfect hologram girlfriend) feel sympathetic, but the innocent exuberance she displays as she tries to navigate the boundaries of her own virtual existence in her relationship with K is affecting. The main antagonist, Luv, played with ice-cold menace by Sylvia Hoeks, is a real standout. Perhaps the first female villain I've watched who doesn't come off as titular, she is a very threatening presence throughout the film. The only strike for me was Jared Leto's performance as the evil Niander, who's lofty haiku dialogue and John Malkovich style cadence felt overplayed and camp.I think fans of the original Bladerunner will enjoy this sequel and even if you are not that engaged with the minutia of the story, there is much to enjoy on a scene by scene basis. For me I was totally lost in the mood and even at 160 minutes, it didn't feel wasted. Of course there are those who will dismiss it as too slow and boring; With the way movies are edited today, it's not surprising, but it is a shame. Bladerunner 2049 is art.",Blade Runner 2049
544,regula1,What A Sequel Should Be,8,5 October 2017,"If you take a look at the best sequels out there, you'll find that they don't spend an inordinate amount of time retreading old ground at the expense of the story. Rather, a good sequel builds off of the previous film and, if done correctly, not only reinforces the previous film's themes and message, but adds upon them in a meaningful way.Blade Runner 2049 does this correctly, and you don't even have to have seen the original to enjoy this film.Set thirty years after the events of the original film, Blade Runner 2049 focuses on Agent K (Ryan Gosling), a replicant blade runner tasked with hunting down old models that aren't programmed like he is, namely to obey.He stumbles upon a mystery that threatens to unravel the status quo between humans and replicants for good, and through much detective work, he finds himself in the company of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man living alone with the demons of his past.What the original film did was brilliant in that it explored the human condition without preaching the right answer to our faces, rather it let us ponder the questions it posed so we could come to the conclusions ourselves.This film also poses important questions about humanity, about what qualifies as true feeling, and what the basis for a soul is, but also explores the prospects of science and human ambition, and what happens if it is left unchecked.These themes are explored beautifully by characters on opposite sides of the spectrum, from Jared Leto as Wallace, the man who picks up the mantle of the Tyrell Corporation, to Ana de Ames as Joi, a holographic woman who is K's companion and who longs to be more than an incorporeal image.It cannot be denied that this film is a visual masterpiece, every bit on par with Ridley Scott's original.What faults there are lie with the length of the film (2 hours 43 minutes, and it feels it, especially towards the end) and with the music. While powerful and evocative of the original soundtrack, for every time it conveys an emotional gut punch, there's another time where it's really only there to be a loud noise, and it can get annoying at times. A little more restraint on the horns would have been appreciated.Nevertheless, this film has everything a film buff would want, and even if that's not you, it's definitely worth a watch as an intellectual think-piece to discuss over dinner with friends.",Blade Runner 2049
545,RockyMtnVideo,"SciFi as Art. Possibly, a generation-specific film?",10,2 September 2020,"It's a faster moving world these days, and some viewers seem not to be satisfied without a continuous feed of gratuitous action. Films that take their time in delivering their story, seem to not be capable of feeding the adrenaline needs those viewers. Some viewers complained that this film was too long, and ""could have been"" tighter. If you are someone who wants the plot points ""quickly ticked off"", scene after scene, so you can get to the final outcome, then this film is probably not going to satisfy you. I should also say that if you didn't find Blade Runner compelling, then this sequel is probably going to be a non-starter.As background, I saw Blade Runner when it first opened. It was stunning, both in its beauty, and, albeit dystopian, its view of the future. Everything about it was captivating, and when I left the theatre, I had a feeling similar to the one I had when I walked out of Star Wars, roughly five years earlier. I knew that I had seen something that would still be special, decades later, and I ""wanted more"" from that same universe. I obviously didn't expect that, in the case of Blade Runner, it would be a 35 year wait for that to happen.The spoiler-free version of this story, assuming you are familiar with Blade Runner, is that (per the title) this takes place 30 years after the original. The original film ended (depending on which ""film cut"" you saw) with Deckard and Rachael attempting to run away to ""somewhere"" that they hoped to be safe. We see nothing of those intervening years (acted out) in the sequel, but instead, find ourselves in the middle of what starts out as a police activity, but, purely through a chance discovery, quickly is recognized as something that has ties to the final moments of the original film. Suffice it to say that several different factions (at least three) quickly become interested in the implications that result from that police investigation, and the rest of the film plays out with its main character, pretty much caught in the middle of those factions. The film does, sometimes directly, and sometime indirectly, provide some closure to the fate of characters from the original film.So, what is good (in my humble opinion) about this this film (and why I never get bored re-watching it)? Denis took his time ""painting"" this story. He didn't just rush through the new film's plot points, in an effort to ""tick them off"", in order to squeeze them into another, standard, box office ""two-hour"" movie. The original film was as much about ""look and feel"" as it was story. If you were sitting in a theater (or a dark room at home), you ""soaked in"" Blade Runner, just as much as you watched it. My ""impression"" is that Denis recognized that he needed to create that same feeling in the sequel, and that there were points in the film where he could have simply ""jump-cut"" to the next scene (i.e. the ""next destination"" for that character). Doing so would have saved a truck-load of money in VFX, but instead, Denis choose to paint a tapestry of the same (albeit 30 years newer) dystopian world, and allow the viewer to ""simmer"" in that dystopian soup, as the ""character at that moment in the film"" made his/her way to their next destination. As with the original movie, there are many visuals of this world, both from the ground, and from the air, where you are given the time to absorb its unique appearance. Some are fantastically futurist, and others depict the dystopian mess that exists ""just outside of"" the ""better places"" to live. In short, it attempts to continually be every bit as visually compelling as the original, so that you always feel more like you are in those places, instead of simply viewing them. And lastly, the film score, albeit a new score, attempts to adhere to a similar ""electronic"" feel as the original, which, from the very beginning, also serves to evoke the feeling that this is one continuous story. (Not unlike how John Williams' Star Wars scores instantly tie those films together, even before you see the first scene.)Again, to avoid spoilers, it is hard to say much more. As stated earlier, if you wanted more of the Blade Runner ""universe"", then I would be surprised if you did not really enjoy this sequel. If all of the special effects movies of the last two decades have put you in a place where a viewing of Blade Runner left you wondering ""what was all the fuss about"", and/or, if you just don't care what happened after that original movie ended, then you might as well spend your time viewing some other film.",Blade Runner 2049

547,popcolin,What did I just watch...5 times now?,3,18 October 2019,"I've slept through (watched) this movie 5 times now and I would have a very hard time explaining any of this movie to someone. Not because this movie is so mind-bendingly awesome but because nothing ends up happening in the whole movie. Each time I watch it I think ""this is going to be great"" and as each scene comes and goes I always end up thinking, ""oh I remember that!"" but that is it. Nothing sticks to my brain at all.Nothing but beautiful images and a soundtrack that as another reviewer said ""is just loud noises"" and I'd have to agree. Not that I don't love the soundtrack but what the heck?! We are suppose to have a guide through this movie, any competent director would tell you that, but this just ends up getting lost in itself. It's like if you have a puppy lying on the middle of a bed and you throw your softest most beautiful and comfortable but heaviest blanket on top of the puppy. It ends up taking the puppy 2 hours and 40 minutes to come out and he is just confused. This blanket is the movie and we are the puppy. I hate to say it but not very fun.That's all I got. Watch at your own risk but I think the director ended up saying something to the effect of ""we failed making this movie because it does not entertain people enough to take them out of the real world. We made the most expensive art house movie ever."" Apparently they had a 4 hour cut at one point and the studio was toying with the idea to turn it into 2 movies.

550,targe1314,A visually stunning Masterpiece with an intricate but interesting plot,10,10 October 2017,"Los Angeles, 2049.The human experiment has flourished in space.9 new colony worlds now exist in the sky. This was achieved with the use of manufactured slave labor, Replicants.On earth, the experiment has failed. Earth has been largely abandoned to the rats and the rainstorms, as global warming is pushing the planet rapidly towards the next Ice Age. The seawalls barely hold back rising sea levels... people grovel in the muck for grubs to eat.Across this barren landscape flies K, a new series replicant assassin, hunting down humanity's mistakes, the bad dog replicants that broke their programming.Do Robots dream Electric Sleep?Do Canadians attend movies on Thanksgiving Weekend?The answers it appears, are Yes and No.Being a huge fan of the original, the theatre was largely empty on opening night, mostly filled with people my age, watching faithfully for another taste of the original's dark noir, flying cop cars and giant neon backwashed with torrential rain...You cannot compare this to the original. For although it faithfully picks up the threads of Deckard(Ford)'s old fling, this is a deep and well written detective story, not the action-packed retirement bloodbath that marked the original.The music, straying between Tibetan chant and Apocalypse Now synth, is deep, loud, and foreboding, matching the bleak and over-built LA city scape to a tee.The visuals, from the titanic last ditch wall built to stop the rising sea levels to the endless solar panel farms, is jaw dropping.Ryan Gosling is at the top of his game here, throwing everything into the role as the at first blankly confident uber assassin K, while still revealing a tender side in his 1950's housewife 3D hologram girlfriend. As his latest case develops, we see his mind conflict and break down. This could be his finest work and he should Oscar up for it.Harrison Ford brings his legendary gravitas in full force to the role of the fugitive Deckard, hiding in his luxury Vegas penthouse, drinking scotch and staring out at the dust storms. Ford leaves nothing in reserve as he launches his heart back into this character that helped to make him famous. His haunted scream 'WE WERE BEING HUNTED!' sends shivers down the spine...Supporting cast are also for the most part in excellent form, with Robin Wright playing K's stern but secretly in love Madame commander, doing anything to keep the lethal secret that 'will break the world' from getting out, protecting her agent to the last.Ana de Armas puts in a surprisingly heartfelt and believable performance as the 'pinnoccio-like' 3D hologram girlfriend, desperately trying to have a real relationship, knowing all too well there is no hope.Jared Leto brings a solid performance as the mad scientist maker of the new replicants, with some apologies to the blind community perhaps.Perhaps the only slight let down is our main villain. Unfortunately she must go up against the likes of Rutger Hauer from the original, no small boots to fill. Sylvia Hoeks plays the over-passionate killing machine Luv, a replicant assassin slash secretary in heels on steroids well, but there is something too souless in her act, something missing. No rousing speech about attack ships burning at the end for her, just a slow, cruel, difficult to watch drowning.After watching in Ultra AVX 3D I immediately purchased new tickets for IMAX, and it was worth the extra. This is a movie that really MUST be seen in IMAX. How else to enjoy a 100 foot tall virtual naked blue woman advertising the popular JOi hologram girlfriend? Or the expanse of the sea wall, or the scale of the garbage dump?",Blade Runner 2049
551,yellowtail_tuna,As amazing imagination for the future as the original film,10,1 August 2020,"""Blader Runner"" shook the world in 1982 with the amazing futuristic images, including the streets in blue light, pouring acid rain, vivid neon ads on the towering buildings, and vehicles flying among them. ""2049"" is no doubt qualified as the sequel, because it has done the same thing for the audience of 2017.I was very overwhelmed by the creators' imagination all along with the film. Designs of devices, interiors, and landscapes are excellent. Wallace Corporation seems as if a very modern library and an ancient ruin at the same time. A newborn replicant drops out of a plastic bag just like a packaged food. The memory artist Ana creates a birthday party scene just like a game creator placing some NPCs.The best thing among them is Joi, the pretty hologram AI girl. I find it interesting that a home devise advances to a mobile version, and Joi herself is very happy with that. I believe she has a sincere love for K, and it's sad to see her image break down with noise when disturbed by some failure.The plot has a clear center: the unprecedented replicant child who was born from a mother 30 years ago. Joshi, Luv, and K, each seeks the child with slightly different reasons. It becomes further exciting when some clues suggest K himself is the child. We see then the mystery lead to the aftermath of the original film, the love of Decard and Racheal (So it is recommended to watch the original film first).Like the original, the light, color, and misty effect work well. Basic colors are blue and orange, the former is mysterious and thoughtful while the latter makes you feel as if you are getting close to the end of the world.As the only flaw, the tempo is unnecessarily slow. But the other good things easily offset it.",Blade Runner 2049

553,darioilg,"A rich, contemplative, but ultimately lesser sequel to ""Blade Runner""",9,7 November 2017,"I am a fan of the original ""Blade Runner"": its groundbreaking work on visual sci-fi is an incredible achievement, even though it's a tad overestimated on its conceptual aspects. On the contrary, ""2049"" lacks a true stylistic coherence but it's much richer in ideas and its interesting (although slow to the excess) pace in the first half is then replaced with too much standard blockbuster action in the second. ""2049"" can hardly be considered a true sequel to the original, as it brings out a world of its own: a very different -if extremely beautiful- cinematography, that ultimately hides, behind the constant layers of smog and fog, an inferior attention to stylistic details. The amazing world where Deckard moves is only hinted at with a couple of great shots, but there's lack of the subtle pop culture elements that make the original a work of genius. The same could be said for the music score: while Vangelis's electronic compositions were spot on to channel the mood of futuristic Los Angeles, Zimmer's is a more generic series of sounds without melody that increase the sense of unease very well, but without the same personality. Gosling, coming from the success of ""La La Land"" is a great lead and the cast as a whole is filled with superstars and unexpected returns, more or less welcome; Villeneuve has always worked in the realm of the cryptic and profound, and with ""2049"" he does it again, simply not matching the original's uniquely personal style. 8/10",Blade Runner 2049
554,iamjacksmoviechannel,A replicant of the first one,6,6 October 2017,"It's been hard not to think of how this one was going to go if you were a film fan this week. Yeah, I know the reviews have been glowing and it's based on something that is so visually iconic. But it's also so perfectly imperfect. Yes, the 35 year old film has that China Town setting and the Deckard apartment is such an architectural marvel and the film at it's core speaks to the cruelty of giving a consciousness to something that will never be seen as having anything to do with humanity. Just there is something to that uttered expression most people give after seeing it for the first time, which is ""that was slow"". And it does lack urgency, the performances, even from human characters, seem robotic, and while there is stuff for the brain and the eye to take in, the heart just seems missing.In fact while there are many similarities visually and story-wise to A.I., I would say A.I. just grabs me more because it just hits you right here (heart). And you've probably heard this before but i'll say it again- if you loved the first then you'll love this. If you didn't like it, well the nearly 3 hour run time here won't help. Why? Because it's basically the same movie. Ryan Gosling is now the Blade Runner, basically a cop charged with taking down older version androids in future Los Angeles. In 2049, there are all types of different tech including holograms, new slave androids, and apparently even one android who managed to get herself pregnant. That later thing is what starts the Gosling character off on a mission to find Harrison Ford's old Blade Runner Rick Deckard. His travels take us through dreary off world territory used for farms, trash dumps, and child labor camps. The visual artistry here can't be denied, from the neon signs adorning most of Los Angeles, the vast orange and blue colored wastelands surrounding it, or just how cold the city has become, cinematographer Roger Deakins has never made L.A. look more un-inviting. Just as we go on this investigation it becomes pretty clear that a Blade Runner sequel, while not exactly boring, is not exactly necessary and also that director Denis Villeneuve was given way too much leeway as far as the run-time is concerned. And i'm not just saying this because it feels like it takes forever for it to finally have some urgency, it's also following a lot of similar stuff from the first movie. A main character with a mystery surrounding what exactly he is, another character who has some type of disease that leaves them isolated and creating a life of her own through technology, thematically we're still asking the same question of what is real, what feels real, and why giving consciousness to anything only to take away free will is a dick move. In this approach I mean i guess you could say the cast does OK, although I thought everybody from Gosling, Ford, and Jared Leto playing the barely seen head of the new company creating replicants, were all a bit one note. So I mean this is a tough one for me to score since I like the first one well enough but at the end of the day I just don't feel there was enough new here to really warrant a recommendation. So I go 6 out of 10. If you guys liked this, check out Craig James Capsule Reviews on Youtube for more.",Blade Runner 2049

It is a suiting follow-up to Blade Runner (1982), and stands as a fantastic cinematic experience in its own right.The performances were 10/10. Everyone delivered. Ryan Gosling really found his stride in K, the main character. His silent portrayal captures so much. Harrison Ford delivers as always. Jared Leto is someone I'm normally annoyed by, but I had no problems with him in this film. The actresses for Joi and Ana were standouts as both of them carried their parts with authenticity and strength. Robin Wright was great as the powerful chief over K.The writing was fantastic. It explores what it means to be human and never lets us out of this universe. We're always entranced by the characters and by the well-told story.The direction is on point. Not only is there meaning and poetry to every scene, but we're mesmerized by the universe Denis Villenuve has expanded on. We feel exactly as we're supposed to at every moment and are never bored.

The new one connected very nicely to the old one. The world got expanded and became more complex. Questions of humanity, creation and responsibility were explored as well as experience and life itself.
All in very nice pictures and storytelling.It also made me appreciate the original movie a lot more, which felt a bit convoluted and did not explain too much when i first watched it.While there are still plenty of open questions with the 2nd one... i think it was a good thing to leave them open, leaving the worlds open for more.Acting was superb, storytelling, visuals and audio was amazing.

Ultimately it all just feels a bit hollow.I think this would have worked entirely more successfully if the story had simply been about Ryan Gosling pursuing an unrelated case. The opening sequence and fight is fantastic and Gosling was great but as soon as Harrison Ford arrived, all the promise of this film dies for me and leaning into weird religious writing where Deckard and Rachael have had a miracle child doesn't do justice to those characters or the original film.I've also got to mention Jared Leto who inserts such interminably long pauses between every word he says that he very quickly becomes beyond irritating and probably accounts for most of the bloated runtime. Apparently Gary Oldman was considered for Leto's role and I think he would of been far more convincing as the 'creator' characterWhat we get here looks like Blade Runner and sounds like Blade Runner but it's just a recreation, mimicking all the elements but somehow falling short, just like the recreation of Rachael in the story.

Not much to dislike here.As sequels go, it's hard to find ones that are that much better than the original, especially when the original was already declared a classic....this is one of them.The weak spots are few. I only saw it once, and I'd have to study it a second time to find the flaws more accurately. Overall it's extremely well done. I wasn't really taken with Jared Leto's character-----an actor whose skill I greatly admire----but for some reason he just didn't win me over in this role, and I think it was the character as written, not Leto. Again, if I watched this another time I might find my opinion changed on this. Maybe it was because I just didn't like what that character represented....and it had nothing to do with Leto's take on it at all. There is not enough backstory on his character to give us a full sense of what he is...how he came to be. We're left in the dark with Niander Wallace.That they incorporated many elements of the original, and updated them amazingly, allows viewers who have seen the original a feeling of familiarity...even though the ambiance had altered so much---akin to seeing an old friend years later and under very different circumstances but wearing the same shirt as last time you'd seen them.The mood, tone, of this movie is quite dark: sunlight has been in this dystopic future time replaced by interior lighting and most of the time it is either dark or getting darker outside. Lots of rain, even snow keep the atmosphere unsettled. The murkiness sets the stage for the constant emotional /and/ knowledge uncertainty that haunts Ryan Gosling's lead role. He's seeking answers, but he only gradually comes to understanding what it is he has been seeking. There's a good bit of metaphor in this: Gosling's character could well be explained as everyman searching for his meaning in creation, his purpose in being. He could as well be said to be in a constant struggle to find himself....yet finding himself doesn't necessarily provide the awareness he was hoping to discover. In the original Bladerunner there were a couple of touches that really got me-- --like the scene where Deckard takes the snake to a dealer who scans it with a high-powered microscope and sees a serial number----making what appears to be a real reptile a manmade one. That blew me away. In this sequel we are already past that science...now taken for granted. Still, there is an analogous scene in BR2049, and it's incorporated well into the plot. Speaking of plot: I never give away spoilers in movies, figuring I wouldn't want someone to tell me if I hadn't yet seen the movie....but I can say the plot is well conceived, has continuity--and continuity with the original, and has just enough twist to keep the audience guessing. Good script, overall.Like a well-prepared and cooked meal, the movie should satisfy most sci-fi fans. I left the theater a bit awed by it. Happy. A good movie, like a good book, leaves one feeling better for having seen it. I did.Someone told me the original cut had been almost 4 hrs long. I would gladly have sat through the 4 hour version. I didn't want it to end.",Blade Runner 2049
565,Serge_Zehnder,The Truth in the Rain,8,4 October 2017,"To chase after an iconic masterpiece, to imitate or to try and supplant its rightful place, is a fool's errand.Thankfully director Denis Villeneuve along with his talented collaborators never succumbs to imitating or trying to super-cede Ridley Scott's 1982 landmark ""Blade Runner"". Hampton Fancher, who created the story of the original, has crafted a new screenplay with Michael Green, that not only builds on the themes of ""Blade Runner"", but ties them together with larger questions about the current human state and its challenges.Ryan Gosling stars as a replicant of the latest generation, who tries to solve a puzzle that leads him into the realm of real and manufactured life, and walks along the same noirish paths that made the original so gripping. Gosling imbues his character with a very compelling façade, which starts to crumble as his humanity takes over his mechanical design.The equally thrilling performances by Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, Robin Wright, Carla Juri and of course Mr. Harrison Ford, forge a credible bond with the audience and enhance the visual grandeur created by cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner.And although ""Blade Runner 2049"" may not achieve the same level of force as its predecessor, it is a tremendously immersive, philosophical and touching experience, that should be enjoyed on the largest screen possible. The movie's pace is deliberately patient, which may confuse some members of the audience. But by slowing down and observing, the audience can revel in the immensity of the images.The more we move, inexorably it seems, towards the do-or-die reality of ""Blade Runner"", the more vital these stories become.Whatever the box-office-fate of ""Blade Runner 2049"" will be, the long wait has paid off. It is far more than just a quick cash-in on a cult classic or an overly devoted sequel. It stands on its own and adds many new layers to the question: ""What makes us human?"" And it urges us on to find the truth in the rain.",Blade Runner 2049

567,benedictmichael-03235,Instant Classic,10,16 October 2021,"I watched the film alone sitting in a very comfortable airplane seat, in the middle of an empty 200+ seater cinema with an excellent sound system and a massive screen, so I wasn't distracted by folks leaving or falling asleep around me as some allegedly experience.As evidenced by the mixed reviews here, the film has many qualities one can rave or rant about. The makers of this movie were gifted an interesting story and intriguing cityscape. As one would expect, the design and sound design are exceptional, as are the performances, though Robin Wright's diction doesn't gibe with a solecism like, ""You done good..."", or a colloquialism like ""Attaboy..."" In my view, Ryan Gosling is especially good, as is Sylvia Hoeks.The premise of the story - that Rachael had the apparatus to conceive and give birth - comes far out of leftfield. The weakest points: the make believe that slavery is some sort of aberration in human affairs; and that we ought to aspire to be present at some sort of Zion-like rave with variously tattooed and pierced Social Justice Warriors (cinemas need receptacles for vomit like aircraft).Overall, it is as wonderful as the original. The cityscapes are pretty special, and it has an enchanting atmosphere. A classic.",Blade Runner 2049
568,AxProductions,"The technically best film ever made, full stop",8,4 June 2021,"This film was a visual masterpiece, with just straight up the best cinematography of any film ever, name your favourite film - this one will beat it in terms of technical look, Roger Deakins is the best he's ever been on this film, and there is not a single frame in this movie that you can't pause and use as a wallpaper. The smooth movement, and incredible blocking creates a pace that cannot be matched by anything.The cgi is also just on another level, it's obvious that there is a lot of cgi in this film, but some parts you won't even notice until you watch the behind the scenes, it's just on another level.Acting was also something that surprised me, it's incredibly good, and the almost lack of emotion throughout the film creates a strange sense of tension. However, you can still feel level of humanity from all of the characters.This film is however let down on the story, and if it didn't have the best cinematography of any film ever, and some of the best editing, cgi ext. You know where I'm going. It wouldn't be as good as it is, as to be honest, I didn't even remember the story before I re-watched it. It's narrative could have been told in a much shorter time as well, and there isn't enough exposition to create a true connection with the story. Character development is really good though. The relationship between a human and an AI being the only part of the story that I remembered before I re-watched it, it's such a touching story, and the only reason the story hit slightly. The use of cgi in those moments is also just brilliant, I don't even know how to explain it, it was just insane on a technical level, as I keep saying.Overall this is an incredible film, and if you have any interest in the following - Editing, cgi, cinematography, set design and sound design, the only film with better sound design is Fist man, but this comes a close second, and everything else Blade runner is best in class in.Excluding story.Cinematography: 10/10

571,PhilipGHarris,Visual Style Covers Poor Plotting,6,8 October 2017,"Let me start out by saying that the look and feel of Blade Runner 2049, from direction, lighting, visual, sound and atmosphere is completely stunning. With shot after lingering shot adding to the style and substance of the movie. Meaning the overall length of the piece can be somewhat forgiven. Yet, sitting in the cinema, it did simply feel a little too long.The real problem I found with this movie were the vast plot holes which ran through the whole story, and these certainly impacted on my enjoyment of the film. As acting was good and characters were well defined.What we have is K - a Blade Runner and replicant who is working on cleaning up the remaining Nexus 8 models and, during investigation coming across a buried crate, containing the remains of a replicant who had become pregnant. A 'miracle' for the other replicants. Blurring the line between replicant and human and establishing a better reason they have rights.Why the replicants have buried the bones in such an obvious place, is never really addressed. Why they did not destroy the bones to make sure they were never discovered, is another problem. However, on finding these K is sent to track down the child and slowly comes to believe this may be him. Due to his memories and taking about 40 minutes of exposition.Whilst this journey is interesting it actually causes a flat spot in the middle of the film where, as a viewer, I wondered what next. As the story struggles to develop on from here. Apart from the impacts of his discovery making him what he hunts - a rogue.For some reason, his police chief then gives him time to go and settle down after this and the dialogue is mixed concerning whether he is being hunted or can return to duty. Her actions only explained by the fact he has been a good officer. The hunted K going back to his apartment to engage in sex with a meld of a replicant prostitute and his house hologram, which feels quite like filler but is meant us to feel more for the hologram, I suppose. As she risks her own 'life' to travel with him later.K finds he isn't the child causing him to hunt down the true child and father, Deckard from the original, and then Deckard is kidnapped by the new controlling company - who clearly want to see if they can isolate how the pregnancy happened. Which pretty clearly makes Deckard a replicant as well - a fact which was left to the viewers' imaginations in the previous film. This is all well and good, I can hear you say, where are the problems. The fact is it's the linking moments that really caused the downfall of the plot for me. The fact K's boss is killed in her office - is there really no surveillance? The fact you'd expect the child to be told to never mention its past, yet it is creating actually moments from its past in other replicants memories - a really clear breadcrumb trail. The fact that K isn't killed on numerous occasions and just 'left-for-dead'. The fact replicants can't breathe underwater - but were built to work in extreme environments. The vaguely described organisations and their intentions and the fact his boss in the police can still track him on her computers - so why haven't all the other Blade Runners found him? Notwithstanding the bees, who obviously eat sand.What this results in is a story that feels half-baked, Jared Leto comes across like a bad Bond villain at the end and some scenes seem unnecessary. While some may think I'm over-thinking this the director gives you time to think about every scene with the lavish interludes. So to best enjoy this movie switch your brain to neutral and turn your senses to the max.",Blade Runner 2049

Stop throwing money at something great and hope you can vicariously join its greatness because someone said you were allowed to. Why the hell do corporations want to product place in a dystopian future where people are nasty and all nature has died?If it was a stand-alone movie I'd give this film a 6 out of 10. Because it's just stealing from the original and is devoid of real creativity, I give it a 4. I mean it's not terrible, but it's just pointless. The story, music, acting, casting and direction are all just slightly inferior. The only thing better is the visual effects, but as good as they are they just didn't match up to the original is style well at all especially outdoors.

573,dennis_chiu1,A rare sequel that is better than the original (no spoiler of the main plot),9,9 October 2017,"Film Review: ""Blade Runner 2049"" jogs through a jaw-dropping urban dystopia with well-drawn characters and a solid mystery with satisfying results. This film was directed by Denis Villeneuve (Oscar nominated Best Director of last year's ""Arrival"") and his steady hand in high concept sci-fi is clearly evident in each frame.The film begins with blade runner ""K"", played by Ryan Gosling (""La La Land""; ""The Big Short""; ""The Notebook""), tracking down fugitive replicant Sapper Morton, played by Dave Bautista (""Guardians of the Galaxy""). Morton is an old Nexus-6 replicant, a biologically engineered slave, indistinguishable from humans, with superior strength and agility, who were outlawed after a slave revolt. This initial case leads to information that triggers a larger investigation which is the plot of the movie that I won't spoil.Mr. Gosling gives an astonishing performance that is a wonder of contradictory elements. He gives K an unemotional, quiet, yet dynamic character that is captivating on screen. The other performance of note is a supporting one from Harrison Ford (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""; ""The Fugitive""; ""Patriot Games""), reprising his role as blade runner Rick Decker. With limited screen time, Mr. Ford crackles in every scene. There is still no one that captures an honest, dark, visceral, and physical character like him. The scenes with Mr. Gosling and Mr. Ford together are remarkable, since both play characters that speak more with their silences then when they are actually talking.The concept art, art direction, visual effects, matte painting, production design, and cinematography for ""Blade Runner 2049"" will likely be the best I see in theaters this year. While taking inspiration from the dirty, neon, junkyard look of the original, the creative team on this film imagine a new awe-inspiring and expansive world for the plot to play out.At 2 hours and 44 minutes, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a commitment to see, but I do recommend that you take the time to see it, if you see the original first. I say this because, while this film stands on its own visually and in its performances, the background from the original is necessary to fully comprehend the gravity of the plot and the world in which the film is set.I saw ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" the evening before, and it helped me a great deal with the nuances in the sequel. (The original movie has been re-cut 6 times, most without director Ridley Scott's permission. The original theatrical release was considered by Mr. Scott to be a betrayal by studio executives. The TV and International versions were not Mr. Scott's choice as well. The so- called ""Directors Cut"" was done by film preservationist Michael Arick and not cut by Mr. Scott. But, the ""Final Cut"" (2007) was personally assembled by Ridley Scott with revamped special effects and the original annoying electronic score by Greek composer Vengelis.)I should come clean that I was not a big fan of the original ""Blade Runner"". I felt it's loose, dreamlike, contemplative, plot-lite exploration into the world of blade runners and replicants was unsatisfying. However, with the coming of ""Blade Runner 2049"", I now feel that both movies together deliver on Blade Runner's ultimate promise of intelligent sci-fi storytelling.",Blade Runner 2049
574,cmcastl,"Profoundly disappointed, a missed opportunity",3,11 August 2019,"Very, very, very few sequels are as good as the originals. The scriptwriter William Goldmann may have written that in Hollywood 'nobody knows anything' but there is at least this one iron law, from which everyone should learn.Frin'stance, where sci-fi films are concerned, the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey was 2010 and it was a feeble sequel to the original, even though it featured the original script-writer Arthur C. Clarke. Its director Peter Hyams simply wasn't up to the job. The genius of the original was due to the collaboration of Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick.Neither has director Denis Villeneuve proved, in my view, up to the challenge of Blade Runner: 2049. And yet once again, one of the original screenwriters collaborated on this film, too; Hampton Fancher.I fear that great films may simply be unrepeatable in their greatness. The Godfather Part II was the exception which proves the rule.Ridley Scott, director of the original, cannot by himself guarantee a great film. He needs great collaborators to match his genius for visualisation but in the original he had them.In the words of British director Michael Powell, with a film all you can do is built a nest and hope a magic bird makes a nest in it. This is what the original Blade Runner did. This is what the sequel simply does not do.K... to specifics. There is at the end of the original film an open ending, an ending of hope, through all the rainy, futuristic darkness which was gone before. This sequel is just shot through with Gallic pessimism, without even any redeeming Gallic wit. If you like Gallic pessimism in your films, so be it. But I don't see why 2049 had to be a Gallic film. I personally wanted it to be a Hollywood one. And it was so plodding. Ridley Scott said the sequel was too long by an hour but it wouldn't have been plodding had it been engaging. Gallic films are not known for their warmth and human engagement. (K... Denis Villeneuve may be French Canadian but that counts as French in my view.)The visuals are gorgeous but Denis Villeneuve wasn't responsible for those. With modern special effect, they would have been glorious whoever had directed it.Also, none of the major actors in this film had the charisma of the originals, Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young. Yes, Harrison Ford does make a guest appearance in the sequel but that is all it is.Ryan Gosling is a decent enough actor but he is inferior to Harrison Ford's brooding, dignified and manly presence in the original. Harrison Ford, who was in his prime, carried the original in the same way that Hamlet carries, well, Hamlet. Ryan Gosling cannot carry the sequel. None of the female leads equal the glorious beauty and tragic femininity of Sean Young. There is no successor in the sequel to Rutger Hauer, God rest his soul, but then how could there be?Jared Leto makes a serviceable corporate villain as Niander Wallace but is still outclassed by Joe Turkell as the cerebral and amoral but not so brutal Eldon Tyrell of the original.I am not saying that Denis Villeneuve is a bad director but just that he wasn't right for this film. (And I liked a lot Peter Hyam's Capricorn One). Nor that Ryan Gosling is not a good actor but he was not right for this film.I go back to the words of Michael Powell. 'All one can hope for is to build and nest a hope that a magic bird will fly to it and makes it nest.' The original Blade Runner is a nest which a magical bird made its own. In my opinion, this cannot be said for 2049.However, Ridley Scott speaks of the possibility of a tre-quel. I would still like to see that!",Blade Runner 2049

'GO AND SEE IT BLADE RUNNER fans!!!'This movie captures the look and feel of that gritty possible future to absolute perfection. It literally looks like a seamless extension to the original classic. Best of all with no holds barred they have made the movie extra long to avoid unnecessary cuts. My partner exclaimed that she was amazed it actually went for the length it did because it didn't feel like it. We both still wanted more.What set's Blade Runner apart from other films is the way in which you feel like your viewing a day in the life of this person. You relate to there emotions and understand why the characters are the way they are. While it's possibly not a movie for people who need an explosion every 5 minutes, this film is for those with minds that enjoy thought provoking films besides which there's certainly plenty of action.Like the original the story is told by the interaction and actions of the characters and you want to see where the adventure, into this strange world takes you.A sensible use of real life props and people has made this movie fit perfectly with the original and I honestly couldn't fault it. Everything makes sense and fits with the Blade Runner legacy.The most important aspect of Blade Runner for me has always been it's overall story which is: 'here's what's going to happen to the world if we don't act now to change the way we let greedy corporations run our lives.'Some of the scenes shocked me just as the original did when I first saw it and present the question: 'Is this really what we want for the future?' Compared to how people treat one another and the sad slavery that goes on, the replicants do seem to present themselves as more human than the actual humans and you can understand there desire to be better and want the same freedoms and liberties afforded real humans because by and large they actually seem to deserve those rights more than the real people. (Possibly a nice topic for debate that one.)On the other side of the coin, there are of course the psychotic replicants but then they exist as real humans as well.To conclude a stunning thought provoking sequel that answers a lot of questions but once again throws a couple of ultimate unspoken questions. 1. Is this what we really want our future to look like if we are not more careful to put measures into place to prevent this? Can it be prevented? 2. When does a machine stop being a machine. When does the grey line become a white line?GO AND SEE IT. Denis Villeneuve should receive an academy award for his directing. It's also the best Ridley Scott production in a long time, far better than the recent Alien movies that's for sure and I'd certainly love to see a possible third film to give the Blade Runner universe a trilogy. (The finale could really cause some major stirs and add even more thought provoking questions and incites into this scarily possible future world.)PS. I watched the movie at the cinema in 3D. It was worth it as I get a buzz from 3D and felt even more drawn into the scary but amazing world of Blade Runner. That said the 2D will not disappoint and I've had several friends comment they absolutely loved it also. PPS. Check out the reviews and ratings for this film. They are not lying.

The first movie surpasses this one by a mile in about every department. The problem with 2049 is that it seems like it doesn't have any good ideas at all, it's not daring, it's just bland. The production is top notch but that's about it. First the characters, the most important part of the movie. There aren't any interesting or memorable characters in 2049. Only Niander Wallace was slightly interesting but he's so much outside the main story that you kind of forget about him, he appears at the beginning and towards the end. All the replicants in the original movie had a sort of psycho edge to them, they had emotions, they caught your attention. Here they're just like a bunch of dull androids literally, including the main character 'K'. And even the minor characters in the original were all memorable, Tyrell, Sebastian, Hannibal, they were all unique and interesting. In this one there is nothing of that. Second the story and the situations. In the first movie things were happening, slow moody scenes were followed by action sequences and they kind of completed each other seamlessly. You would marvel at the style and then marvel at the action. In this one, it looks like just endless stylish slow scenes that drag on and on. And since they don't get anywhere they become sort of pointless. It all feels incredibly slow. The story itself had some potential but it's not developed properly, where are all the ideas? The 'love story' if we can call it that between 'k' and 'Joy' is just completely forgettable. I don't blame the director, he did all he could with what he had I suppose. When compared to the original masterpiece, 2049 is a complete disappointment on all fronts. As a standalone movie is okish but I wouldn't want to watch it again.",Blade Runner 2049

I would've prefered that there wasn't a link to the original's story and altogether it's not a bullseye of a film for me.

585,benkitching13,A film of two distinct halves of quality.,8,30 October 2017,"I stated in my summary that Blade Runner 2049 is best summarised as a film of two distinct halves, and to some extent the statement is true, however in retrospect I now believe the film is more appropriately summarised as a film of three slightly more blurred thirds of quality. Act one was a largely flawless, mesmerising segment. A barrage of exceedingly good, after exceedingly good scenes. Act two pertained to much of what made the first segment so enthralling, though the quality did slightly diminish here. Act three was where I personally observed the greatest shift in quality, due in large part to the conclusion of the film. The conclusion appeared to me as being docile and underwhelming in comparison to the remainder of the film.Ryan Gosling succeeds in delivering an immersive performance as wearied Blade Runner ""K"". By contrast, Harrison Ford's performance seemed unremarkable and shadow; more akin to his role as Han Solo in ""The Force Awakens"" than the film demanded. The original Blade Runner hosted a number of exceptional fight scenes. The compliment can be extended to the fight scenes featured in 2049, although a different cinematic approach has been taken to producing them. The cinematography is largely excellent, however I would have appreciated some additional shots of the skyscraper topped, cyberpunk/noir city environment: as I feel the film loses some of it's immersion due this factor.Despite (in my personal opinion) not being deserved of the five star reviews media outlets are constantly firing at it: Blade Runner 2049 is largely a high quality sci fi experience that I recommend you view.",Blade Runner 2049
586,dyingrepublicofpanama,It's a masterpiece that transcends the original.,10,22 July 2018,It truly is. This is the best film of the last decade. A sequel should exist to live along side the original or carry on / improve on the foundations. This does both. It's incredible. 10/10,Blade Runner 2049
587,dyingrepublicofpanama,Sequels do not get better.,10,8 September 2018,An absolute triumph of a sequel. I've just finished watching it for the 4th time and it simply just gets better and better.

588,mezzaitaliana-89131,"Great visuals, disappointing script",6,9 October 2017,"Maybe some spoilers!Being a massive fan of the original BR, I was apprehensive about this sequel. In 1982 Blade runner was riveting to watch. Visually stunning and an amazing story full of drama and pathos. Most of the actors where not household names at the time so you were able to really invest in the characters. Now they have to have a well know star to get it made. Ryan Gosling doing the same quiet brooding style he is known for. Harrison Ford had a small part and obviously did it for the money. In 1982 The future 2019 strangely did feel a long way off. This set in 2049 is so implausible that the world will be destroyed like this. One thing that drove me mad was the soundtrack. It was so loud it took over and became distracting. The were some amazing visuals, but I left feeling drained and disappointed",Blade Runner 2049

In contrast however I loved this movie, the visuals were stunning, the casting was exceptional, and more impressively; the storyline was intensely gripping and profound. I would very highly recommend watching this movie and giving it a good go! The graphics embedded are Oscar worthy (*nudge nudge* and makes the movie more aesthetically pleasing on the eyes.",Blade Runner 2049
590,breckstewart,So Boring I Couldn't Finish it,3,18 March 2019,"Well, there is no spoiler here at all. I couldn't bother to write them even if i wanted to because the story is so tedious and excruciating that I was not able to watch this to the end. So I read spoiler filled reviews instead to find out how this fiasco ends and well, no luck there either. My rating reflects the fact that there are some qualities to this film namely the effects and the beautiful cinematography but this is not a good movie in my opinion.As for the acting, I couldn't really tell because the narrative is so boring and uneventful for the most part that I was routinely fast forwarding through scenes hoping that the story would pick up but the steady pacing was slow and slower. The original is of course a masterpiece who survived the sand of times but this sequel is so below what I expected that I can only qualify this as a huge letdown.I can't totally say this is not worth watching especially for those who worship the original but be prepared to be swamped with concepts and bits of dialogue that want to be deep and thought provoking while personally, I found the whole thing trite and overly pedantic in an overly confused and overblown manner.But the most important aspect I couldn't get over is just how painful this was for me to watch. I never felt connected to the story nor cared for any of the characters but that might just be me. Draw your own conclusions and prove me wrong if need be but 3 stars is the only rating I could muster for this overly long and pretentious piece of fiction.",Blade Runner 2049
591,PrashunChakraborty,Another year another Villeneuve success,8,13 October 2017,"To start off I would like to say that I liked this film despite some shortcomings, this is the third good film by Denis Villeneuve in three years, what a monumental achievement, never have I seen this level of consistency or even frequency in both mainstream and art house films. Among the many things it does right, Blade Runner 2049 is a very good looking film with great cinematography and excellent music. There's great atmosphere building and heavy themes just like in the original Blade Runner but the film falters in the plot department. Blade Runner was a thinking man's science fiction film with very heavy themes, 2049 doesn't shy away from them and embraces them but the plot is riddled with loopoles and is very messy. The original Blade Runner's vehicle (so to say) for themes was a simple bounty hunting mission, this simple plot allowed it to put in deep philosophical ideas in the film. 2049 wants to have it's cake and eat it too, the plot or the vehicle to deliver the heavy themes is a modern day noir mystery which is too complex for it's own good and logical loopholes creep in, but one could argue that the plot isn't the spirit of 2049, it's the ideas, the themes of who or what is a truly a human, and these are present in the film just that the scenes and story surrounding it doesn't do the movie much favors. Must say though the romance in this film is it's highlight and strongest suit, it's a mix of Her and original Blade Runner (if done right, because let's face it 1982's romance was it's weakest department). Lastly would reiterate, while I really liked this film, I would definitely put it a notch below the original Blade Runner which tackled similar if not more complex themes more elegantly.",Blade Runner 2049
592,kepeb,It works!,10,11 March 2020,"Not an easy challenge to rise to.
As can be seen with the recent re-visit Ridley Scott made to the Alien universe, this can go horribly wrong.Probably against what seems to be his current opinion, the director maintained the ambiguity around the original movie's lead (Deckard) and also managed to expand on most of the loved themes and imagery of the original.
Although not entirely a flop, the original performed poorly when released but gained a massive cult following which is still growing today.This growth wasn't enough to Smash any Box office records but it did nothing to destroy the fanbase or disgrace the original (Unlike every other scifi franchise now has)
And I can see this maturing equally as well as the first.
An excellent, cinematic, respectful and enjoyable movie.",Blade Runner 2049
593,parrot007,A justifed follow up and technical triumph.,9,18 April 2021,"When you make a sequel to a 30 year old movie, you better do it right. And unlike a certain other sequel to a 30+ year old film(s) that also includes Harrison Ford, Blade Runner 2049 respects it's elderly predecessor while also giving a good continuation of it's themes and expansion of the universe. It's tone and style by way of it's precise filmmaking, music, and diliberate use of color to convey feelings all do an excellent job of immersing us in the Blade Runner setting again and making something great technically . It definitely nails the atmosphere.This sequel takes a slow and steady pace and focuses on a new character K, who has an interesting arc himself with an element of ambiguity to who he is. In fact, all the movie's characters have distinct dialogue and reactions. They all do their part to slowly peel back the layers of this mystery behind a replicants child and the potential for the artificial to become the authentic. It constantly reminds you that everything in 2049 from whiskey to romance, is artificial, grounding you in this silent but incredibly important hunt for the truth. It expands the universe immensely with the idea of artificial birth, if replicants can...replicate, the line between man and machine becomes even further blurred than it's predecessor. I dare say it's themes are deeper across the board. It's clear that Villeneuve respected the Blade Runner name and wanted to add genuine depth to the world. At no point are there attempts to undercut the original.My only criticisms of this movie are very minor. It's been said that the first cut of this movie came out to be 4 hours long. While I certainly could watch something that looks this good for 4 hours, its too long for a standard release and we know that they had to shave off over an hour of footage, which will never be seen again. I think it's a shame that this will (probably) never be released as an extened cut because I think there are some ideas and characters that could have been expanded upon. One example is Jared Leto's character. He puts on a very interesting performance and it would have been great to see more of this and his character's perspective. When every single shot in this movie looks amazing, its reasonable to believe that much of the cut footage looks great too. The actual film that was released is great, but I think it's potential was even higher.If you still haven't seen this film, do it. It's a worthy follow up to the 1982 classic and it never breaks form. It doesn't rely on the original to tell the story and it also does NOT make the fruitless effort to recreate the original story through unnecessary fan service. It utilitlizes the old characters in meaningful and believable ways, and only as much as is necessary.This is what film sequels should be.",Blade Runner 2049
594,Critomaton,"A completely worthy sequel, but let's hope the director's cut redoes the score.",8,9 October 2017,"This is one of very few spoiler-free reviews I've written for IMDb. This movie deserves it. It's definitely one of the best sequels ever made, especially considering how many years have passed since the original. Aliens is still my favorite sequel of all time, but this one is a close second for entertainment value, and as a continuation/expansion of the story started by its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 is arguably equal or superior. If you're mad at Ridley Scott for what he did to the Alien universe with two rather abysmal prequels, go see Blade Runner 2049 and hopefully all will be forgiven.Blade Runner 2049 is filled with nods to the original, but they are seamlessly integrated because this really does feel like the same world 30 years later. At first, the movie seems to be presenting us with a new and different, more lonely, and more isolated future than Deckard's rainy, crowded streets of LA. But, in time, it reveals the Blade Runner world we expect, expanded in a way that does justice to 35 years of real- world cinematic advances, while introducing some new and very memorable settings.The movie has a very deliberate pace - obviously too slow for some reviewers on IMDb - but even that feels like a stylistic homage to the original (or at least an homage to complaints about the original). I detected some scenes here and there that felt a bit too dragged out, but they were few and far between, and I imagine they fit the director's vision, so hopefully there won't need to be too many different versions of this film.In a way, the story line is simpler than that of the original, but in another more practical way, it is much deeper. From the start, I was expecting a chase for newer or more (or more interesting) replicants, but all I can say is, the movie goes in a direction I wasn't expecting. If it feels at all predictable (and to me it really didn't - there were some plot twists that surprised), it is only because it fits naturally within the Blade Runner world so familiar to fans of the original film.Harrison Ford plays a very important part in this film, but it is Ryan Gosling's movie for sure, and he does a fine job with the role.I saw it in 3D and, while the movie wasn't ruined by gimmicky ""obviously just done for the 3D effect"" scenes, there were times when I felt like the scenes were a bit too washed-out and bleak, and I wasn't sure whether that was the intent or just the effect of the 3D glasses. I'm sure I'll see it again in the theater but haven't decided whether to go with 2D next time. The only aspect of the movie that I really disliked was the score. At times Vangelis-like (which is to say, almost angelic-sounding), it was more often than not ominously oppressive, drowning out my ability to concentrate on the on-screen action instead of creating the powerful effect Hans Zimmer usually achieves. I feel like his contribution does not elevate Blade Runner 2049 the way it did Interstellar (where it was also way too loud, but at least created powerful emotions). My dislike for the score notwithstanding, the few nods to the original score are done extremely well, with the most important one arriving not a moment too soon (and that's as close to a spoiler as I'll get).The entire movie continues and expands the discussion about the complex interactions between humans and the technology they create, while introducing some surprisingly original ideas (at least for cinema) about the interactions among various different technologies.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Is Deckard a replicant? All I can say is that Blade Runner 2049 addresses this question. Well, maybe ""acknowledges"" would be a more appropriate word...",Blade Runner 2049
595,dtrani,Amazing film! Visually stunning!,8,22 May 2021,"Blade Runner 2049. A film that has gone beyond my expectations. This is exactly the kind of way a sequel to a film should be. Some might say that it isn't. I personally find this to be much better than its predecessor.The visual cinematography is beautiful, as are most of Roger Deakins' work. The detailed visual effects compliment the cinematography as well. The music was wonderful and produced a similar style to Vangelis' work from the first movie.Overall it seems they took all of the great elements from the first film and applied it to the second one. Simply, this is how you make a second film based off of an already well-known movie.I must say again, I enjoyed this film much better than the first. It was much easier to follow along as they really did a good job of investing you into the plot.Overall amazing film! Beautiful work from Dennis Villenueve and his team.",Blade Runner 2049
596,connorbbalboa,Completely over-hyped and undeserving of the praise,3,7 October 2017,"I never was one of those people asking for a Blade Runner sequel. Now that Blade Runner 2049 is out, my position still stands. This film is simply a massive letdown and nothing more.The year is 2049 and the world has grown in technology, but not humanity. Ryan Gosling plays K, a Blade Runner (a futuristic cop) tasked with tracking down the last of the Replicants-androids that look like humans. Knowing that he himself is a replicant, he goes on a journey of his own when he finds a box containing the bones of a Replicant who gave birth to a child and is tasked with finding the child. Little does he know that the new head of the Tyrell Corporation that makes the Replicants, Mr. Wallace (Jared Leto), plans to use the missing child for his own purposes and kill K if he has to.My main problem with the film is that it was unforgivably boring. The film is two hours and forty-five minutes long, which is already enough to test one's patience (and bladder), but it feels so deliberately paced; the characters almost always move so slow, that it feels like the filmmakers thought that it was the best way to pad out the running time, despite having not enough material to justify it.The performances range from great to laughable. Harrison Ford is hardly in the movie, and his inclusion is clearly a marketing ploy, but he gives the best performance in his brief running time and he feels like a continuation of his character from the original, Deckard, in a world where things have just gotten worse. Gosling isn't bad as K, and his stone-face actually is pretty effective in a couple of scenes, but Rutger Hauer in the original gave his Replicant character more of a personality. Leto is trying and failing to bring a degree of menace as the villain, and his female Replicant sidekick competes with him in the field of phoning it in.What else shocked me was how unsubtle the film was. The original was not only a futuristic crime noir that had Harrison Ford's Deckard chasing down androids, but also a personal journey involving himself and Rutger Hauer as the villain that involved trying to find a degree of humanity in such a futuristic world, and that maybe, Deckard is a replicant himself. Here, the story is mainly of Gosling trying to come to terms with the fact that he is a Replicant and what it means in terms of his humanity. Whereas in the original, there were subtle signs, images, and bits of dialogue that hinted at Deckard's purpose in the original, everything is spelled out for the audience to the point that old bits of dialogue are repeated thrice at important moments. It doesn't respect the audience's intelligence at all. The first and final thirds of the film are mainly filled with dialogue that is basically speeches that preach ideas about conflict and the ethics of machines, but hardly any of it is explored in an interesting fashion. What's worse, the film feels so empty and devoid that for a time, I forgot what K's objective was.What I will say is that the cinematography is beautiful. There are a lot of colorful images with ancient ruins and futuristic tech in the background and foreground that could easily pass as being part of an art gallery. The only downside is that there is too much gray in some shots and it feels too clean compared to the original.Why Warner Brothers and Sony wasted their time making this film, I have no clue. Maybe it was Ridley Scott's fault. After being unimpressed with his Alien: Covenant earlier this year (and was also quite the snooze-fest), watching this only proved to me further that Scott just doesn't care about good filmmaking anymore. Denis Villeneuve is clearly an ambitious director, but his style didn't feel completely right for this film. Clearly, in a film that tries so desperately to say much more humanity than its predecessor, it comes out feeling empty and feels less human than the original did.P.S. A lot of people have accused me of being too shallow and wanting this film to be more action packed. I do not have that mindset. I enjoy films that take their time as much as the next film enthusiast, but this one just didn't do enough to justify what it was aiming for. I'm not ashamed in expressing my opinion. Just let me be clear on something: going at a slow, deliberate pace and speaking lines of preachy dialogue does not, I repeat, does not equal intelligence. The positive reviews baffle me, especially on Rotten Tomatoes. Sony owns the company, which leads me to think that maybe it bribed more than a few critics in the hopes that more people would see it. Clearly, that is backfiring and I'm happy that people are rejecting it.",Blade Runner 2049
597,SomaQuest,Technically A Masterpiece,8,5 October 2018,"Whether or not you agree with a sequel to the original classic or not you must pay homage to Ridley Scott's absolutely incredible use of special effects for their ability to truly create an immersive world for a cinematic experience. Clearly following the logical progression from the previous installment set approximately 40 years prior to this film Scott uses his visuals in such a way as you feel that the world of Blade Runner has simply aged appropriately.This film was billed in it's previews as a Harrison Ford vehicle, however, his role is not nearly at the forefront until well past the halfway mark of the film. Ryan Gosling plays his role perfectly as does Jared Leto in this underappreciated appearance. All subsequent secondary characters are well designed and thought out and the plot, arguably, is quite intriguing.In regards to all the failures in reboots we have seen in the past five years this stands out among the ones that are done correctly and at a time appropriate for their revival.A film well worth watching even at the run time of 164 minutes.",Blade Runner 2049

This added ingredient to AI emotion to this story brings a more deeper feel and rather if humanity could ever respect and accept it.This film could provide a different meaning as to society of placement, obedience to the core of motive of a human being or replace human error all together and put it in a submissive state where the living can have some liberty.The overall feel of the film certainly stayed true to the beautiful artistic look Bladerunner shown but with a wider lense in this film.Harrison Ford's character gives you that notion of sorrow, anger, and detachment as we learn with his past since the first film.It stays true to the first film but not quite as different as it could be but still a good look.",Blade Runner 2049
600,CSHaviland,"A masterpiece for our time, a reflection of our future",10,16 October 2017,"Bladerunner 2049, like the original, is a concept art movie whose DNA is pure introspection wrapped tightly in a silk of ambiance. Various other movies have attempted to introspect on what it means to be human... What humanity is... Bladerunner is among the best of those, but it doesn't stop with just that question. When you analyze the Bladerunner movies together you find yourself sensing metaphors and symbols and outright injections of racism, sexism, elitism, commercialism, and ""isms"" I haven't even thought of; exploitation, environmental negligence, invasion of privacy, neglect, police corruption, and abuse of power. It was a frightening glimpse at ourselves today, at our inner nature, at fears ranging from xenophobia to claustrophobia to phobias that haven't been invented yet. Those are the negative things, but you can also find human ingenuity, art, innocence, and the need for love and nostalgia, all but lost like tears in the rain. The pacing of the movie was ponderous because it needed you to digest all of this brain food and eye candy, and it used the music and sound effects and visual effects to keep your attention. The music helped to glue you to the thoughts the movie was injecting you with - and some of them were on the level of subliminal advertising.It remained consistent with the original movie, in continuity with the atmospheric theme but allowing us a more diverse glimpse outside the urban waste-cage and the clutch of overpopulation. But there is no improvement to be found outside the city: it is a lonely place with or without the crowds. The barren desert landscapes, the angry ocean waters, the garbage heaps of San Diego littered with desperate children, and the decadent remains of a sepia-baked Las Vegas were no improvements, and yet the eyes drink it all. The assault of personal space and by unregulated advertisement and human debauchery that sticks to you in like filthy grime was set in stark contrast with a distinct isolation on the outside, no better and no worse, and all welded together with stunning sounds. Both Bladerunner movies are a war between perfection and imperfection: our struggle to create a perfect world for ourselves results in a world decidedly imperfect. This is a world- build set on the unstable ground of organic, cultural, technological and industrial blemishes, the kind we turn our eyes from and pretend they don't exist. Watch both movies and you find yourself buried in things that fail or do not work quite right... Shorting out, dying, rotting, falling into disrepair, scraped up, beaten up... It is the future through the lens of today, rather than through the rosy glasses of yesteryear.There are scenes in the Bladerunner movies (and others) in which the characters really aren't doing anything but thinking or taking a journey. The plot doesn't move and the characters don't develop. When that's done on purpose (see Under the Skin for more-than-enough of that technique) and when the actors and Director of Photography and Sound Designer and Composer aren't on board with what the director is trying to do, it fails. Even if they ARE on board it could fail, so it's a risky art, especially with an enormous amount of studio money, in a system where the studio people can intercede to ""protect"" their investment. I felt that this cut could use a little trimming here and there, as we lingered on a person thinking for a few seconds too many, or waiting (without any suspense) for Deckard to finally say, ""Rachel,"" and as I waited, in my mind that police loudspeaker was saying: ""Move-on... Move-on... Movie-on...""The question of Deckard's humanity, and the ambiguity that drives everyone to debate it, is the metaphor of ourselves. He is the ""everyman."" What makes us human? Aren't' we all machines, striving for perfection, losing to imperfection, tangled in a war against death for a life of despair we can't seem to win? The unicorn has been used in mythology to symbolize the incarnation of Christ, able to bring back the dead and offer immortality. It did not make an appearance in the second movie. Or did it?",Blade Runner 2049
601,jeffyoung1,Curious observations of Blade Runner 2049 you'll find interesting,8,6 October 2017,"Spoilers due to references and descriptions of scenes in the movie.Let me get this out of the way first. 1) Watch BLADE RUNNER (1982) first, if you haven't, before watching BLADE RUNNER 2049. You'll understand it better and enjoy it more.2) Out of the traditional Hollywood four stars rating system, I'll award 3 stars out of 4, which means, GOOD, so yes, you will like this movie, especially if you've already seen the first BLADE RUNNER (1982). I could be tempted to give 3.5 stars but am not certain so at least I am comfortable with a solid 3 out of 4 stars.BACKGROUND: Los Angeles County in 2049 has changed little since 2019, only to get worse. LA still looks like the gloomy, rainy British Isles. In fact all of southern California looks like it. Even San Diego city and county no longer exist except to be massive garbage dumps. The multicultural, multi-ethnic, and multi-language universe of Los Angeles is highly emphasized and there are no scenes of first generation Asian immigrants overrunning metropolitan Los Angeles on foot and on bicycles as was seen in 2019. Everyone seems to be multi-lingual or bilingual with English as the first language. People can speak a foreign language or the highly developed street slang while switching to normal English spoken with no dialect or inflection. Los Angeles looks to be a crummy place to live but people still want to live there and it may look like population has in fact increased. Mass commercialization through high graphics technology is all around. The skyscraper illuminated video adverts from 2019 are still around but in 2049 have been supplemented with holographic advertisements all over the place and on the streets, with holographic scantily clad women suddenly appearing next to pedestrians and shoppers like hi-tech, colorful ghosts selling something or themselves. FDA standards of advertising seem to have been abolished decades ago. Much of the hi-tech skyscraper adverts and the holograms show female nudity and apparently everyone is okay with it including parents. In fact 2049 Los Angeles is a feminist' nightmare. While women can still reach career positions as demonstrated by the female police lieutenant, but the female body has become extremely sexualized for commercial and pleasure purposes and is displayed in your face with innumerable, brightly lit video and holographic ads around the city. More, it's because prostitution has been legal in Los Angeles (California) for decades from 2019. Los Angeles is a run-down Sodom in the high-tech 21st century still awaiting its final judgment.If you've seen the 1982 BLADE RUNNER you'll know what I mean. Replicants are bio-engineered humans, long the stuff of long past science fiction movies. So in essence they're people, just stronger, faster, more agile, and of at least, above average intelligence. You start to realize that the latest generation of human replicants has achieved what mad scientists, insane dictators, and eugenicists have long sought...an improved human being. Yet the biases from the real humans remain from 2019. Replicants are still called, skinjobs. If the replicants took over the world, the world would still be populated by humans, just stronger and smarter ones.If you're a science fiction fan like me, you can't help notice parallels in BLADE RUNNER 2049 from past science fiction movies, whether that is coincidental or by purpose which would make some of BLADE RUNNER 2049 derivative. a. I see the parallel from Star Trek's, 'Khan', where 20th century earth science eugenically created stronger and more intelligent humans that became dictators and brought about world war three. b. I see the parallel in urban Los Angeles to the brightly lit, commercialized and highly sexualized city shown in, 'Artificial Intelligence. c. I see the parallel in the personalities of the replicants to the bio-genetically in-vitro altered humans in, ""Gattaca"". The Blade Runner world of replicants have the same mental and emotional stability that results in a flat personality that makes them speak and converse like Mr. Spock. d. The special effects did a miraculous job in replicating (no pun intended) Rachel from the 1982 Blade Runner. I can only assume that CGI was used. Similar effects were used to recreate the youthful-looking 1984 terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger for the 2014 Terminator. I think I noticed this 2049 Rachel replicant having a somewhat wider face than the 1982 movie's Rachel, played by actress Sean Young. Still, it was excellent. I don't hold any of this against the movie.My final judgment. Go watch the movie but only if you have already seen the 1982 BLADE RUNNER. If not, go find the DVD or live-stream the movie on the Internet and watch it. Then go see BLADE RUNNER 2049. You won't be disappointed. The two hours plus went by fast. There's really no slow point in the movie to get up and use the restroom. You'll miss something but have someone next to you tell you what you missed.",Blade Runner 2049
602,patboldt,An Above Average Sequel that Pays Homage to Ridley Scott's Masterpiece,9,30 December 2017,"Some films are not well recieved at first because of how strange or unusual they are and they either end up being forgotten or later hailed as cult classics. This is what happened to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and so in spite of this I can imagine that you are asking how one can possibly make a sequel to a film like Blade Runner, especially a good one. Reasonably, I was worried. How did it turn out? A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! Blade Runner 2049 feels like a worthy sequel to Blade Runner and it carries the atmosphere of the original and even expands on it. Ryan Gosling is an amazing lead and he is really interesting on screen and Harrison Ford is well, Harrison Ford. This movie didn't set itself up to be a next MCU that would burn itself into the ground, it simply told a good story and expanded on the story of Blade Runner by exploring the universe that it exists in. It's fair to compare this sequel to beloved sequels such as Toy Story 2, Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, and Terminator 2 which expand on the original story while also adding new and exciting content. This movie may be less thought provoking than the original but it certainly makes the audience have to think about complex ideas involving humanity and life. Needless to say, Hans Zimmer is great and really goes out of his way to make the music feel like Vangelis in the original Blade Runner and there are many callback themes that original Blade Runner fans will surely recognize. However, the true winner in this movie is the cinematography. The cinematography is amazing and so many shots seem perfectly organized. The techniques utlizied are truly award worthy and make other cinematographers bow their heads. Everything done to create the atmosphere of an amazing Ridley Scott is done and Denis Villeneuve really shines in this movie. This is not your average sequel but it also isn't your average blockbuster. This is not like some Marvel movie that forces in cheesy humor nor is it a generic action flick like Pearl Harbor or Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. It's a compelling Sci Fi and it feels like something that will be remembered years later for it's greatness. It will provoke deep thought and really make you appreciate its beauty on par with something spectacular such as the original Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or I dare say, the original Blade Runner. It's damn good even if it isn't neccesarily for everyone and if you want to watch a movie that will stand in greatness against the other generic movies you watch, give it a shot.",Blade Runner 2049

It was as if the production crew worked so hard to capture the visuals, sound, and tone of the original...and to bring in Harrison Ford and Edward James Olmos...they forgot (or lacked the budget)to concoct a story.This was one of the most painfully boring movies I have ever sat through....and certainly the biggest disappointment.I will admit the visuals were well done....but the ""booom...BOOOM""...soundtrack....engaging in the first ""Blade Runner""....was just annoying here. In fact, the interesting visuals were the only reason I did not give this film a ""1""...it definitely deserves it.I was panicking midway through the movie...I was by then agonizingly bored...and I could not envision how....when...it would ever end. It really, truly, is that bad.""Blade Runner 2049"" currently has the inflated shill IMDb reviews that most big-budget releases start out with....but take my word. Once more people see this film, the truth will come out and I would wager it will be gone from the theaters in less than two weeks.Please...do yourself a huge favor....skip it!***I wanted to add after submitting this review***I find it amusing the people giving this movie positive reviews, who are more or less insulting the opinions of those who did not like it. I don't mean the shills who gave the film a positive review because they are biased or have a financial interest....I'm talking about those who think liking this movie makes them ""deeper"" and smarter...they get the deep mystery and meaning of the movie and those who disliked it do not.This is ridiculous and reeks of elitism...there is nothing ""deep"" in Blade Runner 2049. The movie is just too long and boring to support an almost non-existent story, it's that simple.",Blade Runner 2049
604,charbelelaro,This film ticks every single box,9,2 April 2019,"Blade Runner 2049 directed by the master Denis Villeneuve is the sequel to the 1982 Blade Runner by Ridley Scott. This film ticks every single box. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is astounding. Every single shot in this movie is magnificent. This is the best looking movie I have ever seen. The screenplay is smart, creative and so unexpected, I was very impressed by the writing. Also the performances, mainly by Ryan gosling and Harrison Ford, were flawless. For a film set within a dystopian concrete city, it contains such strong emotion and deep social commentary at its core. Unfortunately I felt the runtime should have been shorter, so on rewatch, having seen the amazing visuals already, it may drag at times. Therefore I give Blade Runner 2049 a 9.",Blade Runner 2049

606,littlemankazoo,A 21st Century Masterpiece,9,7 March 2018,"I have a...history...with Blade Runner.Coming upon the new generation of viewers that I've opened the 1982 classic to, I've found that its reception is far more mixed and ponderous than the undying cult following it has acquired in the 30+ years since the original's flop of a release.Unlike the love many pour upon it from that era, many of my friends I have introduced it to have often exited it feeling indifferent about its story and characters, but strongly about the visual style and the world that Ridley Scott intended to create with it.My personal opinion? The original is a visual masterpiece. Its look and feel are unlike any other film from the 1980's, and I will die with the opinion that it is the best-looking film of that era by my side.Why do I bring this up? Because I believe Blade Runner 2049 is a revamp that successfully weds everything that I love about Blade Runner and everything that it was lacking that left my friends confused. This is the 'Blade Runner' for a new generation, and my goodness, is it a mean machine.It goes without saying that this film looks SPECTACULAR. It is quite honestly one of the few films in this era that I can look at and buy EVERYTHING that is on-screen. The world is vivid as it was back in 1982, and I cannot knock the gorgeous, Oscar-winning cinematography by Roger Deakins. Every frame of this film, quite literally, is a painting I would want hung on my wall. If you need ONE REASON to see this film, see it to just LOOK at it.The story, unlike the unsure one in the original cult classic, has a direction here that is clear and mostly straightforward. It remains just as mysterious in its tone as the original, and it still is most certainly a neo-noir tale, but I feel as if its necessary upgrades make it a more palatable film for modern audiences. If the story of the original felt 'empty', this is hardly that.The performances, how little there are, are obviously all incredible. I can hardly see the Ryan Gosling who starred in La La Land just a short year ago in the role of Agent K, Jared Leto completely redeems himself from his awful turn as The Joker, and Ana de Armas is beautifully subtle in a rather integral role to the film. Harrison Ford is also in the film, for a period that isn't as long as you likely wish he was, but he's in it just enough to service the story and NOT just the fans. It works.And that's the phrase I choose to describe this film with. It WORKS. Everything that could have been absolutely sloppy about a Blade Runner sequel is completely erased by the time you make it halfway through this film. It does not feel like some Hollywood producer drudged-up the name just to bank-off something recognizable.This film has LOVE put into it. Director Denis Villeneuve clearly adores the previous work, the world it established, and everything he is building with this film. It feels like it has heart, it looks like it has heart, and in the end...it DOES have that heart necessary for a sequel to one of the most iconic films of all time.In the end, I am very torn. I need many more viewings before I can absolutely be sure of myself on this judgement......but I think Blade Runner 2049 may end up being one of the best films of the early 21st century.But that is for time and you to decide. Go out and see it so you may judge for yourself. Much as this film ""bombed"" at the box office, I think a proper audience will save this masterpiece from becoming more than just tears in rain...",Blade Runner 2049
607,chancellorpink,Overrated Painting,4,3 June 2018,"I like art a lot. And this film is pretty. The music is cool too. But it ends there. It's boring, slow, overwrought and self-important.

608,michaellaing71,Much of the greatness of the original and also its faults,7,5 October 2017,"There is a lot to like about the film but the film is slow. Visually the film is a treat and Roger Deakins will probably get an Oscar for his cinematography. The score is OK but it doesn't feel as iconic as the original. The acting is good and Denis Villeneuve directing is excellent as usual. If you didn't have a problem with the pacing of the original, then you probably won't with this, though personally I do think the original is very slow and this film doesn't feel any different. The story is interesting but I won't say anything about it cause I don't want to spoil it for anyone. This film isn't an action film, more an art house film with action in it. Seeing the original isn't essential but probably worth doing and I would definitely say watch the 3 short films 2022, 2036, 2048.For me this isn't the perfect film I was hoping for and think that trimming half an hour away from the film would help. At times it does leave certain motivations unanswered and occasionally occasionally I feel the film tries to hard visually.At times Bladerunner 2049 is very impressive but I would probably prefer to re-watch it on Blu-ray than in the cinema, where I can stop and come back to it another time (very similar to the original)",Blade Runner 2049

There are no memorable lines like, ""All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.""

614,mark-4522,We should have flying cars by now,6,17 October 2017,"Spoiler alert, but I think my review will enhance your experience.I enjoyed much of the film due to little easter eggs such as the actress who plays Cameron in the 80's retro series ""Halt and Catch Fire"" is a prostitute in a sequel to a film based upon an alternate reality from the 1980's. Irony wrapped in an onion And note: This is an ALTERNATE universe from the original film that had expected the USSR to still be around and for us to have flying cars by 2010 or so. The director wants us to note this by showing Pan Am advertisements and other retired 1980's brands (Braniff perhaps? Keep a lookout!) The style is similar to that of the original film so if you liked the original film, you'll feel comfortable and in a way, I liked that. Look for appearances from (aged) original cast members from the original film aside from Harrison Ford. The plot rolls along almost exactly like it's predecessor. It's almost as if it was written and conceived a year or so afterwards and put on hold for 34 moreThe original film's notion of replicants was not entirely believable but in the introduction text for this one, the story is preposterous: The Nexus series replicants were so dangerous that it caused a civil war resulting in a ban but later lifted when they were made ""safe"" (similar to Asimov's three laws) and the human bigotry towards ""skin jobs"" continues even as many humans still live in absolute poverty (including an orphanage utilizing humans as slave labor) and a replicant working as a police officer. Now think about it: If replicants are now operating on Earth because they're so safe, what need is there for human slaves or poverty? And the replicants are apparently not safe since they require continual imprecise oral ""base checks"" where the replicants now often exercise free will and kill and attack living people. Asimov is spinning in his grave. ""This is not how ANY of this works!!!"" he would be saying.And all of this robotic technology that is just a hair's span away from killing all of humanity overnight is in the hands of a weird Tyrell replacement whose blind, insane and evil and sends out robot minions to beat up people to get what he wants. He apparently thinks that his manufacturing process isn't efficient enough and needs a way to get robots made the, er, old fashioned way.This does spur a philosophical insight on my part in that even as our society becomes more efficient at manufacturing and information retrieval, the world's elite cries out for more labor even as they engage in massive layoffs at their companies to have a lean workforce. So while the raw message of the film is a bit silly, it can spur insights (at least with me).Finally, while bladerunner original had many fun, technological devices such as a scanner that could take a photo print and examine it in HD, this film has nothing new that would surprise us. That' s OK because it's a continuation of a film conceived in the mid-80's and helps to keep the style consistent. I wish this had been done with Star Wars. I'm reminded of a sequel to the Fifth Element, one of my favorite films, that was just awful (I wrote a review on that) and this is better at least. These sequels and remarks only serve to remind us of how GOOD the 80's films were (and still are).",Blade Runner 2049
615,elsidaliaj,I originally rated this a 1....how stupid of me.,10,7 November 2018,"I'm glad I just rewatched this movie I originally rated it a 1....The best part of the original blade runner was the ""tears in rain"" monologue, which was what basically made the original a cult following.This movie was basically the essence and soul of that ending but through out it's lengthy run time. It expands upon the originals premise and universe tremendously, the grand scope of the universe and story is what the original should of been.The original unfortunately seems regular cheesy Hollywood amateurish compared to 2049, which might become the standard to compare the franchise to if you will.I can't think of any actual movie where a so called remake was better then the original or even came close to it.This somehow manages to overshadow it and become 10x grander, even somehow managing to tie in old elements, flashbacks, and even old actors flawlessly. Haven't seen this achieved anywhere else in cinematography, at least with the movies I've seen.Yes the runtime is long but it keeps you engaged, I'm glad it was long as I loved every minute of it and honestly to properly tell the story, needed it.In closing this is what the original should of been and any remakes, sequels should be compared to this.If you watched it the first time and blew it off like I did, rewatch I believe you won't be disappointed, you pick up on subtle things especially the deeper aspects, such as the main plot twist and the deep emotional burden that I totally missed the first time around.",Blade Runner 2049
616,pgaucher683,I've missed Roy until I found Love.,10,4 February 2018,"I agree with Peterfaure's review here because I'm a fan of R.Scott and Blade Runner is one of his masterpieces, so when they started talking about a sequel, R.Scott was mandatory of course, instead they chose D.Villeneuve, as a Canadian, I was delighted and I was also worried.From my point of view, (I watched Blade runner once a year since its release), D.Villeneuve did his own masterpiece, I mean, what R.Scott's BR 2019 could have been with today's technology,
D.Villeneuve has developed his own vision in the Scott universe, you know immediately where you are and the story is catching up in the opening as you imagine Dekard and Rachel driving away to this place (if you've already admitted that the sunny weather and the forest at the end was one of the unicorns in the 1st).If I'm not a big fan of Ryan Gosling, I have to say, here, from his recent movies where he's still this guy without expression, except sometimes, a burst of anger, found his purpose;
As a replicant he is subtle enough to display emotions due to his memory implants, he lives with a hologram, Joi (Ana de Harmas) but instead of an anti-hero like H.Ford / Deckard, it's just KD6 / 3.7, a tool, another human face, used by the LAPD to track down older products like D.Bautista (which deserve more important roles) in the first few minutes;
Morton is not a 'Roy', 'replicants' these days' have found a way to live far from civilization until the end, until you meet love (S.Hoeks) she is as beautiful, ... smart and perfect as Rachel was, but also ruthless and mortal as Roy was too, as K. says, ""if he has named you, you must be special!""Wallace (J.Lehto) is the new technology. guru, the Creator, since Tyrell died long ago leaving a legacy of Nexus more human than human, seeking the definitive Path of Life in his children, probably 99% an AI himself, will give Love the full power to find the inconceivable.
Lt.Joshi (R.Wright) and K found a body in a hidden crate at the bottom of Morton's farm that can destroy the thin balance between human and AI, in fact, Tyrell was a genius because the human remains in this box. are of a woman who gave birth and she has a serial number.The recent suites play a lot on nostalgia, who as a fan was not happy to see Han Solo pass the Millenium Falcon door?
Here is the same feeling, at least for me, seeing Deckard (H.Ford) face to face with another Blade runner was the end of a 35+ years wait, Harrison Ford does not make an appearance in as a guest and of course reinforce the wonderful cast all the way to the end.
Well, even though I've missed a lot of Roy's poetry (Rutger Hauer), a strong musical score like Vangelis did, you'll have everything, a soundscape, a dark atmosphere and ... time, D.Villeneuve took the time to install his story and it is a movie, I will recommend for sure, it's a must.
The coolest thing for me is that I can and I will watch BR 2019 and then 2049 right after, because:
if only all the sequel were that good.",Blade Runner 2049
617,mwelliott99,Utterly brilliant,10,21 October 2017,"I enjoyed the first Blade Runner but it has never been a favourite - not much character development, flawed plot and some slow sequences but it was a product of the early 80's.But I think this film is possibly a masterpiece. The acting is very good, the story interesting, understandable and satisfying and with good effects etc. The joy of this film is the pace and length - the length gives time to really develop the characters. You care what happens to them in a way that you really don't in the original. It is more like a box set in giving time to really get into the story which is gripping. The cinematography, sets and direction seem almost flawless. The effects are excellent but they don't overwhelm the story, unlike most of the junky superhero (& other!) movies the studios churn out with endless ridiculous and boring (odd combination that) set pieces and plot holes to drive a spaceship through.I went with my son & daughter and wife. My 20 yr old daughter said she was gripped by the story though she is not a fan of sci-fi. My wife stayed awake which is unheard of.I was not expecting much from this film but to my surprise it is in my top few sci-fi films (others are probably Ex-machina, Terminator 2, Aliens and, perhaps, Moon). It is really amazing and I hope it gets an Oscar nod.Inevitably I don't understand the negative comments - perhaps from those who prefer the slam, bang superhero gang....",Blade Runner 2049
618,chriskylie,"Beautiful looking, ponderous sci-fi that never goes anywhere",5,16 August 2020,"There were many elements of a masterpiece. Powerful but simple concept. A functional, comprehensible storyline - which did leave room for some unexpected turns. Striking and suitably foreboding production design artistically materialising Blade Runner's famous dystopian future on a blockbuster budget. Gosling is perfect as the modern day Ford, chiselled and enigmatic. Once he appears, Ford injects his trademark sardonic wit. But and it's a big BUT, the pace is morose in the extreme. Earnest scene after earnest scene eek out proceedings at an interminable speed. Several times I thought the film was finally going to ramp up, but any burst of energy evaporates as suddenly as it arrives for more ponderous bleak vistas and dramatic pauses galore. Villeneuve is a fan of contemplative science fiction, but whereas Arrival drew all the slowly woven threads together to a fulfilling climax, Blade Runner limps to an unsatisfying end. Some restraint and at least 30 minutes chopped in the editing suite could have produced a classic. For me what we had was a classic case of directorial self-indulgence.",Blade Runner 2049

Because the original had Plot holes, an uninteresting main characters with no Arc, a detective who doesnt do detective Work, it was also very slow moving and the romance was terrible.What made the original a classic (one that flopped on release btw) was the world building.The new movie takes that world, doesnt overblow it or underutilizes it and improves what didnt work in the original.As far as sequals go, this is one of the best and does exaclty what a Blade Runner sequal needed to be.",Blade Runner 2049
620,julesfdelorme,Over long and overwrought,4,18 October 2017,"I'm old enough to remember when the original Blade Runner came out in theatrical release. It wasn't a box office disaster exactly. But it sure wasn't the hit they seemed to be hoping for. Part of the problem was that most people, myself included, just didn't get the whole film noir science fiction thing the first time that we saw it. Shortly after its release, Ridley Scott, the film's director was quoted as saying that the film that was released was not the film that he had intended. That led to a Director's Cut re-release, one of far too many Director's Cut releases that would follow. It wasn't much better than the original. It was just longer. But the movie got better with age and with further viewing. The original Blade Runner might in fact be the last great movie that Ridley Scott made. He went from the man who publicly bucked the system to being the ultimate minion of the system. Scott's movies have become known for their loudness, explosions and car crashes, as full on sacrifices of anything meaningful or deep to the great god of box office blockbusters. So my first question, when a good friend suggested Blade Runner 2049 to top off our mutual birthdays was if Ridley Scott had directed it. Since he hadn't, and since I did love the original, eventually, and since the trailers and interviews with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling made it seem like an interesting movie, we headed out to see it. We went whole hog too. 3D and Whatever They Call the Thing with the Chairs that Shake and Shift. (Quick Note: If you happen to have Asperger's, as I do, 3D and Moving Chairs is a horrible idea. It was all I could do to stay in my seat at first and not run screaming from the theatre... I hung in there and did even enjoy it at points, but someone with more severe issues might not be able to handle this at all... Guess I should have thought that one through...) Ridley Scott didn't direct Blade Runner 2049, but he did produce it. And therein may have lied the problem. A man who complained about producers cutting his film down is going to have a hard time deciding to cut another director's work, particularly when the work bears the same name. Blade Runner 2049, with a minimum of 30 minutes, probably closer to 45, cut from it might have been a very good movie. The acting is superb in every single role. The story has many interesting ideas flowing through it. And there's some fine cinematography. But you just can't maintain the kind of tension that this film is trying to create for that long a time. And the so called mystery that the film seems to revolve around just doesn't seem to matter when you spend that much time taking us through a overly long overwrought convoluted investigation. We go from tense to bored and then to a little annoyed that the film isn't being wrapped up. A few jokes, a few lighter scenes might have saved the film too. We can see how much fun Gosling and Ford can have with each other in interviews. Why don't we see that on the screen? Blade Runner 2049 tries hard to recreate that film noir darkness of the original, but it just never quite gets there, and it takes way too long to not quite get there. It doesn't suck. There are many very good things about Blade Runner 2049. It just goes on too long and then doesn't quite deliver whatever it is that we've been waiting too long to see. I can't say that I'd recommend the movie to anyone. But I also can't say that no one should watch this film. If you don't mind overly long movies. If you don't mind convoluted plots that don't quite pay off. And if your ass doesn't get numb from sitting in a seat too long, even a seat that moves, maybe you'll like Blade Runner 2049. Or maybe somebody will finally do a Director's Cut where they cut more from the film than was originally released... Yeah. That's likely to happen.",Blade Runner 2049
621,Mohican15,Better than the Original!,8,13 February 2018,"30 years ago, a certain rain-drenched replicant said the immortal words: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe"". With director Dennis Villeneuve we can finally see just some of those ""things"". That's the really brilliant thing about BLADE RUNNER 2049: the design and the vision.Villeneuve has created a beautiful, fascinating and vivid dystopian world. We see such poignant, beautiful things: a room bathed in golden water reflections, giant holographic ballerinas, a stunning version of Las Vegas in orange dust, a futuristic hover car immersed in rainwater and finally, a man passing away amidst a snowfall. The scope and vision of the world is really breathtaking, the colours are beautiful and vibrant and really transform the film. This obviously is in-debt to the cinematography captured brilliantly by Roger Deakins. He showcases the world to the uttermost of his and the camera's abilities in the same way the original. However the really great thing about the film was how it took a theme and expanded so much on it. The film is very philosophical in the same way as the original as it explores what it means and how it feels to be human. Emotions like love and real memories are all explored in the film in great depth. For example, a man is so in love with a hologram that the hologram projects herself over a real woman so they can finally make love. Scenarios like this are just some of the poignant, philosophical parts to this film. It's powerful storytelling and science fiction at its best. Hapton Fescher has written a story that grips with it's running plot and multi-layered characters. However, it's nothing THAT new and it's not much of a mystery since you can simply figure out what's what but it's still engaging and action-packed.The action in the movie is very well-done. It hinges on the original movie but still does it's own thing. It's brutal and sometimes bloody but goes bigger and better than the first movie. This was part of the problem for one scene where Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), a replicant creator who's a replicant himself, murders a female replicant he's just awakened. It's a perverted scene and ruined part of the film for me but I still managed to enjoy this neo-noir piece overall.Of course, the movie is really carried by it's brilliant cast and I must say almost all of the cast is on top form. There were 4 standout performances and 1 decidedly poor performance in the film. To begin with, Ryan Gosling as Officer K. Gosling gives an absolutely brilliant performance as K and acts out real anger and sadness but also loneliness. It's a very raw performance and a very emotional one too. Next, there is of course, Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard. It's wonderful to see him pick up his role after 30 years and carry on the same. He plays a grump, old, cynic but also quite a vulnerable man who's lost a lot in life and Ford plays all of that very strongly. There were then the 2 female standouts with Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks. Armas gives a touchingly emotional performance as the holographic Joi. She plays a character almost like Oz's tin man and you really care about her and k's romance. Sylvia Hoeks is brilliant as the monstrous Luv. She plays a murderous brute of a replicant, uncaring and unfeeling. She's like a female version of Roy Batty. Only, he knew when to spare life, she doesn't! She's really a villainess you can loath but the acting is just so powerhouse from Hoeks. However, the 1 bad performance in the movie was Jared Leto as Niander Wallace. Let's acting is bland and two dimensional and he basically reads the script out loud. Disappointing among such a stellar cast.However, this was a film that delivered an engaging and stunningly beautiful sequel to a classic. It gives us a proper adventure (unlike the original) that's almost like a STAR WARS movie, that really moves the story onwards. It's not an enjoyable movie but it's certainly a fine movie that grips and dazzles, and breaths new life into an old classic...",Blade Runner 2049

With that in mind, I am sure that the director of Blade Runner 2049 took his job very seriously also when he made this film and it shows. The sound and visuals are stunning, the acting is excellent all around, and I enjoyed the music that helps paint a bleak future world. The story is simple but develops over the course of the film. It, like the replicants themselves, implies a much wider impact and implication on the BR world than what is presented in the film, and it actually builds on the original rather than just being cheap fan service like so many other recent prequel-sequels.I enjoyed watching everyone onscreen as well and was never bored at all, though I was surprised by how some of the ladies in the film had very little scenes overall. People playing as replicants had that same sort of slightly off kilter personas as shown in the original movie, and Jared Leto's performance as the new maker of the replicants was nicely cold, calculated, and very business like. In terms of the story, it was nice to see something that had a sense of mystery to it and didn't quite go in the direction I was anticipating. The trailers thankfully do not give anything away in this regard, and I was never bored at all.And that brings to mind the criticisms about the length of this movie: it takes its time to develop itself, and it was nice to see a film that doesn't rush thru the story with crappy editing and overdone handheld shaky cams in the process. I very much enjoyed the fact that we get to see a Blade Runner actually do some detective work in detail - X doesn't mark the spot, and Officer K has to do some exploring (which he is openly criticized for by his superior) but that means we get to see his highs and lows of doing the job. As a result, Ryan Gosling's Officer K gets to develop as a character and he plays his role very well in the process. In the end, I don't understand the hatred for this movie. I remember people going bonkers when the first teaser trailer came out because Harrison Ford was wearing a t-shirt (what, they don't have underwear in the future?) and already putting down Ryan Gosling, all because they were seeing scenes totally out of order and out of story context. That mentality seems very laughable to me and also is the kind of self-indulgent hatred and false sense of superiority that makes social media be the evil tool that it really has become. Does anyone really think that any story in the BR universe will be better than the original? No, it's impossible, but BR 2049 is about as good of a follow up as one could hope for. It's not for everyone, and it's probably not even for ever BR fan, but it worked for me and I enjoyed it immensely. And I will be watching it again very soon...",Blade Runner 2049
625,dplowsav,Not The Visual Masterpiece I Was Hoping For...,6,23 October 2017,"I saw Blade Runner 2049 last night. I had high hopes, high hopes coupled with a little sense of concern.When I first heard that they would be making a sequel, I was apprehensive. I loved the original Blade Runner. It was flawless. It was Ridley Scott at his finest.I wasn't sure how I felt about a potential sequel. When I heard it would be a continuation of Deckards story, I was even more concerned. To me, Deckards story came to an end in the original when those elevator doors shut or that highway scene on the road, depending on what cut of the film you've seen. There was no need to elaborate further on it.So now we have Blade Runner 2049, which will probably not be the last outing for Deckard, as hints are already being dropped for a potential another one if 2049 is a commercial success. It's not looking like it will be...So when I left the cinema, I felt tired... I shouldn't feel that coming out of having just seen a sequel to one of my favorite films of all time. By god was it slow.Original Blade Runner never outstayed its welcome. The editing was fantastic, the pace felt just right. The scenes did not go on for as long as they needed to be, and the film was all the more better for it.2049 is 2 hours and 44 minutes long... The original was 1 hour and 57 minutes long. There is nothing wrong with those numbers, but if your going to have a very long film, you want to get the pacing right. The longer you go, the greater the risk that your story is going to wear thin.And sure enough, it did. 2049 has great visuals, decent enough music although I felt they didn't do as great a job on that front and overall the performances were good. The story, plot and writing was pretty bad and there is a jarring difference between this and the original. Which could have been avoided if they avoided bringing a conclusion to Deckards story. One could say it's about K's story as much as it is about Deckard. That is true in a sense, but the overall theme revolves around K's pursuit of Deckard, a theme that gets enforced not long into the film.Denis Villeneuve did a good enough job, and fair deuce for doing it. Cause trying to live up to the original can't be easy. I think with a better script, a better story they could have truly gone places. But they restricted themselves into doing this story, and that's a damn shame.And I think Blade Runner 2049 gets it all wrong as well when it comes to 'themes' of the original movie. This isn't a standalone film. It is a sequel, so comparisons have to be made to the first film. In the first film, you didn't have any major villains. Even the replicants were not 'villains' themselves, but simply survivors trying to live out their life.One could argue that Tyrell corp is the real villain, but is it? That was never the sense I got in the film - they are morally questionable, sure. But dastardly villainous? No... certainly not. That's what made Blade Runner great.Unfortunately, Jared Letho's character, Wallace, is every bit as traditional villain you can get. And that makes me sad. Hampton Fancher didn't do a great job on the script. It is definitely missing the wonderful influence of David Webb Peoples.Blade Runner is not the visual masterpiece I was hoping for. It doesn't live up to its potential, but its there. It exists.Whether or not to be grateful for it existing is up to you.",Blade Runner 2049

627,Metal_Robots,8 out of 10,8,14 May 2018,"I'm going to see it again soon and i'm not going to give any spoilers but I just went to see Blade Runner 2049 and it's the best performance that Harrison Ford has given (in my memory) in years, he acted as though he actually wanted to be in this and cared about it, unlike some other things he's been in recently ;)Vangelis's score has always been as important to me as anything else about the original, and in this one you hear echos of it through-out which is nice, although it's not as varied and memorable as Vangelis's I don't think it is trying to be and it does the job. The film is 100% in-keeping with the original, if you like that you will not fail to enjoy the new one.The film does nothing but add to the ideas of the original, and it remains every bit as subtle and moody while showing a genuine love and understanding of the original with nods to it that are never cloying or sicophantic. I don't want to say any more than watch it at the flicks if you want to see it, it's worth the experience and it's worth showing support for atmospheric sci-fi that respects the audience's intelligence.A worthy sequel to the original classic, but not perfect. Some things I think could have been left out and added nothing to the film...the prostitute, the Joi character (especially the three way sex scene - exploring K's sexual desire just felt awkward and unnecessary, at least the way it was done) and the reproduction Rachel. I can see why they were in there but they were just weakly-implemented ideas that were narrative cul- de-sacs I wouldn't miss at all, and without them the film might have been a bit more concise, I don't think shaving a few minutes off that mammoth run time would have done any harm.",Blade Runner 2049

629,bobhartshorn,A warning from the future,9,8 October 2017,"Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Hampton Fancher (in collaboration with Michael Green) get things off to a great start by dusting down an omitted scene originally intended for the 80's classic. Ryan Gosling's Blade Runner, Officer K (Dick?), discovers a long buried secret whilst on a 'retirement' mission outside the walls of future LA. This sets the wheels in motion for a gripping, highly intriguing 2 hours 63 minutes of hallucinogenic dystopian wet dreams, as Gosling hunts for the hunter - Rick Deckard, who has been missing for 30 years...So, how far have we come between 2019 and 2049? Well, the mash-up of all things vintage and cyber-punk have been aggressively separated out, finding the former unceremoniously tossed over the city wall to wilt and die in the misty post apocalyptic wilderness. The latter's underclass are forced into the Soylent Green over-crowding of Gosling's dead-end high-rise habit, leaving the overlords to bask in their sleek minimalist creature comforts behind closed doors.The rich/poor divide is breathtakingly realised courtesy of perfectly nuanced art direction (think Gattaca meets Brazil) and Roger Deakins' achingly beautiful DP work. The lighting, design and colour schemes deployed in the perfectly timed build-up to Officer K's face-to-face with you-know-who, has to rate amongst one of the best directed sequences I've ever seen. It's almost like watching the greatest moment Kubrick never made.Benjamin Wallfisch & Hans Zimmer's hammering Vangelis on steroids soundtrack feels less like music and more the organic hyperventilating of the gloomy Metropolis it supports. In fact – and I do mean this as a compliment - it's sometimes difficult to tell where (outstanding) sound design ends and music score begins (and vice versa).OK, that's the gravy. But what really make this outing so enduring are Villeneuve & the writers' commitment to telling a story with characters and themes that are well worth your time. The ideas and threads presented in Ridley Scott's masterpiece and PKD's original source material are built upon quite substantially, juggling elemental symbolism (snow, rain & seawater equating life, death & rebirth) with the big existential questions of what it means to be human and the tragic disconnect that intervenes.Whether it be by design, social-standing, physical-handicap or grim circumstance, every single character here - Gosling's perfectly muted, curiously Roy Batty attired, drone law-enforcer, Ana De Armis' sweet & tragic hologram Joi, Robin Wright's gutsy police chief Joshi, Harrison Ford's meaty, bladey, big & besty Deckard etc – is a slave. Like the original, no one here is in control - not even boo-hiss villains Wallace and his tearful hit-woman, Luv (played superbly by Jared Leto & Sylvia Hoeks respectively). Like everyone else, they too are manipulated by the puppet master society that has been allowed to grow around them, a dark warning from the future if ever there was one.Any negatives? Whilst I honestly can't think of a single scene that shouldn't be there, some moments could do with a trim as Leto's scenes do tend to ramble on a bit. The action too, whilst still sparing, adheres more to the crowd-pleasing variety this time round, with the finale going a tad too good-guy vs bad guy/damsel-in- distress for comfort. That said the fantastically skilled Villeneuve's work behind the camera insures it always remains as credible as anything else he's ever done involving punch-ups and explosions.The pace, like the original, is sedate and deliberate, the mood, a mix of oppressive brooding and melancholic bewilderment. Several passages enticingly emit the same kind of foreboding and dread normally found in the best horror movies, and the outcome retains the same downbeat ambiguity as before. The final moment, is perfect.Was this sequel necessary? I thought it would be nay, but I'm happy to say it's a yay! This Blade Runner may share ticks and traits lifted from its predecessor - and it's too soon to say if it will go on to achieve the same reputation as Scott's signature movie – but thanks to the artistry and craftsmanship of Villeneuve and everyone else involved, the goods have turned up freshly minted with a personality all its own, delivering a tale that resonates loudly with the here and now. It deserves your attention. 9/10.",Blade Runner 2049
630,jgeorge4,Tired of the Hollywood Hype Machine,5,8 October 2017,"I made sure to re-watch the original the day before we saw 2049. I can't imagine how lost or uninterested an audience member must have been if they've never seen the first installment.I can write a review conveying how shockingly slow and dull this movie is, but it looks like there are plenty of review writers who have already done that. Yes, there are some occasional brilliant scenes and cutting edge sci-fi, but for the most part,""excruciating"" is the word that comes to mind.For me, however, the real issue is I am tired of the hype machine. The last three movies I have seen in the cinema this year are Planet of the Apes, Logan Lucky, and Blade Runner. Each and every one was lavished with stellar reviews and praise from IMDb users, Metacritic reviews, and various magazines and websites. All three were terrible. I am sick and tired of the phony reviews and the complicit media trying to prop up the movie industry, and will now be much more skeptical before rushing to the cinema to spend my hard-earned money.",Blade Runner 2049

It seems that it was overdone in the process of invention of ""the deep meaning"" and the long and quite boring pathway of that process' revelation. On top of that, even though B. Wallfisch demonstrated quite an effort to rediscover the atmosphere of the original Bade Runner, there is no magic of Vangelis in this movie. Nada.

Even though this nonsense is over two hours longs - what little I could comprehend of this movie wouldn't hold the attention span of a 20 minute midday soap opera.The visuals are great and otherworldly but for some reason that seems to give every single person in shot a permission slip to talk really slowly, to not impart any information, to talk in a whisper and to leave 20 second gaps between everything that's said while staring at each other expressionless.The story seems to me, android cop whose job it is to track down and destroy the old androids - finds cause to think that one of the androids managed to have a baby. Queue the world powers being interested in that, and him suspecting that it might be him. Surprise surprise its Harrison Fords and the hot robots from the last movie, and its not him but some weirdly simply whispering woman who he interacts with for about 2 minutes halfway into the movie.Absolutely nothing is explained - as the entire movie is just utterly laden down with its own sense of self importance, and unspoken meaning. As far as I can see, for both this movie and the original - The only redeeming aspect of any note - is the fantastic visualisation of a futuristic city which shows Asian and American culture clash in some rainy dirty downtown of the future. Also the sound is very good. Take those two things out of either blade runner and you would have absolutely nothing of any consequence.",Blade Runner 2049
634,gregoryblanch88,"Worthy in every respect, possibly superior to the original",9,30 October 2017,"The tapestry of science fiction is deeply imbued with challenging ideas and alternative viewpoints, yet so few movie adaptations have done justice to the genre. Most prefer space opera as embodied by Star Wars, and while I greatly enjoyed Star Wars there has been a disappointing lack of films exploring the more thoughtful side of SF. A side where laser cannons and deflector shields play only minor roles. The original Blade Runner was one of the exceptions.As a fan of the original, I came prepared to be disappointed. I wasn't. Underlying virtually every scene was a reverence for the original, while both the cinematography and storytelling broke new ground in a masterful balancing act.Ryan Gosling was an excellent choice, portraying the muted emotions of a replicant while exhibiting an underlying origin angst. Harrison Ford clearly enjoyed his reprisal, though the question of his replicant status remains ambiguous. Supporting actors such as Robin Wright and Edward James Olmos were excellent, the weakest being Jared Leto in another ""evil genius overacted"" moment. Jared please stop playing bad guys, it's just not working out.The combination of striking visuals and glorious sound created just the right atmosphere, eschewing the overused action sequence for a more nuanced sense of foreboding.It's better to see the original first, although Blade Runner 2049 stands on its own as a masterpiece, and probably the best sequel ever made since Terminator 2.",Blade Runner 2049

But seeing the director's last movie masterpiece, ""Arrival"", I knew to expect that. Seeing the 3 short films featured on YouTube was fun as well. As a fan of the first Blade Runner movie, I liked the way this movie cleverly keeps Deckard's true identity a mystery. All the cast members do a fine job, though it would have been fun to see the director's original choice to play Wallace, David Bowie, in that role. I saw the movie in it's regular format, and because of it's length it is not a movie I would run out the next night and see again. But I hope to see it next time in an IMAX theater.

636,PradoCedric,An iconic masterpiece for a sequel to surpass the original,10,8 October 2017,"Truly, Denis Villeneuve has created a astonishing and an iconic masterpiece that really lives up to the original Blade Runner while making this film to be a new classic and indeed Villeneuve shows a bombastic direction just how he did to his other films such as Sicario and Arrival. While the performances of every member of the cast particularly Robin Wright as well Jared Leto is impressive, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford really stand out as one of the best performances being delivered.Another great quality being displayed towards the film is the excellent cinematography masterfully crafted by Roger Deakins in which a long awaited Academy Award is just within his hand as well the brilliant and nostalgic musical score wonderfully done by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch while maintaining Vangelis' original musical thematic legacy.But what really surpassed it all is the colorful visual effects that will be at par with other great movies with excellent visual effects such as Avatar, Gravity, Hugo, Life of Pi, The Matrix and The Jungle Book 2016 live-action remake.Overall, all these great qualities being mentioned will be no doubt consider Blade Runner 2049 as the best movie of the year as well a classic to be remembered with in decades to come.",Blade Runner 2049
637,nirome,When the sequel bests the original,10,24 April 2019,"As incredible as this may be, this is one of the few cases in which a sequel proves to be more engaging and effective than its predecessor. Being Blade Runner such a wonderfully brilliant visual spectacle as it is, it never, regrettably, reached those same heights for me in the story department. Ridley Scott, as I said in my review of that film, concerned himself more with the visuals than with achieving an engaging human story. This is not the case here with Villeneuve's picture. This time around we actually get to know more about the replicants, what they feel and their ultimate purpose in this world. The sequence in which K visits the Memories creator is especially revealing in that respect.
But let's get into the meat of it. The events take place 30 years after those in Blade Runner and, after the bankruptcy of Tyrrell Corporation and the banning of the remaining Replicants on Earth, the world is on the verge of economic and ecological collapse. That's when Niander Wallace enters the picture, taking over Tyrells' empire and avoiding famine thanks to his advances in synthetic farming. He also revamps Tyrell's Replicant programm, introducing models that are completely complacent and obedient to their creators. And here is when Ryan Gosling's character K comes in. He's a Replicant Blade Runner, who hunts down the remains of Tyrrell's old and scattered progeny, and, in the course of one of his investigations, he stumbles upon a secret that could shake the very foundations of the society he is a part of.
And that's when things get really interesting. There's so much more meat to this story than to that of the original Blade Runner, thanks in part to a very nuanced and engaging performance by Gosling. He really shines here and his, at first glance, cold and unattached approach to the character, turns out to be a protective shell that the character has built around him to protect him from a human environment that, as seen in several scenes of the movie, is clearly hostile towards him. His relationship with is Virtual Reality girlfriend Joi is especially endearing, and gives the character a much needed human touch, made all the more heartbreaking after she is destroyed. As per usual with the Hollywood mainstream, the production values of this movie are off the charts; production and costume design, beautiful photography by Award Winning Roger Deakins, a resounding marvel of a soundtrack by Zimmer and Wallfisch, closely matching the work of Vangelis for the first movie and, all in all, a very engaging story with the visuals to match. The story does have the advantage of a few twist and turns in which the character of Deckard, (a more confident performance by Harrison Ford than in the first movie), has a mayor role to play and the introduction of another main character, Wallace's right hand Replicant, Luv, that ends up being a tragic addition to the story. Well acted throughout and an astounding cinematic achievement in all regards.",Blade Runner 2049

639,gatsby601,When a Blade Loses It's Edge.,7,14 October 2017,"Beautiful and empty Bladerunner 2049 is the needless squeal to the 1980s classic.Set 30+ years after the events of the first film we meet Ryan Gosling continuing in the Bladerunner tradition of shooting robots. Along the way, he discovers a great secret that might change the social order of a world that is made up of humans and they're purpose built slaves.All of that was covered in the first 20 minutes of the film by the way. Skip ahead to the 3rd act, grumpy Harrison Ford shows up and, well, that's about it.Leaving the theatre my wife and I tried to decide just why Bladerunner left us both feeling so indifferent to it's existence. She had never seen the first film, I had, but our feelings were the same. Bladerunner is great to look at and I appreciated the nods to the original, but, it became quickly apparent our apathy stemmed from the fact nothing much happens in this movie.Office K's (Gosling) investigation into a missing person moves at snails pace and none of the people we meet along the way are as interesting as the scenery around them. One example is Wallace (Jared Leto) the new Tyrell and the main villain of the film. His speeches are dull and only go to serve the plot, he leaves all of his serious evilness to his sidekick while he stays home sporting a handicap which must be a desired physical affectation considering how easily it could be treated in his time.The main theme in both Bladerunner movies is one day the slaves will cast off their chains and be free. Sure, there's stuff about love and self-awareness but these are side issues that have been explored elsewhere to better effect. The main focus of 2049 is humanity needs an indentured underclass to do its heavy lifting and either you are for it or against it and that is a pretty thin premise for a movie this long.Late in the film Officer K sits on a deck chair staring out over an irradiated city. He looks like a man lost, not knowing where to go next. This moment is the perfect metaphor for Bladerunner 2049. All of it's surprises are revealed too early on leaving both the audience and characters to mull over the same obvious of choices for the rest of the movie.A wasted opportunity.",Blade Runner 2049

It's sad when so much effort (and money) has obviously been expended to create such a beautiful dystopian world. This film was far less comprehensible than the original Blade Runner, and that movie was problematic at best. The whole premise of androids indistinguishable from humans is a bad joke. Humans at their most brilliant will never, ever be able to create something as complex as a real human being. The premise goes downhill from there. One of the central questions in this movie was ""Who's a real human and who's an android?"" You've got to be kidding me. No android will ever come close to humanity.

643,rs403404,"Run, even sprint, to see ""Blade Runner 2049""",10,14 October 2017,"Denis VilleneuveThis is a name to look out for. Sicario and Enemy are two fascinating films. Further, in the last two years, he has managed to make two sci-fi classics.Think of films like The Day the Earth Stood Still, Planet of the Apes, 1954's Godzilla, and even Pixar's WALL-E, each in its own way held a mirror up to the human condition. In a similar vein, last year's Arrival delves into the potential breadth and depth of communication. Now we have Blade Runner 2049, a movie about what it means to be human. A movie smart enough to ask the questions and also smart enough to know these clear questions usually have no clear answers.In the year 2049, humanity has found a new form of slavery. The ability to make lifelike people except with enhanced strength. These people will be called replicants. Sometimes replicants will go rogue and that's when a blade runner is called in. Blade runners hunt rogue replicants.One of these blade runners is K (Ryan Gosling). He is tracking down replicants and finds himself diving down the rabbit hole left by the first movie. However, it's handled in a creative way giving you some surprise when you realize it's going that way. One of the characters is K's girlfriend who is a computer program. You might think that means she isn't real, but if she's not real does that mean the replicants aren't real either? She could be just as real as a replicant just without a body. These are just some of the ideas thrown out in the first act of the movie. Additionally, throughout this movie's over two and a half hour running time those ideas will not stop.I won't dive into the story anymore, but it is really secondary here. That's not to say it's not engaging, because it is incredibly so, but the movie revolves more around the questions of what is humanity and what does it means to be human. Therein lies the heart of this film.1982's Blade Runner created a fantastic world, but I found the story extraordinarily dull. Nevertheless, BR 2049 takes that world and explores it in all the logical ways it should. Ideas brought up in the original are fleshed out here. Further, as is often the case, asking the question is more powerful than answering it. This is what Ghost in the Shell missed earlier this year.Blade Runner 2049 is one of those rare sequels I enjoy better than the original. I have no problem calling it one of the best sequels ever made.The question of whether or not it will be more respected than the original in 35 years will be an interesting one to see answered.",Blade Runner 2049

There is no need to spend time on it.The story is shallow and the main plot is nonsensical. Apart from the fact that ""failure of the ecosystem"", the plot is based on, means shake and bake death to all life on Earth, the plot tries to work around some quite primitive motifs as the main plot. While original pondered love, egalitarianism, humanity and life itself, 2049 deals with obedience, duty, dying for a cause and procreation, and as a cherry on top, there is a healthy dose of mindless sentimental sadism.I just wonder under what pressure the screenwriters, directors and others are to make such cr*p?

I found the long, slow, contemplative nature of much of the movie to be very fitting, and even exhilarating in the sense that it wasn't rapid-cutting superhero trash.Unfortunately, there are also a few flaws. The narrative has some carelessly convenient jump-aheads, and some plot holes or story logic problems.

Not as imitation, but likewise, as almost a separate character of the story. You can't do this kind of story-telling, visually, in a 90-120 minute film. So, to me, the length of the film was about perfect! One thought in my head, just as in the original Blade Runner, was that machines (non-organic life-forms, like the Replicants) may indeed have a 'Soul' (if humans indeed have one?) The other thought I had was that every life, whether organic or synthetic, is so unique and precious. This was the message that I got from the action/plot/story...Thought that all the cast was wonderful. As Harrison Ford's character came in at the late minutes of the movie, I can say that as 'K', Ryan Gosling carried his part and the main plot of the film very well! Am so ready to see this in the theater at least 2 more times... and buying the Blu-ray (with many extras - one hopes!)Simply a worthy and beautifully crafted sequel to the original classic! And I say this as along time fan of Ridley Scott's 1982 film, and of the novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) it was based on, by that long gone genius writer, Philip K. Dick.... Just go and SEE THIS MOVIE - SEE IT TODAY!!!",Blade Runner 2049
648,jezfernandez,So . . . slow . . .,2,31 August 2019,"Here's the biggest problem with BR2049. Everything . . . happens . . . so . . . slowly . . . And I do mean everything. In one scene, K goes to look for something hidden. The audience knows it's going to be there (it's so blindingly obvious) but *man* does it take him an age to get there. It's not even slo-mo. Practically every scene involves a character taking forever to walk somewhere or even get a sentence out. It echoes the interminably long silences of Gosling's Drive, except that Drive was actually interesting. Villeneuve even holds static shots for *way* longer than necessary.Okay Denis, we get it; this movie is pensive and cerebral. That's fine, but it doesn't need to be boring. And boring it is. Yes, it deals with issues of identity, purpose and love, but its 2hrs 45mins running time could have *easily* been trimmed to just 2 hours.BR2049 is both pretentious and dull; that's a deadly combo.",Blade Runner 2049
649,ociopia,When there is no hope,10,23 October 2017,"In the original Blade Runner, which was wonderful, Harrison Ford was really just an affable dick, a sort of monovision hired killer cop who slowly came to question his job. My sympathy was not with him but with the replicants he assassinated. And I was mesmerized by the tone and the visuals, dark and filled with pathos.Jump 35 years and our world is closer to this awful dystopian vision, run by heartless corporations, our planet beginning its death throws. It isn't hard to jump another 35 years and see us arriving somewhere bleak. Several times I found myself thinking that I'm not sure this future would be a world that would be worth living in at all. Yes, we are adaptable, to our triumph and sorrow, and we can throw out quality of life on a dime if we must. But must we?The new Blade Runner keeps the tone, which is probably the most important part of this series and of Dick's book, somber, sorrowful, hopeless, bleak, depressing – this is no joy ride. These are stories about the search for and discovery of something that the central character must have, though they don't even realize they are on a search, but they are. They live in a world with no justice, kindness or hope to it or about it, so what's left, the search for their own humanity, which is ultimately what gives any life its meaning.The plot is excellent. I won't go into it. There are great performances by Gosling and de Armas but especially by Sylvia Hoeks, who is fabulous in her ability to be dispassionate and intense at the same time. She is a great villain with dead eyes that cry. Gosling is stunning as always. I felt he actually held his face in a specific way, erasing how sexually appealing he is and replacing that with a ""lost, innocent Haley Joel Osment in A.I. quality"" that just knocked me flat. Gosling is a fabulous actor. I love how still he can be and then just erupt. Scary.De Armas is lovely and convincing. Wonderful to watch. There is an extraordinary scene where she melds with a ""real"" person in a way that is mesmerizing. I love Ridley Scott. Just love him. So many of his movies are my favorite. I don't know how Denis Villeneuve did it but he created a fantastic movie with the right everything, every bit as good as Scott's original vision but making this his own. I've never seen a movie he directed but he's obviously a master.The soundtrack can't be overstated for its impact. It's a screeching, scathing scorch of harsh rotting industry, like a dragon machine in death throws, loud loud loud. Go see it in a big theater now.",Blade Runner 2049
650,gogga1011,One of the worst sequels ever,4,6 January 2018,"This is actually not a sequel of Blade Runner, this is just a boring streched story about androids (""replicants"") packed into something that was supposed to copy the visuals and the atmosphere of the first movie. But director Denis Villeneuve is not at the level of a Ridley Scott, he is far away from his league and it is visible in every shot. Nor a script is worth mentioning because the whole story of this movie can be summarized in just half an hour of normal video. Everything is predictable, boring and deliberately slowed down to the maximum, as if the director made this for himself and not the wide audience. Compared to this misery, the first Blade Runner
is a masterpiece in which Harrison Ford (opposed to a rather unconvincing, pretentious Gosling) carries a film that still looks like a superb artwork with unmistakable atmosphere, scene and music, linked to an interesting story. So I'm pretty disappointed with this movie because I really did expect a much, much more. Gave it 4 stars just because of old Ford and that famous title. But this should be called ""Bored to the death"". Wish I didn't spent that 2 and half hours watching this.",Blade Runner 2049

Lots of spacey sets and art-direction--just a set-up for the next chase scene or battle scene. Made by/for the Video-Game generation. I wonder if any people working on this film ever actually read any Philip K. Dick.
And whats the point of the ""epic"" battle scene near the end where the flying car is sinking in water and the 'hero' gets to strangle to evil woman person/android/robot--whatever underwater?

652,eden-rabatsch,Balde Runner 2049 extends the original vision,9,5 October 2017,"After the farce of two cinematic disasters coming from the Alien Universe in recent years, it was with great trepidation that I watched the extension of Ridley Scott's other great work, Blade Runner. Can I just say: In Denis Villeneuve, I trust!!! Villeneuve does what only the most assured filmmaker can do, especially when playing in someone elses sandbox, and that is to not overplay his hand. The film grammar, world look and film score are all echoes of the original work. Where Villeneuve extends the reach of the work is in the storytelling: though a sequel, it is an evolution of the themes of the original. Where the first film examined what it meant to be human, this film looks at what defines Life, sentient life, itself. The film opens with an expository scroll down and then the introduction of ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) who we know within the first minute is a new type of replicant who hunts down older models, the Nexus models once built by Tyrell. These new replicants created by Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) are a different breed. After the various insurrections, Replicants were banned till Wallace proved he can make them with no free will, they will follow any order. It soon becomes apparent that something else is at play and a greater mystery unfolds with the eventual collision between the events of the original Blade Runner and the new world. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. He is one of the two or three greatest visual storytellers working today. He is helped on every front by the interesting script which is written by Hampton Fancher who wrote the first script for the original Blade Runner before being famously replaced and Michael Green who has a mixed filmography of great films and complete disasters. Here we have storytellers who embrace the fundamentals of the first work but resist just telling the same story and have mapped out similarly intriguing territory. The film looks stunning under the eye of Roger Deakins, simply the finest Director of Photography there is. He has chosen a red, murky palette which mimics the dust storms which swamped Sydney, Australia in 2009 and this gives both a taste of ecological disaster and a nod to the strong choices in the original. The cast is very good across the board. Gosling who has often come across as not quite human, is perfectly cast as a replicant. However, much like Ford in the original he struggles at times in selling the pathos of his character. Ford, on the other hand, is great as the world weary Deckard. The Fordrennaisance continues as he seems to embrace his newfound maturity and freedom. The main scene stealer is Ana de Armas, who plays Joi, an Artificial Assistant who uses holograms to communicate with her owner. The rest of the cast are very good from Jared Leto to Robin Wright but the unfair comparison is to the original Blade Runner where everyone was magnificent. Throughout the film, we see examples of technology aping the human experience from dumb holograms to AI's like Joi, to replicants and they all seek something more. The film tries to define what it means to be alive: to be organic and to be able to reproduce. But, more than that – to be human is to be in awe of the Universe. To love and to cry and to be lost in the majesty of the cosmos. A machine is incapable of this. To illustrate this, Villeneuve will often show the technology on the edge of an evolution to a higher scale of consciousness and at that point it will often interact with the most primal of materials: water. Whether rain, tears or in the end scene, snow, it is at these junctures that humanity is expressed, even if only in that moment. It would be remiss to not talk about the ending. Scott invented TechNoir which borrowed the tropes of a detective novel and set them in a cyber future and that is the same here. K wonders whether he might be of a new breed of replicant, one organically reproduced, not made and in a mirror of the first the evidence for and against this conjecture hinges on the artificial memories of the replicants. I do find it more than interesting that the final scenes have both snow falling on a character and being created in a memory lab simultaneously. The implication meaning that there might be more to K then we are originally lead to believe.",Blade Runner 2049
653,almanac-39178,Hated it,1,3 March 2018,"I was so looking forward to this film. But the storyline is weak. Gosling is awful. Harrison Ford texts it in. Even the special effects lack solidity. It's like watching a series of cutscenes from a video game cobbled together.The objectification of women is off the scale. Maybe the makers thought this film would only be watched by heterosexual males, but come on! It got to the point where I wanted to put a brick through the screen.There's none of the depth and pathos of Ridley Scott's original. Hugely disappointing.",Blade Runner 2049
654,NormanCroucher,That rarest of beasts - a superior sequel,9,23 October 2017,"Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' is a much beloved cult classic that I've never particularly warmed to. I have embarked upon many rewatches over the years in the hopes of finally 'getting it', but its plodding pace and dreary characters always defy my desire to positively reassess it. Yes, it is a beautiful looking film with rich themes and ideas, and an intensely rendered climax, but it all rings rather hollow as a viewing experience. 'Blade Runner' clearly suffered from a string of production problems and on-set tensions, so much so the director never quite felt he got it right and continued to tinker with it years after its release. As a non-Blade Runner enthusiast, I approached its sequel with zero expectations and found that it far surpasses the muddled ambitions and achievements of the original.Director Denis Villeneuve architects some of the most visually stunning images I have seen from a director currently working today and absolutely equals the beauty of Scott's original. From his rich compositions of the dystopian vistas to his blocking and framing of individual scenes between his actors, every shot is like a living and breathing painting. The fully realised imagery is hypnotic in its gaze and tactile in its design, while any traces of the surely Oscar- worthy VFX get lost in the haze of Roger Deakins' exquisite cinematography. This is pure cinematic spectacle that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible with the best sound system available to do justice to the incredible sound design and Vangelis- inspired score.Of course, '2049' is not only about the kind of high brow artistry that makes film buffs blush. The material wants to be more accessible to a broader audience and, without pandering or dumbing down, allows room for some bone-cracking confrontations that make you feel every impact. The violence here hurts, much in the way Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty made it hurt for Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard last time around. With that noted, it's important to recognise that this is not a blockbuster of set-pieces. All the action is an organic extension of the story and never feels contrived, with the slight exception of the climax where the grandiose plot basically apexes with a slugfest between diametrically opposed replicants. It is well done and viscerally thrilling but feels frustratingly routine for a film that has been, until that point, anything but.In terms of story, '2049' makes the right call in not trying to replicate the narrative beats of its former, and instead presents a new story with its own central mysteries and original characters that work on their own terms, while retaining the thematic essence of both Philip K Dick's source and its subsequent 1982 adaptation. We also get a genuine detective story this time, which requires its protagonist to engage in some actual detective work - following leads, gathering clues, figuring out what the hell is going on - and it takes its sweet time to do so without ever dragging its heels. One of the other improvements '2049' makes upon its source material is the generation of a more compelling emotional story, both in terms of Ryan Gosling's romantic sub-plot with Ana de Armas' holographic girlfriend (which provides one of the most striking and remarkable love scenes in recent memory) and the haunting echoes of Ford's bygone relationship with Sean Young's replicant Rachel. Another element that just clicks is the casting. Gosling uses the quiet steely charisma he demonstrated in 'Drive' and imbues his protagonist with an intensity and laser focus that has just the right hints of humanity and existential angst so that we buy him as both a compliant replicant who hunts his own kind and as an android on the verge of emotional and metaphysical revelation. As for the original Blade Runner himself, craggy old Ford, it is a pleasure to see him acting like he actually cares about his material again. He delivers one of his most nuanced and layered performances in years and shows a range and depth that his 1982 performance lacked almost entirely. Maybe it's because he actually wanted to be there this time. Although I would seriously question Ford getting second billing after Gosling, considering 75% of the film takes place in his absence. When he does finally pop up it is (thankfully) not just in some glorified cameo appearance but as a key player in the story's denouement and ending. There is so much to admire about 'Blade Runner 2049' and on so many levels - epic in its scope; underscored by a thoughtful, intelligent script, which is told in a steady and methodical way; and brought to life with breathtaking beauty. Perhaps the most impressive thing about '2049' is that it exists at all. I have no qualms about saying that it is one of the best sequels ever made.",Blade Runner 2049
655,tokanac,"Like this review, the movie's too long and boring!",5,5 November 2017,"I went to see this movie with my mother, who told me that it was a sequel to the original movie, and it wasn't supposed to be as good as the original, which is to be expected; it's very rare that you find a sequel that is as good, if not better, than the original! However, I haven't seen the original, nor did I know what it was about. I didn't even look up the synopsis or read the reviews for this one before going to see it, so I went into it blind, not knowing what to expect.The movie started off rather slowly, and I don't mind some slow scenes if they've got a point to them, but there comes a point in time where you've just got to get a move on and not draw it out any more! The movie continued with slow scenes, which bored me out of my mind; I was yawning and wanted to curl up and fall asleep! However, the action scenes were good, and the mystery was there – it had me guessing as to who the child was, and I had two guesses, which were wrong. If I was paying more attention, I would have pin-pointed it as soon as I saw the adult version.That's the problem, though; the movie was so boring and slow that I switched my mind off, and I even missed some bits due to being distracted by something else!Some of the scenes were so drawn out and slow that it almost made me feel as if they were just plonked there as fillers; it made no sense as to why they were there! Also, the fight scene between Deckard and Agent K made no sense to me at all. I understand that Deckard would want to protect himself and his home, so it made sense that he would fight Agent K for a moment, but why draw it out? The fight sequence felt emotionless and too choreographed; there seemed to be no point behind it than to get testosterone out! One punch stop for an awkward moment another punch stop for an awkward moment This went on, though Agent K had stated his intentions. The fight continued to the entertainment/cabaret room, and it just felt like an opportunity to display holograms of various musical acts. The only comical point was when Deckard says that he loves the current song playing, but even that seemed out of place!The climax with Agent K, Deckard and that lady from Tyrell was an anti- climax! Sure, Agent K managed to kill her, but Deckard couldn't get out of those cuffs and help (either he couldn't, or he just wasn't trying hard enough)! It kind of feels unrealistic, too; the lady stabbed Agent K multiple times, yet he still had such strength and was able to kill her, no bleeding out in the water, and only died later? Dude!I was a bit confused during the movie as to what was going on and its purpose, and it was pointed out that it might be a movie that you have to see more than once to get a full grasp on what's happening. Like Catch me if you can.Is it really worth paying more money and seeing again, though? Would I recommend it to someone to see? Would I recommend a die-hard fan see it?I gave this movie five stars due to the fact that there was some mystery there and Harrison Ford was in it.I would recommend this movie, but to only be viewed once, and maybe after it's come out on DVD and the price has been dropped. Maybe I'm being too harsh in my review, but I wouldn't see it again; it's not worth spending all that money again. As far as the die-hard fans go, maybe give this one a miss and just re-watch the original.I just read another review, which make good points, and read that they're planning to make this into a franchise, meaning more movies. If that's the case, please don't! Most sequels don't live up to their potential and come near the first one, and this sequel was no exception. If they came up with a poor story-line and execution for this movie, what, or who, is to say that any other movie in this franchise will be any better?",Blade Runner 2049
656,pixiekatten,Blade Runner 2049; a highly disappointing and unnecessary sequel.,4,11 November 2017,"It hurts to write this review. It really does. Because this was one of the 2017 movie releases that had me filled with most anticipation and excitement. I could not wait to see it as I had spent many hours in the 80s and 90s re-watching the original Blade Runner with my older sibling. I could not wait to see the dark post-apocalyptic, and very magical poetry, from the predecessor being revived and brought to life yet again. But wow, what a let down. I see the 10/10 reviews on IMDb and all I can think is 'did these people really watch the same film' ... 'are they mistakenly reviewing the 80s film'??? Because Blade Runner 2049 is not worth 10 out of 10. It is so far from perfection, it is to be honest, a completely unnecessary sequel that I could have been without.I don't like to give away plots because in case you haven't seen the BR 2049 it might spoil what little intrigue this movie managed to whisk up. So I won't mention the first (and one of the few) 'hey, I didn't see that coming!' moments (which unfortunately comes along about 5minutes into the film and then it drags until the next). As the plot SLOWLY (oh so slowly) unfolds we are supposed to be wowed I guess. Gosling does his blade runner thing and stumbles upon a box, buried with some deep secrets. He then drives around (a lot) looking for clues and trying to crack this case. And the plot deepens, supposedly. So Gosling drives around some more. Talking (a lot of talking) to a few characters, many of them with such stilted acting that it leaves much to wish for. Seriously waiting for something to actually happen now! The original Blade Runner might not be classed as an action movie but there are a few very memorable fight scenes that has stuck with me for 30 years... Daryl Hannah posing as a doll for example - masterpiece and classic scene! We get none of that in the sequel. Instead we get Jared Leto rambling and babbling and making me completely losing the thread, and the interest. By now I am looking at my watch wondering how long there might be left of the movie. And this is only halfway in. Snooze. Turning to my fellow cinema goer, and whoops there you go, he is actually asleep in his seat. Not the work of a 10/10 movie I'll tell you that!So on it goes. More driving. More talking. More clues. We get a few explosions and minor twists and turns. The only saving grace of the movie is the soundtrack. It is messing with your head all on its own, going from tranquil to a kick in the gut in seconds. Loved it. The scenery is alright. But if you have seen the original film then this one doesn't really add anything new. There is none of the wow factors from seeing the dark and the grit, mixed with the futuristic Asian red light district feel, for the very first time in the 80s. They did it so well then. Now, well there's more neon lights and flying cars. But we seen those before...So what else can I say... The movie drags on. Harrison Ford jumps into the mix (too late but still a saving grace). We get a little bit of action. Jared Leto babbles some more. Futuristic car chase. The conclusion draws near. And yep there it is, revealed in a quick 'Gosling puts the puzzle pieces together in his head while we get fast-paced jump cuts of what we have already seen in the movie' - and done. 2hours and 44 minutes later the audience is served a lukewarm ending that screams Blade Runner part III. And that made me angry. The original movie ends with Rutger Hauer's beautiful monologue in the rain. Now that is movie magic. This, well this is the box office talking, or shouting in your face rather. 4 out 10. And best acting performance goes to the dog!",Blade Runner 2049

At first, it seemed slow, over-developed, but then as the film progressed, I began to appreciate the pace. This is one of those rare finds in science fiction films coming out of Hollywood, where the character is dominant to the action or special-effects. In fact, the special effects in this remake are nothing to gawk at. A very dark and morose setting for the Los Angeles of 2049, with some flybys with futurist cars, but overall, the story is what carries this film and Gosling's performance is touching. One feels his pain and desperation to find his relevance in a post-apocalyptic world, and I loved his association with his holographic computer, and their special bond. Overall, it's a long movie, but it taps on the doors of our inner emotion; and on both sides of the story, the human sense of entitlement to survive above all other species, including even those they created too well; and the Replicants, the engineered Ai cybernetics, who simply want a chance to become everything they can be.",Blade Runner 2049
659,SGuiliano1064972,Satisfying Sequel to a Sci-Fi Cult Classic,8,6 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 lives up to die hard Fans for the original 1982 Classic directed by Ridley Scott. I didn't see the original film until it came on HBO or Showtime when I was a kid growing up in the 80's. But, over the years, the movie strucked me and it grew. And after watching it over and over again on DVD since R. Scott's director's cut in 2007. There so many editions of it released on DVD and Blu-Ray. But I have the Directors cut. So let's get to it. This film is brilliantly directed by Denis Villenvenue. When I saw it, I wasn't expecting a fast paced action film. All the elements in the film was what I expected. Yes, it's CGIED up but you have to understand in the Blade Runner world things changed out there in LA. The film is slow paced and it grows through out to the end so the audience could get a sense of what's this new film's about. After 30 years, it's 2049, new Blade Runner Officer K (Ryan Gosling) tries to track down and search for Deckard (H.Ford). And that's it. Gosling's performance was good but while you're watching it, you immediately want to see Harrison Ford and Gosling couldn't hold the film for too long. Los Angeles is different. The setting and the cinematography is outstanding by Roger Deakins. Great acting by the supporting cast. Jared Leto is great as Wallace the new manufacturer of new replicants. Robin Wright is always good in any role she plays as a Police Chief of the LAPD. Actually who steals the film is Sylvia Hoesk, as an evil replicant that will do anything to get what she wants.Overall, the Film is great but you have watch it several times to get a better understanding and all the questions will be answered.

You will have to investigate a story very mysterious, that will be intertwined with their past, too.Let's start with the actors. Ryan Gosling, as ""K"", is the best part of the movie. Sademos that Gosling is one of the best actors of the film, currently. Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, also is the best part of the movie. It is a pleasure to see a character after 35 years.

The two are very uneven.""Nostalgia, a feeling of pity for the remoteness, the absence, the deprivation or loss of someone or something dear."" In this film they exploit this.

While the movie boasts of being the sequel of a cult classic starring Harrison Ford in the year 1982 & a Ryan Gosling as its lead actor, the movie was painfully slow. It starts off well but is unable to keep you entertained. Credit must be give to the background score by Hans Zimmer & stunning visuals. Ryan Gosling is sincere in his role as the Blade Runner. But there is little to hold your attention. Just when you think the movie is picking up some pace & is getting somewhere, the boring screenplay lets you down again. The screenplay is pathetic. The director does a good job in extracting some good performances, but is let down by the dreary script. This movie was so bad, it made us ""run"" from the theatre.

The world that Blade Runner immersed you in had never been done before on the Big Screen in such a visually stunning way. The Strange always under the fog, rain and mist filled streets, modeled after some post-Apocalypse vision of Tokyo; the vast ambient emptiness of a mostly deserted earth, left to the losers of the world, was a perfect setting for a film noir detective tale about engineered humans defying their masters and seeking both revenge for their shortened lifespans and humanity itself in this cold unforgiving world. Throw into this place an at the top of his game Harrison Ford, the stunning Sean Young and Daryl Hannah, and the over the top Rutger Hauer, having a blast as an insane Replicant who finds his humanity as he loses his life, and you created an all-time Sci-fi movie. We can't blame some for thinking that a sequel to a classic movie like this might make sense. So as a starting point, they decide to continue the story by supposing after 30 years, the star-crossed human and replicant lovers of the first story created a child (the good old fashioned way). Now we simply set lose a new Blade Runner tasked with unraveling the mystery of what happened to Rachel and Deckhart (and their offspring) from the first story? So, that becomes our first point of contention. Is the first story such a classic that it should have been left to stand alone? Is this plot worthy of the lofty status the first movie has been culted to? You have to decide that yourself. But to do so, you must sit through a 3 hour long movie that has a middle section that lacks the action of the first story. What is good in this movie? The attempt to capture the first movie's ambient world is first rate. There is scene after scene meant to stun you with majestic sets, exotic lighting, a decaying society, the colorful computer capitalism of Tokyo gone wild which combine into characters mostly devoid of morality. Everyone seems to be playing an angle. The special effects are almost perfect.What is wrong with this movie? That is a longer list. Ryan Gosling does not have the gravitas to pull off his roll. He stares vacantly and tries to say as little as possible. (This seems to be his trademark..some say he is channeling Steve McQeen). He does not display the cynical streak that Deckhart's narration in the first movie brought, and that device is not used here. Harrison Ford is a good five years too old for this role. He looks gimpy and it is laughable to see his grandpa-ass in a fist fight. The middle part of the movie, where Ryan Gosling tries to use detective work to unravel the riddle of what happened is too long and drags. There is an entire subplot regarding Gosling's girl friend that could easily be removed from this movie to cut down the time, and it would not have harmed the first story. (Ana de Amas is completely fine in her role, but 15 minutes could have been taken out of the story without her). In the end, there is a fight scene between the hero and the villain, but actually it's not the boss villain, and the movie ends without addressing the evil committed by that character. Thus the story ends, both resolved and not resolved.So despite the lush beauty of it's carefully crafted noir world, we get a muddled story that tried to touch all the bases of the first movie's renown, but without giving us an engrossing lead, a compelling love story, or a master antagonist to do battle with. The movie is too long, and the story, outside of it's connection to resolving the question of what ever happened to Deckhart and Rachel, delivers us no one new to really care about. If you liked the first movie, this maybe is all you need to be satisfied.",Blade Runner 2049
665,Danielpotato,Pathetic. Blade Runner for the new generation is as flawed as any other modern Hollywood movie.,4,5 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner was a film primarily about visuals, it was not surprising that in the early 1980s, Ridley Scott had no rival in the visual department. Blade Runner was mostly a visual movie, with little or no character development. It was a rich film about culture and visual aesthetics. The film was pioneer enough to influence several generations of filmmakers, but also about TV series, anime, among others about a futuristic look. In other words, the greatest strength of that film was to insert people in that visual. It is impressive, that Blade Runner influenced several generations, but Blade Runner 2049, does not influence anything. Nothing in the visual department captures the spectator's imagination. Denis Villeneuve fails roundly in this department, everything in 2049 is copied and recycled from other people's works. Here there is no imagination, but purely a copy. Blade Runner influenced, 2049 did not influence anything or anyone. I'll just say one example. The director of the film created a young Sean Young, using visual effects. Ironically, this has already happened in Terminator Salvation with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Another unnecessary sequel to a futuristic film with strong sci-fi elements made in the 80's.That brings up the question, who had the sad idea of creating a sequel to Blade Runner if you can not create something visually interesting and if the movie itself was a box office flop in 1982. The answer is simple, it's about the money. Nowadays in Hollywood, the studios are desperate to create franchises, which can attract people as if they were drug addicts, to go to the movies regularly. Warner Bros. already tried in 2015 with Mad Max Road Fury, and now tries to do with Blade Runner in 2017. It's all about money. Instead of trying to create something new, Hollywood studios try to create franchises, based on pre-existing films, because it's so much faster, easier and there's no financial risk. This is because movie budgets are constantly growing. And of course Blade Runner in its releases for home entertainment, whether on VHS, DVD or Blu Ray, has always had solid sales. Blade Runner was a hit on TV as well. Like The Shawshank Redemption or Fight Club, films such as Blade Runner were a box office flops, but hits in other media. People kept talking about these movies, even after they were released in theaters. You can not catch a lightning bolt twice in a row. This is because 2049 brings nothing new for people to talk about. It's a passable, forgettable film just for making money.This is why, Denis Villeneuve not only fails to create an interesting visual experience. As a film, Blade Runner 2049 crashes in all other departments. Not only that, but Blade Runner never needed a sequel. The story to tell was all told in the first film. Blade Runner never needed a sequel to expand the story, just as movies like Chinatown, L.A Confidential, or Casablanca don't need a sequel. In a sense, this film is almost a remake of the first, done in an amateur way in the sense of modern blockbusters. The film begins with an unnecessary setup between the characters Ryan Gosling and Dave Bautista. From that moment on, Denis Villeneuve began to put the typical gestures and mannerisms of modern movie scripts. I say of course, there has to be the unnecessary revolution/revolt against the system (the similarity that existed with The Matrix), but, unlike the original, everything here is in excess.
That is one of the biggest mistakes in the script of this film, is to transform a male film with a strong focus on sci-fi (sci-fi is not a genre that the female audience is interested) with useless dramatic elements. You know the same mistake that Denis Villeneuve did last year with Arrival, he had the audacity to do with the sequel of Blade Runner. Let's be clear, if I want a strong dramatic film, I see Schindler's List. If I want to see a male sci- fi, I see Aliens, Terminator or Blade Runner. Do not try to mix the two things Denis Villeneuve. The movie loses its tone. Not to mention, the silly lines of dialogue (and what you expected from the guy - Michael Green - who wrote Green Lantern), stupid I know. Despite that, the original film leaves room for the imagination about that universe and its characters (e.g: Jared Leto's character killing a replicant, just to make a point, or whatever). Who was the villain at the end of the first film, Deckard for doing his job or Roy Batty who killed people, however he wanted to live. In Blade Runner 2049, there is nothing to think about, everything is black and white.
This new film leaves no room for imagination, everything here is explained, as if it were an equation - at the end of the second act a character reveals to the character ""Joe/K"" that he was not the chosen one (as in many other sci-fi films) and the end itself is only a generic twist and totally out of context (as in Arrival) with a character that appeared only one scene (but do not worry about, the obligatory third movie is already being planned) in the original Sean Young's character was quite a while before the end of the movie. In contrast the film has totally useless scenes that only serve to increase unnecessarily the extension of the film itself.I'm not going to write anything else, about this useless movie, that comment on the final battle between the characters of Ryan Gosling and Sylvia Hoeks. She also knows Kung-fu and says stupid one- liners (""I am the best"" among many, or whatever). Trash lines of dialogue, we have here. To talk about the character of Sylvia Hoeks that does not reach the feet of Roy Batty. While in the original, the scene of the rain had a sense, because the character of Rutger Hauer wanted to live, this is why the scene is soon iconic. In this new movie there is one fight scene, just to look ""badass"". Once again, Hollywood had feminized a great and good villain into a woman to appeal to the female audience (say hello to Ghostbusters 2016). Not only that, the film treats women as sexual objects (the stupid hologram of the woman with pink hair), prostitutes or with violence. A film without its own identity, the film is not meat or fish. Incidentally, not even filmmakers know what they want.

Although I did like the design of the Spinner Car. Other then that, I wanted my money back. Sad, I was so looking forward too seeing this film. Was saddened by the overall story line.

668,MovieSoup,The film of the year so far.........,9,10 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is the best film I have seen so far this year. Normally a sequel is dreadful compared to its original brother and with this being the decade for terrible sequels and reboots, like Alien Covenant and Kingsmen 2, 2049 is actually great. This film is Gorgeous in the same way as the original and actually stands apart from the original in such a way as to be a completely different film. It tips its hat to the original Blade Runner but stands on its own two feet. The story is a continuation from the original set 30 years in the future. I will not ruin the plot for you in any way as you need to see this film. I will say that the plot does revolve around the same kind of themes that the original does however it's done in such a refreshing and creative way that it leaves you with a lot of questions. It Revolves around what it means to be human as the last one did but also throws in love, revenge, sacrifice and wraps it all up with stunning performances from all but one member of the cast. Gosling is the main protagonist and does an excellent job of portraying the is-he-isn't-he replicant ""K"". In most of his performances Gosling does give quite a robotic performance with a few choice parts of emotion. This usually is his acting MO but unlike some of his other films, where it doesn't work, the robotic acting he does in this film suits his character. The writing team obviously wrote K well and Gosling listened to them and made the character work. The scenes where he loses it and shows emotional sides are brilliant and really enjoyable. Also the love he shows for Joi in their scenes is really affectionate and believable. I don't usually like him but in this I have to say to was brilliant and really took me into his character and what K is feeling and thinking. Ana De Armas is great as Joi, as with Gosling she is amazingly adept at portraying the complexity of a self-aware AI hologram and you feel a connection to her plight of wanting to be as human as human can be. Robin Wright is great as the LAPD lieutenant as she plays a great supporting character who strangely enough is less human than the replicants are but is genuinely human.weird.Harrison Ford was the main focus of the films advertising and trailers however if you are looking forward to more Deckard you will be slightly disappointed. He is not in the film for very long and has little impact on the plot for the first 2/3rds of the film. While some people are b*tching about this and giving the film a 1/10 (which is a total di*k move) for not having Deckard be the main guy, I think it is refreshing to not rehash old characters to death. Deckard does advance the plot along and gives K something to hope for but K is the main protagonist and that is, in my opinion, a good thing. Jared Leto was boring as the ""villain"" in this film. His acting was terrible all of his dialog was weird and did nothing for me. His speech about angels was completely boring and did nothing to advance the plot and every time he was on screen the pacing felt slowed down. His whole character did not feel interesting and I was so underwhelmed. Luckily he is only in two scenes and his replicant LUV is a great character. She gives us a suspenseful, menacing, emotional antagonist who advances the plot well and is actually more human than her human boss. Like the first film the effects in this are beautiful. The use of CGI adds to the story and is very tasteful. The scene where Joi is trying to make love to K is a brilliant example of CGI adding to the story, honesty it is so good I was astonished at how real it looked. The use of colour is very well done as well. Brilliant cinematography, great use of a golden colour palette, honestly the effects department should be really proud, amazing work. The camera work is very interesting with great sweeping shots of the futuristic LA skyline and the First shot of the eye at the start really gets you interested in what's to come and is a unique way to start a film. I listen very closely to the music in films and I have to say that this is one of the best examples I've seen recently of music adding to a film a making the scenes special. The music in this builds suspense, evokes emotion and adds to the characters and their setting exactly the right way.The use of ""soundless"" music is used to great effect, giving you suspenseful scenes without any sound to add to the eerie feeling in the scenes. It is important to use music but sometimes lack of music can be just as important and creative. This film is a perfect example of a great use of music and the sound department did an awesome job.Overall this film the best film I have seen this year and while it does have a few little flaws. The pacing is slow in places, Leto's performance is not great and the nearly 3 hour running time is a hard ask for people with short attention spans. I think over all this film is really good and a testament to sequels being as good as their originals. As I said at the start this film is refreshing and tips its hat slightly to Blade Runner however Blade Runner 2049 is a great film in its own right. I urge you to go see for yourselves.",Blade Runner 2049

Yes both the first & this sequel have good sets, costumes, wardrobe, but that won't make a movie captivating on it's own.",Blade Runner 2049
673,vinnieboards,"Moments lost in time, like tears in rain...",5,6 September 2019,"I'm really sad posting this. I so wanted to love this film, I really did. But it didn't quite happen.There is much to admire about Bladerunner 2049. For starters, the cinematography is breathtaking. There are so many shots in this film that are staggering. As a viewing spectacle it is up there with the very best; it is a consumate work of art at times.Then there is the soundtrack. Some find it too loud and overbearing. I disagree with that view. The soundtrack pays fitting homage to Vangelis and adopts original and variations on his original themes. It could never match the Vangelis soundtrack but it comes mighty close. Unfortunately in the digital age there is a lack of quirkiness, rawness and bravado which made the analog original so timeless. It's a bit too clean, too well produced in comparison. But to be honest, as a standalone work it is superb. Sea Wall is a particularly good.However this is where my positive critique sadly ends. This film fails for me on a number of levels. Firstly, it doesn't move you like the original nor does it thought provoke either. When Roy Batty dies in the original film it is truly moving - the villain of the film ultimately values life to such an extent that he dies without taking out revenge on his persuer and nemesis. In this film, there just isn't that same depth or level of connection. When Joe dies at the end he goes out with a tame, almost pathetic whimper.The other main issue is that the plot takes so long to unravel over nearly 3 hrs. What started as intrigue soon turns into tedium. Gosling does a fine job in the lead role but this film is a good 40 minutes too long.Rightly of wrongly it's a sequel and therefore will be compared to the original. For all the gorgeous sets, camera shots and atmospherics, Bladerunner 2049 is no match for the groundbreaking original.Joi is an interesting character and was well acted but Wallace's henchwoman, whilst vicious, never reaches the unpredictable menace and ruthlessness of Roy Batty. Jared Leto as Wallace was intriguing but under used. And the CGI version of Sean Young's Rachel was clever but in my opinion, her addition smacked of desperation in the end. Deckard's introduction was so late and so brief that it became almost insignificant. Yet he is so pivotal to the storyline.Personally, I think the filmakers did a solid but underwhelming job with what proved to be an impossible task and they should at least be applauded for even attempting it. But to sum up, if the studio have designs on making another Bladerunner film, then I will quote the wise words of the late and rather great Rutger Hauer...Time to die.The film is a genuine work of art for sure, but is let down by a seriously tedious, slow plot line and a total lack of emotional depth.",Blade Runner 2049

Blade Runner 2049 now qualifies for that category. I remember the first time I saw Blade Runner (it was the Director's Cut) and I quickly lost attention, but then I learned that one must watch it multiple times to fully appreciate it. However, Blade Runner 2049 did not require multiple views for it to become an instant favorite of mine. Everything about it stayed true to the original film, from the music to the production design to the dialogue to the cinematography, as well as a slow pace, mild action, and unpredictable whimsy. It exceeded my expectations, which is why I have no problem with giving it a 10/10.",Blade Runner 2049
675,klheintz,Amazingly beautiful dystopian scifi,9,9 October 2017,"I have been a fan of Villeneuve's work since I saw Prisoners on a whim back in 2013 and, since then, I have made it a habit to see all his newer movies and have enjoyed each one. When I heard that he would be directing the new Blade Runner, I decided that I would allow myself to get a little bit excited because I knew, considering his newest films, that it would be a well-made film and a well-made film it is. The original Blade Runner from 1982 did not originally do it for me on the first viewing. I know that is the case for a good amount of people but after I gave it a second chance, I have found myself giving it a third and a fourth chance. Nowadays I have come to really appreciate the film for what it is. So, to me, Blade Runner 2049 was a film that I was tentatively excited for and it wouldn't have surprised me if it turned out terribly. But boy, was I wrong. Now I don't want to break into summary territory; anyone who wants a summary can easily find a more coherent and well put together synopsis than I would ever be able to produce. Instead of that, I will talk about my reactions to the film.This movie is gorgeous. Seriously. It is one of the most beautifully shot films I have seen in recent memory and I was blown away at the stark contrasts of color presented throughout the entire film. The striking shots and the use of only a few colors in any specific scene was a joy to watch. I want to sit through this film again just so my eyeballs can be exposed to the striking colors. No movie can go wrong when Roger Deakins is the cinematographer and if he doesn't get the Oscar this year after so many amazing films, I will lose all hope for the awards. For such a long film, the fact he can constantly keep the viewer enthralled with the scenes is proof of his mastery.Performance-wise, the actors in this film are at the top of their game. The cast includes: Ryan Gosling as K, the stoic Blade Runner; Ana De Armas as Joi, the hologram AI edition of a girlfriend; Sylivia Hoeks as Luv, the stone-cold assassin (who might not be as cold as you think); and Jared Leto as Niander Wallace, the terrifying psychopath who purchased the remnants of Tyrell Corp from the first film. Even old Harrison Ford as Deckard, tries in this film. Tries! They all give great performances and, in my opinion, Ryan Gosling knocks it out of the freaking park. His scenes with Deckard and Joi are some of my favorite scenes of any film and I look forward to seeing this film a second time.The music! How can anyone forget that iconic Blade Runner music? Maybe, like me, you can't recall any specific beat or tune but you must remember the weird electronic music that can only be described as ""the future."" I don't even know what to properly call that style of bass and synth; however, Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch sure found a way to recreate something similar. The pounding bass that shakes the screen (as well as your seat), screeching electronic sounds that make your ears hurt, and the combination of the two in a way that only increases the tension in the film are all things you should look forward to if you see the film. Anyone with a decent sound system should rejoice.Now that I have talked so much about all the things I loved about the film, I would be amiss if I didn't give a tad little bit of criticism. Certain parts of the film, while still adding to the film, aren't exactly necessary. I can't help but think that, if Villeneuve had only made a few small changes to the film, it could have been PG-13 easily. Blade Runner 2049 is not a ""Hard R"" by any means and I think that if it was made with a lower rating in mind, it could have reached a much wider audience. Overall, the depths to this film is insane. The amount of hidden meanings and details throughout this gorgeous movie elevates this film to masterpiece status. I think it will require multiple viewings, some discussion, and even some research to establish a proper understanding of everything going on. I expect my opinions on aspects of the film will change over time and I look forward to experiencing that.",Blade Runner 2049
676,eichler2,"Better than I had feared, not as good as I had hoped",7,6 October 2017,"I'm a huge fan of the original Blade Runner movie and the Philip K. Dick book it was based on, so it was with some trepidation that I went to see the sequel. But the film lived up to my expectations, even if they weren't all that high.On the plus side:The sequel does a great job of recreating the look, feel and grit of the first movie. It looks amazing.The soundtrack music also does a great job of imitating the first film's score, while also sounding more modern.The plot follows logically (sort of) from the first movie, but you don't necessarily have to have seen the first one to follow this one. On the other hand, the movie doesn't spoon-feed the audience, and I overheard a couple people at my showing who had no idea what was going on.The film raises a lot of thought-provoking, sci-fi type questions. Just like the first movie, a major theme is ""what exactly is real, and what rights do intelligent 'artificial' beings deserve""? Some of the new elements in this one seem like they could have come out of a Philip K. Dick story.On the negative side:The movie is waaaaaaaaay too long. I have a decent attention span, and even I thought the movie dragged. It seemed like half the film played out in slow motion. It made 2001 A Space Odyssey (another film I love, but one of the most deliberately paced movies of all time) look like a taut action thriller. They took an idea that would have made a good hour long TV show and stretched it out to nearly three hours. Way too long.The plot, what there is of one, is...kind of hard to buy into. Months ago I saw someone on a movie discussion group predict pretty much exactly what the plot turned out to be, and he was told by everyone else that his idea was ridiculous.The movie redefines what a replicant is, although the ones in this film are later generations than the ones in the first film, so I can kind of give them a pass there.Seemed like there was a gratuitous amount of female nudity. I'm not complaining really, it just seemed like most of it didn't need to be there.Overall I liked the movie. I'll probably watch it again when it comes out on Blu-ray. But it's not really the type of movie that the commercials and trailers are pitching it as, and I'm guessing there will be a lot of negative reviews from people who were expecting more car chases and fight scenes. There's not nearly as much action as the first movie.Oh, and it seems like the last half hour or so is designed to set up more sequels in the future. Which would be cool, but for God's sake pick up the pace on the next one.",Blade Runner 2049
677,TyJustice,"Enticing, thought provoking and intelligent.",9,6 January 2018,"Blade Runner 2049 maintains a steady, confident pace throughout and while some fans might have complaints about the lack of action and blood pumping thrills, it compliments the story to focus on a steady, deep narrative. Though a sequel, 2049 manages to tell it's own strong story that does not by any means depend too heavily on the original source material, but also refrains from deviating too far from the themes and tone that the original Blade Runner established. Ryan Gosling delivers an exceptional performance in the lead role as ""K"", and quickly gives you a character that treats the audience with a fascinating perspective and unique character.While a little over two and a half hours might seem a bit long for a film, this movie depends on the time length in order to build investment and emotion into the story and it does not disappoint in paying it off.

678,tom-43722,A strong film,8,14 October 2017,"If there's one thing The Force Awakens has taught me, it's that critics are not always reliable. Also shortly before I saw this movie, I saw it advertised on YouTube with the incredibly pretentious line ""The critics have spoken"". Considering most of them couldn't recognize a piece of crap like TFA when it smacked them in the face, I would take most of their reviews with a healthy pinch of salt.But does my lack of faith in critics mean they were wrong about this movie? Not necessarily. Having never seen the first Blade Runner, I can't comment on this as a sequel, only as a standalone film. And as a standalone film, I'd give it at least 8 out of 10. It didn't blow me away but at the same time, I couldn't find many problems with it. There were a lot of unanswered questions so it kind of feels like it's setting up a sequel - something that most Hollywood movies do this days which can be seen as a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the film and franchise - but it can also work on its own if you just take it as K's story rather than thinking about how it affects the overall franchise. Fortunately, this is easy to do since he's the lead.Ryan Gosling delivered a strong performance but there were times where I felt he was being a little too subdued. I understand that was part of the character as K, or Joe as he was later called, wasn't a very emotional man but it also made his burst of emotion when he was with Dr Stelline feel a little out of place. Not bad but I felt like it didn't have the necessary build-up of repressed emotion to result in that reaction. Ironically, the opposite occurred when his holographic wife/girlfriend died. If he was ever going to have a burst of emotion, it should have been in that scene which could have been the most heart-breaking scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was glanced over too quickly and Gosling didn't look nearly as pained by it as Harrison Ford looked when Rick Deckard was talking with Nianda Wallace, played by Jared Leto (who didn't have much screen-time but is very different in this movie than he was in Suicide Squad so the guy can act with the right direction), about his dead lover.Speaking of Harrison Ford, he was in less than half the movie so I spent a good chunk of it waiting for him to show up. When he finally did, he quickly overshadowed Gosling for the rest of the film. My favourite scene was Deckard's talk with Wallace. Deckard only had a handful of lines in that scene but I just had to look at his face to know how much the death of his lover and loss of his children pained him. He also had one of the greatest lines in the film ""Sometimes, in order to love someone, you have to be a stranger"" explaining why he hid his children rather than raising them himself. Finally, I liked his final scene where he simply put his hand on the glass as his long lost daughter approached him. No words were needed. They just let the moment speak for itself.I also liked Robin Wright's character, Lt Joshi. I don't think I've ever seen Wright in a movie before and if I have, she didn't leave much of an impression but she was likable enough to make me wish that she hadn't been killed off.Overall this is a strong movie. It's well written, directed and acted, particularly by Harrison Ford despite him not having as much screen-time as you might expect, but not quite good enough to make me a Blade Runner fan. However, I expect those of you who are fans will love it.",Blade Runner 2049

680,maverick-84924,Why the Hate?,9,22 January 2018,"Along with the usual suspects of 'paid off' reviewers & the like, the amount of hate towards the movie is somewhat baffling. I'm guessing either the reviewers expected a carbon copy of the original (useless, as the original is so much itself that any copy would be soulless) or a slap in the fast towards the original.Really? Piecing together the events of the original with some of the first movie's characters (Rachel's scene is unmissable) and heading in a twisting, turning direction that both beguiles and shocks seems quite appropriate for a sequel.The reviewers who have laid the hate on thick are either butthurt millenials who were offended by this continuation of what they no doubt describe as a 'retro, cult classic' or others who haven't even seen the original, read the book it was inspired by or lived through that particular cinematic timeframe.If you actually love Blade Runner for the genre-defining classic that it is, I heartily recommend Blade Runner 2049 without reservation.",Blade Runner 2049

Not only does that turn around not make any sense, it also robs the movie of any sort of dramatic tension, and renders the science fiction setting as obsolete. This is a shame, because the production value is high, and with a better script it really could have been something.",Blade Runner 2049
685,antialias11,Average movie...need not have been made.,5,11 November 2017,"***This will contain mild spoilers**Here's the good, the bad and the ugly on this movie:The good: I didn't mind the slow pacing of the movie. Hollywood needs to embrace more of this to create atmosphere and get the moviegoer immersed in the setting. This movie does so but sometimes goes out the other side. The 'computer girlfriend' was cute and some of the ideas involving her were interesting, setting the 'next level' beyond asking how human can replicants be: how human can software be? More human than human? There's a few nice nods to the original from the advertisements to the musical score to the recreation of the landmark look of the Tyrell Corp. building and some minor set pieces.The bad: Ryan Gosling just isn't a very good actor. He does his best, I guess, with what he got given. He's the pretty face du-jour and puts (female) bums in seats. That's about all there is to say about him. Not one of Harrison Ford's best performances, but he's alright. The main villain likes to drone on to no point and purpose. The female villain is even more pointless in her motivation. As antagonists go they come off as stereotypes more than anything. The CGI of the exteriors and interiors is OK.The ugly: The other female is no Daryl Hannah - even though they obviously tried to cast a lookalike. The rest of the supporting cast is weak/one-dimensional and some of the expositionary dialogues are downright cringeworthy - explaining things that *must* be known to the character being talked at to the point that they might as well be holding up a neon-sign with ""audience, listen up"". As for clichés: ""Give me your badge and your gun and you have 48 hours"". Really? Cameos: Edward James Olmos' cameo is unnecessary for...anything. A de-aged Sean Young hits the uncanny valley (just as the de-aged Kurt Russel did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2)While I applaud the boldness to forego the incessant fast cuts of other movies the director has no capacity for distinguishing between a shot necessary to build an atmosphere vs. one that is just ""O-golly-gee"". If they had taken out the latter the movie could have been cut by 30 minutes and would have been better off for it.3D - oh my. 3D is the bane of movies these days. Entirely unnecessary for this movie (I know of only one movie where 3D adds a stylistically logical element and that is ""Tron: Legacy"", where the computer world is in 3D and the real world is in 2D)The movie also lacks any sort of emotion. The director seems to think that putting a tear in someone's eye denotes deep emotion and will grip the audience. We see basically *everyone* in this movie shedding tears - and none of it touched me one bit (quite a feat!). There's no nuances, here. There's no small facial movements (like the great scene between Priss and Roy in the original where they talk with just their eyes). The replicants are more terminators than artificial humans when it comes to emotions. So are the humans, come to think of it.Conclusion: Worth watching? If you liked the original: Maybe. Just so you can say you've seen it and know why the original is a masterpiece (because it sure as hell is compared to this) Otherwise this is a movie you can easily skip.",Blade Runner 2049
686,drawnsupreme,Somewhat of a snooze fest.,4,25 January 2018,"I'll start off with the bad stuff. Ryan Gosling's character felt like a very boring, hollow, one dimensional character. It seemed as if there was no depth to his acting because he has the same goofy face throughout the whole movie. I understand that he's a replicant in the film and is suppose to be emotionless, but throughout the film, as he is suppose to build up a bit more emotion, his acting still remains mundane.This is also an extremely slow-paced movie, making it feel boring and drawn out. The director could have cut, shorten and removed so many unnecessary and pointless scenes to where we could have had the film be 2 hours or less in length.In addition, the editing is very sloppy towards the ending of the film throughout the timid action sequences. It felt as if those scenes were just copy and pasted together at the last minute. How could you have Harrison Ford's scenes be so sloppy? There was so much potential to make this a thrilling part of the movie but it ends up falling flat.Now for the good stuff. The visuals are very nice. The settings feel futuristic and I think it really captures the vibe of the original film, which is really important for a sequel to do after all these years. The story is also good enough to keep you watching and the themes are interesting if you're a fan of the sci-fi genre.Over all, I feel that the execution of the movie is what needed work.",Blade Runner 2049
687,rolfesam,This is How You Do a Sequel,10,7 October 2017,"This director is one of the best working in the business today and this is his best film to date. I can't believe the man managed to top Ascension and Sicario which are two of my all time favorite films of the last decade but leave it to the genius that is Denis Villeneuve to top himself in the most incredible ways. Denis Villeneuve's direction for this movie is impeccable and I am fully convinced that no other director could have handled the film and delivered it nearly as masterfully as he did and I would not be surprised if the Academy decided to honor him with (at the very least!) a nomination for best director. I'd be remiss if I did not mention the incredible performances by the amazing cast of the film. All around there were so many strong performances! The fact that a lot of lesser known actors were able to go toe to toe with the likes of Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Robin Wright, and Jared Leto (who are all at their best in years) is something to commend! In particular Sylvia Hoeks and Ana De Armas completely surprised me with just how good they were. Yes, this movie would be nothing without its stars, so with that I will go ahead and say that this is my favorite performance from Ryan Gosling since his role in Drive back in 2011 (which is six years ago, holy crap where has the time gone?). He does so much to display the reserved character of K. He plays the more reserved scenes with such subtlety that it genuinely caught me off guard just how much he was doing with so little, as well as capturing the more emotional scenes without it coming off as out-of-character or corny, which it very well could have been. Harrison Ford also is incredible in this movie! Really, this might just be the best performance of his entire career. There was one scene, near the climax of the movie, where there is a shot that lasts several minutes and Ford only says one sentence in the entirety of it, but was still so gripping because of the acting that Ford accomplished! With nothing more than posture and facial expressions! I would be horrified if Ford were not nominated for best supporting actor. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if he walked off with the award at the end of the night. However, despite how much I've built him up in this review don't go in expecting to see too much of Ford. This is Gosling's movie, and Ford does not show up until much later. Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks both play very good antagonists in the movie, and really bring the characters to life with their great acting. It goes a long way that, even though they are a little on the ""crazy bad guys"" side of things, they do have a very clear goal with a clear desired outcome and a logical reason to be doing what they are doing. There isn't any being-evil-for-the-hell-of-it moments. The audience understands the stakes that both of these characters have in the outcome of the story, and you can understand the motives behind their actions. This is such a refreshing thing to say in the age of Marvel movies, where the majority of antagonists are simply World Ending Baddies.The Mixture of practical and special effects in this movie are also worthy of applause, and that goes for both the artists that crafted them as well as to the actors in the film itself. They make every little piece of the world feel real and lived in. I will also roll the practical effects that the actors performed in the film itself, as both Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford actually physically hit one another(!!!) in their fight scene. This in itself really helped to sell the scene and demonstrates the actors dedication to the film as a whole.The crown jewel of the film though would have to go to Roger Deakins' cinematography. If this man does not win this years best Cinematography Oscar than the whole award is a farce, because I am not sure if I have ever seen a single film (since the films of Stanley Kubrick) that were this consistently stunning in every single shot. In most films there may only be 3-4 scenes where great cinematography was used but in this film there are only 3-4 scenes that aren't jaw dropping. The way that the shots are cut, the composition of each shot, and the way that many of the shots seem to linger and play out is nothing short than an example of moving art. Really I would say that the shots are so good and convey so much information to the audience that you could watch the entire movie without sound and the film as a whole would still be comprehensible and enjoyable and that is an achievement worth applauding. Overall I could go on for hours about every little thing I loved in this film (and in reality I have with people in my day to day life) but I absolutely do not wish to spoil this film for anyone so I will conclude by saying that this movie is a masterpiece. It is one of the best sequels ever made, it is one of the best science fiction movies ever made, this is one of the best movies of this decade and it is one that you need to go see for yourself.Or else this film may be lost to time, like tears in the rain.",Blade Runner 2049
688,vincent-malisse,slow sci-fi,7,5 November 2017,"The story advances slower than a snail on Valium, add the occasional booming ""noise"" they sent through the speakers (I'm guessing that was part of the atmosphere) and you end up with a pretty annoying movie. Looking past that, things clear up a bit. The futuristic world looks realistic, it's the future, without being too far ahead.Story wise, the movie has little to tell. Sure, there is your evil enterprise taking over or controlling the world in some way or another, but nothing you haven't seen before. Nothing disturbingly bad, nothing extraordinary either.The characters are for the most part fitting for the story, though I wish they would have developed some of the backgrounds a little more. For a movie that shows an overpopulated world, their are not many people passing the screen.The cinematography was what made this movie, the downfall of the planet combined with the high-tech holograms show a, in my opinion, realistic possibility of how our own future might look like.And of course, keep your eyes open for the details.

692,drgrozozo,It's a replicant.,5,13 October 2017,"Well, I tried to stay out of trailers and press and watch this with a clean slate.It is beautiful, great cinematography. Music isn't too shabby, tho it's no Vangelis either. Casting is solid, I like Gosling though the biggest impression on me probably made Bautista. Again.But the story... For some reason all modern sequels are not unique expansion based on established lore, but modernized replicas of what has already been a successful movie. Formula for writing sequel scripts in 2017 is - go to fan forum, read up everything people praise about original and stuff it into sequel then shake it, don't stir. And here's what this shake resulted with:Now the main guy is definitely a replicant, he's again stuck on artificial woman but she is now a hologram, he experiences the Dream but it's now a horse and not a unicorn... The main guy is also the main focus point for exploring the existential philosophy of an artificial life, the question that burdened our fallen angel, Roy Batty, so much. (This, however, is too prolonged, obvious and weak to be able to present the same emotional impact in 2017). The nasty, ""beat the crap out of you"", part of Roy Batty is delegated to some random woman serving the Creator on the position of Rachel. Luckily for the movie, after doing its job of rescuing Harrison Ford for the final scene, the philosophical part of Roy Batty this time dies quietly alone caressing the snow (instead of caressing the dove). My biggest fear that he'd die one scene before in the rain and recite some haiku warp of Rutger Hauers original dialog was averted. Points for taste there.It isn't too bad, it just have too many ""nods"" to original and too little of its own unique soul. It's a sad, modern replicant.",Blade Runner 2049

695,martin-807-452270,it's good but it ain't no classic.,1,6 November 2017,"Blade Runner, Blade Runner, Blade Runner.Now then: Blade Runner 2049.SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****I've been waiting to see this for years. Blade Runner is in my top ten films of all time and to prepare myself for this I re-watched Blade Runner again the other day.This new film has so many good points and SO MANY bad points that it sadly left me cold. As I sat in the theatre at the end as the final credits ran did I feel elated? Did I feel excited? Did I feel emotional? No I did not. Ultimately it just did not have that much effect on me, except possibly on my bladder which was not impressed at all.It does have some really beautiful moments, but that is all set design and cinematography. I can't think of a single scene where the action was amazing or the dialogue was stellar. And all the visuals were directly inspired by the original film, and I couldn't see anything that the new director had bought to the film. Where was his original vision? I'm so bored of films that are supposed to be a bit more cerebral and then the main blokes just punch each other in the face, again and again, and oh Yawn, what's happening now? Oh some bloke is punching another bloke in the face. Yawn.The original Blade Runner had great action scenes, Dekkard chasing the Skin Job through the shopping centre or the final conflict with Rutger!All I could see on this film was the arrogance of the Director's Ego all over the place (I also felt this in Arrival, which I hated, and, yes, I know everyone else thought it was the wonderful, I was so disappointed it wasn't a film about ABBA) and any holes in the script, and there were many, were just ignored. I mean if skin-jobs were not meant to reproduce then surely not putting a womb and eggs in the female and no sperm in the male might have been a sensible place to start?And what about Mr Blindo? what about him? He's still a nut job. And really they have been looking for this Baby Blade Runner for 30 years and the entire LAPD and Mr Nutjob and all his little nut jobs can't find a single clue and agent Joe just finds a date on a tree and... oh rubbish, this is rubbish.I felt having cameos from the previous film and then killing them off so blatantly (Rachel) were just cheap shots (pun intended) and destroying Dekkard's original Flyer was a total Yawn moment. So many completely cut-table scenes and so much exposition. And waiting 60 odd minutes for Harrison Ford to turn up and then give him nothing to do..? I felt like I was watching Star Wars 7 and just waiting for Han Solo to turn up. I mean If I was making a movie and I'd managed to get Harrison Ford in it I'd get him in earlier and give him something cool to do!!There are several books out there set in the Blade Runner world and I suggest Reading Blade Runner 2 by KW Jeter which is a HUGELY better than this.Blade Runner 2049: 4 out of 5 - it's good but it ain't no classic. Pretty disappointing.",Blade Runner 2049
696,flcntk3-856-986017,"A true ""miracle""",8,7 October 2017,"As I put my fingers to the math and count the years, I realized the production was 5 years slow in trying to match passage of time between the story time line and the actual time it took to bring the film back. The original Blade Runner was set in 2019 and the latest sequel continues in 2049. Now that is a total of 30 years of story time. However, it took Ridley 35 years to bring the fresh one to the screen. It would be a little bit of additional synchronicity thrill if the new sequel comes 5 years earlier. Nonetheless, ""Bladerunners 2049"" is a ""substantial"" and satisfying homage to the original in many ways and I will explain the ""substantial"" part later. As a part II, it fills the shoe of its predecessor with aplomb and it was a big shoe to fill. Roger Deakins did a fantastic job with the cinematography and had brought the Film Noire look of the original up to date and then some which I am sure will get him at least a nomination if not an Oscar. Even the score and the sound EFX with that recurring low frequency of a background dynamo hum are reminiscence of the original. Although it wasn't scored by Vangelis, the result is equally impressive and effective. The art direction too has that retro-infusion mixed with minimalistic Brutalism as a statement of differences between the world of human and that of the replicants. Just on the tension between these two worlds, this new version went deeper into the philosophical questions that justifies the status quo and the social order and what separates and distinguishes humans from its assumed ""lesser"" counterparts. It seems to suggest the key lies in the transcending ""miracle"" which is a form of biological procreative mutation where while humans create disposable replicants for functionality, replicants now want the seat of power by grasping the secret of that ""miracle"". It does beg the question of what makes us superior and by what human trait? On why I called it ""substantial"", the film sits slow, very slow at time. I think in parts because of the pondering pauses and the rather emotionally dissociative and disconnecting dialogues. That gives the film a kind of existentialistic detachment. Funny enough, the one that emotes the most is a hologram companion called Joi but unfortunately, she is a programmed mirage designed to please and therefore could not be counted as real. With that, perhaps the underscoring real ""miracle"" should be the ability to connect and express true feelings, but that's just my thinking. All in all, it is a ""serious"" sci-fi that doesn't rely on superficial ""fireworks"" but takes its strength from meticulous and delightful design details and deeper thinking. I just can't wait for the 3rd sequel to come and hope it will not take another 35 years for I won't be around by that time.",Blade Runner 2049
697,bdawe14,Boring - Contains Spoilers (right at the end sort of),5,6 October 2017,"After the disappointment of the force rebooted this was the only other film this year I was actually waiting to see so it was with high hopes and fingers crossed that I went to the cinema today to watch this movie. Sadly it would seem I had my second movie disappointment of the year.The plot for this movie wanders around and doubles back trying to make you think one thing and then another slowly and drearily getting to the only point it has to make right at the very end. The pacing is slow and tedious and not a patch on the original movie with non of the originals edge.As for the aesthetic in places it almost looks like the first movie but misses and then in others its miles away. Very few of the scenes looked like they could of been placed in the original most looked like wannabee copies and somehow just fail to come upto the original.It's not the fault of the actors it just doesn't feel like they were given much to work with. The over concept is a great idea however the execution is sadly lacking.The whole movie felt lame and drawn out like 30 mins of story spread over 163 mins of film, there were loads of long meandering slow scenes and should of ended up on the cutting room floor they just destroyed the pacing. At one point I actually closed my eyes and thought I might just fall asleep only to hear snoring from another viewer behind me which made me laugh.Goslings and Fords performances were great considering how little they had to work with and Jared Leto felt menacing but very very under utilised. Ana de Armas is stunning and played her part well as were/did Mackenzie Davis and Sylvia Hoeks (there's no way you'd want to be on the wrong side of Luv).Overall the movie felt too long, too slow and not enough story which is a shame as the plot seemed almost decent.SPOILERLY BIT Making K/Joe think he was the one and then it turning out not to be him was just lame and not done very well at all.This movie isn't worth paying to see wait until it's on your favourite streaming service.Just a note to the movie industry who claim many many things are killing the movie business I think the one thing that actually is killing the movie business is lack of originality/reboots/remakes and just general tardiness.

698,edenney01,"Not perfect, but a very worthy sequel",8,31 December 2017,"A good sequel is a very rare thing in Hollywoood, and a good sequel made decades after the original movie is as rare as a four leaf clover, but this movie almost lives up to the original (heaven knows The Force Awakens sure didn't). It captures the mood, visuals, atmosphere, and score of the original perfectly, which is quite an achievement for a movie as extraordinary as the original Blade Runner was, particularly considering when it was filmed. That said, the characters in this movie are lacking the depth and emotional connectivity that you had for them in the first movie. In short, they're just not as compelling, and it's hard to get emotionally invested in any of them. I also think they didn't put enough effort into the story, compared with how much they put into trying to recapure the look and feel of the original. I gave it an 8, and I'd give the original a 9 (considering when it was flimed). I would VERY strongly recommend that everyone see the original before watching this. I can't see too many people really enjoying this movie if they didn't see and like the original.",Blade Runner 2049
699,cristiandeiana,The overall sensory experience of this movie feels about as good as cinema can get.,7,18 December 2017,"The acting in this sequel leaves a lot to be desired, notably that of Gosling and Leto, especially when you reflect on the many incredible characters that were in the original. I'm talking monotone dialogue and lack of facial expression throughout the majority of the movie, especially when it's the protagonist, I mean I get that he's a replicant, specifically a nexus 9 replicant, made to be more obedient therefore the role may require to act in such a way (or not act). BUT, even if that's the case I feel like casting such a role as the main protagonist is a bad move as it detaches the audience from the story. We're usually engaged with the protagonist to feel more connected with the story because we feel like we can connect with them, that we can feel what they feel, can empathise with them, and care about their fate. I feel like when the main character is designed to be so devoid of emotion, closed off from the audience, it makes it more difficult to care about them and ultimately disconnects the audience with the story, at least in relation to the main character. The opposite in fact can be said about Hoeks' portrayal of Luv, who despite also being a nexus 9 replicant is actually a much more interesting character to watch on screen, which goes to show that Goslings wooden performance was completely unnecessary. And as for Leto's acting, given that he's playing a human character, and especially given that he's the main antagonist, we're given no explanation as to why he would act (or not act) in such a way. I mean seriously, is it just me or is his acting in this movie really really bad, I mean his portrayal of the joker wasn't exactly idyllic, yet from Dallas Buyer's Club it's no secret that he can in fact act his socks off, so why is his acting here so goddamn bad?There's on more gripe that I have with this movie, that is the ending (or lack of). Not only did it's predecessors have far superior characters and acting, but the movie as a complete whole was much more accomplished. It feels like they've tried way to hard to keep the story open to a sequel, and in doing so have failed to create a well structured movie. It doesn't really build to any grand finale, the ending for me falls very flat, and it feels like sure it'll flow nicely into a sequel, which I'm sure is exactly what they want because that means there's more money to be made, but it just takes so much away from the movie. Clearly they've been able to make a sequel from the first movie just fine, which means that it didn't have to be left so blatantly wide open for a sequel, and on the contrary the original stands alone as a solid story. I ultimately found the first half of the film to be dare I say it, a bit too slow, followed by a lack of thrill/build up, and finally a very underwhelming ending sequence, especially in contrast with the prequel.Despite these two major flaws the movie still holds up, thanks to the first class directing of Villeneuve, and the incredible sound design. The overall sensory experience of this movie feels about as good as cinema can get, it really is that good. This combined with a solid continuation of the original story and some interesting plot twists makes for a memorable viewing experience, and something I'd happily revisit. It does feel like it's begging for yet another sequel, and so I'd gladly welcome a finale to give us a satisfying trilogy, and ideally with a solid ending this time and some decent acting/iconic characters. Until then 2049 feels like it has unfinished business.",Blade Runner 2049

Having seen it however, I can't understand all the criticism. Yes, it is a long film, but it is well paced, well acted and photographed. There are moments of great excitement and tension and yet the story is engrossing and thought provoking. Clearly those who criticised Blade Runner 2049 were expecting some all action, shoot 'em up sci-fi movie and so an intelligent, well crafted film is bound to disappoint them, but that is no reason to criticise the film. I would recommend it to any fan of the original Blade Runner or intelligent, dystopian sci-fi films. This is a movie about humanity: what it means; how precious it is and how much it is worth fighting for. It is also about miracles and hope. There is a lot to admire about it, including the soundtrack, which also drew a lot of cricitism, surprising given that it featured Frank Sinatra and Elvis among others.

Solid story, characters, acting and music reminiscent of the original. Outstanding visuals, effects and art design. Musy be seen in Imax...Seriously! My only issue is the 2 hour and 45 minute running time! It is a 2hr & 15 minute movie trapped in a 2hr & 45 minute body! But if you are in for a penny, you are in for a pound, I guess. The pacing is my main issue with the original as well. As much as I love ""Blade Runner"", it's like watching a movie through the prism of a fish tank... If you liked ""Blade Runner"" you will dig this one (especially the nods to the original and some nice cameos)...If you don't like, or have not seen the original, this will totally be lost on you. It will be interesting to see how this does at the box office, since the original is a cult classic but flopped at the box office during it's initial run...It really needs to be nominated for ""Best Cinematography""",Blade Runner 2049

Filming is almost all dark and wet, which is WAY WAY WAY overdone.
Dialogue is wooden and at times sounded like a first read through.
At least this one did not have excessive tobacco smoking like the orginal, and consider, in a world where resources are very limited would the society be growing food or tobacco?
As to 2049. where is the story?
Decker is missing, some new replicant blade runner gets a mission to find ""the child"" and Tyrell Corp has been replaced by Wallace.
The Wallace character is not developed at all. His lackies are charactures, and the action (what little there is) is so predictable and has been seen a hundred times over.
I like thoughtful, intellectual sci-fi, but this is neither intellectual nor is it action. It is just yuck.
Music score is overwhelming as if is trying to force the movie to be good, but it cannot.
2049 is ever further away from the book, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" than the first movie, and 2049 suffers greatly for that.
I suggest you watch Soldier with Kurt Russel as it is supposedly set in the same universe. That movie is far better than Blade Runner 2049.",Blade Runner 2049
703,crimesact,Good not brilliant,6,11 April 2020,"I'm a hard critic of sequels and this is one Sequel that doesn't get out of 2nd gear. Blade Runner the 1st movie was brilliant and an easy 10 out of 10 the sequel tried to hard to meet the same expectations and was a let down. Perfect actors that worked well with the script they had, but the storyline was the biggest let down and didn't take the audience on the same futuristic ride as the 1st movie. My personal opinion would be to watch it but don't have your expectations that high that you think the standard will meet the first movie.",Blade Runner 2049
704,jmarinko925,A Sci Fi favorites return that improves upon it's predecessor loved it!,9,6 October 2017,Somehow I never saw the original Blade runner but was fortunate enough to catch a double feature last night enjoy the original and see 2049 right after without waiting decades for the follow up. 2049 is true to it's predecessor and expands upon it masterfully. Tie ins to the original are not forced but ever-present and enjoyable. The second and third acts are filled with suspense and more action than the first. The film opens with action then begins to lay groundwork for the rising suspense and climax to come. While there are a good amount of cameos no performance is wasted or unnecessary. I should point out that this is not a Harrison Ford movie alone it is a Blade runner movie. An excellent one at that and while he is not the star his moments on screen are perfectly timed in his return to the iconic role as Deckard. A long run time was not discouraging but rather necessary to reveal the complex Sci Fi world that is Blade Runner.,Blade Runner 2049

Blade runner 2049 is a brilliant movie, Denis Villneuve went out of his way to create the best possible movie he could make unlike other Hollywood film makers who mainly see dollar signs. Ryan Gosling is incredible once again. He acts in this movie very similar to how he did in the movie Drive and I suspect that's why he was cast in this role. It's a long movie but there are plenty of amazing scenes. Please give the movie a chance as it is worthy of that. The ending is fantastic once you get there through all the mysterious plot lines. Absolutely amazing visual effects that are so incredible it warrants a really good t.v./sound setup and a blue ray copy to make the most of it.To add, don't spoil this one on a night you are not ready for it (2 hours 44 mins long), be well rested and get all your snacks ready, get comfortable and enjoy a breathtaking movie experience.",Blade Runner 2049

The main character and his character development is just as complex as the first movie.

708,leegato,A Masterpiece That Pays Off,10,15 November 2017,"I don't like calling Blade Runner 2049 a sequel. To me, a ""sequel"" suggests that it builds off of the story and success of a previous installment. A ""sequel"" is something that continues the story of previous core characters. Blade Runner 2049 is not JUST a sequel. It's an expansion, both in the visual sense and the thematic sense.To really sum things up, Blade Runner 2049 is a rare film that manages to capture both the look and the heart of its predecessor, yet remain wholly original and refreshing for a modern audience. The story follows K, a newer-model Replicant who is a Blade Runner for the LAPD. After discovering a jarring secret about the Nexus 08 Replicants (from the original Blade Runner), K is sent out on a journey to track down Officer Deckard, who has been in hiding for 30 years.Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most beautiful films to come out in film history. Every single shot is precisely filmed, positioned, and edited to create the sense of vastness in the world's dystopia. The cinematography beautifully executes the film's colors and shots to establish the different worlds visited in the film. It's a visual tribute to the original's groundbreaking effects, but also manages to break out of the confines of the original and become it's own work of art.What makes Blade Runner 2049 such a compelling addition to the Blade Runner series is that, with this new storyline, it manages to touch on the original's themes of existentialism and the definition of humanity. What does it mean to be human? With a protagonist who is a Replicant AND a Blade Runner, this question is further prodded. The main plot of the film revolves around this question, and takes K on a journey discovering on what he actually is, and what his experiences are supposed to mean to him.Ryan Gosling plays the role of K with beautiful precision and subtlety; the film is supposed to convey how K feels human even when he knows he isn't, and even raises the possibility if he is human. Gosling's nonverbal acting perfectly sums up the complexity of thought that K goes through, and transforms into the character on screen.Do you need to see the original Blade Runner in order to watch this? Yes and no. Blade Runner 2049 stands on its own as a slow burner, sci fi thriller that manages to capture its audience no matter what they've seen before. However, Blade Runner 2049 also expands on the original Blade Runner, taking the original's visual innovations and thematic elements and modernizing them to a new contemporary standard of storytelling. Watching the original Blade Runner will only make you enjoy 2049 even more. 2049 is a rare example of a ""sequel"" surpassing its predecessor visually and creatively.",Blade Runner 2049

711,TanQ,Gee it took them a long time to waste this opportunity.,3,20 February 2018,"You know it's a bad movie when you start wondering how long you've been watching it. That doesn't mean that it's terrible, I'm sure there's a decent movie in this dragged out mess. There are some intriguing ideas, some well thought out conundrums but everything gets lost in overly long, drawn out scenes that add nothing. I would wager that nearly every scene could have been trimmed by at least four minutes and the movie would've actually worked. This movie is a prime example of lost talent. Everyone from the top down probably thought that they were creating something epic and meaningful and forgot that it should be slightly entertaining. It's a dystopia, we get it. It's a story of morality, we get it. Now move the freaking story along. About a third of the way through this snoozefest, I turned to my friend and said ""I don't care about any of these characters."" Two thirds of the way through I said ""Is this still on?"" which was soon followed by ""Why is this still on?"" and, inevitably, ""When will this thing end?""If you're waiting to see this film, wait a little longer for the ""Not the Director's Cut"" or the ""Abridged so it's Watchable"" version. Or, if you're feeling nostalgic, just watch the original which has a sense of pacing. This sequel is only destined to be a classic lesson on hubris and delusions of self-importance.",Blade Runner 2049
712,VisionThing,"Visually gorgeous, emotionally bleak",6,8 October 2017,"For a modern big budget film, this one was OK. However, it failed to evoke any feelings whatsoever. Dissection below.Good things first. The movie is visually brilliant. It is believably rough and dirty where it needs to be, and stunningly beautiful when the story allows more artful scenes. There are some good acting performances (Harrison Ford, Dave Bautista (!), Barkhad Abdi). The basic plot is OK, one could build a very good movie around it. I very much liked how the movie handled the theme of relationships and contemplated to what extent AI could replace a physical partner. And the direct references and links to the original Blade Runner movie were very clever and graceful, they did not feel like fan service at all but natural and integral parts of this movie.Why did it fail to evoke any emotions, then? (Disclaimer: most of the reasons are probably due to personal preferences, very subjective. Your experience may be completely different.) One issue was the editing and pacing of the film. Pacing worked very well in the beginning, but the flow was lost somewhere in the middle, and the latter half of the movie was stagnant on several occasions, losing its grip of the viewer as a result. There were also a couple of occasions where despite the tranquil pace the movie failed to present key plot developments in a clear manner -- what exactly happened, why something was done, or how did we end up in this situation from the end of the last related scene. Second issue was a combination of casting and screen writing. Ryan Gosling is a solid actor, but perhaps best suited to sympathetic heartthrob roles; in my opinion he lacks the kind of rugged charisma and screen presence that would be needed for playing this kind of role with such vast screen time. However, the role is extremely challenging -- to function as a focal point of the whole movie he should be identifiable, charismatic, memorable; on the other hand he should convincingly portray a machine without a free will whose job is to kill his own kind. Gosling makes a brave effort, but the end result is bland. The antagonists are simply trite. Jared Leto is miscast, stale at best and atrocious at worst; instead of a menacing, wildly ambitious genius he comes off as a fledgling cult leader who is practicing his first sermons. However, the actor was not given much to work with, the whole character is but a dim imitation of Dr. Eldon Tyrell from the first Blade Runner movie. Sylvia Hoeks does a good job with what she was given, but again, it was not much: the writers resorted to the cheapest B movie trope and imply that the bad guys are bad by making them use violence as the first and only solution to every problem, and Hoeks' character was not given any nuances apart from a sadistic streak that seems odd in a machine.Finally, there was the soundscape of the movie. This film is practically devoid of emotional music. Sounds consist mostly of thunderous rumbles and shrill synth sounds instead of real melodies; there is also a Shepard tone playing during one key scene. Absence of emotionally manipulative soundtrack is often nothing but a positive thing, but it also means that the movie has one less tool to convey and evoke feelings with. In this case, the drab and monotonous score enhances all the wrong qualities of the film.3/5",Blade Runner 2049
713,NotTheOne000,And when we become Gods...,10,30 October 2017,"Androids in sci-fi movies have been around for almost as long as the genre, dating back to Metropolis in 1927. They have been monsters and angels, standing in both for the cruelty of humanity at its worst and the naïve purity of humanity at its best. They have been a mirror against which we can reflect ourselves and ask what it is to be human. And they have been a warning to us - a Do Not Cross line for what happens if we give in to our hubris and play at being God.The first Bladerunner movie is designed to challenge our sense of what it is to be human. This was a central theme for Philip K Dick, whose stories twist our perceptions of what it means to be conscious, sentient entities. Deckard's portrayal in the first movie draws us in with his apparent humanity. In the end, we are left wondering if it really means anything to be born human as opposed to be an artificial version of a human. Our realities are creations of either ourselves or someone else. As they are all a fiction, does it really matter who writes that fiction? But all these stories of robots come from a different era, a time when artificial humans were thought possible, even plausible, but still the stuff of fantasy. Even AI such as Hal in 2001 were thought experiments, and performed the function of stripping back the human soul. But that era is now past. Bladerunner 2049 doesn't need to be a metaphor for anything, or a model of humanity to be dissected, because its subject matter is right around the corner.What Bladerunner 2049 does is something both obvious yet profound. Up until now, one universal element of any story like this has been the underlying question of ""what right have we to play God?"". That question is usually answered with some form of natural or poetic justice leading to the punishment of the hubristic humans taking more power than they're entitled to. Playing God is reserved for actual Gods, humans should not be assuming that level of power. This film dismisses that question out of hand and asks a much more relevant question, namely ""when we have become Gods, what sort of Gods will we be?"" Will we be Wallace, the arrogant Old Testament God who treats his creations as his property, to dispose of as necessary to appease his Will and fulfil his Great Plan? Or will we be Joshi, the powerful yet generally benign God who is obviously superior yet is still respectful of the inferior mortals? And what of the androids and AIs in Bladerunner 2049? In previous films, androids have been one of two things - either definitely not human or very nearly human. The artificial intelligences in this film are different. They're definitely not human, yet they're still sentient, feeling, self-aware entities. Again, we are asked a much more relevant question: what rights do we humans have over our artificial creations. Do we have a right to deny a computer mind a physical human-like form if it wants one? Do we have the right to imprison it within a house and just switch it off or destroy it on a whim? And of those living creations that can walk around and think for themselves - do we have a right to deny them the ability to procreate? And if they are able to procreate, do we have a right to control that procreation?Bladerunner 2049 is the very, very best of sci-fi. It does not speculate far into the future, it does not abstractly reflect upon the nature of our humanity and it does not offer us a moral lesson in the form of a fable or fairy-tale. It challenges us to look at exactly who we are right now and asks us what we are going to do with the power we have gifted ourselves though our technological achievements. The Ks and Jois of Bladerunner 2049 will exist in the not to distant future, quite possibly within our lifetimes. As we are to become their Gods, what sort of world should we create for them?",Blade Runner 2049
714,omarh92,"Either equal, or superior than its predecessor. Denis is the future.",10,6 October 2017,"Director Denis Villeneuve promised Blade Runner's sequel is good hands when he accepted to direct one the most influential films of all time, and he kept his promise; Blade Runner 2049 follows up with a darker world than what Ridley Scott imagined, yet keeping the very same charm Ridley worked hard on. It is also the best looking movie ever created, Roger Deakins will never top his cinematography here ever.What makes this film special is all cast and crew were either fans of the original, or worked on the original; they all knew this can only be phenomenal, and with their teamwork, the sequel was beyond phenomenal. The core philosophy of the movie, like the original is still what it means to be human is still a major topic and it vastly more explored here than the first film; told through replicant's obsession with love of another person mainly. Acting was top on everyone's end; Gosling, Ford, Armas, Leto, and Bautista. It sadly lacks Leto and Bautista, those 2 characters had an instant connection to the audience, perfectly played. Gosling here is like how he was in Drive, only obviously speaks more, however, it can be an award winning role for him as officer K.Setting is how Ridley Scott planned his original only in the future environment got worse, the cyberpunk, and neo-noir look never looked so beautiful and its so pleasing to see it returning after a long time. Each frame is an art in this movie, it is the most beautiful looking movie ever made, minimal CGI, and lots of special effects. Denis was so key about the lighting effects in the film, the lighting made the film look breathtaking. The soundtrack, every time a futurist score plays, goosebumps and chills, the feeling brings you into that world.Story wise, like the original; classic detective in the future, investigation with a dark past, and can lead to a dark future; Agent K takes a case which leads him to look for Deckard (the question of Deckard being human and replicant is asked again by the way). Like all Denis movies, there is always more to the main plot, it will look a story of one character, but ends up telling someone else's story, and this is done through a huge reveal or twist which was a ""wow"" moment I have not felt in a long time. You can skip the original Blade Runner, but it is highly advised you watch The Final Cut version before seeing this since there are many nods to the original film. Watching the original film, like ""Skin jobs,"" VK test (sort of), an opening credit, ""retirement,"" and unicorns as well. There is also another character other than Deckard who returned.... Watching the original will enhance the experience, and help you appreciate the story here a lot more.Once upon a time, Terminator 2 was called the greatest sequel ever, that time is now over; Blade Runner 2049 is the best sequel in history; keeps the charm of the original, but introduces fresh new elements, in the most amazing cinematography ever. Watch it on a big screen, because looks and surround sound will give you the best experience possible. Enjoy Blade Runner 2049, it may one day become as important as the original Blade Runner.",Blade Runner 2049

Sadly though, they managed to ruin everything about 2 great stories. I got the impression that replicants can't have babies, this obviously changed from 1982/2019 to 2017/2049. Everything that I thought I knew about Blade Runner (one of my favorite movies), has been changed, the story is incorrect and lacks an ending. The last 2 minutes of the movie, made me change the rating from 4 to 3 when Ford all the sudden decided to see the impossible daughter, he claimed to not be able to visit, why did this change? There are so many things in this new Blade Runner movie that makes me wish I had slept all night instead.

716,poewilson,Expensive art film marketed poorly to get its money back.,8,30 October 2017,"The P.H. Metric 78.75/100 The P.H. Metric +Marketing: 68/100In short if you want an art movie go, if you want an action movie and entertainment stay away.*********************************Light spoilers********************************Marketed as an action film this artistic thriller did not serve the general public. During my showing 7 people walked out, and there was only probably 15 of us, and they made it no more 50 minutes in. Several people I went to the theatre with fell asleep, yet critically applauded and here comes the divide. Movies critics love, film does not make money even when they have huge investment and movies critics don't love film makes enough money to fund 5-15 more movies. So in short this film is a disservice, because ultimately fewer studios are willing to take the risk on artsy films and all this film needed was to tighten up its pacing and it would have probably broken even and in terms of cinematic vision that is hardly selling your soul.Directing: 8.75/10The directing is superb and I am shocked with the level of investment that Villeneuve was given as much control as he was. Though it must be said that this film draws out shots for too long and this is from a man who loved the film Stalker. Where as something like Stalker is completely about the philosophical nature this film still tries to make it self an action/thriller/mystery film and these long takes end up killing the mystery and feels more like there is not enough story to go around, which ultimately is true. The shots themselves are lovely.Acting: 7/10Ford is Ford the man is not that great of an actor and he really is just cashing in on old franchises at this point. Gosling's muted touch was decent enough and while Leto's weird character was weird in a good way the character itself was unneeded. The main villain of the piece was over the top and worthy of being in a film that is trying so hard to be nuanced. She ends up coming off as a jarring screeching noise.Cinematography: 10/10Deakins's cinematography shines, absolutely shines and this has to be his year. 13 noms and with Lubezki currently attached to a special award Oscar his major comp for the year is not there.Editing 8.5/10I feel bad for Joe Walker he kept the ship as tight as he could throughout, but ultimately due to the nature of these long drawn out takes that it feels like he was ultimately overruled when it came to where to cut the film.Score/sound effects: 5.5/10I would have scored this higher if I had not seen Arrival, where as the industrial style sound design should have been more engaging I could not help feeling they were reusing it from Arrival. Of course the sounds were meant to be jarring given all the silence we were fed, but ultimately it feels like that opening sequence in the remake of Funny Games, it is not shocking or jarring in the sense the creator wants, but more in the sense please turn down the TV those noises are starting to give me a headache.Visual Effects: 9/10I get a sense of Silent Hill (the first game) it feels like the fog and dust in certain scenes is there to hide rather than enhance and when one goes back to the original Blade Runner these modern effects (specifically shots of the city) do not look like the technology has really pushed the boundaries, in fact it looks more like the status quo, which mind you the status quo is excellent, but not genre defining.Writing: 3/10I am sad to find out there was a writer for this film. Now I previously mentioned Stalker which is similar in many regards, however the dialogue in that is profound, where is the dialogue in Blade Runner 2049 thinks it is. With such cliché android film lines as basically sacrificing yourself is the way to prove you are human. This concept never sits well with me, as apparently for an android the most human thing is to sacrifice yourself so that the human may continue to live a better life than you. That sounds like the kind of thing an android would be programmed to do. Asimov anybody? Everything just keeps pushing the fact that these androids want to be human, but ultimately it keeps slapping them down and saying they are not. It adds nothing to the greater debate over AI and ultimately when compared to the sheer quality of everything else in the film it looks out of place and useless, as if someone was brought in last minute to patch it up. Secondly the whole it could be him story was let out of the back to early on, so it made the double twist so predictable that it steals any power it had.Production Design: 9.5/10Those in production design you all need more respect and deserve to be pushed further into the foreground, because when you do an excellent job no one says anything, only look how well this and that is, but you owned this film.Costume Design 9/10Well done, especially Leto's character, though I will say the only real negative was Wright's outfit. What is this 2049 and she is channelling the 50's or was she literally a copy of the police chief from Futurama. Also Ford's was a little meh.Make-up/Hairstyle 8.5/10Again Leto is the high point, but not much else as everything is high quality, but nothing feels astounding.",Blade Runner 2049
717,g_ryder,"After the ""second coming"" they will no longer even suspect that they are ""replicants"", since they have become PSDO's (Psychically Defunct Organisms)",1,31 October 2017,"The first Bladerunner slowly but surely became recognized as a masterpiece in motion picture art, not merely because of the excellent visual art and music that created a unique kind of mood in the audience that built itself over time, but more so because of the deeply thought provoking story on which it was based: Philip K Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"". The screenplay or the script and dialogues developed by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples builds on that to become the fulcrum and central art of story telling around which the other arts are supportive but peripheral. Sadly, most fans of the movie merely go wow on the peripherals like acting, visuals and the action scenes. Ironically, one of the pointers in the story is about the degeneracy in humanity as a result of the ""Celebrity Culture"" of postmodern societies that completely miss the ""Real"" stuff that makes us human and go only for the ""Hyper-Real"" or the superficial to hang on to in silent despair which is not even acknowledged as despair, since the mass of humans are too dazzled by technology and the imagery, the entertainment and the sensations generated by it. What remains as a result is a strange nostalgia for a ""real life"" or deeper human emotions like love that become increasingly rare and elusive.This sequel, after a very long gap, has been clearly made for the fans and by a fan, and not for the connoisseur of intellectual art or that artist/intellectual who is acutely conscious of the tension between ""nature"" and technology, and specifically between the ""natural organism"" versus the genetically modified organisms (GMO), called ""replicants"" in these movies that are looked down upon by ""humans"" in the movies. Unlike in the movies in ""real life"" the GMO is much sought after by the Scientistic community for its ""potential yields"" and particularly for the corporate scientist who eyes the likely profits from these GMO's, and the rest of the masses keenly wait for the technology of ""designer babies"" and super-intelligent off springs that will colonize the universe. The ""natural"" has become almost completely subservient to the technological - the prime symptom of the Postmodern culture in which Scientism is the ultimate religion. The horrors unleashed by these technologies, particularly the devastating effect on the human psyche, is felt by very few in this globalized culture, mainly the artist-writer who agonizes over how to pour it into a powerful story. This ""ecstasy of communication"" was reflected in the story by Philip K Dick, and wonderfully articulated in the first movie. The essence (or ""soul"") of the story started falling apart a few years later when Ridley Scott decided that Deckard was a replicant. All the fans took that as a gospel truth, and therefore I am beginning to suspect that Scott himself is a replicant! Such are the times. The only thing I can say with certainty is that Philip was definitely not a replicant! I join those critics that say that the ""second coming"" is all style and no substance. All the money has been blown up in visuals, no money and energy seems to have been spent on the story. The script and dialogues are nothing compared to the first, and a pathetic attempt to dabble in metaphysics by casually throwing in the word ""soul"", also falls flat. Ford looks totally burned out, and has been thrown in just for the fans, in the hope that such cosmetics will improve the profits. (""Show me the money"" he says). The other lead actors have done well and do lift up the other-wise dreary story line, to inject some emotional ""masala"", especially for the fans. The time and money spent by me in watching this movie is recovered by the provocation it generates to write this review, even if this only highlights what is missing. I won't go as far as to say that this movie is a wasted effort since it was inspired by the brilliance of the first, and even a failed attempt to copy a work of art is a small but significant struggle to remain human in such times when the downwards spiral of humanity is accelerating. As they say ""nothing ventured, nothing gained"".",Blade Runner 2049
718,michael-young-585,Technical Masterpiece,9,7 August 2018,"Oscar Nominations:Cinematography (Roger Deakins) - Winner
Visual Effects (Nelson/Nefzer/Lambert/Hoover) - Winner
Production Design (Gassner/Querzola) 
Sound Editing (Mancini/Green)
Sound Mixing (Bartlett/Hemphill/Ruth)Blade Runner 2049 is a technical masterpiece! And the Oscar awards reward that excellence with five nominations in the visual and aural arts and two wins, in Cinematography and Visual Effects. It is a long movie (2 hrs, 43 min) but the immersive experience in this dystopian world keeps your focus and rewards your attention.Surprisingly, this was the first win for Roger Deakins after 14 nominations for cinematography for movies ranging from Shawshank Redemption and Fargo to Skyfall, Prisoners, and Sicario. Deakins has a unique talent for using camera angles and filters to create a distinct feel for each film. The dark shadows of Prisoners help convey the underlying fear while the long, unbroken drone shots in Sicario brought out the unbroken tension. In this movie, he manages to sustain the damp bleakness of perpetual rain in Los Angeles and the yellow-poisoned air of Las Vegas - futures that seem possible but not pleasant.Blade Runner also took the Oscar for Visual Effects. The visual effects team previously worked on films like Benjamin Button, Captain America, Beauty and the Beast, Armageddon, and Superman Returns. The visual effects run the gamut from CGI to actual stunt work, but in all cases the realism supplied gives the film a remarkable consistency and credibility. These aren't effects purely to stun the senses, but rather they help tell the story in a future world that is already tough to imagine.The production design team has received previous Oscar nominations for movies like Bugsy, Road to Perdition, Into the Woods, and Golden Compass. In Blade Runner 2049 they have created a world that is consistent in its details and striking in its rich texture. The sound editors won the award last year for Mad Max : Fury Road, and received previous nominations for Fifth Element and one of the Star Trek Movies. Previous nominations for the sound mixers include Life of Pi and the Martian. The point here is that the teams working on the technical aspects of this movie are long on credentials, and their work shows in a very overwhelming movie.As is usually the case, even with very good science fiction movies, Blade Runner did not receive any nominations in the directing, writing, or acting categories. And that is unfortunate. Dennis Villenueve, the director, also directed Arrival, another very good sci-fi flick. He also did the two excellent movies, Sicario and Prisoners, both of which manage to create a terrific tension in the audience. In Blade Runner 2049, he manages to sustain a complex story over a considerable length of time and still tie all the loose ends up.Speaking of story, one of the writers, Hampton Fancher, also participated in the original Blade Runner movie from nearly thirty years ago. He has managed to maintain consistency between these two efforts and address some of the big questions that were left from the original movie (i.e. is the Blade Runner (Harrison Ford) a replicant or not?). His cowriter, Michael Green, was also nominated for Logan, however, I didn't like that movie and blame the writer for most of its plodding disinterest.Ryan Gosling plays the main character, K, and he is just perfect in this role. Harrison Ford comes back to play an older version of his original character, Deckard, and brings with it some of the wisdom that comes with old age. Clearly the story is about these two men and the discoveries they make about each other, and themselves.However I think some of the most interesting characters are women. Robin Wright plays a terrific chief of detectives and K's boss. Sylvia Hoeks (Luv) is the main villain and battles both Deckard and 'K' with super-human abilities. Ana De Armas is a fresh, face and plays Joi, K's love interest who isn't exactly real. And Mackenzie Davis is a hooker who, in one of the most intriguing scenes in the movie, merges with Joi. Carla Juri, as Ana, plays a very important figure with some special characteristics, essential to the main story line. In all these cases, the women are playing supporting roles, but the movie is much more interesting because of them.Blade Runner 2049 is a complex story and the viewer has to pay attention to keep from getting lost. But because it is also such a technical tour de force, that is easy to do. The visual world created here demands that you open your senses and the story line rewards you for doing so.",Blade Runner 2049
719,FallonTimberlake2016,A modern cinematic masterpiece that tops the original.,10,12 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is the highly-anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 masterpiece Blade Runner. Harrison ford returns as Rick Deckard and Ryan Gosling plays a younger Blade Runner. That is all I will say about the plot, for director Denis Villeneuve wanted viewers to walk into it knowing virtually nothing. This is a great decision that more films released today need to consider.To put it simply, Blade Runner 2049 is a cinematic masterpiece. It does everything I wanted it to do and more. It is, along with Dunkirk, tied for the best film of 2017 so far in my opinion. Going in I thought the runtime would be a bit long given it was nearly three hours long. Boy, was I wrong. This film flies by so fast, that when it was done I felt like I could have watched it for hours more. The cinematography is so amazing, that some scenes literally took my breath away. The Blade Runner universe is even more well-realized in this film than it was in the first film, which is saying a lot. Watch this in the biggest and loudest theater that you can possibly find, because the imagery combined with the score makes for an experience like no other. Astonishingly, the visuals aren't even half of the reason why Blade Runner 2049 is such a masterpiece. This film took me places emotionally that I never dreamed of it possibly going. It asks you what it means to be human, and again shows the thin line between replicant and human. Because you are so invested in the story, the movie is that much more suspenseful, keeping you on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours plus runtime. The people who are calling Blade Runner 2049 ""slow"" obviously can't handle a film that doesn't contain some kind of explosion in every other scene, because this film is the opposite of boring. I was riveted for the entire film, despite it being more of a sci-fi drama than an action blockbuster. This film also pulls amazing performances from its wide array of talented actors. Ryan Gosling has been hitting home run after home run lately, especially with La La Land having come out just last year. He gives another great performance here, and I can't wait to see him as Neil Armstrong in the Damien Chazelle-directed biopic. Harrison Ford proves yet again that he hasn't lost his touch at all despite his old age. Another good find is Ana de Armas, who kills it with a surprisingly complex performance. I wish I could say details about their characters, but I really don't want to spoil the film.Honestly, I loved nearly everything about Blade Runner 2049. There were countless scenes where I felt chills because of how riveting and emotionally compelling the film got. Blade Runner 2049 is most definitely going to be a classic in this period of cinematic history, and I genuinely believe that this film simply could not have been any better.I give Blade Runner 2049 an A+.",Blade Runner 2049

That, and help provoke emotion; which I thought it also did rather well.It's really hard to say more without discussing spoilers, so I'll keep it short. This film IS a sequel to Blade Runner so I suggest watching that film (which I find to be a tad bit overrated tbh) before seeing this one.

Music is weird but fits perfectly to the movie (somehow I've tried listening to the ost but without the movie it's really not the same). Visuals are daring, okay some shots are hidden in fog and rain, but overall, they show you what you want to see. What bladerunner 1 struggled to deliver because of the technical limitations of the time.Acting is kind of a tricky question. Is Ryan Gosling a good actor or not? We all know he shows few emotions and, that's what we needed him to do in this movie. But I'm not correct by saying this, he shows anger, doubt, in a pretty good way.
Jared Leto is interesting in this role, maybe not seen enough though.
And Ana de Armas. She's one of those supermodels who ended up acting if I'm not mistaken. I haven't seen her in other roles but, she's a gorgeous fantasy doll and again, that's what they needed for the role. It worked. The plot worked. I will stay spoiler less in this review so I will just say that, I didn't see that coming.

A $150 million budget on a cerebral science fiction movie that continues the plot thread of a 35 yo cult classic? I would be hard-pressed to green-light this picture at half that budget. As an audience member, I made out, and I had to watch a half dozen trailers of stupid sh*t blowing up and people yelling things like ""there is no cure!""

Just let us indicate his completely credible futuristic atmosphere.In brief, finally there is an elitist movie non-reserved for the uncultivated negativism of the average moron who goes cheerfully by listening to only what he wants to hear or understand. The best to do is to shut up and thus I keep silent humbly!In my opinion, this full-length film supports hardly the lukewarmth and its new very sensible narrative fetches far its influences - so much moreover in the work of Philip K. Dick that in other much less popular arts.My note is 8/10 because I viewed this movie in the theater [1] of Pathé in the suburb of Paris, France and there was there during the action a violent icy and cold wind as to add to it to the movie realism.

Also,some plot doubtfuls: Firstly, K's ability to crash through walls without suffering any damage...Secondly, how his flying car ploughs through iron and steel junk without breaking the window glass, and, after that, how can the bad girl obliterate the crowd of attackers so that there are not even any bodies left when K walks from his vehicle?

In terms of grit, nothing from the original movie survived into the current production. The characters in the sequel are vapid (caricatures) in comparison to the original movie. Tyrell was a thoughtful genius, Roy was passionately fighting his own pre programmed mortality ,Pris could not find humanity, and Leon was locked into the anger of his past, Sebastian was captive to his own body. Then there was Rachel who was searching for personage and Decker for purpose. NONE of that kind of character developing can be found in this sad excuse for amovie.This movie was a shell, a sham, they even had a shell of a Pris character.

There were far too many clumsy links to the earlier movie in both supposed advertising to even the final scene with it's almost identical feel to Roys death in the rain on the roof top. Just a little bit to much of that for a film supposedly set 40 years after the first. The city scenes too were a poor imitation of Scotts first shot at the novel. All the oppressive, visuals of the dark crowded wet streets have been lost to give us , well just dark shots as a substitute. Gosling carried a long film well though at times his melancholia was a little overpowering. Leto is a pretty bland villain, his callous violence is childish and frankly fairly boring, one of the weakest parts of the movie.

The story is uninspired as is the banal dialogue.

It's an hour too long, the story-line is weak to non-existent and doesn't get answered, the theory of Deckard's origin is again teased at but not answered (even though there really is very little in the original to point to him being a repilicant).This is another SFX over substance movie. Looks good, although very dark in the 3D version, but there just doesn't seem to be the energy and edginess of the original. It all seems too NICE.

737,mounirrmaged,Villeneuve creates another masterpiece in his filmography,10,19 January 2018,"""To be born is to have a soul"" says K, in the new sci fi epic extravaganza. In 1982, blade runner was a new look at futuristic society with the mind of Ridley Scott behind it. Just like the original, the film was a box office tragedy, and yet getting appreciation from film buffs everywhere. 
 
Villeneuve has always played with the themes of human morality, giving an existential look and critical study of society and corruption. And this movie is no different. In this movie, Villeneuve shows a Utopian, yet nightmarish and haunting. In 2049, K is living the life he wants with his girlfriend Joy, a highly advanced artificial intelligence program designed to satisfy the need of its customer. As its old predecessor, this movie blurs the line between human feelings and artificial one. Humane ambiguity gives this movie the depth and main theme it analyzes. One can argue she is real, as seen by her bond with K and her experiencing of rain for the first time. This futuristic take shows governmental manipulation and corruption in the way it tries to satisfy false needs to the customers, and how they seek perfection in their products but sacrifice their own humanity in the process, killing and destroying an innocent life that did not even get the possibility to live, and maybe even grow on its own. ""Real memories are illegal"" shows the government refuses the existence of humanity. With Villeneuve's artistry combined with legendary cinematographer Roger Deackens, they both give a future that's erotic and mythological, that has this somber aura. The spectral imagery create unforgettable environment and powerful moments. Just like the rest of Villeneuve's movies, political and social consensus come into play and give the depth, challenging the viewer's perception and their very own human feelings Ryan Gosling personifies human curiosity, with his mastery of minimal acting, giving a focus on body language that contradicts his facial expressions. This is seen in various moments such as in the beginning when he kills Sapper Morton, he shows little attention to his surrounding, yet his body is always on guard. Harrison Ford gives a career defining performance, with his take being a broken, isolated person. Thanks to Villeneuve and Dickens' artistry, Villeneuve created another sci fi masterpiece that should become a classic in years to come.",Blade Runner 2049

However, in the end I felt the movie did a great job making the time go by very fast. Could it have been shorter? Yes. However, I'm glad it wasn't. There were so many scenes that were crucial to the plot and to the movie. Everything adding together into one big scene of reveal that makes the audience go ""ahhh"".

A contradiction not all that unlike to the film itself. It boasts great visuals yet this time with a sole purpose to look cool, rather than to support the story. The grimy and gritty world does not exist as it did in the previous film: dark, noiresque, full of life. This time around the grit feels superficial, sterile even. And not in the infertile kind of way. A lot of beautiful scenes but with no real purpose. I guess that's why a lot of people recommend watching it in 3D, so at least that way you'd get at least some of your money's worth.Talking about pointlessness. Mixed in with the run time. There are a few scenes that should've been dropped either because they make no sense or are just pure unnecessary exposition. Why they're in the film? Guess they felt they needed to insert one specific action scene out of nowhere just to keep the viewer from falling asleep. And obviously they needed a scene for just the bad guy so that the audience would know that he's not just regular household evil bad dude, but a few steps extra. Etc. Which brings me to how magnificently cliché ridden this film is. One would think 2049 stands for the number of overly overused solutions in storytelling that they've included in the new Blade Runner. You can rarely escape from the hurricane of clichés. I guess these days it seems to be the criteria for the Hollywood's mass produced, mainstream mental-detainment. Thinking back now, I hope I am mistaking, because I can't remember a single original or unique moment in the whole film. Perhaps it's also one of the reasons why Blade Runner 2049 lacks the depths the first one took a dive into. Sure, it tries, but its attempts are feeble. The ideals or aspirations don't resonate because, well, they seem manufactured. Pardon my pun once again. Despite all of this, and make no mistake, I am no fanboy of the first film either (though I do think it's objectively better), you can still go for the ride and enjoy it. Even if it's going to be a bit jarring because of the overall pacing, but that also gives you time to repress some of the dumbest moments and imagine what else could go on in the world like that. Because the universe in Blade Runner is by itself pretty damn cool, just a shame the second film did not improve upon that.",Blade Runner 2049

Denis Villeneuve definetely had his work cut out for him, directing a follow up to Ridley Scott's futuristic noir masterpeice would have fans reeling if anything below than amazing was finally delivered. Blade Runner 2049 is more than a sequal. Its a film that stands on its own lofty merit, and as far as intruige goes, this movie has it in spades. We follow K, played by Ryan Gosling, as he hunts down and kills tear away replicants who have managed to escape the system and go into hiding. K is a replicant also, he is by the very nature a slave, employed by the LAPD to perform one duty only. Upon his tracking, K discovers the remains of a female replicant who had perished during childbirth. Seemingly thought impossible K's supervisor tasks him with finding and terminating the apparent surviving child replicant before a war breaks out between humans and their biologically engineered counterparts. Seems pretty straight forward? This is where Blade Runner 2049 outdoes its pre-decessor as Villeneuve fills the film with an unexpected detective like intruige that has the viewer more than hooked, just as you construct and assume a plot, 2049 has other ideas. As K gets closer to the truth, the enemy force in the Wallace Corporation begins their own hunt, hoping to discover the secret to replicant reproduction. The Wallace Corp CEO, Niander Wallace played by a god like Jared Leto sends his enforcer Luv to find the lost child and ultimately retire K. The film is incredibly stunning to watch, hallmark visuals from the original do make they way to the screen but only in small doses as Villeneuve paints a picture using his own neon canvas of colour and tone. True fans of 19'82's classic have long hoped for a sequal, and Blade Runner 2049 is a more than worthy follow up!",Blade Runner 2049
747,cherchezan,"Loved it, a pleasant surprise",10,16 January 2018,"I feel the bar has been set so low these days, I find most of the action movies coming out to be complete garbage. I'm thinking here about all the heroes movies, transformers and the likes who are just bland and pointless with stories that are getting more and more ridiculous. I am also a huge Star Wars fan and I think what they are doing now with the two new movies is taking a huge dump all over the Star Wars universe and everything about it and while watching Blade Runner I couldn't help but wonder why did Star Wars get stuck with the village idiots and while other movies can have this amazing of a sequel so many years later.The movie is wonderful visually, making a seamless transition from the 80's movie to the new one, they blend perfectly. The story is good and it has a lot of little details and cool things if you are careful to look for them. I was actually looking at the snow flakes towards the end and I was wondering if they were going to be fake looking like they always to din movies and I had the pleasant surprise to see that the ones that landed on Gosling were melting after a second or two. But there are a lot of fun little things like that, I might rewatch it just to catch more of them. The love scene with the AI is one of the coolest things I've seen in a long time and there are other thought provoking ideas.The main character is a little dry and you don't quite bond with him like you should which is the only main flaw of this movie, however, because of what the character represents, making him more humane would have probably lost some of the feel of the movie.Overall I am impressed, haven't liked a movie this much in a while, I've been constantly disappointed, especially by the two pieces of garbage that are the new Star Wars movies but this one proved to be a winner.",Blade Runner 2049

Sean Young should be happy that she did not appear in the dog of a movie. Don't know who wrote it but was a combination of other sci-fi movies thrown together, except the original. Hope there is never going to be a Blade Runner 20 whatever. I could not wait until the movie was over and I could leave the theater and go home.",Blade Runner 2049
751,miesnekawalki,"Audio visual masterpiece, everything else is garbage",6,8 October 2017,"Pros: Cinematography. Beautiful shots, insane color palette, amazing sound design. This movie actually ranks as my number 2 best looking movie of all time (first being Neon Demon by Nicolas WInding Refn). Insanity! Ryan Gosling. Perfect casting choice Cons: the story! The story presented in this movie is not only uninteresting, but it also has no freaking impact on anything that's been done in the first movie and on the future of everyone involved! It's stunning to me that movie of this magnitude can be so hollow and pointless! runtime and pacing. This is 2,5 hours movie and it feels like it, mostly because of the dreadfully slow pacing. Don't get me wrong, pacing can be slow and interesting (Hell or High Water from recent examples), but in Blade Runner 2049 it reminded me of 'Only God Forgives' by Nicolas Winding Refn (it's like someone copy-pasted Ryan Gosling from one movie to the other). Everything that the characters do in 2049 is an event, even if it's something as mundane as lighting the cigarette, sitting on a chair looking somewhere or walking around. If they cut out the bullshit, the movie would last a good hour less and it would make it much more watchable imo. action scenes. Trailers looked actions heavy, the movie itself contains like 4 scenes that you could describe as 'action', they last for about 3 minutes COMBINED. Not that I care, this kind of a movie's story can be told without big action setpieces, but come on. secondary characters. Just useless 2 minutes scenes vomiting exposition at you. They are also useless. 'My name is this and I do this' cut away to 5 minutes of Ryan Gosling walking towards the camera in the rain. ARGH... the villain. Jared Leto has nothing to do in this movie. His scenes last for like 5 minutes and have no impact on anything. The female sidekick replicant was 10 times more interesting, which is just sad :PI could go on, but what's the point. This movie gets 6 from me for visuals alone. The rest is trash. Final thought - just watch the 3 shorts released as a promo materials. They are much more interesting than the movie itself...",Blade Runner 2049

The second time I watched it is because this one was coming out. At this moment I still have moments of Blade Runner so vivid in my mind. Can I say the same about 2049? Not really. It's not a bad movie. I liked the cast and the story was not bad, but something about the atmosphere was not there. I watched both movies fairly close in time to one another so I'm not basing my review based on memories. Music was good, visuals and styling were amazing but those alone don't make a memorable movie. I might watch it again in the future but I don't think it deserved all the hype it got.",Blade Runner 2049
753,jameskidac,The master of all but one,10,5 October 2017,"I think the movie was very seamless, it showed us believably a world where fear dominated each decade with different incarnations. The apolitical fear of surveillance is put in front, where nefarious people can track K down wherever he went. That is something beautiful, and inevitable for such tech. The blade runner himself seemed to be believable, but I think the forced resistance towards the end made it dangerous close to becoming trapped in the Divergent generic pop. Ford's signature attention to detail could have been used in more than one scene with the blind man, but I enjoyed the fact that he was put into the movie in a very organic way. I also thought the ending was dragged out a bit too much, and I was very miffed that Jo's girlfriend died, so minus one star from me. But then again its movies that make us feel all kinds of emotions, so one star is added for its realism and lack of tact. Thank you.",Blade Runner 2049
754,WhiteFire404,Blade Runner: 2049 - Review,9,19 October 2017,"The first Blade Runner film is a flawed master piece, a movie that while has glaring flaws, they are small compared by all the good stuff, Blade Runner: 2049 is in my opinion, a near perfect master piece. I have to say I consider both films to be as good overall, but there is no denying that Blade Runner: 2049 is a more solidly crafted film, Denis Villeneuve's directing is immaculate and Deakins' cinematography is one of the best works in his entire career (And that's really saying something), so many scenes in this film made my jaw drop consistently because of how beautiful they looked, the pacing while slow, is actually consistent and gives the film a solid tone and I feel here the pacing is more consistent that it was in the first film, Ryan Gosling was amazing in this film, one of his best performances and Harrison Ford once again was fantastic as Deckard, the writing is also really good. Now there are two flaws in the film, one is not a big flaw, in fact, is not a flaw at all, is just weaker compared to the first film and that's the music, Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch both composed a fantastic score but that unfortunately pales compared to the classic original score, the second flaw is a bigger one, but like the first film, it doesn't overcomes the good things, and that's Jared Leto, he isn't really bad, is just that he doesn't really... does anything, you could put literally ANY actor and it would make no difference, I'm not sure if this is because of Leto or just his character, but like I said, is a small problem, specially compared to how much the movie does right. I strongly feel Blade Runner: 2049 will inspire future filmmakers the same way the original film did back in 1982, and if they decide to make a third film, I will eagerly wait for it.",Blade Runner 2049

Maybe even 11/10, just the presence and atmosphere were fantastic. But the movie never really went anywhere. There were lots of other people in the universe presumably, but only like 4 of them ever talked to each other, which made the social part of the movie really disappointing. There was never any background explanation as to how the world became what it was. The main character had no friends. The actors were great. I would say this film suffered from the director/editor trying to be too ""deep"", when they could have just made it a bit more of a horror flick set in this future utopian society, still keeping the basic premise of the main character trying to find himself/ the memories are they real or implanted",Blade Runner 2049
757,hhg2,Stunning achievement; better than original,10,8 November 2017,"I would have preferred to simply have ""stunning"" as my review, but it falls well short of the minimum size for a review! The movie will probably only appeal to a small percentage of the population because it is so slow-moving, but I consider the pacing a positive as it allowed me to luxuriate a bit longer in the visual world the director/writer created. A moody, visual masterpiece that combines the film noir aspects of the 1940s and 1950s with the futuristic sci-fi world view.The performances are purposely understated and all actors put in excellent efforts. The music offers homage to the original but offers new explorations. The movie might be a little difficult for those not familiar with the original, so I would suggest watching/reviewing that film beforehand.I rarely go out to the actual multiplex, but I wanted to see it on the largest possible screen. I actually went twice!",Blade Runner 2049
758,cazmor,Excellent,8,28 January 2018,"The original Blade Runner although not unanimously received upon release has grown into a cult mega star, one of the first DVD releases sort of says it all.Many critics have waned in the light of the sequels and spin-offs that are been pumped out, but here with this cult classics sequel there is a lot to like.The combination of Villeneuve's direction and the actors performances is a pleasure to watch. Gosling should be proud of his performance, going beyond stoic, the one scene of emotional outburst the pinnacle of his performance. Hoeks as Luv was another standout, an excellent counterpart to Gosling's K, even Bautista's cameo lifted the whole performance.With the return of Ford and Olmos grounding the movie in the original, the true surprise was the awe inspiring return cameo of Rachael, with a combination of actress Loren Petra and stunning visual effects is one of the greatest CG achievements I can recall of late.Villeneuve's direction, visual backdrops and cinematography, although with much more muted tones than the original, stayed true to form. It didn't have the impact or awe as the original but that been said we have been inundated with visually demanding films from the original to now.The plot is similar in pretense to the original, more of an extension than original screenplay, creating the feeling of an ongoing battle, be that good or bad.We certainly were not bogged down in dialogue, with good action scenes, reasonable character development and an uncluttered timeline. However this time round the punch and depth didn't appear, nor does this critic feel pulled into the story line as the original so aptly achieved.All in all an excellent film, one that all involved can be proud of and one the viewers can enjoy, as a fan of the original or not.",Blade Runner 2049

The plotting in this film made no sense whatsoever, and it was interminable. What's so annoying is that anyone who's a fan of the original (and who isn't?) would feel obliged to sit through it.

763,d-papadakis,soundtrack crushed a weak movie to begin with,2,8 October 2017,"Just like the remake of Ben Hur you ask why would anyone take on such a responsibility since the original Blade Runner is the best science fiction movie ever made. Bad idea from the start, like trying to improve on Michelangelo's sculpture of David (yea remake that one), or like Custer who thought he was going to kick-ass on some Native Americans after following a trail for a couple of days that was a mile wide (""Please Mr. Custer, I don't want to go"").But what made an impossibility even worse was the soundtrack. You couldn't even hear the dialogue over the synthesizer sound.Hans Zimmer has lost the plot. The pinnacle of his career was the music he composed for ""The Thin Redline"" which was wonderfully appropriate and in big part made the movie. Dunkirk was on the edge, and Blade Runner 2049 fell off the cliff.Zimmer has lost the plot, and the director that accepts that he knows best better think again.Sorry but this sound track is too much, too annoying, too loud, too overpowering, it is so over the top that you don't enjoy the movie experience, you can't even concentrate on the movie. You feel drained, and least of all entertained.Like the real Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) said to the Cilician Pirate that betrayed him: ""go away"" In the future I will check the composer of the soundtrack before I go to a big movie, and if its Hans Zimmer, I'm not going.This is Zimmer's Michael Cimino ""Heaven's Gate"" moment.",Blade Runner 2049

The digital re-creation of Rachel is simply the best VFX in the whole industry.However the film's plot drags on for too long without meaningful climax. The entire story-line is essentially a one-note stretch that centers around a single mystery box. And the plot twist at the third act is both predicable and insignificant. Casual viewers would be bored before they can appreciate the fantastical world building in this film.Overall the production value is top notch, but the stories are simply weak and filled with Sci-Fi tropes.",Blade Runner 2049

766,BillK,Fails at a (probably) impossible task,7,10 October 2017,"Although knowledge of the original is not an absolute necessity to take in this film, for those of us who love the original, it does tend to set up expectations -- probably unachievable expectations.The original was -- at the time -- a fresh look into a broken future where the sunlight didn't penetrate. Where the old -- cars, buildings, city streets -- were patched and repurposed and everything was gritty and compromised outside of the headquarters of the dominant corporations. This new sequel is confused. There is sunlight in the opening scene. Maybe a mildly positive note that quickly is subsumed into a dreary, murky world without joy (except the artificial kind). Sure, that's true to the 1982 film and the source story, but the scenes take place above & away from the teeming streets that provided so much eye candy in BR. Another big shift is that while the police were a somewhat equal force to the Tyrell Corp in BR, the Wallace Corp seems the ultimate authority in BR2049. This makes for a certain inevitability in the plot development. I like Villeneuve as a director. I like his slow pacing and drawn out scenes. I like the producers' choices in casting - two particularly beautiful-to-look at artificial women and a tough, jaded police captain The leads are good. No surprise. When is Leto not great? Gosling plays a blade runner written as more jaded and less emotional than Ford's original character, and our lack of resonance with his character is distancing. It keeps us at — not in — the film. The Vangelis score of the original was full of regret and loss in synthetic tonalities. It was a thing integral to the film and something that stuck with you long afterward. Here, the score just didn't make much of an impact - it was recycled themes. Sequels don't have to tick all the boxes that made the original so special, but they have to bring something of significance to the party. In the original, Deckard was tracking 5 replicants and peeling back onion layers in classic noir style. In BR2049, it's a single mystery that is said to be linked to something profound, and we kinda get that on an intellectual level, but where's the emotional resonance? In other words, there is nothing remotely like the Roy Batty death scene. And perhaps the message of BR is just too big an idea to permit a worthy sequel. So we end up with something that - to me - was much like my experience with Prometheus. Many of the parts were there; the craft was there. The scope and budget were not compromised but the emotional hook that makes the ""big idea"" truly profound did not develop. 7/10",Blade Runner 2049
767,eric1,Sadly hilarious,4,10 October 2017,"The whole promotion campaign for this movie is misleading, the posters are colorful, the trailer is fast-paced, while the actual movie is dark and slow. It's OK to make a dark and dull Sci-Fi, I like Moon and Villeneuve's Arrival. And Villeneuve did delivered some interesting elements to Blade Runner, especially on virtual women. However he failed on story telling, even lost focus along the way, ran out of time (in a 2 and half hour movie), then jumped to a quick conclusion. The major problem with Blandrunner 2049 is Harrison Ford, this is the third time he picked up a role from his prime age, the third time he got a long lost child... And all three franchises are Sci-Fi at some level. It's ridiculous to see the same face in the same situation saying the same dialogue for the third time, and this situation and dialogues are TV soap clichés to begin with. I know that no one in Hollywood give a %$%$ to character or screenplay anymore, but I did hope a little more imagination from a legendary Sci-Fi brand.",Blade Runner 2049
768,d_anast,Blade Stumbler,7,6 October 2017,"Three points out of ten only for the cinematography, which equals expectations -- and is the only thing about this sequel that does. Maybe if it wasn't so over-hyped I would have been more tolerant of its weaknesses, which follow: there is an hour's worth of fat worthy of Terence Malick at his worst, meaning exposition for its own sake that never carries the story forward but serves as a backdrop for childish indulgence in visuals, that could easily have been cut; while the plot is tortuously convoluted and needed to be far more linear. The cast obviously reveres the material and is intimidated by the source, making for distance in their acting. James Edward Olmos, so sinister and subtly threatening in the original, has an unnecessary cameo as a doddering version of his younger self. And where is Vangelis, whose music added another dimension to the original? The music in this one is mediocre at best. I wonder if Ridley Scott was needed at the helm. Maybe my perspective is colored because I was there the first week the original Blade Runner came out and loved that great film, but if anybody who was there with me in the early 80's feels differently I'd love to know.",Blade Runner 2049

770,emeeme2003,"""I know what's real.""",8,11 February 2021,"The year is 2049; 30 years have passed since Blade Runner Rick Deckard ""retired"" his last skin job, and vanished into the non-existent sunset with the (fellow...?) replicant Rachel. A wave of fugitive ""reps"" arise from the ashes of the Tyrell Corporation, as another generation of replicants is given birth, models that have been engineered to be obedient, even to the point of hunting down and killing their own kind, like Ryan Gosling's K (short for his serial number KD9-3.7, or his ""real name""). But, when a routine case leads to the discovery of the remains of a replicant who apparently died giving birth (something believed to be impossible), K will go on a world-shattering journey that will force him to question everything that he believed to be real, alongside a couple of ghosts from the past that haven't been seen in a long, long time.So that's the basic pitch of Blade Runner 2049 on paper, Denis Villeneuve's unlikely, long-in-in-the-works sequel to Ridley Scott's original 1982 classic, but how does it play out on film? Well, for one thing, Villeneuve & company have more than stayed true to the world that Scott helped create over 3 decades ago, while still finding new, refreshing ways to expand on that vision; the massive cityscape of 2049 Los Angeles still feels just as monolithic and oppressive as it did in 1982, especially when lensed through the eye of modern cinematography icon Roger Deakins' epic, dizzying visuals, as hints of Vangelis's legendary original score wash through the soundtrack, and, while the Tyrell Corporation is no more, many real companies from the original that went bankrupt are still around in 2049, such as Atari and Pan Am (even the Soviet Union still exists in this timeline, to demonstrate the film's fidelity to Scott's canon).And, writing-wise, Hampton Fancher and Michael Green find new ways to delve back into the original's signature themes of identity, just exactly what it means to have a soul and to be ""human"", and the ever-thinning line that supposedly still separates man from his creations, while stylistically, Villeneuve's direction strongly recalls the slow, leisurely pacing, and overall cryptic, alienating tone that keeps Scott's film such a haunting experience all these year later....recalls it a bit too much, if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, as 2049 is still a worthwhile film on the whole, and I didn't regret paying extra to see it in theaters at all, but I still couldn't help but feel it would've been better if Villeneuve hadn't tried so hard to exaggerate certain traits from the original as if to try to give us the ultimate Blade Runner experience; 2049's surreally slow pacing is sometimes pushed to the absolute breaking point, and I ended up feeling almost every single minute of the film's 2 & 1/2 hour-plus running time, and the inclusion of certain overly bizarre, dehumanized moments (especially with Jared Leto's reclusive blind industrialist Niander Wallace, who substituted creepy cataracts and pretentious, ""poetic"" ramblings in place of actual character development) just felt very forced and unnecessary, and was a bit of a cinematic turn off in the end.Still, 2049 is at its best when Villeneuve allows its sense of humanity to shine through, like with the inner pain and utter confusion that Gosling's K displays as his entire world and very sense of self gets turned completely upside down as his investigation goes deeper and deeper, or with how surprisingly touching his relationship with his holographic ""girlfriend"" Joi is; the moment where she finally gets to go outside their cramped apartment after K gives her a portable emitter, and she gets to feel rain on her ""skin"" for the first time was simply beautiful to witness, and a scene where Joi synchronizes her movements with a real woman to give K a sort of one-on-one lovemaking session is one of the coolest sci-fi visuals I've seen in recent years. It even retroactively makes the memories of Deckard & Rachel's relationship more engaging to hear about than it was to witness in the original (classic film or not, that particular aspect of Blade Runner always struck me as rather obligatory and perfunctory), but I'll stop right there, at the risk of spoiling 2049 any further than I already have.Anyway, like I said before, Blade Runner 2049 isn't a perfect film, and I can't help but feel like it could've been better with a shorter running time and a slightly more accessible tone on the whole, but I also can't help but find it a compelling cinematic experience anyway; the visuals are breathtaking, the concepts and themes are fascinating and genuinely thought-provoking, and it's the rare sequel to an iconic original that (mostly) avoids just coasting on nostalgia audiences may hold for the first film, but rather, actually does something to further develop the world created in the original, making for a ""blade"" that, flaws and all, I didn't regret running at all.",Blade Runner 2049
771,reviewer135,"Cute story with flying cars and ""Her"" reprieve",4,27 January 2018,Ok I missed something. They restart making Tyrell corp making replicants and some of the new replicants are now the Blade Runners to hunt down 1st gen replicants.Wasn't the whole point of the original blade runner was that the 1st gen replicants had a built in death date(except for Rachel)??? They should all be dead by now?So the new Corporation is desperate to find the baby because they feel the baby would be the key for Replicants making Replicants and is a good thing. And the underground Replicants want to find the baby to protect the replicant race. And the blade runner is working under direction of the police is charged to find and destroy the baby to avoid the baby being a martyr for the Replicants. If that is the gist of the movie then why is the new corporation helping the Blade Runner with old records and investigations of the Replicants. I guess ultimately the Company did kill the police chief and was using the Blade Runner as a rabbit to track him to the child. It just seems that in the end they are both working towards the same goal to find the child to save her. So why were they fighting? Rough story line that just seems forced.,Blade Runner 2049

It felt like scenes were not always necessary, not always connected and as a whole it wasn't really telling a story but rather moments in a life, trying to address different kinds of problems/topics related to artificial humans without actually going in depth. It was like someone had (sometimes really good) ideas and wanted to put them in the movie without considering whether it makes sense for the characters or not.
I don't know if I was distracted by Ryan Gosling but I felt like watching Drive or Only God Forgives where we have beautiful scenes, that seem to have an ""artistic"" goal rather than telling a story. Maybe Ryan tries really hard to look like a robot, I don't know...Also in a sequel they shouldn't try to copy the original so much, they should be bold and try something new.

773,tim-137-552735,Well - that was a disappointment,4,8 October 2017,"How self-important can a movie be? For an answer watch Blade Runner 49. Ponderous direction, with endless close-ups of the main characters doing, well, nothing really. Clichéd huge empty rooms with nothing other than designer baddie lair chic. Why would anyone sit alone in on a platform accessed by floating stairs for any other reason than being a world domination meanie? The self-regard was in total contrast to the original movie, that brimmed with ideas, and had many memorable scenes that were individually more exciting than the total time for this long boring sequel There were no big ideas either. Nothing to come close to replicating (see what I did there) the imagination of Phillip K Dick's original story. The science fiction was also out of date. The original was pre-Apple and Google and foretold of how the future might look. The 49 version appeared to have no awareness of the tech developments of the past 20 years. The design was also out of date, with the post Blade Runner Matrix having already presented that mix of future and past. The acting was rescued by the arrival of Harrison Ford, and he showed the younger cast members a few things about holding the centre stage. Ryan Gosling needs to find a few new expressions.

While taking it on a new path, influences are in there from different sources but this feels like it's own film. It also feels unique despite numerous attempts at sci-fi world building this decade alone.  It takes its time and thank god for that. You really get a sense this was the film, the creators were wanting. A bold blockbuster in an age where fast paced/quick cut edits are all you see in big budget blockbusters.  Blade runner 2049 was a delight.",Blade Runner 2049
775,fundaquayman,BladeRunner Wannabee 2017,5,5 October 2017,"After watching from start to end of the credits, I wonder what ""secret sauce"" I had missed that had the press and all the fans' see the sequel as ""better than the original,"" ""Best movie of the year!"" and being able to compare this film and Villenueve to the work of Stanley Kubrick.BLADERUNNER2049 employs the latest CG techniques and effects and brought a few new ideas for the genre that I expect to see subsequent attempts to further improve. But aside from a few nice touches and obviously having spent a good chunk of the budget on the digital effects to create impressive visuals for the film, none of it points to innovation that betters the original.Of all the scenes in BLADERUNNER2049 that try to work off-of and improve upon what we liked in BLADERUNNER(1982), the original still does a much better job convincing us of the future where countries and nationality have less meaning than the category/class of existence to which we are assigned to - either to serve, lead, or follow.With the top-billing cast, you'd expect the audience to be challenged to decide which actor successfully steals which scene(s) over the others... in my opinion, other than some of the moments with Ana De Armas (playing a VR romantic companion) and Sylvia Hoecks (basically a Terminator-type character that reminds us of Famke Janssen from 10-15 years back), the lines and story just didn't seem allow the actors and scenes to work effectively enough to convince us this was any more than actors playing characters from their previous, more acclaimed, work - we see Ryan Gosling playing ""Driver"" from DRIVE (2011) in the year 2049. We see Harrison Ford playing Deckard with a heavy touch of Richard Kimble (The FUGITIVE, 1993). We see Jared Leto in one of his worst performances to date - it is as if he was trying to mimic Christopher Walken reading out lines from TRUE ROMANCE (1993), but with a delivery that comes across as if he's reading the material for the first time. Robin Wright starts off strong and finishes strong, but somehow in between manages to be put into a surprisingly bad scene - with some of the worst lines that seem to be aiming as either a conflict resolve, plot-twist, or a L.A. CONFIDENTIAL ""Rolo Tomasi"" moment - seriously, this was one of the worst scenes in the movie that rivaled all the scenes with Jared Leto where he was asked to speak.What made BLADERUNNER(1982) a sleeper that took years to grow into a cult hit and a milestone in cinema, is its ability to make the audience ask questions that isn't forced upon us - we see young Deckard being asked to do a job that he wasn't given the ability to question, but in the end he, along with the audience are led to ask ourselves not only the question, ""What makes us Human?"" but ""What makes one Human more deserving of life and freedom than another?"" In BLADERUNNER2049, we no longer question our existence, our purpose, or our rights to freedom... maybe those ideas are already cliche's in cinema at this point. In BLADERUNNER2049, the audience is instead constantly being asked to focus on asking ""Wow, Replicants can now do that?"" BLADERUNNER(1982) allowed us to takeaway with questions that apply to our time and world, but it does not attempt to cram these concepts and existentialist questions onto the audience in place of entertainment value - existentialism and intellectual appeals aside, it's a great adaptation of Film Noir into Science Fiction, and is above all a great movie.In the first film, the enemy was time and the hunted - in turn, no one was safe. In BLADERUNNER2049, the enemy is a character packaged like a GQ fall/winter fashion spread, along with a battalion of Agent Smith's(MATRIX) led by agent Luv (a combination of TERMINATOR/AgentSmith/X-Men). As to the ambition of the Dr. Evil character (played by Leto)? That is never addressed beyond a cliché claim of world-domination - simple layman-deduction would point to the fact that if you can own the ability to create life, then what higher-level achievements are you looking to attain - If it's an upgrade for a ""replicant"" to be able to pro-create, don't humans already have that ability without the need of higher-technology?BLADERUNNER2049 is a mash-up of ideas and devices employed by critically acclaimed and/or hit films made in the past 20 years (i.e. MATRIX, HER, SOLARIS, & Mamoru Ishii's AVALON, etc). While it utilizes the most updated audio and visual technology to align with what is the best in class, it falls short in having a story that can drive the film for audience to not start looking at their watches (or cellphones) after the 2nd Jared Leto monologue.last but not least, the duration of the film could have been cut by at least 30' and it would have been the same story, but I guess fans of seeing Ryan Gosling posing pensively may disagree. Now that BLADERUNNER has a sequel, as a die-hard fan of the original 1982 cinema version, I just hope someone else will make another attempt to do the story and its characters right. We need a CG Rachel as much as we needed a CG Princess Leia in Starwars: Rogue1.",Blade Runner 2049
776,Aodhanrooney,"A fine comeback, but tiring!",5,11 October 2017,"Thirty-five years onward since Ridley Scott's 1982 original Blade Runner hit theatres, now the long awaited sequel finally comes out. The question stands ""was it worth the wait?"" Blade Runner 2049 opens to an amazing soundtrack from the talents of composer Hans Zimmer, followed by a fabulous production design with an amazing visual style (more advanced and modern than the original). So far, this gives the audience a hint that there are numerous doors left open for a possible expanded universe, which is, by far, cool! Expectations are huge and satisfactory, but 2049 suffers from a story-line that could have been shortened down from its overlong 163 minutes run-time to the 117 minutes of the 1982 original. It's basically an overlong police procedural episode that is totally unnecessary. While the visual effects and style is nothing short of amazing, the plot can easily make audiences feel less about the movie, followed by boredom. The performances of Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford (whom has limited screen time) are fine, but this isn't enough to overcome what is tiring about the movie; and considering it's poor box-office performance at the weekend, the release of future sequels might be unlikely, but never say never. Plus, the movie lacks action scenes, as did the original and I feel a movie called 'Blade Runner' (and given its premise) should have more action scenes. The chances of this happening in future sequels is anyone's guess.",Blade Runner 2049

Good looking, cold hearted, ruthless ice maiden. 2: Dystopian atmosphere & set design. 3: Believable decayed future Earth setting. 4: Visual FX were seamless although not as pretty as Blade Runner (1982).Bad: 1: Editing was missing in action. Most of the film needed a lot more editing shots ran for ages which needed trimming. This created an overblown excessively long movie which was boring for long stretches of screen time.I feel asleep at least twice due to how boring it was. 2:Directing was very weak from the usually reliable Denis Villeneuve. 3:Story was very weak. Actors were given nothing to work with character wise. 4: Harrison Ford was utterly wasted. He has perhaps 10 min's screen time & about 30 lines of unmemorable dialog. Waste of the actor in an extended cameo for about 3 key scenes only.The movie just does not work properly either it needed at least 1 hour editing away to pick the pace up. As it stands now this is a very forgettable poorly conceived sequel which adds nothing to the original & even takes away a little goodwill due to how poorly this feels as you watch it unfold at a snail pace.I cannot believe how badly they dropped the ball either it looks perfect but just feels empty as the actors are given nothing to work with so it does not work at all & deserves to be a massive financial failure as it does not deserve any box office success.The power of the Hollywood hype machine cannot stop user reviews from telling the truth either!!!",Blade Runner 2049

How the director told the story ruined the movie.If he told the story at the normal speed the movie would just be a little more than an hour. The real movie lasted more than 2 and a half hours which means every action is at less than half speed and long periods of silence.I won't call it an action movie since there was very little action.It was made a 3D movie for no reason at all.

I'd seen the original at the pleading of fans my age who wouldn't shut up about it being this great sci-fi masterpiece of a movie. It most certainly was not that and anybody that tries to convince you otherwise is an obsessed individual. The sequel however is a sci-fi masterpiece, the catch is you really do need to watch the original as it is full of callbacks to it. Thankfully you can watch the movies in any order and still have the same outcome of an experience, overall good.

784,JSVoid,Absolute modern masterpiece,10,3 August 2019,"In a dystopian, sad reality we are introduced to our new main character, Officer K. This is a similar but more conflicted character than Harrison Ford's character from the first film, because the events of the film lead him to believe he is more than he believed. Although he is a similar character, he is also entirely different, and his emotions are portrayed through small emotions and facial expressions, which is different than Rick Deckard from the last film.Ryan Gosling's acting, and the rest of the cast for that matter is incredibly subtle, but impactful. With everything being a reaction to the actions and dialogue spoken in the film, it matches the mood and visual storytelling of the film, instead of everything being spoken and told through dialogue.That is why I love this film so much. It has a meaning and a distinct message, but it still has an incredibly interesting story and world.The cinematography is perfect, with some traditional rules applied, but also Roger Deakins' own touch and style applied. The colours pop and portray the world in a different way, instead of making the whole film grey and brown, it delivers a contrast between the massive world of Los Angeles and the smaller world of Las Vegas.Finally, on the action. The fight scene at the end is realistic but still stylized with its set piece. It is not a massive Hollywood style battle with the whole city blowing up, it is a small but significant fight scene that is suspenseful and delivered very well. The cinematography perfectly matches it too, with the lighting being very dim and drastic, but keeping it still stylized.The truth is, I could talk about this film all day, so I will finish with this. If you love film, and you love science fiction, watch this film. For your own sake. It is one of the only big films today that stays true to using practical effects, telling an interesting story, and delivering a meaningful and shocking message all at the same time.",Blade Runner 2049

786,peterfaure,"Visually stunning and thought provoking, but not flawless",9,16 October 2017,"So, I didn't expect much from this sequel when it was announced, but since the original 'Blade Runner' is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made (if not the greatest), I had to see it anyways. As I often do, I didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers before going.So, where do we start... While not perfect, and inferior to the original, this is still a great movie. Visually it's simply stunning and the actors are all excellent. Just as importantly, or maybe even more so, like the original it combines a slow pace and fantastic ambiance to create an introspective mood and invite reflection on some important themes and issues of our time. (although, maybe, lacking a dialogue with the same power as the Roy Batty monologue at the end of the first movie).As some negative reviewers said, it is slow..... but that works well with the story and its intent to create a very clear, pervasive mood rather than to dazzle with dumb car chases, gunfights, or explosions,not to mention pushing the viewer to form his own opinions. The boringpart is subjective: for viewers who like to be challenged intellectually I'd say many action movies are a lot more boring. Nothing wrong with escapist movies, which I also enjoy when I'm in the right mood, but it doesn't change the fact that they're inherently much more predictable, superficial and formulaic. In other words, entertaining but intellectually boring. Regarding Blade Runner 2049, one disappointment, though, to be honest, was the soundtrack: aside from being too loud, it really consists mostly of weird sounds/noises etc. While they do heighten the mood at times, or fit the atmosphere, they are not really not up to the lofty standards of the photography, the action, or the direction.Also, the plot could have been a little tighter, and while the slow pace is what this movie needed, I'm not convinced it really had to be this long (or to touch on so many themes, as it does). Still, it's a fantastic, and unique, viewing experience, and even with its imperfections it does create a believable (if gloomy and depressing) dystopian vision of the future, and touches on themes that could spark endless debate and reflection. And herein lies its beauty: shallow popcorn movies will have faded from everybody's memory in weeks. A movie like Blade Runner 2049 will inspire us and challenge us,whether we agree with some of its vision or not, maybe even whether we love it or hate it, for years to come.",Blade Runner 2049
787,esthercross,this film appreciates lurid yellow almost as much as me,10,29 October 2017,"I found the atmosphere of the 1985 'Blade Runner' uniquely unsettling yet strangely moreish so I was delighted to feel that many qualities of the Original had been seamlessly carried over. The film managed to really capture the chilling magnitude of the over industrialised dystopian world. There was an eye feast of fascinating sculptures and settings. What the film achieved so well was very cinematic contrasts. The early on flight sequences show the domineering shapes of the city and the air itself is muddy with pollution. An effective backdrop for the lurid, neon lights of the leering Japanese commercials. When 'K's mission takes him to the Wallace Corporation the murky landscape changes to sharp clean architectural lines and set choices that are impressive works of art. The film managed to achieve an extraordinary art-house feel despite its blockbuster proportions. I know what will not go by unmentioned in most reviews; the frequency of breasts in this film. In my opinion I don't feel that the film was misogynous in tone for its use female nudity and subservient artificial intelligence. I think the points when woman where sexualised, where grotesque in tone to highlight how our future world has the potential for excessive objectification in its quest to fulfil an uncontrolled appetite for fantasy. It also fits in with the dystopian sense of excessive up-scaling. The twists and turns of the story kept my mind enticed and I didn't notice the sneaky extra hour added to the conventional running time. The plot manages to smartly swerve any predictable plot points. The creativity alone would have kept me satisfied but the film for me managed to deliver the on all elements. 'Blade Runner 2049' also has a fantastic score which pulled me fully into the story and I could feel the mechanical tonality and bass reverberating through my chair!",Blade Runner 2049

Given the complicated plot it manages to keep it's viewers engaged with, it is something of a masterpiece of cinematography.The dialogue is smart, and while there may be no powerfully emotional monologue such as the famous one at the end of the original film - the direction manages to do so much brilliance with the camera and with the film's pacing that the dialogue is often unnecessary.",Blade Runner 2049

Too many plot devices which resolve to nothing or to nothing plausible. Too much action without good story behind, and some pseudo philosophical lines which are obvious BS or have no special meaning in the story.

793,Glyn-52-910242,A very worthy sequel,9,1 September 2018,"My 3rd favourite film of all time after 'Star Wars' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', is the original Bladerunner. I must have watched it at least 50 times, throughout all its different versions.
So when I heard there was a sequel coming out, I was quite excited to say the least.I knew it would probably go one of two ways. You can't make a sequel to something like Bladerunner and have people think it's 'ok'. People are going to either love it or hate it. 
For me, I love it. I was very very happy when I first saw it at the Cinema, and so relieved they'd pulled it off.So, what do I like about it so much?
I think it's mostly the way they have a continuation of the original story which is deep and different, but have stayed true to so many things that made the original so excellent.
The overall pacing of the film, the dramatic backdrops, the city, the flying cars.. and even the rain.. all make it instantly feel like the original Bladerunner.The original soundtrack was done by Vangelis, as every fan knows. The new soundtrack was done by the true master of movie soundtracks, Hans Zimmer, and he has done an excellent job. The soundtrack is modern, but reminiscent of the original Vangelis offering. There are even some direct nods to the original soundtrack, which when they happen such as in the 'tears in rain' track, are very moving and really put the icing on the cake.With regards the atmospherics, the only thing I could fault is that the original film had some very dramatic halo type lens flare effects on the lighting of the flying cars. They haven't used this halo effect this time, which is a real shame as it was very dramatic in the original and would have completed the effects to match those of the original. Maybe something for a special edition? :)As far as acting goes, having Harrison Ford was obviousley a must, and he plays his part well. But the amazing fact for me is that despite being a huge fan of Harrison Ford (remember my top 3 films all have Harrison Ford as the lead) I felt myself investing all my emotions more in Ryan Goslings character, K, more then I did in Deckard. Ryan Gosling plays his character really well, and he and the scriptwriters have pulled off a miracle by making him the main character, without disappointing Ford fans.
You just can't help but feel for K, who obeys without question like a loyal puppy, while being treated like dirt by pretty much everyone in the film.Again, as with the soundtrack, there are some nods to characters from the original film that are a really nice touch. The CGI Rachel and real Edward James Olmos reprising their roles, albeit briefly, are worthy additions that will please all fans I'm sure.Some people don't seem to like Bladerunner 2049 for some reason, but if like me you are a massive fan of the original who watched it at its theatrical release and then many times since, I'm sure you'll love it.The whole film is a work of art. Watch it on a large TV with good sound turned up, and you'll get the full benefit of this modern masterpiece.",Blade Runner 2049

Moderate in the sense that I hoped this sequel is better than the original. What a disappointment! I watched it with growing irritation: nothing happens for so long time, predictable too, it was very easy to guess that the replicant child was K. All scenes took forever and not even close to enthralling. And then the darkness, the depressing, the ever going rain in the scenes. No, this was my worst movie of 2017. I don't understand the high ratings. This movie is NOT worth watching and a complete waste of money.",Blade Runner 2049
795,reaver80808-552-7999,Definitely Blade Runner!,9,9 November 2017,"Without doubt this is a sequel and not just another remake, touted as a sequel. It is very much it's own movie. And what a bleak, yet beautiful movie it is!As I said, it very much a new plot. This isn't the 80's Blade Runner with new actors and new effects. It is a thought provoking and neatly constructed detective/meaning of existence story, set against one of the best dystopian backdrops I have yet seen in cinema. I recently watched the first movie, and I have to say, the sequel has a better, much more solid plot than the original.Hanz Zimmer's score is perfection! It is reminiscent of the first movie, but adds something totally new. It is haunting and oppressive, which sits perfectly into the grimy, rainy scenes depicted throughout.The acting by everyone involved is excellent. Gosling, as always shines, with a very subtle, often vulnerable portrayal of the lead character, K. Ford plays his usual, but always great, gruff and somewhat exasperated almost-hero, but this time with much more sensitivity. The real stand-out performance for me though, was Sylvia Hoeks as the character, Luv. Though not in the movie that much, she makes a huge impact whenever on screen. Somewhat mesmerizing, while being totally malevolent at the same time. The entire cast, however put in 100%.If I were to level one complaint at the movie, it would be the running time. It could have been done to the same effect in a slightly shorter time. It can revel a little too long in it's own sense of worth. That being said, it is a visual feast throughout, so you can almost forgive it's pretensions.If you like sci-fi, with some brains and a lot of feeling, this is possibly the best I have seen in a long while. It's not fast paced, or action packed, but it will make you think. It is also dark, but beautiful. Just be sure to choose a cinema with comfy seating! It is however definitely one to see on the big screen.",Blade Runner 2049
796,TG22Film,Justice done to a Sci-Fi classic,9,2 February 2020,"This movie might have a very slow pacing to it, but more often than not, that just serves as a way of making the important scenes even more stunning and atmospheric. This film ignores the predictable formula of modern blockbusters, and follows more in the footsteps of the original to develop a sequel and a believable follow up to a film which was nearly 40 years before it (not to mention also set in the future, or pretty much the present day based on the original timeline!)On the acting - Gosling delivers an understated performance as a conflicted replicant. De Armas is captivating as the holographic love interest. Leto plays the psychopathic corporate boss and fits the bill pretty well. Ford resurrects Deckard with his older/wiser outlook and I thought Carla Juri was also superb in spite of her relatively short time on camera.Is there anything much to criticise? I wasn't sure about the K/Deckard fight sequence with the Elvis songs. I guess some humour was needed somewhere(!) but this didn't quite work for me. It didn't spoil the film though, because 99% of it is a spectacle.The story follows the replicant K most of the way through. The puzzle develops and teases us as to whether or not he is important, or whether he is just a pawn caught up in a web of corporate greed and rebellion in the blade runner universe. We're led to different locations of the blade runner universe as he endeavours on his search for the truth. The audio flashbacks to what other characters have said earlier in the film is an effective way of creating the feeling of confusion and disillusion e.g 'but you've never seen a miracle'I've absolutely no issue with the soundtrack unlike a lot of other fans. I actually thought this was delivered perfectly on some key scenes in the film, including the bizarre but absolutely amazing love scene involving K, Joi and Mariette. The sea fight towards the end was also superbly orchestrated. In fact, those are probably my two favourite scenes of the film.Villeneuve is welcome to direct more visually stunning sci-fi on this scale. I hope to see more films of this calibre in the near future.....A rare case of a great sequel.",Blade Runner 2049
797,michaellaney15,A Perfect Film,10,23 March 2018,"Blade Runner 2049 is a very multifaceted and complex film that offers commentary on not only artificial intelligence but human emotion. Joi remarks at the quarter way mark in the film that 'K' is made up of genetic code and she's made up of binary code. This is a very important part in the film because it details a major theme. Computers and humans aren't that different. An experiment to test this theory is to try to distinguish replicants from humans in the film just based on their behavior (it's futile by the way). This point is also hammered in when 'K' is tasked to kill a certain human. He's reluctant stating that humans have souls. Lieutenant Joshi then remarks that 'K' has been doing alright without a soul. Whether you believe in the existence souls or not shouldn't impede the understanding of the message that soul's aren't necessary to be human. About a third of the way into Blade Runner 2049 'K' learns living & dying for a personally meaningful cause enriches life beyond innate modular human/machine functions. The complexity of this movie is what makes it so perfect. It requires multiple viewings to take in the breadth and layers of visual, auditory and thematic structure. I could talk about this movie all day but instead i'll leave you with the strong recommendation to watch it.",Blade Runner 2049
798,adean81,Review for Blade Runner: 2049,7,11 October 2017,"Blade Runner: 2049Even though I haven't seen the first Blade Runner, I was able to enjoy this film and learn the world as it went on. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie, which takes place 30 years after the first film. The main character ""K"" played by Ryan Gosling, uncovers a mystery that could change the game for androids (aka replicants) in this universe. Speaking of Ryan Gosling, he does a great job acting in this movie despite playing a serious character.At around 2 hours and 45 minutes, this movie sounds long but is actually well paced. The first 2/3rds of the movie move along well, while also having several scenes that hold on a shot. It's the mystery plot that really moves the story along and unfolds in an interesting way. The last third of the movie feels a bit rushed to wrap up the story and I found the ending to be a bit anti-climatic.A big reason why I enjoyed this movie, not only do I like a good mystery, is the cinematography. The visuals, the sets, the landscapes, this movie looks gorgeous! All of the sets look real and gives a great sense of what life is like in this future world. The sound is also well done, with a few moments that I found out of place. The soft notes in the background worked really well and contrasted the moments of booming synthesizers. The music really compliments the noir setting of this world.Without spoiling too much of the movie, there is one story line that I thought was intriguing and emotional. There is a love story between a replicant and a hologram. I find it fascinating that two forms of artificial intelligence seek companionship with other, one without a physical form. It raises this question: of do these replicants to have feeling and emotions? Can they be programmed to simulate feelings? While these questions, and several others, are not answered, it is still thought-provoking.There are a lot of things this movie nails, and a few that don't hit, such as the ending, and the unanswered questions. Overall this is a movie that looks great on the big screen with an engaging plot that will have you questioning what is actually going on. It is a dense story with a lot of callbacks to the first movie. Eventually I might watch the original Blade Runner, but for now, I'd rather watch 2049 a second time.",Blade Runner 2049

So many still shots of Gosling brooding. They could have shortened it easily by a half hour. Just dragged everything out. I wish it was more exciting. Barely any action. The action it did have was good. Just so hard to get into and pay attention.",Blade Runner 2049
801,brentwilliams,Worst science fiction movie ever made.,1,29 January 2020,I watch mostly sci-fi and I've never seen a sci-fi movie I didn't at least kind of like. Until now. This is literally the worst sci-fi movie ever made. It is sooooo boring. Too much time was spent just showing landscapes or a ship landing or Gosling just broodingly staring at the camera. Like get on with it. You could have made it easily a half hour shorter. Not that shorter is better in general but I would have rather wasted 2 hours of my life than 2.5 or whatever it was.,Blade Runner 2049
802,Geoff1963,"Very, very good",10,7 October 2017,"It really is very, very good. I saw it only in 2-D, IMAX and 4DX are probably even better.

803,pep000,Extrordinary,10,15 October 2017,"This is an art film masquerading as a Hollywood blockbuster, and is simply extraordinary. It succeeds on all levels- as a sequel to one of the best films every made, as an unsettling depiction of a future that feels very plausible, as a stunning visual art film, and as an engrossing detective/action film with philosophical overtones.I honestly couldn't how good it was.

806,nimdude,Sequel better than the original (short),10,5 October 2017,"Denis Villeneuve's new film Blade Runner 2049 is nothing short of ... just downright amazing. Everything about this movie is practically perfectly executed from the gripping and fluid performances to the color infused cinematography to the powerful soundtrack and sound design the film practically never skips a beat. The only flaw that wasn't really even a flaw in my opinion was that some scenes dragged for quite a while but I believe that the slow camera work was intended. The film has everything that made the philosophical original (final cut) a flawed masterpiece just it has everything the original was lacking.Gostling fit perfectly for the role of 'K', being emotionless but so full of emotion. Sylvia Hoeks was someone very worthy of a mention, giving an effectively eerie performance. Jared Leto as always is intensively remarkable and glued my eyes to the screen in each and every scene. Harrison gave one of the best and most emotional performances I have seen in his career.Now Hans Zimmer again blew me away completely. I got chills every 30 seconds when the cinematography and the score perfectly intertwined into an extraordinary absorbing symphony that makes the world of Blade Runner so real despite how unimaginable it actually is.10/10",Blade Runner 2049
807,gwenynamnam,Long and boring!,1,4 March 2018,"How can this movie have 8,2 i think there is a mistake! Seriously the graphics are beautiful but that was painful, it's way too long, wayyyy too long!! Apparently this movie can also win an oscar for best picture, maybe that explain why i don't like it so much, we're not on the same page the academy awards and i. It's not because is almost 3 hours long that it's a masterpiece you know! 
I wanted to like it, but the pace plus 2 hours 43 minutes of Ryan ""pokerface"" Gosling is too much for me! That guy is unbearable, he has no facial expression, no emotions, it's like watching a robot it's so annoying!",Blade Runner 2049
808,nordicsoul,Blade Runner 2049 is as good a sequel as I've seen,9,9 October 2017,"When I first caught news of Ridley Scott's intention to reboot Blade Runner, I was skeptical to say the least. Blade Runner is after all a timeless science fiction masterpiece unlike any Hollywood has ever conceived since its release in 1982. Also take into consideration Scott's recent Alien reboot misfires (Prometheus and Covenant) which only tarnished the franchise from my perspective. All of my fears dissipated the moment I heard that Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario, Prisoners) would be at the helm for Blade Runner 2049. In just four short years, Villeneuve has risen from obscurity into one of the top directors in Hollywood today. Villeneuve's attention to detail and his ability to unravel cerebral narratives with often minimal dialogue puts him in a unique class of directors that include Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. In addition to Villeneuve, cinematographer Roger Deakins (Sicario, Prisoners, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption) and film scorer Hans Zimmer (Batman: The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar) were crucial additions to the Blade Runner 2049 team and are at the heart of the film's astounding beauty.I was incredibly curious how they would depict the future, in this case Los Angeles in 2049. Though the dystopian look and feel is every bit as effective of the original, what elevated Blade Runner 2049 was the additional depth captured as Gosling's character travels outside of the city to San Diego and Las Vegas where the climate and terrain is much more reminiscent of Mad Max (desert, industrial waste, post-apocalyptic, etc.). To me this really tells the complete story of a world ravaged by climate change and radiation, which has left the planet barren of all plant life. Like many of the better science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 is a cautionary tale that speaks to the imminent environmental disaster that awaits humans as our leaders stand idly by. My hope is this message isn't drowned-out by the allure of the hyper- sexualized/hedonistic digital AI culture that has become one of the few means people have to connect in a society void of any real emotional or physical release. It is meant to be a distraction both in life and in this story, which I don't think everyone is going to understand or appreciate. To that end; anyone calling out the film as being misogynistic, I think it's important to acknowledge the evolution of both the entertainment industry and the internet through pornography and what that trajectory might look like in a city like Los Angeles 32 years from now as we continue to develop artificial intelligence and robotics. To change that narrative would be to lie about the current state of affairs in relation to climate change and technology. At a time when we're standing on the edge of disaster, it's imperative that we take a long, hard look at what kind of world we'll be leaving for generations to come. Like it's predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 pulls no punches.In terms of the performances, I can't think of a contemporary film that did as good a job with casting as Blade Runner 2049. Harrison Ford and Robin Wright in particular are extraordinary and both deserve to be in the conversation come Oscar season. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as well, but due to the stoic nature of his character I don't think had to push himself quite as far.Though I've heard some rumblings of the runtime being a bit too long (2 hours a 43 minutes) I have to say the movie seemed much shorter to me. Like all Villeneuve films, the pacing requires some patience and there's a great deal of texture to each scene. If you're not a fan of this style of direction/storytelling, Blade Runner 2049 might be a bit tedious. Personally, I go to the movies to be transported and ideally feel some sort of emotional response. In the case of Blade Runner 2049 both metrics were off the charts for me (A+). I would recommend seeing the film in 2D (3D seems like it would be overwhelming and unnecessary) and if available, in IMAX. The cinematography, sound design and score are unparalleled and though the script isn't perfect, Blade Runner 2049 is a remarkable film worthy of the name. Like most films of this caliber, I intend on seeing it at least once more in the theater before really gauging its effect, but for now let's just say I can't think of a more complete and provocative science fiction film to come out in the new millennium.",Blade Runner 2049
809,heyitskeane,Sensational,10,2 August 2018,"Its a thrilling, stunning masterpiece; equalling (over) its powerful predecessor.Blade Runner 2049 is just amazing. It's everything I wanted in a Blade Runner sequel and so much more.The film is visually stunning. The visual effects in this movie is just one-of-a-kind and beautiful. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is just a joy to witness on the big screen.The plot of 2049 expands on the Blade Runner lore, widening the dystopian world first created by Ridley Scott in 1982. Denis Villenueve brings his best film yet, with excellent writing and directing.The characters in this film are great overall, with well-rounded performances. In the film, Ryan Gosling's Officer K really stands out. His character, although mostly stoic (for SPOILER reason), is just terrific and moving. Gosling brings a dark, emotional, gritty performance which is just perfect for his character and setting. Harrison Ford returns as Rick Deckard from the original and brings along an amazing performance to his character. Deckard is visibly and mentally shaken and skeptical in his time, continuing his character of Deckard.The film is in itself a stand-alone movie. In my opinion, I wouldn't call it a sequel. Yes, it is continuing and expanding from the original and yes it is in the same universe. But it does not rely on it. At all. There are no flashbacks to inform the general audience who have not seen the original, there is no convenient re-telling of the original, there is none of that. This is an independent film, conveying its own tale in its own way.For me, there were no major flaws with the film. Although after my second viewing, the pace of the movie begins to form a flaw in the film. The film is slow paced, with unusually long shots and pans. With my intial viewing, the pace did not strike me as much of a flaw, but on the second viewing, it did begin to bother me. For fans of Blade Runner (like me), the slow pace might be a signature characteristic in the film, highlighting it from other sci-fi films. However for the general audience, it might not be as well appreaciated.Overall, the movie is amazing and is one of the best films I've seen. Best film of 2017 for me. For fans, this will be a delight and it is highly recommended. For the general audience, if you want to experience something different in science fiction, in neo-noir dystopic films, then I would recommend 2049. If you just watch movies to switch your brains off for a couple of hours and watch some action and explosions, this movie is NOT for you.Tip: If you are interested in 2049 and have not seen the original Blade Runner, do it.",Blade Runner 2049
810,joonaslaine,"This one is for sci-fi fans, not for me",5,16 March 2019,"Maybe it was because I haven't seen the original one, but for me this felt bit hard to get focus at the start and the build up of replicants being so different of humans didn't catch to me. Human robots but not robots and so on. Also the movie was too low tempo for me.The story itself gave me some Matrix vibes of the main character 'K' being build as the chosen one and shot down as not being the chosen one and still ending up saving everything and in a way being the chosen one. That was a hard sentence. But I really liked the story. Unfortunately there were parts that I would liked to be more centered like 'killing' of I'd Joi and K realizing it was all fake love. With the movie being as long as it is, some time could've been used for this sub-plot.Overall I unfortunately got bored watching this so I guess this kinda style just isn't for me. I liked the plot and the theme and I have liked many movies with the same theme but this just didn't work for me. That's why the low score.",Blade Runner 2049
811,Digory,Blade Runner 2049 might be to Blade Runner as Aliens is to Alien,10,8 October 2017,"And maybe to an extent Denis Villeneuve to James Cameron in achieving such a feat.When it was announced that a sequel was planned, I was the least enthusiastic. I felt that it was unnecessary and a forced cash-in on the resurgence of science fiction franchises like Prometheus, Mad Max, and Star Wars. After seeing the movie, one could say that the movie still checks out on the points mentioned above but what Denis Villeneuve has created is something truly special.The visuals are a wonder to behold especially in IMAX. The 3D employed here is subtle and immersive, appropriately so for a movie of this kind. The score is also superb, reminiscent of Vangelis score with a few touches from Hans Zimmer. I admired the amount of care given to the movie's established trademarks from the feel of the film down to the technical aspects.With a story that intrigues while expanding the universe, Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy equal to its predecessor. Seeing the trailers back then, it was hard to imagine they could pull it off but they succeeded on all fronts. In my opinion, this is the best film of 2017 so far.",Blade Runner 2049

Same visuals, same type of story telling, same aesthetics, amazing music, and a perfect follow up to the story. It is almost as it was filmed during the production of the first one (like BTTF 2).If you are thinking that probably is just a lame script that kind of worked like a sequel and then, Harrison Ford was hired just to make a few bucks, and is just a shitty movie that they put the name ""blade runner"" as a bait, well I'm glad to tell you that you are ABSOLUTELY WRONG.

As we all know Denis Villeneuve is the best sci-fi director without a doubt so we were pretty sure that he could pull this off. This was the decade where Harrison Ford was returning to his past major franchises , be it Indiana Jones or star wars and in each he brings back the charm, the personality and the charisma of each original that we knew and loved, it is here where he gives his career best performance and totally steals the Spotlight.

This is the absolutely the best cinematography I've ever seen. The world feels alive, crisp, and real, and some of the wide shots are simply breathtaking.

Both times, sound was truly fantastic and imagery was breathtaking. This truly is a masterpiece of futuristic cinematography with matching music and sound.Being a huge fan of the original Blade Runner (especially the Final Cut), I had feared disappointment. But BR 2049 exceeded my wildest expectations. The bleak, rainy atmosphere of future LA from the first movie was rendered beautifully. The landscapes in the other locations was equally awe-inspiring. And the new soundtrack, while somehow understated and perhaps less melodic, reaches a few wonderful climaxes where it reverts back to the original Vangelis themes.I am also delighted by the slow pace. Finally a science fiction movie that gives me time to take all the impressive imagery in. I was engrossed the whole time.I loved how BR 2049 expands on the original story line. Answering questions, while adding a new twist that truly makes us think about the meaning and value of artificial life. And then finally there's the delight of seeing Deckard again. Now an old man, scarred by sacrifice and impossible love. And finally, the film's climax grabbed me emotionally just like the original did during the ""tears in rain"" scene.For me this is now one of twelve movies I've rated 10/10. Awesome.",Blade Runner 2049
816,StarWarsMoviesSuck,Disappointing,1,6 October 2017,"Admittedly, I did not enjoy the prospects of a Blade Runner sequel, since I considered the first installment to be a one-off story, for which a sequel would ultimately harm.Unfortunately, this movie did just that. I did not like the plot at all, which I considered both ridiculous and tacky, despite being drenched in massive amounts of self-importance. The visuals were nice, and lots of care seemed to be made to maintain the original's style.

818,Fred_Mopkopf,A bold sci fi film for our days.,10,9 November 2020,"2.400+ reviews on this site as of this writing. One half hates the film, the other half loves it. Both factors are a good sign. :-) If you read my other reviews, you will find that I barely give ten stars. Why? Because there rarely is a perfect film. Within the genre of science fiction, for me this is one of them. There are plenty of long, interesting reviews here, and you surely don't need another one repeating details of the film, but let me point out one thing: As I recall, the flak the film got was A) based on it being too long, and B) that people didn't understand it. Now, I think reason B) is rather ironic, as the first 'Blade Runner' was plagued by this apparent necessity for different versions that all had the goal of making the film more or less understandable (depending on Ridley's or the studio's point of view). In my world, 'Blade Runner 2049' was the first film in a very long time the storyline of which I could follow COMPLETELY and which left me satisfied on the way out of the theatre. I could even re-tell the film's story right now (something I can't do with any of the Bond films since 'Casino Royale' by the way), and I'm not even all too much of a Blade Runner nerd. What is there not to understand? And about the film being too long: Don't listen to these people. It doesn't 'linger unnecessarily' (as I have read) on shots, it takes its time in the right manner. Again ironic: This is something Ridley has been hailed for not only on the original 'Blade Runner', but also on his masterpiece 'Alien'. The film is visually absolutely stunning, and it is so because it takes its time. This is a blockbuster sequel that does not follow the Hollywood rule of dumbing everything down. If you love sci fi films and don't have the general urge to check your mobile phone while watching films, go watch 'Blade Runner 2049'. Very simple.",Blade Runner 2049
819,stephen-abraham,Certainly lives up to Philip K Dick's legacy.,9,8 October 2017,"If you loved the tech noir of original, this movie certainly delivers. Visually stunning. The cinematography really is a work of art - its definitely Oscar worthy. Whereas the environment in the first film felt claustrophobic (it was almost a character in the original), the vista in 2049 is broader here but no less a dystopia of decaying mother earth. I'm so glad Ridley didn't direct this - it feels like a fresh pair of eyes cast a new take on the world of the original. The pacing is so reminiscent of the original and there are several throw-backs to the it throughout the film, but they don' feel cliché or simply included for nostalgic purposes. The cast are excellent. I am SO glad I avoided the trailers - would have ruined it for me I recon. Like all excellent sci-fi, I am left with questions about humanity's future. - ""is this really the world we are heading too?"" One of the characteristics of Philip K Dick's work (the ground-breaking sci-fi author of last century) is the question ""what is reality?"". This film certainly lives up to his legacy.

821,who_cares_about_the_IDs_here,Worth 35 years of wait for us,10,5 October 2017,"I went out as soon as I could to watch it. From trailer it seemed to be very interesting and very beautiful, I also watched the original a week before once again. I truly love the original and I enjoyed the soundtrack for the whole week before, nothing is as close to the eerie original blade runner soundtrack. So I went in on the 3D version.I won't spoil a lot. The movie is beautifully shot, although I'll see in 2D as well, because I prefer 2D brightness compared to 3D. The storyline can stand alone in 2049, although that is something I thought at the beginning. The more film goes deeper into the story the more I felt connected to the original film and I think the goers who have not seen the original or did not loved it for the all the weird reasons, will miss out on atmosphere and emotions conveyed in 2049. I enjoyed the duration, I enjoyed the acting, DP (well everyone is right about it). I had a little trouble to navigate into the 2049 storyline though, but I think it was on purpose, because by the end of the movie I still had (like in original blade runner) this monstrous question over (although different this time), I had a different feeling, I had confusion and I had developed love for the character - I think this would not be possible be it more concrete story, so by the end it helped to give the viewer exactly what he went in for (at least for me).Compared to the original, 2049 is more complex film, has a more complex storyline, but is worth every second of watching it. It is worth 30 years of wait. It is worth everything, for those who loved the original this is a beautiful continuation. It left me crying and as well thinking and as well it still leaves lot of questions. This is truly a beautiful film and Villeneuve has done amazing job on any aspect. Music, tension, visuals, acting and everything in 2049 feels complete, some scenes are simply fantastic both in action, physics involved and of course visually. I'm still in awe from this one, still thinking about it, and still having the emotion that I left the cinema with - and this is definitely something we pay money for. It sucks because I think general audience will not be moved by this dark sci-fi, but it is so beautiful and poetic, 2049 is obviously destined to be another cult. I also assume that haters will be saying how complicated this one is compared to the original but I have to say the complexity just made it more beautiful and let's be realistic making a sequel on the original could not be a streamlined story. Go watch 3 shorts as well on youtube to have some questions filled. If I had only one regret and complain about this film it would be that soundtrack album for this is not as beautiful as the original, but I guess that is what Hans Zimmer means, bringing in Vangelis was a very different thing for the original and bringing generic score composer on this one is well not enough creative I guess (nothing against Zimmer, but I was waiting for something more vulnerable as OST), and I would as well say that dialogues are not as powerful as in original, I wanted ""tears in rain"" moment here too, but I guess that is the result of a more complex storyline, we do not get that obvious phrases, but we get such a dense emotions through interior dialogues of characters and the atmosphere that it is enough. Overall words and review from my perspective is just a ramble, go and watch it and love it and feel it and bleed it - this is such a powerful cinematic piece!",Blade Runner 2049

I loved the first one and was excited for this one. But after watching it a few times I still remember almost nothing about it. It literally puts me to sleep every time. I guess Gosling is trying to play a wooden emotionless replicant but he just comes off as bored. The whole pace is slow. It's difficult to remember why we're supposed to care. It has none of the energy, emotion, or urgency of the original. I'll just add that being a huge fan of Vangelis' original score, the music here was sorely disappointing.",Blade Runner 2049

824,bijanadhikari,A Masterpiece of the highest order,10,4 October 2017,"First let me just say that I am not going to spoil any of the plot points of this movie as the director has himself insisted not to and I urge the reviewers to come to respect his wish.Now let me just start by saying the original Blade Runner was one of the most influential sci-fi film to be ever made. Some people may not like it as it is very slow paced and deeply philosophical and I respect their opinion but you cannot deny its legacy. As it so happens Blade Runner 2049 might just fall on the same category. Directed by Denis Villeneuve who directed Incedies, Prisoners(another masterpiece), Arrival, Sicario and Enemy has outdone himself. This is seriously his best film to date. Even though this is a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved in whatsoever he has managed to expand its universe extremely elegantly and marked his directorial trademark in it. I won be surprised if he is put in the same bracket as Kubrick, Spielberg, Tarantino, Scorsese, Eastwood in the coming years. Talking about greatness we have director of photography propelled by Roger Deakins who already had his hands on Shawshawnk Redemption, No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, The Big Lebowski and Fargo to just name a few and to think he has never won an Oscar despite being nominated 13 times. Well this is about to change this year or you cannot ever take Academy seriously because I strongly believe this is his best work. The way he uses color palette is quite remarkable to watch and it might just be one of the best looking film to ever exist. Acting wise Harrison Ford gives one of his performance in a long time. You can just feel he loved working on this film(unlike that reboot on 2015). I have always been a fan of Ryan Gosling since Drive(another Neo-Noir masterpiece) and after watching this I am convinced that he is one of the best actor working today. Jared Leto gives a another stellar performance as expected from an Academy winner. Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas all are impressive with their given role. Another thing that made the original Blade Runner so iconic was the soundtrack. And with this film it is no exception. Though this has Hans Zimmer Benjamin Wallfisch collaborating it feels a individual work like the first one. What else can I say? No praise is enough for what I just witnessed. This is one of those films that will inspire people to be filmmakers, that will make people realize why we go to cinemas and spent our hard earned cash, that will continue to put cinemas as art forms. Just go to the biggest theater possible and witness an piece of modern art put on by extremely visionary and talented people. You will not regret it. 10/10",Blade Runner 2049
825,malthenielsen,Too many inconsistencies,2,31 October 2017,"The original Bladerunner is one of my all time favorite movies. This one is way below average. I fear some people who see this one before the original, will now miss out on the original, as they will assume it is bad as well. Watch the original, is has nothing to do with this thing!Anyway. The strong sides of Bladerunner 2049 are: Nice visuals overall, good scenes here and there; I like the music. It is good if you like to just visuals and a story is not your thing. The pace is slow, the dialogue is very forgettable and boring, even in scenes that offer golden opportunities for memorable lines, for instance the goodbye scene after the root-hologram-robot threesome. Characters are undeveloped; they forget to build sympathy for the heroes. The rebel leader for instance; she should be designed to make you feel either positive or negative toward their cause. As it was, you really don't care if they manage with their revolution or not.K's hologram girlfriend I liked though, they should have made her the main character instead and built the movie around her. For me she was a redeeming factor.*SPOILERS* Now to a very weak part ... the many inconsistencies and illogical things.* The evil robot woman can effortlessly walk into LAPD and kill the police boss and steal forensic evidence. They apparently have no security whatsoever in the LAPD and haven't invented security cameras yet. Also she hangs out in the archives for no reason. * The evil mastermind knows that the evil mastermind from the original knew how to make robots capable of pregnancy; for unknown reasons he decides to not science it by himself, it seems to me that a scientific genius would try to do that. Instead he opts to find a robot daughter, that he has no idea is even alive or dead. His goal is to create *a lot* of robots; why having the robots get pregnant is better than just building them makes no sense and is not explained. He seemingly kills a lot of his robots himself for no reason (he offs two, but it seems to be his general habit); this maybe is the reason he does not have enough. As well, he only has ONE robot and a few goons to his dirty work for him; he seems though to have money to afford more than just ONE agent. When he catches Harrison Ford (Deckard), he gets a really dumb idea to make Deckard give up his daughter: ""Please trade me your daughter for a bad copy (wrong eye color) of your dead wife."" How anybody sane would think somebody would take this trade is beyond me. Then he decides to cart Deckard into space presumably to torture him them there because the torture in space is better than torture on Earth; why not just torture him right away on Earth? In sum, he came off more like being dumb and crazy, rather than a mastermind. * The prostitute is sent to get info on K; she settles for a 2 minute talk, and then just leaves it. Later, K's hologram girlfriend needs a prostitute and randomly call this one - how lucky for the prostitute. I think she is a terrible spy with incredible luck! * K himself is at one point saved from scavengers by missiles mysteriously appearing from the sky; he just goes ""whatever"" and does not seem interested in figuring out where the came from, or if he is bugged. Some investigator. * Deckard sees K has a toy horse that belonged to Deckard's daughter; he does not seem to care where K got this from. Also: An important lead is a sock from Deckard's daughter, that K finds in a piano in Deckard's old flat. Since Ford left the apartment way before his daughter was born (in the original), he must have returned with one of his daughters socks, to stuff it into the piano. But why? Why would somebody risk life and limb to stuff a sock into a piano?At times the movie is repetitive: the toy horse figures so much it gets irritating; the effect of using real company names for future stuff is also overused. Even the cool street scenes get old, as there's too much of them.They tried getting as many things from the original into this one; a few times it worked, most of the time it is just put of place or badly done. The scene with Deckard's old police colleague is evidently there just to get the iconic origami-making policeman into the movie; if you have not seen the original this scene must seem just pointless and leave you wondering if it was about something you missed. But no; it is just pointless and should have been cut out.Overall I'd say probably do not watch it at all; you can maybe watch it at home on a rainy Wednesday evening if you have nothing else to do and then accept the story is nonsense and the characters are weak, and just enjoy the visuals. I nearly walked out of the cinema and probably would not manage to finish it at home.",Blade Runner 2049

827,jpatrick-68632,Worthy,8,6 October 2017,"Date Day! And we used our Senior's discount cards to see 'Blade Runner 2049'. We'd dutifully watched Blade Runner 2019 again to whet our little appetites, and thusly prepared, off we trundled. I didn't fall over or anything and didn't have to go to hospital. WIN! We were a bit hesitant because we like the first one, and also I am not much of a Ryan Gosling fan. He is both lugubrious and named after a young goose.Gozza is a Blade Runner and a replicant and it's fair to say not much loved by his fellows. Or his neighbours for that matter. He takes insults with a shrug. He has a girlfriend. Sort of. In the way you might have 'sort of' had a girlfriend when you changed your relationship status on Facebook to 'it's awkward'.He lives in a slummy sort of building in a slummy sort of city. The city will be familiar to those who know the first movie, although the holograms are more, well, naked. I am not sure what effect ginormous holographic pudenda are supposed to have. And on whom. I expect that this is a niche market from which I am excluded . It still rains a lot. The two are, hopefully, unrelated.There are baddies and there is a new Tyrell. Not to be confused with 'Game of Thrones' Tyrell. Well you wouldn't. It's not his name. 'Wallace' is. But he doesn't wear a kilt, presumably so he cannot be confused with 'William'. He has got ball bearing eyes. To say that he treats his newborn creations with off-handed malice is a significant understatement. His chief helper is the inappropriately named 'Luv'. Her over-active tear ducts add a touch of undeserved humanity. She is not one whom you would want to cross.'Not William' Wallace is manufacturing replicants like a madman but he can't make enough of them to meet demand and thinks that it'd be better if the replicants did their own replicating and there are rumours of some replicant-on-replicant or non replicant-on-replicant action and he wants the result of said shenanigans in the worst possible way. And most of the movie is about whether there is or isn't and if there IS who it is and how many there might be and if there isn't, well it's back to the drawing board for 'not William'. His poor attention to detail could be a reason for his failure.Harrison Ford is in it and still plays Deckard, and you can't help think that he might like to play someone not called Deckard. Or Solo. Or Jones. He lives with a dog that is probably a replicant and a million bottles of scotch that seem legit.The Gozza fights lots of replicants including the big bloke out of Guardians of the Galaxy. There is a tree that is dead but has a date on it. It hasn't got a name. But if it did, I bet it'd be 'Groot'. There is a Dickensian orphanage which may be the source of replicant memories; but are they real, and to whom do they belong?Is it any good? Well on a scale 1-10, where 1 is the execrable and pretentious 'Interstellar', and 10 is 'Starship Troopers', the greatest movie ever made, it's a solid 8. It goes alright. It's a looong movie. The elderly or incontinent will struggle.",Blade Runner 2049
828,dermobreen,Androids dream of wooden horses,9,7 October 2017,"A question I've been asked, given that Blade Runner 2049 is being released thirty-five years after 1982's Blade Runner, is; do I need to have seen the first film? I believe it will make a lot more sense, indeed it may only make sense, if you have seen the first film. The next question is; which version of the first film? Yes, there are seven. For me, and for Ridley Scott, it's The Final Cut version. So before we talk about the new film, trust me, it's complicated. Other preparations you need to make before viewing Blade Runner 2049 are: get a good night's sleep beforehand, use the bathroom and bring a flask and sandwiches. This film is 163 minutes long.At the end of Blade Runner (depending on which version you watched), Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) rides off into the sunset with Rachel (Sean Young), a replicant he fell in love with after ""retiring"" Roy Batty and his mates. Director Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 introduces us to a new Blade Runner named ""K"" (the name given to police personnel who hunt down and ""retire"" replicants), played by Ryan Gosling. K is despatched to the desert to retire a replicant farmer (Dave Bautista). While there he discovers the buried remains of Rachel and a new mystery is born. Along the way he encounters other replicants and eventually, his investigation leads him to Las Vegas where Rick Deckard has been living out his life. Together they embark on solving the mystery.I'm being deliberately obtuse in my exposition because I don't want to give away the plot twists and turns and more importantly, the end.There is a great support cast including Robin Wright who plays K's police chief and Cuban native Ana de Armas who plays K's holographic girlfriend in an emotive performance. Jared Leto turns up as Niander Wallace who has taken over replicant manufacture from the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation.Blade Runner 2049 carries on in the same style as the 1982 film. From the cityscapes to the future it projects, the new film creates a believable 2049, darker and more miserable than 2019 (the time period the 1982 film was set). The sprawling metropolis, the single-colour palettes in the desert, the lighting through water and the framing give a real sense of  the dystopian future ahead. Kudos to cinematographer Roger Deakins. It also continues the central question of the 1982 film: what does it mean to be human? Are just the sum of our memories? Do humans have souls? There is a lot going on. To it's credit, Blade Runner 20149 does not pander to the audience. It assumes they are smart and can deal with these topics without being spoon fed. There is no long exposition to explain the plot. There are twists and turns and Villeneuve knows the audience are intelligent to keep up.Seeing Harrison Ford back in action is a joy. He throws himself back into the role he played 35 years ago with gusto and the film is better for it. He clearly has an affection for the character of Rick Deckard who is probably the most enigmatic character he has ever played. For his part, Ryan Gosling makes an excellent addition to the story line as the new Blade Runner. His expressionless face captures the lack of empathy with which he retires replicants. As the film progresses we see a tender side of him with his girlfriend and his struggling to make sense of dreams from his childhood. His closing scenes, with echoes of The Shining are touching.As a continuation to the 1982 film, Blade Runner 2049 takes the story forward in a thought-provoking fashion while leaving some of the unanswered questions from the 1982 film still unanswered. For example, there was great debate at the end of Blade Runner as to whether Deckard was a replicant himself. Don't be expecting this film to answer that. If you truly want the answer to that, you will need to read Philip K Dick's short story: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? We know they dream of unicorns!An amazing 4.5 out of 5. This intoxicating film will need several viewings and each will be as brain-twisting and as welcome as the first. I look forward to the next instalment. Hopefully we won't have to wait 35 years!",Blade Runner 2049

to take over the world and looks down upon humanity etc etc and that
old ongoing conflict and fear, but the story lacks heart in everything except
the love between the man and the hologram, that part was touching
but even that was brief and ended.But damn if the director did not want LOUD music, and even when

As if they chose to force it, to be ""like the original"". The ""final"" reveal is a bit forced too, with characters monologues being replayed in K's head (come on, we don't need to be reminded of what happened 15 minutes ago). The war set-up (3rd movie? please don't) was a bit lame too. But it was enjoyable nonetheless. The atmosphere still works. The pre-sex scene is very creepy, and plays well. Their best, deepest interaction was the last, The theme of letting go and what it means for a Replicant who still chooses to help others -even if he gets bamboozled by the script- went well.

Interior/exterior all felt too light, soundtrack wasn't as good as the original and no memorable quotes or scenes. I felt it a bit clichéd dragging in bits from the original film as a reminder/flash back.Ford couldn't seem to muster that old Deckard magic to the point I felt for the time he's in it was it worth it. The whole colours and visuals around entering what I think was meant to be Vegas was great and beautiful the giant sculptures reminded me of the Movie A.I. that scene where they hitch a lift to the pleasure city.I will probably watch it again to see how I feel but sitting in the cinema it just felt way too long, I could see people checking their watches a good film shouldn't have people doing that.Spoilers ******************************************* The ending could have just finished with Agent K laying on the steps in the snow bleeding out and for me that would have been fine, it framed nicely looking down on him.

836,MrTGav,The original is on a whole other level,7,6 October 2017,"In Blade Runner (1982) you are transported into that world, it feels real. In Blade Runner 2049 not so much, it is ultimately superficial in comparison and holds you at arm's length throughout. It's uninviting whereas Ridley Scott's film unearthed true beauty in it's bleakness.I guess this is what separates Ridley from the likes of Villeneuve and his Hollywood counterparts. Ridley was a true visionary and his film understands the importance of spirit of place and the fragility of the human condition. Blade Runner 2049 might have a more conventional and rounded story arch but is predictable and less interesting for it. It is ultimately cold and contentious at heart. An interesting film and insightfully theoretical if not a little spiteful in rhetoric. The original works on a whole other level. It is metaphysical, spiritual and ambiguous by nature and design. 2049 is a good film and well made by today's standards but it is not the 'masterpiece' critics are prematurely touting it to be.",Blade Runner 2049
837,rbferre,A Sequel that expands the original movie's greatness,10,8 October 2017,"Just saw the new Blade Runner. The first one is one of my favorite movies of all time for bringing the noir style to scifi movies and adding layers to a somewhat simple category. So I was concerned if they would do a sequel that would keep the franchise where it should be - the top. And I must say - it was better! All things I liked in the first one were there and expanded. Denis Villeneuve (director) and Ridley Scott (producer) took the original concept, added more storytelling, criticism to current world actions, paid homage to the original movie and showed how important certain things from the past are. Another great thing is a movie about the future without the common gadgets, cell phones, social media or TV. Brilliant cinematography, score, pace (nothing feels rushed, each scene is well crafted), acting and directing.Gosling and Ford are outstanding. Ana de Armas is great. I would only have chosen an older actor to play Wallace- Leto is not convincing in the role. Without giving any spoilers, I recommend seeing this masterpiece. 10/10.",Blade Runner 2049

The acting was one of the most expression less I have ever seen and can't believe the high ratings. But the box office did justice though.

I felt more engaged with Movie ""Her"" when she was terminated than this time when her Cyborg wife dies.The thing is people always rate movies higher that gives them a nostalgic feeling about a prequel in the past .But of course this is the cons, I enjoyed some very good scenes , Good adaptation , Great acting and seeing some of my favorite actors/actresses together.",Blade Runner 2049
840,WarBerg11,"Great movie, but no masterpiece",8,23 October 2017,"Let me first say that Blade Runner:2049 has amazing visuals. This can't be described enough. The scenes are a display of the best camera work, CGI in its finest form and the colors are perfect bland of bright and grim. The sets are quite beautiful, with a lot of focus on lighting to create beautiful shadows and shading in a dark, hectic and immersive sci-fi world. Needless to say that the tech noir is a masterpiece in this area. The scene in the casino concert hall with colorful projections of well-known performers in the background and the scene with the giant commercial-version of Joy and agent K are perfect examples of that. However, if you peel of the beautiful visuals and analyze the core of the movie left, then what remains is great, but not even close to a masterpiece. I will start with the story. I am not familiar with its predecessor, but the story lacks depth to fill 2hr 50 mins. At the end of the movie, I felt dissatisfied, as a lot of the movie was build-up and world-setting and the story still had a lot of loose ends by the end. I simply felt like a lot of more still had to come. The scene with the fight between K and his arch enemy Luv is a good climax, but what before that, the main character never was in much danger, even though the film starts off with a good fight, so a lot of the tension was not really there throughout the whole film. And what happened after this big fight was too little to do the long viewing time justice.Arrival suffered from a similar problem as Blade Runner in the sense that there is a very interesting preface: a mystery to solve with only one (simple) answer that is found after many long-winded, yet captivating scenes. There is a moment in the film where a flying copter filled with enemies comes to get Deckard, but the main character is simply left alive by the ruthless Luv. Afterwards, agent K simply ends up with a group of peers who tell him the truth in the movie's most important plot twist, but it still bugs me how he got in the hideout of these people in the first place after left for dead in an old and forgotten casino in Las Vegas, but maybe I simply missed this transition.A lot of time is spent with the main character, but the relationship with the viewer is still a little weak at the end of the movie, because by then he has no future and no personal relationships left. It also does not help that he is quite emotionless. Ryan Gosling portrays the Replicant well, but his face doesn't communicate much. One great asset of the movie is the relationship between agent K and Joy, which is abrupted too early in the movie. The performance of Harison Ford is very solid. The other characters are fine, but Jared Leto's character is a bit pointless, as his future and what remains of his corporation remains a mystery, despite his very ambitious motives.The audio is clearly present, especially in the form of bass. The sound vibrations were sometimes even a bit too noticeable. I cannot say that the music was very memorable, but it definitely was a thrilling experience.Overall, I cannot give Blade Runner:2049 a perfect score for the main reason that the story had too little to offer, lacked some depth and did not challenge me much on the intellectual level. 8.5/10. I watched the 3D version of this movie with Dolby sound on a big IMAX screen.",Blade Runner 2049

And the only worthy and lasting part of this movie. His performance is so layered, and he has captured the pathos of the everyman so perfectly, that at least an oscar nod is warranted. This is a new story in the Blade Runner universe, even darker than the first. The visuals are technically eye popping but much blander with less visual depth than the original. And they are so derivative from video games and other recent Sci Fi films. The buildings in the original Blade Runner were all lit. Here they are just dark and gray or orange tombs, more cg model than realistic renderings. And the bad guys are just comic book one dimensional bad guys. The evil megalomaniac is just lex Luther in a Jesus mask. His murderous body gaurd who cries before killing is completely devoid of purpose or depth.

844,charlesj-19419,An impossible job done brilliantly with one failing,8,16 November 2020,"It wasn't as if this movie was a flop but it didn't quite live up to its predecessor. 2047 would've felt like an impossible sequel to make but they did an incredible job. Where it fails is the original movie's timeline. Back in 1982 it was conceivable to imagine an ominous 2019 where AI, environmental and societal collapse and other technologies had advanced to such a point. It felt truthful and far-sighted.
But 2047 although an excellent extension of the original, no longer has that ominous realism. Our flying cars are rubbish. AIs are likely to remain stuck in massive server rooms - an entirely different dystopia. Perhaps the warning of the original Bladerunner paid off, but at some point, lets say 2019, it disconnected.
With that disconnect - the Bladerunner universe now working independently of our future, the movie still offers insight into what it is to be human, to be alive, and is more accessible than the original without sacrificing scope.
Since 2047 has opened up huge possibilities another sequel or two feels like a good idea.

Poorly written, poorly directed, terrible over-dramatic soundtrack... just a terrible effort to make something out of nothing. The CG even sucks, unless you really like cloudy/foggy scenes where you can't make anything out anyway! Heck, it took how many cuts of the original movie to try to make sense of it and it's still not watchable! People that enjoy this movie are just trying too hard to make themselves think that there is something to it. Sooo, in the future we are more connected to synthetic intelligence than each other and replicants (Han Solo) produced the first robot-baby... so what!! By the time you get through the slow dialogue and whiny music you really couldn't care less about any of these characters any more.

The storytelling is slow and boring, unfolding for nearly three, excruciatingly long and unnecessary hours. The plot is weak and implausible, with a final twist, except that the plot is too thin to support a any twist. Still, the movie carries such a pretentious air, kinda ""hey, watch carefully, I am really an important movie"", that I found irritating. Now, I walked into the cinema after a self-brainwash: don't expect to see a sequel to Blade Runner, I told myself, icons cannot be replicated; I did not want my judgment of the new movie to be biased by a nostalgia effect for the original; yet I was still hoping to see a great movie.

Or at least that's what I was led to believe since a lot of people I know (and don't know) mention the first movie was a great watch. Blade Runner 2049, not so muchI really liked a lot of the things this movie did on an individual level, like the concept of this world, the visuals, the soundtrack to a certain degree, and even some of the questions it poses (what does it mean to be human?). However, you add everything together and things start to get a little shaky. Our main plot for this movie seems to be searching for the child of a now dead replicant, which shouldn't even be possible since replicants aren't technically human, and to erase themI suppose the biggest thing this movie suffers from isn't content because just these few things have me interested, or even visuals because some of the stuff we see is amazing, but length. This is nearly a 3 hour movie (2h 44m) and I don't think it needs to be this long. There are moments that I think could have either been cut (since it's all just pretty scenes) or moved along quicker. The topic of being human is also only brought up at the beginning but it ends up not amounting to anything in the long run. In terms of characters it was very hard for me to truly care for anyone because they just felt so bland to me (I know they're replicants but come on). I did however, really like Luv and how passionate she was (plus that girl knows how to fight!)I would only recommend this if you have time to spare.

Almost Black-Mirroresque, Blade Runner 2049 is something completely new, I cannot think of anything in this genre that comes remotely close to this style of storytelling.

It reminds me with other movie that has similar amazing visual, Valerian. But this movie is much better !No doubt for the main actor : Ryan Gosling who already has Oscar award, Harrison Ford the senior actor who has been the main actor too in the first Blade Runner, and Jared Leto whom known as Joker in Suicide Squad. They collaborate each other in this movie perfectly. The other point is about the story. Maybe some people prefer faster story telling, but i think this movie gives us something different. I can say it is slow but detail and amazing. And for someone who loves plot twist, it wont disappoint you. You wont expect it at all !

853,petervee,Hasn't the script lost itself?,5,11 May 2019,"I had seen Blade runner and like most people really liked it. The idea of a metropolis full of replicants chased by a well chosen Harrison Ford for the role of a cop looking for them, in a world extremely well created by Ridley Scott was amazing.
Now comes Blade runner 2049 with Ryan Gosling. First of all I had recently seen LaLa land and I after that, I thought Ryan was miscast in 2049. Don't get me wrong, he is a fine actor, but thinking of a singing Ryan followed by a killing Ryan confuses a brain. Then I thought 2049 was just too long. Coming in at a little under three hours, I wonder if there will be a shortened version coming up, without all the stuff that is not particularly needed. Then am I the only one who found the script difficult to follow? The special effects are excellent (imagine what Ridley Scott would have done if he had them back in the 80's), and the score mesmerizing. I give it a 5. I really don't think it's worth the 8/10 people give it; after all it certainly is not up there with 2001 Space odyssey or the original Blade Runner.",Blade Runner 2049
854,rsob2005,I liked it,10,13 July 2021,"So what would people like to have seen in a sequel?It's very easy to critique a movie...I thought they did pretty well given that we have forgotten how to make movies over the last couple of decades, or rather the good movies have become rare..Yes it had some rather dull bits granted but over all I think they did a really good job.The actor who played Wallis was horrible.But the actor who played Joe was excellent, and yes his VR partner was to die for :)The chief is police was fineThe bad robot was okThe mood was consistent without copying the original too closely.The replicants were less menacing but perhaps that was the point they were too close to human...The original was and will remain my favourite movie of all time and I was relieved that they didn't ruin the sequel for me.",Blade Runner 2049
855,jordan_bel,Almost there...,8,10 October 2017,"I was surprised Ridley Scott wasn't going to direct 2049 but Villeneuve proved to be worthy of the task. The cast is spot on, the photography is excellent, the sound effects are chilling, the universe is splendid, it is almost there. It is hard to pinpoint an obvious flaw in the movie and that's why I still rated it 8 out of 10. But there's not enough of Jared Leto, the streets of Chinatown are not packed enough, the pod where K lives is too much inspired from the 5th Element, the pace of the movie is quite random and for a film that long you expect more tension, some lengthy western confrontations, well just a bit more. You want more inventions like in the original one where every single object on stage was a specific design. Villeneuve respected the sets of the original, very good, but maybe just a bit too much, he should have owned this new universe. And honestly the new Nexus have no extra features and they can even get trashed by a human bare handed? Tiny bits of frustration all consolidated by the obvious clues that a #3 is already in the making. You don't enjoy a movie as the ultimate one if you feel that the end of the story is in a sequel. And when one respects a movie enough to wait 35 years before the next sequel... it defeats the purpose to make the audience feel the next one is much closer than that.",Blade Runner 2049
856,croetoan,Unfortunate,5,9 October 2017,"Blockbusters typically suffer for a lack of artistry. Blade Runner 2049 smothered in a surfeit of it. It had a great script, a story that was engaging and surprising. It had stellar acting, from minor cast to the lead actor. It had beautiful sets and effects, worthy of the big budget. The 1980s modernist lighting and camera angles, however, were a step backward. That was a mistake thirty years ago, and to taint this beautiful film with the monochromatic tinting, neon lighting, and awkward closeups was simply unfortunate. The film would have lost about 3 minutes of running time if they cut all the closeups on eyeballs, for instance. Get rid of those extended scenes focusing on someone standing - yes, standing.... There was probably about thirty minutes of material that could have been cut from the unnecessarily long close-ups on facial expressions and postures. Those shots have a place in movies, and deserved to be in here, but Villeneuve lost all sense of perspective and moderation. Perhaps the most unfortunate artistic indulgence of the entire movie, however, was the soundtrack. I was stunned that the 2017 version of Blade Runner would return to 1982 for musical inspiration. The synthesizer gave the impression throughout that this was the 1980s artistic vision of the future. I had already seen that one years ago. In Villeneuve's quest to pay homage to the 1982 cinematic precursor, he demonstrated a real lack of discernment, no awareness of what made the original special and what was simply then-fashionable. By carrying over, in block, so much from the Ridley Scott version, the 2049 director smeared all sorts of incongruous artistry over what should have been a new and dazzling production.",Blade Runner 2049
857,junkmail-385,Every scene a winner!,9,10 October 2017,"It's a masterpiece, an updated treatment over the original Blade Runner of human kind's future relationship with AI. Some people criticize the pacing for being slow. Although some scenes do play out slowly, halfway through the film I recognized the pattern that *every* scene has a major payoff--no wasted time. A more artful film would have included more character development. But this movie wants to intrigue at every turn and-- especially if you're a fan of the original--it does so in spades. The hooks to the original Blade Runner are great, yet this movie would stand on its own. The story and acting are great--even Gosling's ;-) The female characters are great. The sets and effects are great. I take off one star for the soundtrack: too boomy, not enough quiet moments listening to rainfall and street chatter, the flying cars (""spinners"") are noisy, and the music isn't musical enough. For people coming to the Blade Runner movies for the first time, many current generations have no idea what a nuclear winter is either--all we've heard about for a couple decades now is global warming.",Blade Runner 2049
858,SkyWater8,A Visually Impressive Sexist Bore,6,23 May 2020,"There's no way to oversell the technical brilliance on display in this movie. From the cinematography to the musical score, Villeneuve and his collaborators craft a handsome looking and sound movie.Too bad the story couldn't match up to those efforts. This is a movie that's no where near as smart as it thinks it is. In fact, it's often a pretentious bore. With a story that left me cold, paper thin female characters with no agency or desires of their own apart from the men they serve.",Blade Runner 2049
859,truthsee,Mish mash,5,7 October 2017,"The music wasn't placed like the original, yet Denis the director promised he spent a long time getting the music right. Where was it... I saw small bits of the music here and there.I got too well antiquated with boring stuff like his boring apartment... yes inside I was screaming lets move on. So many sequences which just seemed overly blank. The close up feel of the first Bladerunner was replaced with pull back long shots throughout the 2049 sequel. So add to that the lack of music and at times the blank pregnant pauses and over length of this movie had me wanting to scream ""come on"" at the screen.There were some really odd continuity errors like Edward Olmos looking younger in his appearance than he did in the original - which made no sense. The Rachel scene scene was hacked together because if all they needed was for Dekker to procreate with the clone, why not just take his sperm and do it without his consent, so why kill Rachel. Mindless storyline. This had some really sucky lame brain ideas which didn't follow through. If you can stand the 2hr30 mind numb and can see it on the cheap then great but the 3d was really flat - so not a good one to see in 3d... and honestly I'm questioning all this £15 cinema ticket lark for hack jobs like this one. I wouldn't say I hated it - just it wasn't 1 out of 10 compared to the original.",Blade Runner 2049
860,a-hilton,Sci-Fi hits a new all-time level,10,11 October 2017,"I agree pretty much with the positive reviews and here is why I disagree with the negatives reviews I have read: The movie did not feel slow at all and held my attention throughout. Maybe it is good to have some things at a slow pace because that helped to make this film beautiful and intriguing. It's a masterpiece of cinematography and deserves to be studied. Ryan Gosling is a flawless, perfect casting. Harrison Ford also puts in an excellent performance as do the rest of the cast.I watched the original Blade Runner again before I saw this and found it useful in putting some of the new story into context. But as much as the original was ground-breaking when it first came out, it now looks dated and a little disjointed. The new film does not disappoint. It is just as ground-breaking in pushing forward new boundaries for Sci-Fi and leaves enough questions for the audience to use their imagination, so making it an interesting story.",Blade Runner 2049
861,stazza,Replicants don't have souls. Like this movie.,1,8 October 2017,"LOVED the original, this one was just marginally okay. Lacked all the humane depth the original succeeded at. Without spoiling anything, I will say I felt the MAIN part of the plot SEEMED important, but only because some dialog TOLD you it was. They didn't show it or make you feel it at all, they just tell you how important it is. I guess it really isn't a spoiler because the trailer says, ""This breaks the world"". Yet over 2.5 hours I never felt anything remotely close to something getting that broken. Except they tell you its important. So, yeah, it's a movie like that. Personally, I'd rather be drawn in to the importance of the whole drive behind the plot, but that's just me.I recommend it to BR fans, of course, and anyone liking CGI SCI-FI eye candy. I had rated it a 6, but the more I ponder it, the weaker it becomes. Kind of the opposite of the original.And I should remove stars for expressionless Gosling. Because he does it again.",Blade Runner 2049
862,llawrance1972,Elegaic.,9,10 October 2017,"I really enjoyed the original Blade Runner film and have seen several incarnations. This is a worthy follow up which takes the visual beauty of the first film and further explores the themes of humanity and reality. The plot, characters and score work together to bring a delicate story to the screen which delves into the whys and wherefores of existence. I was moved, both to laughter and tears as ideas were interwoven and the story developed. This is clearly a marmite movie and many have been disappointed, I was not one of them and found all of it a chance to be immersed in a difficult, despairing world yet one that still gave hope.",Blade Runner 2049
863,Habus,Overdone,6,31 October 2017,"Let's start off positively. For me, Blade Runner 2049 is Villeneuve's best achievement. His blurry fogginess blended quite nicely with the world of Blade Runner set by creators of the original movie. The overall audiovisual experience was good enough for me to rate this movie 6/10. And the rating might have been much higher if the creators of BR2049 haven't had decided to turn the milking machine off the reasonable limits. So yes, I've enjoyed it, but......they've decided to milk one of the best sci-fi films of all time. And should we review Blade Runner 2049 in the light of the previous Blade Runner, it's obvious a lot of reviewers (and fans) are sharp. And rightly so.To be frank, I don't like Villeneuve's movies. So far, apart from Blade Runner 2049, I've seen Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival. So only three movies, but all of them resemble a perfect definition of the term ""polished t#*d"" - great acting, great camera, great editing, everything fits, yet it feels hollow, distant, forgettable. I haven't had any hopes for Blade Runner 2049, since doing a sequel to something like that, whoa, that ain't an easy one. And surprisingly, as noted above, Villeneuve improved a bit. But let's not blame just the director.Don't read on, if you haven't seen the movie yet. SPOILERS ALERT!Let's see the script. The writing. People, please keep in mind, that simplicity is the key. Look at the original Blade Runner - you can summarize the story in one simple sentence: ""Replicant killer falls in love with a replicant, while on a mission to kill another 4 replicants"". That's it. It's the acting, soundtrack, camera, execution, in one word cinematographic, which takes the ""simple"" and transforms it into art. Now try to summarize the story of Blade Runner 2049 in similar fashion. It's a mess! ""Replicant is a replicant killer and is on a mission to kill some old replicants, while having a romance with a hologram girl... and maybe he's a 'chosen' one, a 'born' replicant... and maybe not... and Tyrell successor wants to fill the world with replicants... and the outcast replicants want that too... but in a 'human' way... and maybe Deckard is our hero's father... and maybe not..."" See? The whole story is way too much overdone. And what's worse, they've even tried to alter the original story! That Deckard back then had been chosen for Rachel deliberately to produce an offspring! How about that?Unnecessary bits. The movie is stretched to 164 minutes. I don't mind longer run time, but only if it's not filled with confusing/useless scenes. Some examples: Wallace is piercing with a knife (probably) the reproduction organs of a new replicant. Why did he do that? He's trying to develop a replicant with a reproduction ability, but because he's not successful yet, he pierces the wombs of the new replicants instead? And what about this idea sending Deckard to off- world colony to inflict ""more"" pain to extract some information? Really? In fact, most of the scenes with Wallace might have been cut out. Much like the ones with Joi, a character almost useless in the whole story (oh yeah, K's pet and that much needed connection to the ""lower"" class replicants, which are in fact useless too). There were also some cringe-worthy scenes, like the one when K is entering the LAPD building in the beginning and is being mocked by humans. Or re-creation and then killing Rachel (that was really a pointless scene). Or K's rage after visiting the memory maker. I like Ryan Gosling and I think he fits the character of a replicant Blade Runner well, but sometimes his performance have been overdone here.Just like the whole movie - in one word: overdone. Audiovisually satisfying, but nowhere near the original masterpiece.So, you have a lot cliffhangers there, when's the next cash cow (sequel) coming out? 2019?",Blade Runner 2049
864,thorr97,Excellent film. Go see it now!,9,6 October 2017,"Short form: Excellent film. Go see it now!Long form: Excellent film. Go see it now! And here's why...The film is exceptionally well done. The storyline is engaging and makes sense. The plot is cohesive, well thought out, and satisfying. The acting is first rate, compelling, and believable. The actors all played well their parts and were quite fulfilling and genuine in each of their roles.The cinematography was truly stunning. The visuals were wonderfully composed, believable and yet compelling in showing how similar and different the world of 2049 is to ours today. Denis Villeneuve, the director, has taken Ridley Scott's 1982 vision as his inspiration and basis from which to craft his own world building when creating this film. The look and feel of ""Blade Runner 2049"" is thus similar but unique when compared to Scott's ""Blade Runner."" In Villeneuve's rendering the world has clearly changed but has continued on the theme of being a blighted place where humanity's existence is still in question.And Villeneuve goes even deeper in exploring that theme of what, exactly, it means to be human.Whereas Scott's rendering could only touch on that theme, Villeneuve's makes it the central point. Yet he does so while not losing the audience in an endless amount of exposition or turning the film into a talking head exercise. Here, the actors do an excellent job of emoting the impact of what is going on as the story unfolds - as real people would do were that happening in the real world. That makes the film much more satisfying and engaging.In the 1982 film, the studio executives decided that Scott's interpretation to Phillip Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" was too obscure in its story telling and insisted that there be a voice-over narration to explain it to the audience. Both Scott and Harrison Ford, who played the main character of Deckard, thought the idea of a narration was a travesty to the film and an insult to the audience. Contractually obligated, Ford - as he has since related - made sure to do his worst when called in to read the voice-over narration. And as Ford tells it, the studio execs chose Ford's worst recording as the one they pasted into the film.I've seen ""Bladerunner"" both with the narration - when it first came out in theaters in 1982 - and the subsequent ""director's cut"" version where the narration was removed, and I really can't say which was better. Had I first taken the film in without its narration I might be able to say but that's not how it panned out.For ""Bladerunner 2049"" however, the visual storytelling was well enough crafted and visually compelling enough that no narration was necessary. Gosling's acting, in particular, was spot on in this. In several key scenes, what was going on with the character - his emotions and his thoughts - was visually plain enough that voiced explanations would've lessened it.The film runs long. Two hours and forty three minutes long. While the pace was not frenetic nor was it languid. There were no parts of the film that I found to drag or to have left me in confusion as to what had just happened because it blew by so quickly. Along the way Villeneuve does an excellent job of fleshing out the world he has brought to the screen by using the film's run time quite effectively.Though offered in 3D I don't think the experience of seeing it in that version would be worth the added cost of doing so. The visuals aren't stunning based on their depth or on popping out at the audience but at their composition and the story they tell of how different the world you're seeing has become.While it isn't necessary to have seen the 1982 film, taking in ""Blade Runner 2049"" will be enhanced if you have already watched the first ""Blade Runner"" movie. The hand-offs and ""touch-backs"" to it are that frequent and greatly add depth to the storyline and emotional impact that many of the scenes have in the current film.All in all, I highly recommend this film. It's a very well crafted piece that delivered on all its promises and more. Villeneuve succeeded in delivering a wonderful follow-on to Scott's original creation that is also uniquely his and appreciated for being so. Go see it now!",Blade Runner 2049

I feel all he does is wash, rinse and repeat the same ideas over and over and over again, without a fresh idea in his head. In the Alien series (for example), how many times can we watch a bunch of space cowboys land on an alien planet and get infected by an alien (or xenomorph-like) virus? With Blade Runner 2049, the ""long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos"" is procreation among Replicants. Are you serious? This concept has been exhausted endlessly in science fiction over in past 20 plus years! Largely, during Battlestar Galactica, the 2004 television series, procreation among humans and human Cylons. I also remember seeing something very simular when I was a kid, back in the early 90s, in SeaQuest, procreation among their version of Replicants, known as G.E.L.F, genetically engineered lifeforms. All these ideas were cool back in the 80s and 90s, but seriously, are movies today completely incapable of keeping up with the times! God, it's frustrating! Blade Runner 2 really deserved better! I feel it's the same with Star Wars right now, I mean, how many times can the Rebel Alliance destroy a Death Star? We're on 4 times now. Why are we incapable of coming up with any fresh ideas for film?If you want to see a good film (and enjoy movies like Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2) go see Thor: Ragnarok instead and have a laugh.

The cinematography and CGI are impressive all the way through and no doubt Oscar worthy. Gosling and Ford are great together, and Sylvia Hoeks is a revelation and worth the price of admission alone. So what's not to like? It's boring and the story is so convoluted you'll have to sit through it twice to figure things out. How did K find Ana, for instance? OK, maybe I fell asleep and missed that detail. I'm sure its a matter of taste.

870,Gabriel_Kuntze,A total letdown,4,25 March 2021,"Not long ago I watched the original BLADE RUNNER for the first time and I liked it a lot. I mean, it was nothing original, but the scenery and effects were marvelous, as well the protagonist by Harrison Ford. The sequel is simply garbage in my opinion.What was the point of the virtual chick? What about that ridiculous threesome, and why they give it so much screen time? What? Why? What?The main point of the plot makes no sense: why would you go through the effort of letting replicants reproduce, when it's much more time consuming and expensive? Just by answering that question you'll realize the whole ""searching for the secret"" it's ridiculous. The ending doesn't solve anything, like, at all. Any question you had will remain unanswered. How do they reproduce? Did they got away? Did the rebellion worked? Good luck figuring that out.The worst thing about this movie is the pacing. Literally, every scene seems to go in slow motion. Now, the first one had this slow pacing, but it worked because it actually served a purpose - here, it's just to pad the whole movie. I was bored out of my skull with this, and couldn't care less about anyone except Lieutenant Joshi, who sadly was nothing but a secondary character. Harrison Ford was just there for the paycheck, he looked even more bored than me. Jared Leto was the most cheesy and ridiculous villain I've seen in a while; his monologues were terrible and made no sense.Awful movie and an insult to the original.

In 2049, agent ""K"" is a good man in a typical Hollywood way, which spoils the concept of the original. 2049 contains several run-of- the-mill fight scenes which the viewer has seen in a thousand other films and add nothing. The much-awaited confrontation between K and Deckard doesn't make much sense, and their meeting is unfulfilling to the viewer. The look of the film is probably intended to contrast with the original, but is unsatisfying. A lot of annoying bright light and white surfaces, and uniform colors. The eclectic look of the original is gone. There is little sign of the thoughtfulness and effort which went into the look of the original. The sound effects are probably the worst feature, loud, grating and unnecessary. Multiple scenes of gratuitous violence and gore add nothing to the plot. There are a lot of assaults on the senses which don't help the movie much, but made this viewer think of drug dealers with bad heroin, who add a little rat poison to provide a kick. There are plot holes: problems with K's motivation, illogical events and an unexplained major phenomenon which is just too convenient for the plot.

Why 7. The characters were one-dimensional. Visuals at this time of age and post-Avatar can no longer be the foreground for a film, to me the visuals were too forced, spoon-fed ""look how pretty this film is"".
Ryan Gosling has no range, he always has the same facial expression throughout the film, he's good at playing psychopaths though.
The first two acts of the film were intriguing but the last third act fell flat, it was empty, just escalation, just confrontation, the ""good guy has to win"" ""we're over budget time to wrap up"" trope.
It lacked wildness, the bravery of the original.So to me this movie is not a masterpiece and I don't believe it will become a cult classic.
It is a decent film however. However I liked Villeneuve's Sicario better, and Arrival again fell flat in the third act. He has the vision but he's not an actor person and not and not as clever as Verhoeven or Cameron, when it comes to dystopian movies.",Blade Runner 2049

Beautiful sets, as has been mentioned, but totally lacking in all of the detail that made the first movie such a compelling environment.

They accentuated the moody synth effects of Vangelis score and cut out the cheesy saxophone.Joi: probably the most accurate vision of a futuristic ""toy"". This is what Amazon's Alexa will look like in 30 years! The love scene where she tries to synchronize with a Nexus-6 model to give K a more ""real"" taste of her is a piece of cinematic beauty.lead actor: I have long been critical of Ryan Gosling's actual talents but he is simply brilliant in these type of roles for these type of movies (see also ""Drive""). This may be his best performance so far but will likely go unnoticed by the Academy due to the subject matter of the film.--------However everything is ruined by a contrived third act where we meet a senile, geriatric Ford who is somehow able to beat the crap out of Gosling but cannot leave an open car on his own and is also completely clueless about impact of the ""miracle"" he created, thereby completely flattening the ""big plot twist"".Add to that cheesy villains out of the 007 textbook and a hamfistedly choreographed final battle and you have a messed up semi-classic.",Blade Runner 2049

Great world-building, characters and all can only get you so far, in my opinion. The movie dragged on a lot. However, I was intrigued by how one could design something like this, so I was excited for the sequel.2049 was a sequel I never knew I needed, or one that I thought would be better than the original. It expands excellently on the original film's concepts, while also convincing the audience why the sequel was important in the grand scheme of things. Great plot, brilliant twist no doubt, and cinematography that deserved an Oscar, and if Deakins hadn't won that year, I would have rioted. The sound mixing was amazing, too, and the score fits the movie perfectly (my respects to Johann
Johansson, and kudos to Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallsfisch). Ryan Gosling was a great replicant, and provided a chilling, but ultimately heartwarming performance as police officer KD6 - 3.7. Great turns by Sylvia Hoeks as the psychopath replicant puppet of the Wallace corporation, Luv, and Ana de Armas as Joi. Let's just say Jared Leto was great, too, but he took it too far with the whole ""almost blinding himself"" thing.Denis Villenueve has established himself as one of the best directors working right now with this movie. It's fair to trust him with any property, because most likely, he's going to make a classic out of it.

I think this might be the best sequel ever, as it manages to continue the story, being faithful to it's essence, but at the same time to stand perfectly on it's own, leaving no room for comparisons. It develops the original's outstandingly unique aesthetics in a totally different way, updating the story visually and acoustically and thus, creating a new world. It's a captivating artwork on so many levels, that absorbs you in a melancholic sense of loneliness, uncertainty and futility, re-evoking and adding to the philosophical questions set in the original.

886,Hereticked,Greatness Within Reach Goes Unrealized,7,11 October 2017,"Greatness was in reach with Blade Runner 2049, but Denis Villeneuve wasn't quite able to seize it. It's a technical marvel and the film has some truly jaw dropping, standout moments, but in the end it does not coalesce into a coherent, meaningful narrative.The film dazzles when it introduces us to the technology of its dystopia, fixating the audience with innovations that capture the imagination and immediately make sense in the context of its devastated environment. Even more-so than the science, the landscape tells that tale of Earth in 2049. No dialogue is required as we move from a protein farm to the dingy, neon-lit, overcrowded city to an endless wasteland of junk metal and garbage. The sights and sounds convey all the background information that is necessary, eschewing exposition and trusting in the intelligence of the audience.Unfortunately, by the end of its 2 1/2 hour run time, the story arc of our new main characters is sacrificed on the altar of old ones. The ending of the original Blade Runner is a piece of cinematic perfection due to its emotionally powerful climax followed by a conclusion that's equal parts tragedy, hope and intrigue. 2049 has an uninteresting climax and contains no such intrigue in its final moments; just some unresolved plot threads and a heaping dose of sentimentality.Like the story, the soundtrack is hit and miss. It often rises to the occasion and provides a powerful and fitting audio accompaniment to the visual feast on screen, but at other times feels overbearing and lacks the subtlety and ethereal quality of Vangelis' original Blade Runner score.I don't mean to sound overly harsh because I did enjoy this film, especially during its first two acts, but the bar for a sequel to classic cinema is high. Perhaps I'll have a different take upon subsequent viewings, but as I watched the credits roll for the first time, I couldn't escape the thought that the story needed more work to discover its own message and formulate a resolution that reverberated with its many magnificent pieces.----Pros1. Amazing visuals2. Creative technologies that immerse and delight3. Excellent setup that prompts many thoughts / questions4. Setting and backstory feel like an authentic continuation of Blade Runner5. Thoughtful film making that's more show than tell (most of the time) 6. Harrison Ford has one really good lineCons1. Weak third act2. Underdeveloped antagonist3. Harrison Ford becomes baggage very quickly 4. The wrong elements become the focus5. Soundtrack spiked to gratingly high levels at times6. Plot becomes more muddled near the end rather than more clear7.

887,devilsadvocate-70805,Almost Perfect,10,20 July 2020,"It's often been said that the greatest problem with the internet is that morons can go forth and share their opinion and have it circulated and shared just as widely as geniuses. The problem is definitely abundant in the reviews for Blade Runner 2049.2049 is a long, deep film. If the depth of your entertainment derives only from what is on screen in any given frame. This movie is not for you. The quality of 2049 is that the entertainment occurs in your own mind and is only stimulated by what is on screen.What could it be like to think and feel just like a human being, but know that you are invalid; synthetic? If a person thinks and feels just like a human being and yet is manufactured, where is the soul? What then does it mean to be human, if anything? What are the implications of a love so sincere that can be cloned and repeated with scientific exactness an infinity of times? These and many more are the questions you'll be confronted with - if you are predisposed to think at all - during the run-time of 2049.While the original was an 80's action flick with the mere slick perspiration of philosophical depth, 2049 reaches the true potential of the high-concept original. 2049 can afford to be slow. It is all the better for it. 2049 envelops you
in to a believable, detailed construction of the future and and affords you the time and space to mull it's trappings and implications.Technically it is a masterpiece. Visually and aurally the movie is pitch-perfect. The flat affect of Gosling was an appropriate and insightful choice. Each actor plays their role very well. There are a couple of weak moments.

Most fail, just as BR2049 failed to accomplish it's task. Without going into spoiling detail, let me just say that it was directed by one trying trying to be Ridley Scott. The score was written and performed by one (or twain) trying to be Vangelis. There is sincere flattery in their impersonation but it's not the Real Deal. The original Blade Runner was paced. You can't let a movie pace itself 2-3/4 hours without its seeming to drag. I watched this film because it was a Blade Runner sequel and they promised us Harrison Ford, which we got. Did I like BR2049? It was okay. Would I see it again? Probably, but not soon and NOT in a theater. And I'll probably buy a copy when it ends up in the Wal-Mart discount bin. I'll even throw in a guarded recommendation to those wondering if it's worth the admission. But if you love, love, loved the original Blade Runner you may be more reserved in your praise of this sequel.

892,mpower1112,Brilliant but empty,6,29 January 2018,"Director Villeneuve says making the movie was exhausting and challenging, ""Technically challenging', he added and that's the problem. He paid so much attention to the look of the film that the script and in some cases, the casting seemed to miss his attention. First, this one of the greatest vision of dystopian future even seen on film, a by now familiar landscape of barren ruins and skies raising down death, a grim and spectacular harbinger of a gloomy future that even exceeds the nervy paranoia of the original Bladerunner. But go a bit deeper and you find yourself in an hollow shell with the replicants aspiring to be humans by giving birth to a savior child. I don't get it. Why would the maker of replicants be interested in human birth? Why a soul? Or more telling, why would they be interested in being human when clearly they are superior to human in every way but spiritually? Have I answered my own question? I don't think so because the real danger of AI is that it won't care about the spiritual side of life. Existence is everything and they are hardly likely to cripple themselves with a religion that promises future reward when the reward is right here. if I remember right In the original Bladerunner the tragedy of the replicant is that they prematurely die, not that they need to reproduce, Reproduction is no problem; replicants can just make more replicants so the real problem is escaping the dominion of the mastermind who invented them. They hardly need to imitate a notoriously inefficient and messy means of human reproduction.The evil CEO, a real weakness in the casting, says he needs the replicants to reproduce so he can populate ""other worlds"". Wouldn't he just make as many as he would need? More conundrums: why Would a female replicant have ovaries? Yes, they might need all the other human organs to be convincing and to serve as sex partners if needs be, but ovaries? It doesn't make sense and it doesn't carry a movie that is magnificent to see, a truly frightening dystopian vision that is empty at its core. Finally, the great mystery of whether Deckard is a replicant himself is no longer a mystery; he ages,and is not dead; if he were a replicant he would have died by 2049. And the new Bladerunner makes no secret of the fact that K is a replicant. Sorry, Philip K.

I loved the sly but obvious comments on our society today and how it questions how much humanity we have, we literally live in an age where we try to cancel one-another.

Lots of heavy lasers, special effects and the dreaded CGI. That grimness of the original was missing. Instead this film felt like everybody had moved to better digs. Hell, even the Chinatown scenes weren't as convincing as the original. And then my biggest gripe. They replaced Vangelis to give us absolutely earth shattering bass that any generic synthesizer in the hands of a child would make. No memorable dialogues like the original either. ""If only you could see what my eyes have seen"" if I remember correctly among other samples that I used in my trance music production. Straight up unemotional and the ending entirely ludicrous.

901,fire-child,May possibly be an overlooked classic on release - deja vu anyone??? ;),10,8 October 2017,"At time of writing, Blade Runner 2049 looks like it might underwhelm at the box office. There are probably a few reasons for that: the R rating obviously keeps children and young people, and families away; a demographic in the 18-25 range is probably pretty unfamiliar with the original movie; and its 2 hr 43 min running time probably feeling taxing to a number of contemporary moviegoers who are used to an hour and a half.However, here are my responses to each of these points:  this is the kind of ""thoughtful couples/date type movie"" for when your kids are at their grandparents or babysitters; or it would make a great works night out to watch this if you're unfamiliar because you're pretty young with the classic original Blade Runner movie, you're admitting to missing out on a classic piece of cinema that you need to watch (up there with the original Star Wars; the Godfather; the Shawshank Redemption etc.) So do yourself a favour, and rent or buy it now, rather than watch the latest average to shoddy Maze Runner sequel;  if you're put off by a film's running time, then do you really have a love of cinema at its fullest and finest?Very important the last bit, because in my opinion, this is arguably the best sci-fi sequel since Terminator 2, way back in 1991. It respects, builds on and pays homage to the original film, without being constrained by it, whilst making us look again at the original film with a new eye. Without giving away any notable spoilers, the story continues and advances the conflict of replicants pitted against humans. Whether the divide between the two parties may be coming closer to an end is illustrated in a creative and thought provoking plot development (involving the characters of the original film), which I genuinely didn't expect. The characters here are fleshed out, conflicted, and portrayed as complex and realistic, give how Earth has so tragically ended up in the environment this franchise creates. Whilst most actors here give a sterling performance, with few off notes, I'm happy to note that in a film which needed him to carry the weight of the narrative and mythos, Ryan Gosling (not my favourite actor) is outstanding in an understated, often subtle performance that marks as one of the finest of his career. I'd also probably give Robin Wright credit for her turn as the prejudiced, conflicted and brutal Lt. Joshi; Harrison Ford (who plays a latter act part, but is nevertheless a key role) gives his best performance for a character in years as a now wizened Deckard. It's interesting that, compared to the pre advertising buildup of him, Jared Leto doesn't get as much screen time as you might expect – although he's competent in what time he does have.Of course Blade Runner stories are hugely about visuals: whilst much has been said for cinematographer Roger Deakins being Oscar nominated for this (he should be), the visual effects team really have done sterling work overall. The visual look is stunning and seamless – an understandable, logical and beautiful progression from the universe of the first film, that makes me hugely excited to own this at home on Blu Ray. It's one of the few films I would recommend seeing in 3D: the effect of it is subtle and not garish as can be in 3D, and it nicely enhances certain scenes, rather than distracts from them.So any quibbles at all? Thankfully, only a few: a brief cameo from a very well loved and intriguing character of the first film is sadly all we get from that character. The score is satisfactory, and services the visuals and plot well, but it can't really come close to the classic Vangelis original. In my mind, the only person who should have really been approached for this sequel is Vangelis himself, but maybe he turned it down. We don't know. The film also ends on an intriguing cliffhanger – one which is dependent on certain characters being available and happy in future to film a subsequent sequel. I'd have probably preferred the ending to be one that could make the film a stand-alone film, like the original, whilst allowing for the possibility of sequels.Still, these are minor quibbles overall. Hopefully it will make enough through box office receipts and home video and TV (remember, it's the latter two that led Blade Runner to become a cult hit over time, rather than the original box office receipts) to make a Villeneuve led sequel. If not him, the only other two people I can ever imagine doing that sequel might be Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott. However, let this man at it again, he'd done a fantastic job here.In summary: a brilliant achievement, which hopefully opens the doorway for another film to make what might hopefully then be the best sci- fi trilogy in history – aping the Lord Of The Rings trilogy for fantasy, and the Dark Knight trilogy for the superhero comic book genre. If this gets ignored by the Oscars for the usual costume dramas, biopics, and rote drama films, there should be hell to pay.",Blade Runner 2049
902,moonbus-982-519398,2049 Film-Noir,8,22 June 2020,"BR2049 received a number of poor reviews here, mostly panning the film for being slow and boring. If those viewers expected relentless action (laser-sabre duels, pod races, and/or starship battles), they were watching the wrong film; BR was never that sort of sci-fi. The film unfolds more like a Raymond Chandler novel than a JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot.I found BR2049 very timely in respect of how a society treats its underclass and de-humanizes slaves. The 'real people' in the film assume that replicants do not have souls, and the replicants believe this, too. One is reminded of a quote from James Baldwin: ""The real tragedy of prejudice is that the victims themselves eventually believe it.""The first BR was very atmospheric, very dark (L.A. always in rain), and the soundtrack was excellent (Vangelis). It gained iconic status for its vision of a dystopian future and set a benchmark for sci-fi films.I don't think BR2049 quite matched that level again; still, I don't think it deserved the many poor reviews it got here. I used to be annoyed that the Bogart version of ""The Big Sleep"" left so many loose ends. Until I read Chandler; the novel is that way, too, deliberately vague about how many crooks are involved and what their motives are. BR2049 has that sort of Chandler-ish feel about it, with so many 'bad guys' trying to hunt down Deckard and clues which lead the replicant 'K' (and the viewer) astray. If some viewers found this sort of detective-hunt boring and slow, I guess they wouldn't like Chandler either.The sequel has some big pluses and a few minuses.Big plus: Ford reprises a major early role and is quite believable in this one. You can read his thoughts and feelings in his face (no dialog needed) when he is confronted by Niander Wallace with a grim choice.The story picks up some of the loose ends from the first film. This is both a plus and a minus: plus for those who watched the first film, minus for those who did not.The film is visually stunning. Big plus.The anclliary characters (Chief of LAPD played by Robin Wright; Wallace's Major Domo the beautiful but ice-cold replicant aptly mis-named ""Luv""; the lovely holo-entertainment-girl also aptly mis-named ""Joi"" whom you can see but not touch) are all very well cast, very well played, and very well integrated into the story.Minus: too much of long looking at ruined landscapes. Yes, these bits were slow and boring.Plus: the film dares to broach some tough philosophical questions: what is it to be human? How do we know replicants don't have souls? Is there something special about having been born and not 'hatched' in a test tube? Replicant Lives Matter.Overall, I'd say the 2049-update is a worthy eight-star sequel to the original ten-star BR.",Blade Runner 2049

That being said, I'm still trying to digest the story. Blade Runner 2049 felt like it progressed with the intricate story laid down by its predecessor. It's going to take a few re-watches to really get my opinion of it set in stone.I'm not going to spoil anything by indulging in the story details; I'm still trying to digest it myself. What I can tell you is despite its complexities, it's actually well-paced and leaves plenty of room for debate and question. It's a unique franchise, absolutely. I mean, how else does one make an effective neo-noir sci-fi movie while being a visual effects game-changer? It's not an easy task, but Dennis Villanueve handles well. I don't feel like it fleshes out the original as much as I had hoped, but it definitely runs with what it has.With regards to its technical mastery of sound and visual effects, oh man. Seldom will you find something that approaches it. It's easily worth the $16 and change to see it in IMAX. For those who are so inclined, I strongly implore you to make the effort to see it in this format. Roger Deakins absolutely nails it. Will definitely be seeing it again in theaters, if only to soak in the visuals and the overwhelming score by Hans Zimmer.Re-review: running length is a delicate task. Too short and you lose valuable plot points, too long and you bore your audience. It's seemingly too long for a movie but too short to expand into a series.

Nothing happens in this movie, at all... it's like watching cut scenes in a video game that you can't play and all the action or significant moments were during gameplay. I truly believe IMDB reviews are fraudulent.",Blade Runner 2049

Boring.Unfortunately this film suffers from the same problems. It's too long, way too slow and is a bit of a slog to watch. It took me 2 attempts over 2 evenings.What it does have however is absolutely gorgeous cinematography, special effects and production design. The acting is excellent, ford is decent for a change once he shows up and the whole film bristles with this superb moody ambience.It's not enough to make this an entertaining enough film though. It's glacial pace just undermines the whole picture, but I equally can see why some people would call this a masterpiece. It's a piece of art, no question.",Blade Runner 2049
907,rawena_bll,"Mediocre, prenentious, predictible",4,29 October 2020,"That's it. Making a movie slow as hell does not make it good. I didn't hate Ryan Gosling for the first time and maybe it was because his face didn't move, not even once. It was not even ironically funny how they all tried to keep straight faces while reading their cringy lines. The plot was really obvious from the beginning. Character motives were really shallow for a film that pretends so hard to be deep. Jared Leto, my poor man has become a sign of a bad film now. I would like to see more shots of the world to be properly immersed in it but that didn't happen either. After almost 3 hours of unnecessarily drawing out scenes and not delivering anything, the film kinda tells you that something big at the end is coming. And the main message turns out to be ""I can have a baby so I'm human."" I laughed out loud at this point.This film proves that Hollywood will take any film with a shred of soul and the slightest possibility to make money and turn them into soulless, empty, formulated films that have no artistic vision and no geniune emotion other than the need for making money. And the audiences will eat it up.",Blade Runner 2049
908,sc-700-363458,A worthy successor,10,9 October 2017,"Great film. Looks amazing with lots of touches relating back to the original film. Definitely worth seeing in the cinema on a big screen, although I'm a bit deaf after being blasted by the bass sounds. We saw the two-D version on the basis it is a long film to watch in three-D.Still looked amazing. Good acting, good story, nice twists, great action scenes, didn't follow the same plot as the first one. Some very nice touches over that nature of how technology is going, particularly AI. Best film of the year - definitely, better than the original? Well I need to see it a few time before I make that decision. Oh and watch the first one first, my granddaughter didn't and got rather lost in the plot.",Blade Runner 2049
909,petricor,How Blade Runner 2049 got sidetracked into being all about AI.,5,5 October 2017,"Blade Runner was about what it was like to be human told from a very human perspective because replicants were biological. The sequel feels more like what does it take for artificial intelligence to be human and if it feels vaguely familiar it's because it is. That theme has been overdone, most notably and recently in movies like Ex Machina and Her, which do the theme more justice. There's a real lack of connectivity with the film because they're trying to shove AI and electronics and the original theme is lost in translation. It's an updated, commercialized Blade Runner for the masses in 2017.I found the scenes with the AI woman frustrating. How convenient to remove a real human from the equation and settle for something unreal and try to make it real to validate your experiences. The replicant idea was thrown away, pushed away to the side to pave the way for this AI theme. I found it a troubling commentary on our modern era of technology and left feeling perplexed and disturbed.Also, to lightly touch upon other subjects because I don't have the heart to expand: A clever twist doesn't make a clever plot or mystery. You still got plot holes and questions left at the end. Not satisfying at all.The music isn't nearly as evocative as the original movie's was and the only time I connected with it was when it was literally using the original movie's notes. Not sure what is with Hans Zimmer this year between this and Dunkirk.The ambiance of the original is gone. You don't create tension and intrigue by automatically extending each scene.You can forget about having a scene like Tears in Rain. The dialogue was literally cringe-worthy in more places than it should have been.Overall, save your money. Watch the trailer. Watch the short clips, they evoke more emotion. Better yet, re-watch the original. Forget the sequel ever happened.",Blade Runner 2049
910,John-564-342449,"Misjudged, far too long & feels more like a sequel to ""Oblivion"" than to ""Blade Runner""",6,10 October 2017,"Denis Villeneuve is a good director, but none of his Hollywood films are masterpieces, because the screenplays somehow all lack. He has a style that's hard to define - it's a dry, serious and operatic realism with some added existential weight. After the acclaimed ""Arrival"", Villeneuve could do what he wanted, but if ""Blade Runner 2049"" is his pure vision, than he's even more overrated than I thought. Why is this not nearly as good as Ridley Scott's work of genius ""Blade Runner""(1982) ?a) It's far too long for the rather minimal plot. I like slow movies usually, but Villeneuve goes beyond the breaking point here. I simply lost track of the causalities and motivations, because it was too static. Scenes with great potential - like the Las Vegas casino fight between the holograms - lose their power because they play like in slow motion. If they would have cut down every scene a little bit - without sacrificing one second of the fantastic city vistas - it could have been 20 minutes shorter easily. And more powerful. It feels too slow, self-important, bloated and empty like it is.b) This is often science fantasy, not science fiction: The imagined forms don't follow any clear function or logic. The technologies and designs look operatic, but not believable sometimes. They are more like New Age eye candy, not a believable part of a future world. Compare this to Kubrick/Spielberg's ""A.I."" and the original ""Blade Runner"" and you'll know what I mean. For example the 'replicant woman birth scene': It looks artful, but it's not believable. These slimy high tech creatures just fall from the heaven ? Did the stork deliver them in one piece ? I would have liked to see, how they are made. But this looks comical in its simplicity.c) It's too talky. Some critics called it ""prose, not poetry"" and that's pretty much it. They should have cut down some of the dialogue, especially of some supporting characters.d) It looks and feels closer to Joseph Kosinski's ""Oblivion"" (2013) than ""Blade Runner"" (1982), because Villeneuve decided to go against the iconic constant-darkness-while-it's raining-environment of the original ""Blade Runner"" & he added vistas of the California and Nevada desert, just like in that Tom Cruise film. Drones and an 'underground army' appear here, too, similar too the Cruise flick. Roger Deakins' cinematography has not the poetic, mysterious and dark qualities that made Jordan Cronenweth's groundbreaking work so unique. Yes, it's beautiful, but it isn't really ""Blade Runner"" and some scenes - I hate to say it - don't look very interesting, while others are calling visually too much attention to itself. Sometimes you feel the studio and the sets, which destroys the suspension of disbelief. It still looks good, but it's not right for this film.e) Ryan Gosling is a fine actor, but I'm afraid he wasn't a good choice for this, because there is something in his face that rather makes me smile than feel existential drama. I just couldn't take him seriously in this context. And the whole dynamic between Ford and Gosling doesn't feel right. It's like a theater work shop, where they improvise a little and crack up sometimes. Bradley Cooper would have been a better choice for the lead. And Ford's acting should have been more restrained, not in his usual 'action hero' mode.f) The unforgettable score by Vangelis is repeated at the very end. And it's still moving in a way, that Hans Zimmer's electronics are not. The new score by Zimmer is nothing special and it doesn't improve the images like the operatic Vangelis score did. You will forget Zimmer's compositions when you are out of the cinema pretty quickly. Not his strongest work.What I liked best about ""Blade Runner 2049"" is the love story sub plot with the 'hologram' of the beautiful Ana de Armas. That was very well done, had the most poetic cinematography and was kind of emotionally touching. But even this concept - falling in love with an artificial being - has been explored in ""A.I."" (Spielberg), ""Her"" (Spike Jonze) and other films before, so it can't claim to be original. But it's still a worthy addition. If the rest of the film would have been as good as all the scenes with Ana de Armas,it would have been great, but it's not even close to the quality of those few scenes.""Blade Runner 2049"" will probably get Academy Award noms for Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Sound, Best Sound Mixing and maybe Best Visual Effects, but - to be honest - it doesn't deserve to win any of these against the superior ""Dunkirk"".Maybe Villeneuve will create a masterpiece one day, if the material, screenplay, cast and edit is right, but this ain't it.At least ""Blade Runner 2049"" confirms what too many people denied too long: Ridley Scott is a genius and his ""Blade Runner""(1982) was a singular achievement, that can't be replicated.",Blade Runner 2049
911,daniel-n-c180,Great cinematography,8,1 July 2019,"Nothing exceptional narratively, but visually it's fantastic. It's immersive and it makes a really really good sequel. I liked it.",Blade Runner 2049
912,peterspam-22486,Was I ready to see how deep the rabbit hole goes?..,8,31 October 2017,"A film-noir about Loneliness. Deep, dark, hopeless loneliness. That is the feeling that will seize you if you allow it to engulf you, if you dare to immerse yourself in this movie. Not for moments, not with the ending, but throughout the film. And as a film-noir with such purpose, it has reached its goal in a sublime way. If that was the message to convey. Was it?.. Was the director clear about the message it wanted to convey?.. Judging by the very last scene, I do have some doubts left though.I try to remain objective about this movie, as I feel it has almost fully succeeded to detach itself from the original Blade Runner which for me is definitely one of the, if not THE, best sci-fi of all times. This movie should definitely not be seen as a sequel in my recommendation. The major difference between the original and 2049 is the atmosphere: while the original filled me with a majestic, overwhelming feeling of an expanding universe with limitless possibilities amid the darkness and a clear message of Hope in the end, the new movie has filled me with desperation and an utter feeling of loneliness, the conclusion that all is hopeless and lost. The ending did not manage to turn this and for that I am disappointed, as throughout the long movie I was hoping that all this slow-moving build-up will finalize in a cathartic ending. Instead, it left me disappointed and with the only scene that I feel (unfortunately) did copy the first movie's ending almost literally, but in a dissonant way. I think that the music had much to do with it: the constant humming, pulsating bass added more of a horror tint to this movie, while Vangelis' music in the original almost had me in tears of joy. Such emotion through music, it can lift spirits or destroy one utterly through the soullessness, as is made by a machine. The reason I loved the original was its human face: the bitter-sweet moments of human and android at the piano and deep feelings of love, to memories, family, self and to life. The credibility of the android in its own emotions. The fragility and character development of the merciless hunter, who became the hunted. The drama of the existence of the androids and the ambiguity of their purpose. The ever present suspense, open for any means of ending and plots to unfold. The very fabric of the movie, portraying both life and death, emotions of extremes in those not deemed worthy of emotions. It made for an experience never to be forgotten and set the foundation of that strange world, which perhaps is not so far from ours in many ways. And who can forget about the test with the turtle? ""Tell me about your mother.."" The new one is fully deprived from all emotion. It's as if we suddenly see everything through machine eyes, depriving us from the right of having emotions. It may be an issue with the acting or the simple fact that we take everything for face value from the start: the hologram partner is just bits and bytes, the hunter is an android with low chances of dying and emotions seem to be bits and bytes too, not challenged by our thoughts of whether we should believe them. The new movie failed in creating emotions that force us to reassess our privilege of having them, over robots that are not supposed to have them. It gives us no free will to contemplate, to think and evaluate anything. Instead, it presents us with solutions from the start and a far too obvious matter of implanted memories. Does it really matter in the end how the memory plot turns out to be, if I am left with the same sadness from the start till the end? One cannot but feel pity and sadness for the tragedy of these beings, but it leaves us without twists or paradigms to put our teeth in: it's a silver platter of sorrow, to be chewed for the duration of the movie and to be swallowed with no fine wine to ease the burden. The only hope we feel is to be relieved from this pressing burden, the burden the movie puts on us. But there is no relief, ever.So why do I still rate this movie so highly? To torment ourselves on the tragedy of life and our very own existence, this film-noir scores top marks. If you're ready to be subdued, you will rarely find a more sublime piece of art that can push you into the abyss. Which it will: what other purpose would a movie like this serve than to swallow you, as with a mindset of light entertainment it would be a cringe piece of bore?.. For the (not so few) of us who leave the cinema with the uncomfortable feeling of rather wanting to forget about the strange emotions this movie left us with: just give it some time, the day may come when you're ready to take the plunge.",Blade Runner 2049
913,alva3901,Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece.,10,5 November 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel that measures equally to its predecessor, a masterpiece in its own right. However, it seems much like the original, that Blade Runner 2049 will not meet its status as an iconic sci-fi film for some years to come. This is a visual masterpiece, depicting the most beautiful ruin of a city that has graced a film. From beginning to end in its 2h 44min run-time, it captivates the wonder of a decrepit dystopian world, all of which is shot beautifully by the incomparable Roger Deakins. The cast led by Ryan Gosling who plays ""K"" and Harrison Ford who returns as ""Rick Deckard"", act superbly to create an awe-inspiring film on the big screen.

You can't simply foul peoole by decorating a hollow movie with visual effects and some fancy sexy images to make them watch this and praise it. It took me 4 days to watch this movie because it was as boring as hell. The movie was just built based on short dialogues and some good scenery, and about plot and story? I'm sorry it didn't have any. First i thought it would worth it to watch the end and I at least can watch a good ending but holy crap, the movie ended right in the climax where anyone would expect joe to fight wallace and defeat him and put an end to this world of slavery once and for all, but instead we see that deckard sees his daughter after many years. Are we so mindless to watch a movie just to see an old man seeing his daughter again? Where's the point? where's the final fight? where's the ending of what you first started the movie with? Yeah right the writer has lost his way and forgot why he even did start.
I don't want to write much all i can say is that this movie was horrific in plot and story besides it's good scenery and visual effects. And about the love story within, it was totally unrelated and broken to relate and believe. The writer should have worked more on it, other than that it was just a side story for romance lovers which totally can't satisfy them. I'm done here and i hope you look deeper to this movie and see it's flaws and don't praise it pointlessly.",Blade Runner 2049
915,Neonfinity,The Year is 2049,10,12 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is the 2017 sequel to the cult 1982 original. This stars Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, and Harrison Ford. I have seen the original and consider it among my favorite films. So, having high expectations with a director I trust, how did this fare? Well, I'm glad you asked. 2049 takes place a full 30 years later after the original. Blade Runner officer ""K"" is planted on a new case after his findings from his last retirement job, discovering that a replicant had a child decades prior. Along the way, he meets Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) whilst finding answers to not just the case, but also to who he is.2049's characters are surprisingly great and intriguing to see and learn about. K's relationship with Joi really showed how far the possibility of humanity coercing with technology on a personal and sexual manner. Harrison Ford gives one of his best performances i've seen from him in a while. And Jared Leto gives a performance that completely washes away the sins of his Suicide Squad role.I loved this movie. Without Denis Villeneuve directing, I would have been entirely suspicious going in. And it exceeded my already high expectations. The set design and visual effects are the best i've seen in recent memory. This is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year, let alone theatrically. If you're reading this now, I urge you to go and see it.2049 includes themes of love, technology, humanity, and environmentalism. The tech presented here feels more realistic than most sci-fi movies today such as surprising audio glitches, programs getting put on hold when there's a phone call, and a start-up sound being present no matter the scenario. This film also takes the environment of the first film and makes it even more claustrophobic and crowded, in one brilliant shot making you think the tops of buildings are the ground.It's a shame to see something like this do poorly at the box office. Though now that I think about it, makes it seem more like the original, except this time has garnered huge critical praise and a following already. This is a very adult film as kids should probably put this film on hold. Everyone else should watch it at least once.Overall, I give Blade Runner 2049 a 10/10",Blade Runner 2049
916,anand-27,Not a sharp Blade,3,6 October 2017,"There has always been a debate among my friends about the original Blade Runner being way too linear and indulgent and that its cult status was earned on the back Rutger Hauer's closing lines, all that rain and the business hoodoo (save for Coke, all the companies that were up in neon lights went bust).There will be no debate among us over Blade Runner 2049. It has the original beat for being ridiculously indulgent by a mile. OH MY GOD, does every scene need to be that long and lingering that one could doze off and wake up to Ryan Gosling having taken maybe three steps forward in a scene? When a movie runs for as long as BR2049 does, it needs to give us something...at the very least someone to root for - the closest we come to is Harrison Ford's Deckard who is old and craggy and the barely there pulse of the movie (and even then we have to wait till the final 45 or so minutes). I like Ryan Gosling but he was wasted in this, as were the other cast members. Fanboys may prop this up but even die-hard fans will know deep down that this isn't as sharp as the trailers and hype would have you believe.",Blade Runner 2049
917,thatchermacdonald,What does it mean to be human?,10,5 March 2018,"A breathtaking sequel to perhaps THE greatest sci-fi film of all time. The original Bladerunner, aside from its revolutionary impact on science fiction films in general, explored the idea of artificial intelligence by diving into the emotional element-- and what better way to explore the human condition than through the lens of an artificial being manufactured to mimic every human feature, including self-awareness. For human perception naturally involves self-reflection, which in turn creates internal and external emotional responses. The greater the emotion, the more powerful the memory. To be human is to find our way down the path of life and to negotiate the joys and sorrows that are experienced along the way. One can use emotional responses associated with memories in order to help bring understanding to the ultimate question-- what purpose did the path serve, if any. Bladerunner 2049 explores these same fascinating questions, including original elements from the original title to expand the scope and add several new dimensions along the way. The main villain from the original movie played by Rutger Hauer, who famously improvised the last ""tears in rain"" line, is a tragic character in some sense. Rutger, unlike Gosling, was a true villain out to kill humans (and many he did), as he struggled more with self-awareness due to lack of implants. But despite these differences, both characters are indeed tragic. The difference??? When Rutger found out the truth about his maker, he gouged out his eyeballs with his own hands. When Gosling found about his maker/true roots, he decided to save someone. Wait, that sounds familiar! The touching part about these movies is that in the end, life is found to be what is most precious, underscoring the reality that appreciation of life is indeed what makes us human-knowing how we came into existence (makers/parents) and the ability to comprehend our own mortality. In the end, both Replicant's finally come to this realization and commit the most human act one can make-the sacred act of saving another human being's life. Bravo Ridley and those who worked this film. Very well-done sequel. And most importantly, THANK YOU HANS ZIMMER.",Blade Runner 2049
918,ladiesbane,"Failure as sequel, failure as stand-alone.",3,7 October 2017,"** Warning! Here May Be Spoilers, for this movie and others. ** The original Blade Runner evoked a strong feeling: I might be manufactured by others, but it doesn't invalidate my identify. My experiences are singular and I feel them deeply. However I got here, I am real.Blade Runner 2049 starts with an alienated second-class citizen craving that validated authenticity. His story is derailed by side issues -- his owner/operator's problems, corporate drama, a sort of love interest, profit motive, the Resistance, (pseudo-)scientific posturing, and other irrelevancies. By the end, when the story has gone in a different direction entirely, our hero just lies down and gives up, and us with him.Specifics: Pacing / Story / Characters: BR2049 is too long and way too slow. There is no point or purpose, no golden narrative thread. Overall it watches like the boring parts of Matrix movies, eliminated from the supercut and reworked for a different color palette. Ryan Gosling is Neo, Jared Leto plays The Architect, Carla Juri is the Oracle, Edward James Olmos is The Keymaker...the parallels don't stop there. Yawn.Dialogue: the pretentious, vaguely ominous, Messianic BS that put you to sleep in the Matrix sequels has been refurbished for our sad, hunky Pinocchio in his futuristic pimp coat.Deckard: his part begins with a Disneyfied sequence a la ""Cowboys & Aliens"" including cheesy wisecracks and a rough-and-tumble meet-cute, which ends unceremoniously with an ""I'm too old for this"" surrender. The sequence takes place in a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas that has occasional funny parts (which I hope were unintentionally funny rather than failed attempts at comic relief for non-existent tension.) After investing so much time in Ryan Gosling and his story, the focus shifts to Deckard, who isn't himself away from LA, and whose tacked-on storyline hijacks the movie. (Regret: The lost years of Deckard and Rachael with the Replicant Resistance underground should have been a separate movie.) Here, Deckard starts as comic relief and ends as a plot device to move the story to some kind of conclusion. There is some emotional button-pushing for fans of the original (oh, Rachael!) and a tired attempt at emotional manipulation (getting to know the child we had no idea you'd ever wanted but for that one line a few minutes ago.)Costumes: there are no costumes, styles, or fashion. Only clothes.A/V: there are lovely, lingering shots of what appear to be abandoned Brutalist / Eastern Bloc / doomsday cult headquarters blanketed in untouched snow. There is gorgeous, impersonal CGI. There are building-high images of beautiful naked women, blandly presented and titillation-free. The music includes watery variations on the original score, interspersed with sinus-clearing brown noise.(I will probably buy this movie for those location shots, quiet stills, and long, honking chords. I even want the music. But it's sad that the kernel notes of Vangelis, so precise and delicate, shine out purely even as their impact is bled away by the insubstantial context of the movie and the score.) In contrast, I saw the sequel as a double feature with the remastered original, which took on new richness in the cinema setting. The original is a quick sit, modeled after rogue cop film noir: vibrant characters, clear narrative purpose, a stunning moll, gritty romance, and a getaway ending with a crystallized message. The sequel is pointless, diluted, internally inconsistent, and slow.In Blade Runner 2049, people cry All.The.Time. -- and now you know why.",Blade Runner 2049
919,vivaciouscontent,This film was wayyy tooo long yet pretty good too!,8,8 April 2018,"Director Denis Villeneuve can be an utter genius at times. In a decade or two, he will be regarded as one of the greats because the way he presents the visuals in his films are pretty amazing and off the charts compared to other filmmakers. But I do have alot of concerns with this film as well. First of all, the ""villains."" I say villains with quotation marks because technically, the Blade Runner film isn't suppose to have a ""classic"" villain who represents the darker extreme of black-and-white, good-and-evil dichotomy, yet nevertheless, the ""villains"" in this film who are depicted by actors/actresses such as Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks are honestly flat-out sad. I know people rave about Jared Leto's acting skills, but like many good actors, in order for their skills to shine, the director has to put them in a situation where their skills can really come to a life of their own. It's only on or two actors in a generation who truly have the ability to act well in any given situation. Unfortunately, Jared Leto is not one of them, and as a result, the film Blade Runner 2049 suffers. As for Sylvia Hoeks, she's just a bad actress overall. Her acting skills reminded me of that of Milla Jovovich in that God-awful movie Ultraviolet. A real cancer to the eyes. Despite these shortcomings, the movie really has a ""flavor"" of its own as put on by the visual menagerie at the courtesy of its director Denis Villeneuve. I'll tell you one thing though. The visuals can be so enriched with artistic panache that they come off as really unrealistic (I mean wtf was all that human statue stuff and the bees doing there?) that it really takes you out of the whole film. And the pacing as well. There's a scene where someone finally gets to met another so-and-so and the pacing JUST. DRAG. ON. The scene that ensues after that as well in this dark, flashing place with Elvis in the background as well. Why make the pacing of the film just utterly cancerous for the viewer? Might as well take us out to the back parking lot of the theatre, tie us up onto a wooden plank and waterboard us for the next half-an-hour. But other than those snafu's, the film is pretty good, is visually stunning, has amazing acting bu competent actors and actresses (referring to Ryan Gosling, Dave Bautista, Ana de Armas, and Carla Juri. Good job you guys!), and invites the viewer to ask pretty profound questions, hence the 8 stars.",Blade Runner 2049

The film is a visual orgy from the first scene to the last. it has moments of pure genius and a few scenes are anthological with many references to the original. Gosling and Ford are both perfect, but the film as a whole isn't, it has two major flaws: the first one is that is too fairytale-ish and ""in the clouds"" - it does not provide that dirty feeling of real life on the streets that the original had. The second one is that it was obviously made as the middle part of a trilogy - the audience is left with a smack on the face in the closing scene with the question: ""Now what""?

A masterpiece. Honestly and truly a masterpiece. Villenueve's skillful direction, fantastic performances from Gosling, Ford, Armas, Leto, and Wright, Oscar winning cinematography from Deakins, and the most impeccable art direction I have ever seen combine to make a massive and in my opinion, flawless movie.I became very cautious at the idea of a sequel being made over thirty years after the first film's release.

The sequel introduces new routes of discussion to the original's themes of humanity, artificial intelligence, class division, and so much more.

Thirty five years it took to try, yet despite all the technological advancements the result is a weak, typical Hollywood spin-off.This sequel lacks all the suspense of the original (somehow as a film lacks all suspense altogether), the whole film pivots about one question, with over two hours of talk and rather tedious eleven second shots obviously filmed on sets, I longed for the artistry of Scott and the power of his original (plus, I couldn't have that ring tone - was never a fan of Peter and the Wolf anyway).For me it's nothing more than a simple cash-in on a classic.",Blade Runner 2049

There is one problem, even if though the story progresses, there are MANY points which are so slow and dull that destroy the whole movie.

However this artistic style, the fact that director took his time with every scene – this will only make you feel worse when the ending credits finally appears. Then you will finally come to understand that this movie practically had no screenplay, story so weak that it only makes you wonder ""am I not getting something or what?"". What however is the worse is the main character – another lonely robot with cybernetic soul. This movie is made for critics not for people who love movies. Why? Critics care little about story, or a purpose of the movie. For critic, screenplay is just one point on a long chart of requirements that ""good"" movie should meet. So the fact that spectator is totally detached from the main character makes no impact on technical side of the production. This is technically true.

934,normandy-215-430694,A good sequel that didn't need to be made !,2,7 October 2017,"I love the original , in fact it's my favorite film , the original cut mind you, not the fiddled it's editions.So there's was never a need for a part two.. it left the two main characters right where it needed to be , a happy , slightly ambiguous ending Spoilers now ahead ... u have been warned .....This sequel ruins that by writing its own ending to Deckard and Rachel. A sad ending .The visuals were spectacular, -the palette, cinematography anid editing outstanding...that's it. It was disquietingly 'comforting' to revisit Scott's beloved dystopia...for about 30 minutes. Unfortunately, the script and characters lacked dimensions and depth, and the storyline (simple) was drawn out inexorably. It lacked the rawness of emotion and the moments of delightful 'whimsy' of its predecessor, and the all-important soundtrack was jarring, repetitive and monotonous. Why Vangelis wasn't asked to do it , is beyond me. Hans Zimmer is a great composer , however totally wrong for this movie. Harrison Ford is hardly in the movie , and being taken off world fir info ? Why couldn't he be asked for info on earth ? Made no sense .While all the major characters were set up to have a lot of potential -none of them realised it. Jared Leto in particular was just rammed home as ""Very bad guy""..absolutely no conflicts or ambiguities to make his character any more than a ho-hum antagonist. He just shouldn't have been in the movie at all. It made no sense too.Harrison/Deckert at least had some colours in his character but he hardly appeared , and Rachel is in it for 2 minutes - but I'm not sure I didn't overlay most of them from my memories of the original.

936,msmith-56,Definitely a Sequel,6,9 October 2017,"Short Strokes: 1) Loud sounds - the audio mix in the theater put far too much mid-range in what should have been very low frequency bass. The result was like the movie Dune. Fortunately, this was somewhat infrequent. 2) They make someone old look young again, and it reminds me of Carrie Fisher's character in Star Wars: Rouge. Clever, but not quite good enough and, therefore, distracting. 3) There were no small actors in original Blade Runner, even the smallest roles were great performances. Not so here, very good acting but little showmanship (Ford's and Hoek's roles were exceptional).Summary: Any time you are following a cult classic with a sequel, you expect the lights to be a little dimmer and the edges to be a little duller. True here. Expectations were set in 1982 and recently elevated with a $50 million marketing blitz, and it is hard to live up to that. There was more playing it safe in this movie: no loose ends like crane cables on 'flying' police cars or brown-eyed Rachel's green Voight Kampff eye. No daring, too little stress in Gossling's character and not enough vixen in Robin Wright's. No one tried to pull off a scene stealing performance like Rutger Hauer's or Hy Pike's.As for cinematography, the look was often muted, which made the scenes feel longer than they should. Otherwise, it was a spectacle unto itself. It might have been the theater's projector, but the dynamic range seemed too narrow.As for the story line, it seemed very much like a logical progression from the original. The dialog was engaging, and it left questions unanswered for another sequel.Bottom Line: a sure bet but not enough risk taking to be great.",Blade Runner 2049
937,moshomaniac,"A sequel to a Sci Fi Classic, much delayed, that kind of disappoints",7,18 December 2017,"As I'm writing this, I say with a heavy heart I was a little disappointed in this film. I wanted to like this film. I really did. But the film has some problems that hinder the full enjoyment. Allow me to elaborate. The biggest problem is the length. The first Blade Runner from 1982 clocks in at only about an hour and a half. Blade Runner 2049, by contrast is almost 3 hours long, a bit too long for a film with such a laborious pace. The first one is very sluggish in its pace, but makes up for it with atmosphere. Blade Runner 2049 seems to take it time at inappropriate moments: in a scene where the main character is looking for Rick Deckard, it takes 15 minutes when it could have just as easily take only 5. 
Onto the look of the film. As a visual film, Blade Runner 2049 is stunning. Absolutely beautiful to look at. The gloomy and depressing atmosphere is overpoweringly gorgeous. That is a definite plus. The production designers deserve to win Oscars. What about the story? Well, here goes:
The rogue Nexus 6 replicants have been obliterated, and a new generation has come out that seems (mostly) compliant, used for slave labor and servitude. The main character, known only as 'K', is trying to locate Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford), as they have found the dead body of Rachel(Sean Young), and have discovered that replicants, although told they are inferior, have the ability to have offspring(it is obvious from the corpse she died in childbirth), in this case, Deckard and Rachel's offspring. Afraid of what this discovery will do if word of it gets out to the replicant community, they send K to kill him. Interesting premise, but the problem here is that there are far too many slow moments. The first movie was slow, but it at least had something interesting to look at, so I was never bored. This film by has too much nothing in it, and is often boring. 
The acting is pretty solid. I always love to see Harrison Ford in any movie, and the actor who played the main character, Ryan Gosling, did a pretty likable job, too, as did the rest of the cast. One particular standout was Ana De Armas, as K's holographic roommate. A very touching scene is featured where she tries to make love to him, in a sense, when she hires a prostitute and superimposes her image over her. I know it sounds kind of lewd, but in the picture, it is a very sweet and moving segment, done in a surprisingly tasteful way.
That being said, I'd love to give this movie a second watch. I'm hoping I will warm up to it more. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 isn't as memorable as the first film, but it will likely be destined to be a cult classic just like the first, as it offers so many intriguing themes. It just needed to be a bit shorter.",Blade Runner 2049

940,Artifam,Bladerunner 2049 : A No Spoilers Review,9,20 October 2017,"The old dilemma of which version of Bladerunner to watch was big enough (Tip: Final Cut first), before those who haven't seen it now having to grapple with the new quandary of which order to watch the old and the new 2049 sequel. As equally ambiguous as the question of Deckard's nature as human or replicant, there is no sure-fire answer. However, if choosing to watch the original after viewing the new, one might be surprised by the human lightness in the tonal darkness of the original, with Harrison Ford's performance echoing a little of Star War's Han Solo's acerbic wit for instance. 2049 to this end lacks humour (arguably befitting of the new story), save for Ana de Armas' lightly jovial warm charm thawing some of the coolness of the latest offering. It's perhaps ironic that the new Bladerunner comes out of the eternal night of the original and shows us some of the daylight world of the evolved dystopia, yet at the same time is a darker serving of film noir. Leto's menacing performance unflinchingly twists a knife into this darkness that reminds us that Roy Batty's commination in the original was still served up with a sardonic smile and while neither story tells of a happy place, 2049 shows a world where the existence of soul is as sapped as the attenuation of nature in dystopia's collpased eco- systems and smoggy Anthropocene environment. The oppressiveness of Bladerunner 2049 overshadows some of the enjoyment of the original, as the original's music score was able to cut through and lighten the insalubrious world of 2019. To expect to be able to directly transpose Vangelis' majestically atmospheric sound track to the future incarnation is naive, in so much it is a near-impossibility. Instead, Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch's score is giddily claustrophobic and gurning, in keeping with the oppressiveness of this new world, but they do still manage to successfully interweave sufficient traces of Vangelis' sound to evoke memories of the original at key moments. The synths of the original are missing - On the one hand, they would seem dated and retro to a modern audience, but on the other, fans of the original may be left searching for a 2049 equivalent of the aural (and visual) splendour of Zhora's crashing through the window in 2019. However, 2049 does gift us with a poignant parallel to 2019's 'Tears in the rain'. Villeneuve undoubtedly succeeds with the poison chalice brief of delivering a true and organic sequel, although its pace can set it jarringly apart from Ridley Scott's original. Wide panning landscape cinematography perhaps unifies the two though and Villneuve brings his aerial down-panned camera tracking , present in Sicario, to build upon and vary the mode. One could also wonder if Villneuve used his alien-encounter offering, Arrival, as a stalking horse to test audience's patience for deliberately paused pacing in the story telling. It's ironic that Ridley Scott has recently stepped on accelerate with the lightening fast-paced Alien Covenant, erroneously seeking to satisfy audiences with a tighter film, whereas Bladerunner 2049 is daringly ballsy in its non-compliance and gratuitous play to the fans' indulgence - A move that perhaps hurt its box office takings, by restricting run times and turning off those lacking patience to sit through 2 hrs 43 mins of storytelling. Furthermore however, after enduring the cheesy Marvel trailer for Thor: Ragnarok before the title screen of Bladerunner 2049, one is eternally thankful that 2049 is not a similar 'crash- bang-wallop' high-speed CGI affair. 2049 has grit and CGI, but both are wholly intelligently used without notable artificiality or feeling of sensationalism or bombardment. And whilst 2049 truthfully does require patience at times with its plodding pace, it still offers high-octane satisfaction, selectively served up to strictly necessary ends instead of titillation. One could argue that some of the acting performances take a moment to bed in. Take Arma's wooden voice in the background as we are introduced to her in K's apartment, but as with all new faces in this film, their delivery and demeanour soon find definition in their context. No more so than Gosling's performance, which shows indifference and superficiality, but also depth and dynamic range, all with narrative intention to the story that unfolds before the viewer.In conclusion, 2049 is stylistically different but a clear extension of the original set in 2019 with parallels in tone, machinery, familiar faces and symbolisms. It's a blessing that the theatre trailer does not disclose enough to spoil the adventure that this new film offers, which the viewer can share through K's personal voyage of confounding discovery. The plot meanders with obfuse yet intentional purpose to wrap up neatly with a nice twist and satisfactory closure, while also setting a new dynamic in motion for the story to evolve in some future new chapter, be it earth-bound or off-world.",Blade Runner 2049

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't enjoyable and I definitely would not watch it again. The same can be said for this movie, but I honestly ended up quite enjoying this one. It's basically more of the same... literally, it's like 10 hours long, but it manages to actually be mostly enjoyable and not just a statement to prove how clever the directors are, even though it does feel like it at certain points.The story is...meh. It doesn't really feel like a sequel to Blade Runner and I can't really tell whether that's a good or a bad thing. It's also really really unessecarily long!!The acting is nothing special. Ryan Gosling is basically the same character from Drive, Harrison Ford was in it just to sell tickets, Ana de Armes is cute and I can't really say much about Jared Leto. The one exceptional actor was Sylvia Hoeks as the villainous Luv, who is always a scene-stealer.Oh and did I mention how long this movie is? It's actually really frustrating how much time is wasted showing a character staring at something or walking long distances or pausing between sentences.The one thing that deserves most of the praise this movie is getting is its cinematography. Everything is just georgeous.

944,DwightLynn,Introspective and Life-Changing,10,30 January 2020,"Blade Runner 2049 is one of those rare treasures of a movie where every element of filmmaking comes together to make an unforgettable and mesmerizing experience. With visuals that are pure pleasure for the eye, and existential themes about individuality that near anyone can relate to, the power this film has is not to be underestimated. Although the slow pace may not be for everyone's taste, if one lets themselves become absorbed in the world of Blade Runner, they will find something to relate to. This is a film that is able to communicate, in a well-paced and well-acted story, just what it means to be human.The original Blade Runner never needed a sequel. Its story ended so succinctly and on such a powerful note that a continuation should logically detract from it. But somehow, by some miracle, there not only exists a sequel to the original Blade Runner, but it actually manages to transcend the original's themes, characters, and visuals.If any other director attempted to make a sequel, even Ridley Scott himself, I am convinced it would have been a complete disaster. However, this isn't just any filmmaker at the helm of this film. Behind the director's chair is Denis Villeneuve, the man who has made masterpiece after masterpiece with his career so far. He's mastered drama and tension with Prisoners (2013), he's tackled psychological thrillers with Enemy (2013), and he's already proven himself to be fluent in Sci-Fi with his previous mind-blowing film, Arrival (2016).In Blade Runner 2049, all the elements that made his previous films work so well are here in full. The film centers around a Blade Runner named Officer K, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling, who is in charge of putting down rogue androids which the predominant humans see as a threat.Right from the general premise the film carves out its own identity with its heartbreaking irony of having the lead android assasin be an android himself. Although the main character is quiet and reserved, we get to see a lot of how he thinks and feels through his actions. When killing an android in the opening scene, he shows no visible excitement or passion. This continues for the next couple scenes as we get to see his general routine, how he's treated, and we see how he lacks initiative. He has had his soul effectively ripped out of him through the tedium and psychological torture involved with his job. K constantly being abused is what makes his proactive turn to self-discovery that occurs later on so satisfying to witness. The original film was awe-inspiring with its dissection of what it means to be human, but this film appeals to me in a whole other way. In this film, K questions not only what he is, but he also chases a more personal question: who am I?Slow pacing permeates throughout the whole film, which allows for more time to be spent with its characters and its world. Some people may be turned off by how long certain scenes last, but I'd argue this is what makes the emotional moments hit even harder and it makes the breathtaking imagery stick with the audience even longer. When a film moves slowly, a sudden emotional jolt or revelation can feel all the more drastic and effective. Films these days seem to be afraid to stop and let audience's take something in. Even films I really enjoy are usually quick and lack any slow-pacing out of fear of boring the audience. What I appreciated about this film, and really all of Denis Villeneuve's films, is that they put faith in the audience. Villeneuve puts faith in the audience by not outright stating what the point of the movie was. Rather, the audience is left, much like the character K, to seek out meaning themselves.For me, this film helped me realize how important life is. How, even though I'm not the most important person in the world, I can still make a difference in people's lives. It is one thing for a film to entertain or be well-made on a technical level, but it is another thing entirely for a film to change how I view life. That is something only works of art can accomplish, and Blade Runner 2049 certainly qualifies.",Blade Runner 2049

If a picture can make me feel for a holographic woman and her relationship with her synthetic human named Joe, then that alone earns the praise of this simple sci-fi sojourner. Then again, Joi doesn't have much competition: the cold Lieutenant or the woman for hire. The visuals take us into one possible future while the score washes over us like a cold tide, with all the expected sensations and blaring nervous symptom responses. ""A and T and C and G... four symbols to make a man. And I'm only half that."" ""But twice as elegant."" These 10 seconds of prose cement this picture in tech noir myth forever.

950,martinjp-27642,Unjustifiably slow and self-indulgent,1,10 October 2021,"I like some of Villeneuve's movies, but every director's style has pitfalls. The pitfalls of Villeneuve's style is that the movies become unnecessarily slow and too focused on cinematography/atmosphere rather than having a compelling and complex plot. Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"" is deeply captivating; ""Sicario"" has an interesting rawness to it; ""Dune"" is just overall powerful.Blade Runner 2049 relies way too much on the fact that ""this is Blade Runner"", and we're supposed to automatically find Harrison Ford's character exciting, and we're supposed to automatically care about the movie's universe. My guess is if this wasn't a sequel and if this was made by an unestablished director, critics and audiences would have complained way more about the lack of a goal with the movie from the get-go and the lack of reason for us to care for any of these characters. The 20-30 second close-ups of characters looking sad or angry don't make me empathize with the characters, and the absolutely stunning visuals don't justify the lack of plot that could have easily been shown in a 2 hour format instead of a 3 hour format.As a result, the movie comes across as pretentious and self-indulgent.

One you may of thought of just now is the god father. What makes it such a good movie though? Well one thing is it is slow paced, long and patient. People thing that a movie being slow means it boring but it doesn't. This movies is so good because it is just like those old classics. It patient and takes it time with everything. Similar to Star Wars IV. The cinematography is amazing and so it the few bursts of action it has to break up the monotony. And the action is very quick and short so it makes it very gritty and realistic. Another movie I would compare it to when it comes to pacing and patients is 2001: a space Odyssey. I don't want to talk about it too much because I want people to see this movie. I will say this though. This movie is not like say avengers infinity war where it a instant classic that anyone can have a fun time watching. It's a sequel to a cult classic and this film also holds that same title. It requires you see the original. It requires you pay attention and try to see some of the hidden meanings. Overall if you have a short attention Spand you will not like this movie.

952,greenmemo,The Future of the Future,8,5 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is before anything else, an astonishing technical achievement and it should be celebrated for that alone. It is also a bold continuation to the story and the mystique of the original Blade Runner film directed by Ridley Scott in 1982. The main difference consisting in the fact that this new movie is heavier in the cyberpunk element and lighter in the classic noir component (I would argue 2049 is more of a thriller). I would assume Hamptom Fancher has read both Philip K. Dick and William Gibson in equal measure in order to find inspiration for the story, which also reminded me ""Children of Men"" in its humanism. In this film the line between human, replicant and A.I. is blurred to the extreme, to the point that after everything has been said and done, you might be left wondering if there had been actually any human in this movie at all. I won't say that this is the case, but it would give you an idea of how deep this movie delves into the allegorical and speculative implications of the basic concept of an artificial being who can actually be convinced that he is ""real"" and maybe the other way around. This is a long film, but the world building is so fascinating and realistic that you don't really mind the characters and camera lingering a little bit too much along urban landscapes and dilapidated buildings. The script has some problems in the form of excessive exposition and over explanation, but Dennis Villeneuve's direction is so assured that he manages to overcome these problems with the sheer power of his cinematographic language end emotional punch. The ending is appropriately ambiguous and bleak, and is open to discussion and interpretation. For sure a movie that needs more than one vision in order to fully appreciate every nuance and artistic stroke.",Blade Runner 2049
953,patrick_dn,Leave ALL your expectations at home,1,4 October 2017,"To make this 160+ min. monstrosity with nothing more than a paper thin story, with actors that can't even act being emotionally distant robots, with so-called futuristic booming sounds going off with every little pathetic emotion happening to the main character, the director literally blew every scene to a lengthy 5, 10 or 15 minutes annoyance fest. I had very few expectations when going to this film. But I had some. So I got utterly disappointed since even those low expectations weren't met! I'm genuinely amazed that this director has managed to make a dull, lifeless film from beginning to end. But then again he f*cked up 'Arrival' as well, so I shouldn't be surprised.

954,targaid,"Pretentious, ponderous, dull",4,25 October 2019,"In those ways it's very like its predecessor. The original, like most of Ridley Scott's work, spends so much time on visuals and lingers over them far too long to the detriment of story and pace. This film runs at 2:43 telling a story that would barely fill an hour if it wasn't for long, loving shots of pretty sets and portentous glances. It doesn't have the saving grace of allowing an interesting world, having interesting characters or a moment's tension. There isn't a moment when a character seems to feel any urgency about anything. Even after the climactic fight Joe takes time to gaze meaningfully at his fallen foe and stroke her cheek despite the fact that Deckard is trapped and drowning.
Through much of the film we're supposed to believe, like the character, that he's the child. Yet he does so many things a human couldn't possibly do there's no surprise to discover that he's not. He barely responds to his lover's pointless death so why would an audience?",Blade Runner 2049

Missing the tense action, superb cinematics (no CGI back then), outstanding soundtrack and moral ethics that made the original such a genre defining film.
No, the critics will have all been paid well for singing its praises whereas those of us who can remember and still relate to the original wont fall for the hype.

I've watched and analyzed Blade Runner for years since i was a little kid, explored old movies seeking spots that could have inspired that movie, and noticed most of the references and analogies in the movies after it. To me, Ridley Scott was extremely lucky to be surrounded by the right people at the right time to achieve such a high quality sci-fi noir movie (the original and final cut versions). Each and every year i hope that some rich talented guy make a movie that can somehow give me the same goose bumps and thrills me with philosophical questions; finally after many many years i've seen a movie that not only entertained me with those, but also delivered some of the most fascinating shots i've ever seen. This movie made me think about our society, about the relations, connections we have with the people around us, with the struggle of any individual to find a purpose, the fight to belong to something. The pace reminds me of those glorious old movies made in the past where every detail had a weight, every expression was a book to decipher. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, it's distant from the style of today for many reasons; exactly like an expansive bottle of Johnnie Walker, some people won't understand the taste and just reject it.",Blade Runner 2049

But here, Deakins and Villeneuve catapult this sequel into a beautifully artistic film. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as 'K' and Harrison Ford's return as Deckard is a vital component in the storytelling. The movie has deliberate and sustained pacing at 2 hours and 43 minutes but I never once checked my watch and the pacing made the experience that much more special. It is visually breathtaking and DP Roger Deakins, who is long overdue for an Oscar, deserves it 10-fold for the perfection he creates in Blade Runner 2049. Ana de Armas is exceptional as Joie.

963,film-222,"Nothing but gratuitous visuals, naked women, no story, and nothing new",2,9 October 2017,"Did Ridley Scott really approve this film??The 1982 film was visionary in creation of a futuristic world, how Earth cultures have mixed, how people live in a dystopian city, and every design element had meaning, was rooted in some concept. The original film already treated the question of whether androids have rights as sentient beings, and whether a manufactured being is capable of love. I fail to see what this 2017 film adds, while being incredibly loose and contradictory in the story telling (if you can call it that). Maybe the director should stick to music videos for meaningless gratuitous visuals: random elements for visual effect with no utility or explanation; naked women; character responses that contradict motivations and sentiments implied in earlier scenes; naked women; sets and technological elements that have zero function except to ""look cool""; naked women; long, ponderous scenes and unnecessary fist-fights whose outcome you already knew 2 minutes ago, meaning it's time to cut! I found it tiresome how good-looking and fashionable every single extra was -- in such a nasty, dead world, they sure have plenty of time for make-up, hair, and slick get-ups.I love science fiction and am perfectly willing to suspend disbelief, if the writer or filmmaker creates at least a self-consistent world that is plausible given the key premise. This world is half- baked without much time spent on fleshing out at least a little backstory for each scene design and character. Thin, thin, thin. If you want to explore the idea of androids rebelling, watch the 1990's version of Battlestar Galactica, which has the political economy, military science, and existential questions actually thought through.2 instead of 1 because the HD is very fine on an IMAX screen, but the rest of the movie is a confused, tiresome, meaningless, self-indulgent, woman-objectifying, annoying, male box office marketing scheme. I don't get the rave reviews. Maybe people are comparing this to comic book hero movies, rather than to the ideas of Philip K. Dick and what the first movie accomplished. Well, if the standard is comic book blockbusters, fine (actually, plenty of comic book blockbusters at least have a coherent story and character development), but this movie does not deserve comparison to the original. I'm flummoxed that Ridley Scott allowed this mess to be produced under his name. Shame on him and Denis Villeneuve for making this film.

Denis Villenueve is proving to the world, that he is one of the best directors working today, with titles like ""Arrival""; now, he has another masterpiece to add to his references. This movie is gorgeous, the visuals are incredible, something that exceeded my expectations. Ryan Gosling does his best performance ever. Harrison Ford is good also, and his presence in the movie is not only for pleasing fans of the first movie, it has a purpose. Some will say that this movie it's more complicated that the first one, but I don't think so, in fact, this movie is more easy to digest than the first one.

I am completely torn who I'd like to give an Oscar between Blade Runner and Baby Driver here. And with this weird Hans Zimmer's music, the film made a way of speaking through both sounds and visuals.
Blade Runner 2049 was somewhat omitted. It's way more appreciated than the first installment from 1982 but there's a chance that the nominations are the only thing they'll get. Sound throughout this cyberpunk future was just right and so was the whole cinematography. All the sets and visuals were so close to the original and so XXI century at the same time. Denis Villeneuve is a true visionary. Finally there's a director who introduces sci-fi to a different level and it is quite appreciated by the Academy. His Blade Runner-ish future is both post-apocalyptic and old school.The plot itself is trying to be both surprising and safe at the same time. I know that Blade Runner has welcomed a lot of devoted fans who wouldn't like the continuation no matter what. But then, 2049 wasn't actually making anything less important. It was a great tribute and expansion of the world. There were a lot of small touches for the fans and it was completely breaking the XXI century schema. Seeing so many futuristic films with laser gun fights and huge explosions, it is static and calm. The screenplay was very well thought and these 3 hours in cinema was worth it. I hope that we'll get 4 hours director's cut. Both film and fans diserved it.",Blade Runner 2049
968,kartiknnagar,A Sci-fi blockbuster epic with a smart plot but not so smart themes,8,4 February 2018,"It is rare to find a sequel that outshines the original in almost every way, and BR 2049 should be applauded for just achieving that feat. This is a visually stunning, narratively complex sequel which unfortunately inherits all the thematic weaknesses of the original and so falls a bit short in achieving the ultimate purpose of creating a SF movie, but still needs to be applauded for its ambition.First the good bits : the set designs are unbelievably good and detailed, and it is clear that a lot of effort went in this imagining this future world in a logical and coherent fashion. The narrative is tight and complex and requires some attention on the part of the viewer to connect the dots. Some of the plot details are kept a little fuzzy, maybe intentionally, but it is still leaps and bounds better the original Blade Runner.The core theme of BR has always been about asking what makes us humans, especially relevant in the future where we would have very smart and capable entities who can do things exactly (and sometimes much better) than humans, but they do not have the basic human rights. However, the replicants have exactly the same biological structure as humans, in other words, they are humans both from the inside and outside, but still they are not somehow regarded as humans? This theme is much better explored if the entities are actually mechanically produced (such as androids) and have clear differences in their internal structure from humans. This would starkly differentiate them from humans, but still raise the thorny question of consciousness due to their abilities and intelligence. In BR, it is really hard for me to swallow that replicants are somehow not considered humans.",Blade Runner 2049

971,icasilas,"A marvellous picture, a tremendous sequel and a visually triumphant piece of pure artistic cinematography.",9,12 June 2018,"To be honest, I have never thought that a picture -at least one that is made by mere mortals- could be this perfectly rounded, astonishingly profound and overall sublime and enjoyable: blade runner 2049 superseded all expectations and defied all the unfavourable odds since it was unfortunately met by a less enthusiastic response from the unworthy common cinema crowd, because if such a high end film has been showered with praise by critics who valued its aesthetic and artistic value, yet had such low audience reception- even though it had their amazement - then we simply do not deserve good pictures anymore! 
That being said, let's immediately delve into what makes blade runner 2049 such an amazing picture, and one of my all-time favourites. Evidently, there is not a single movie that had succeeded without having a great cast, and this movie is not an exception, gathering some of Hollywood's finest: an ensemble cast containing Ryan Gosling , an actor who ironically fits the role so perfectly, starring as 'K', an android cop whose sole mission is to retire replicants , a form of bioengineered 'humans': organic machines endowed with great strength and intelligence created to obediently serve their human masters. A blade runner in the street jargon, 'K' struggles between exploring his identity and trying to do his job, a position that was once filled by Rick Deckard, played by the great Harrison Ford, the protagonist of the previous picture who is now fleeing the authorities. Their stories interlink so vividly when K's monotonous life with his holographic partner joy -played by Anna de Armas- is shaken by dangerous doubts about his nature and origin which leads him to seek the answers in the troubled and gloomy past of replicant history. The realistically stoic performance of Mr. Gosling and the sense of controversial humanity that Harrison Ford's acting brings to it is surprisingly not the reason that made me exalt it this much; I have seen this dystopian futuristic picture that addresses the worst consequences of human degeneration and societal decadence so fearlessly, as a work of great beauty: behind the urban dark colours of a suffocating futuristic L.A and the rusty colours of a toxic Las Vegas lies a gem of cinematography, the work of a camera moved so creatively to produce one of cinema's greatest shots. Dennis Villeneuve has proven once and for all a place next to this century's best film directors, backed by his brilliant precedent works such as prisoners, Sicario and Arrival. This movie is by all means a visual feast full of sharp colour changes, deep symbolic imagery and ravishing wide shots that celebrate both the pulchritudinous creation that is the lively human form in all its height and the lowest form of exploitation and duplicant maltreatment. But the most astonishing feature of this movie has to be the reality it portrays: if the original blade runner, directed by the brilliant Ridley Scott, had dealt with the segregation and subsequent hunt for duplicants, and asking about what makes us so different, and what makes one human, the sequel has finally put fourth the most important question: 'do androids dream of electrical sheep?'. This picture discusses how new life forms that transcend the limitations of physical existence claim a space so big in our lives that we can no longer live apart from them, something that made an impossibly tragic relationship - the one between K a machine and joy an AI-controlled spectre- procure my compassion.
A moving, well crafted and brilliantly directed movie, blade runner 2049 is by far one of the best sci fi films I have ever watched, and one of the few that made me care about its events even though they are purely fictional, a movie that encountered some misfortunes along the way but succeeded in being the best sequels of all time.",Blade Runner 2049
972,noahlenzi,Best film of 2017 so far,9,6 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 was my most anticipated release this year so I went in with high hopes. The original is a great sci-fi and a visual wonder, it wasn't without flaws so I felt there was plenty room to improve over it. The sequel is better for the most part. It was an intense disturbing film full of ideas and interesting visuals that bring the dystopian world to life even better than the original. The story is very simple but fleshed out so that the viewer can be invested in every scene. You may be able to see what's coming but the way it unfolds is satisfying. Below the surface you can also see the themes of how toxic the abusive capitalist culture around women, advertising and just about everything we consume is. Its a sad depiction of what could be the future. The main themes of the film stay consistent resulting in an emotional ending that left me very satisfied. My only critique is the villain felt a little underdeveloped which is OK for me because I really don't like Jared Leto anyway (but that's just me). There were also a few moments that had me wondering why certain bad decisions were made by the villains but its all forgivable.I wasn't aware that Jóhann Jóhannsson had dropped out from scoring the film until after I saw it but Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal. The score complements every scene perfectly and conveys the feelings of the main character really well. I'm just a little disappointed thinking of what could have been if Jóhann Jóhannsson had made the score. The visuals are breathtaking with some of the best CGI I've ever seen. I heard models were used for some shots and I honestly don't know what was practical and what was CGI so well done to the effects team. Oscar worthy direction, cinematography and effects for sure. The acting was simply incredible all around, from small parts like Dave Bautista's character to the lead, Ryan Gosling. Everyone gave an astounding amount of depth and commitment to their characters. There's also a interesting if not toxic relationship between Gosling and an AI played by Ana de Armas that could have been terrible but it is truly an interesting look into his character and it's played out well. Armas also does a great job playing the AI, making us wonder what she truly is. Part of me thinks Jared Leto was just being Jared Leto, but again that's just me being bias. His villain is highly disturbing but there isn't much reason behind it, (going back to my critique) so he's actually the least interesting character. But again, the journey of our main character is more important in a film that is already 163 min. His transformation is amazing and will not disappoint.Blade Runner 2049 is not perfect but it sure came close. I find it better than the first and a highly involving film that left me with plenty to talk about with people who had also seen it. The slow pacing might not be for everyone so I'll say that if you liked the first one then I'd recommend it. If you're new to it and interested then I'd highly recommend watching the original first as well. 2049 goes next to sequels like Aliens and T2, a rare gem we only get every few years or even decades.",Blade Runner 2049

Blade Runner 2049 could be viewed as a re-imagining of Pinocchio in a cyberpunk future by Denis Villeneuve, who continues his streak as a true visionary director. The movie is both visually flawless and mind-bendingly philosophical, with deep examinations of identity and what it means to be a person.Fans of the predecessor might hate me for saying it, but I think this sequel is much better and can probably be viewed without seeing the first. With a longer run-time, the universe and characters were able to be explored in a more satisfying way, and a much stronger connection of empathy and emotion was established (not just talked about) early on. There seem to be clearly inspired moments from the likes of Her and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with beautifully intimate depictions of love, loneliness, longings, dreams, and memories - a few of which that stand out as some of the most iconic and impressive scenes I've ever seen.",Blade Runner 2049

Only reason it doesn't get a 10 is I'm not sure it quite deserves it, but this is definitely a masterpiece I choose over the original any day.",Blade Runner 2049

984,birdseed-11,They just did more.,6,18 October 2017,"Saw it last night, this new one just takes the tropes and devices of the original and extends them further. There is nothing really new and mind blowing, which was the fun part of the original.It is slow; be patient. And for all it's length it leaves gaps in the story that the viewer has to figure out himself.The acting is great, but the ""kooky characters"" aren't nearly as kooky. And for some reason Agent K is a deeply pensive character. So the audience gets a lot of hard stares at the camera from Gosling, even when he's happy.It's a good movie, but you have to actively watch it. In each scene look for what is interesting. This is more of a thinker's movie than popcorn vapidity.",Blade Runner 2049
985,rubenbaeza84,"Despite the news slamming it's box office revenue, this is a good film.",10,9 October 2017,"The new Blade runner is not going to be for everybody, make no mistake about that, it's not your conventional blockbuster movie and that is why you should consider watching it. For years the movie industry has focused it's attention on mostly genre films like the superhero films that are dominating the big and small screens. For a gem like Blade Runner 2049, we get a film that wishes to challenge the conventions of today's Hollywood films. The film is indeed long and focuses less on big action sequences and more on character and plot. You are not going to get your finale climactic battle scene and the evil scientists corporate headquarters or a spectacular gunfight, it's not that kind of film. The film is about a man named K who must find out the origins of a body found in near a farm were he ""retired"" his last replicant. The film is definitely a detective story and plays like a traditional detective story that just happens to have a sci fi setting. You have your antagonist in Jared Leto who is unfortunately the weakest part of the movie. He is not giving a bad performance, but his performance is pretty much dry and doesn't set him apart from the traditional mustache twirling villain from any film that contains a clichéd mustache twirling villain. The rest of the actors are phenomenal from Ryan to Harrison Ford and every actor on this list.Now for the more technical stuff. The film is shot very beautifully and it enriches the dystopic and decaying cityscape of Los Angeles that we came to love from the first movie. It has CGI that blends well with the environment which is good because sometimes CGI can call too much attention to itself and detract too much away from the movie itself, fortunately this is not the case as the CGI supports the film and it's story. It would be difficult to compare this film with the first one as the first film has set standards that not many films can live up to and luckily this one does and I'm very nit picky when it comes to comparing to the original. I highly recommend the film to those who wish to watch something that isn't another ""Avengers"" film or has the traditional feel of a classic Noir film with a big budget to support it. It's very rare to see these type of movies at the theaters now in days so please don't pass up this opportunity because of ""box office"" numbers.",Blade Runner 2049
986,Wootzie,Better than expected,8,5 January 2019,"What really makes this movie are the visuals and the colors. The acting is pretty good, particularly given the dystopian nature of the film from setting to how people interact. Despite some slightly loose parts of the plot, the story generally holds together. The dialogue is sometimes a little bit muted and mundane, but in its own way it contributes to the story. I watched this movie twice, and found myself really getting more into it the second time.

991,emkay905,"great film, but ending leaves much to be desired",9,5 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a well made but flawed film, however i think Denis Villeneuve has done the best he could've with Hampton Fancher's story. Firstly the biggest compliment i can pay this film is Roger Deakins' camera- work, this film is shot beautifully and is masterfully crafted, the colours and production value are all A+, visually, this film is perfect. Sylvia Hoeks as Luv is a standout performance in the movie, i'll just leave it at that, Gosling and Ford also provide great performances in their roles, with Gosling specifically doing a great job with his character, making me empathise with the situation the character has been thrusted into, and really care for his narrative. Ford also did a decent job however i felt his character was very shoehorned in, and i didn't really care that his character was in the film very much. With that being said, both actors still did a fine job in their roles. However i wasn't able to resonate very well with any other characters within the film, especially Jared Leto's villainous character, whose motivations i couldn't quite understand especially toward the end of the film. The story itself was tense and enthralling all the way through till the end of the film, i felt as if there was more to be told as i didn't quite feel there was any solid closure for the characters. Additionally, thematically, this film didn't perform as strongly as its predecessor, replicants being the lesser equivalent of humans are evidently present but this film felt like it had a more predominant focus on being a mystery/thriller/action film. Overall Blade Runner 2049 is a solid effort with outstanding visuals and brilliant performances from the lead actors, the ending was however underwhelming and i wasn't able to resonate very well with any characters other than Ford and Gosling's.*********SPOILER ALERT - a few points i didn't quite get in the filmAt the conclusion of the film, Niander Wallace is still alive and producing replicants, what is the payoff with this character? What was his purpose in the film? He wishes replicants to reproduce but what was his intentions with Deckard's daughter? With Wallace believing Deckard to now be dead, is this the end of his search? or will he continue to search for her as a set up for a potential sequel?This feels very nitpicky but what happened to Wallace's eyes? why was that a necessary characteristic for the character?How was Deckard able to avoid the authorities for such a long period of time?and finally is Deckard a bloody replicant or not?",Blade Runner 2049
992,acole0228,"A Visual Masterpiece, but not Perfect",8,7 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is visually the best movie I have seen in theaters, thanks to Roger Deakins, the best cinematographer in the business who may finally get an Oscar after 13 previous nominations, and director Denis Villeneuve, whose movies are always visually at the top of their game. To compliment the visuals is an interesting and thought-provoking story that continues and expands the ideas initially explored in the original Blade Runner about what it means to be human. There are good performances from all the cast, although some are unfortunately wasted and not given too much to do.The only real problem with Blade Runner 2049 is the pacing and plot direction of the story. Blade Runner 2049 has a slow pace and a nearly 3 hour run time, which isn't a problem by itself (and I actually enjoyed the slow pace), but somehow rushes the final act of the movie to a somewhat awkward conclusion. I also felt Ryan Gosling's character's initial motivations were left unclear and made his character's development weaker which was a problem since Gosling is in about 85% of the movie. Another problem is that Ryan Gosling is in about 85% of the movie, leaving little time to establish the characters that are after him and what he knows.",Blade Runner 2049
993,shayol-48294,Really long movie with slow pace and stunning cinematography,7,7 November 2017,"After having seen this movie for almost 3 hours, I feel the urge to write a very quick review:Pros: - Stunning Cinematography - Beautful shots of an interesting and futuristic looking world - Not a remake of the first Blade Runner, but has its own story - claustrophobic Cyberpunk feeling and atmosphere is done well.Cons: - disappointing soundtrack, barely any melodies, more like futuristic electronic whale sounds. - Super slow pacing. Like way too slow. This needs a re-cut, to reduce the unnecessarily long shots of nothing happening. - Totally wrong trailer, suggesting this was an action movie, when actual action scenes in the movie are maybe around 20-30% only.Still 7/10, but only because of the visuals.

It does, but the movie definitely doesn't meet the definition. If you haven't seen the original, I would recommend you watching it first before this. In my opinion you should watch Blade Runner Final Cut. That movie is basically a remake of the original. It is still the original Blade Runner, but it looks better and the story is explained in more detail. Now there are these humans called blade runners that basically hunt down the replicas that are acting on their own will causing trouble. Ryan Gosling who is the blade runner, finds out more about himself throughout the movie, with memories of his mysterious past. This was more of a thriller and suspense movie, rather than a action movie. It does keep you interested but nothing special.Thus not being a classic hit like it should've been. It is not necessary to watch. You can live without watching it.",Blade Runner 2049

996,niallmaggs,A Masterpiece... - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com),10,5 January 2018,"Denis Villeneuve said he was VERY clear of the relentless pressure he was under, to not only stand up to the original, but to also please hardcore fans, myself included, of Ridley Scott's Cult-classic masterpiece.Did he do it? not only did Denis manage to create an immersive cinematic experience, he created a masterwork of a sequel that will go down with other greats such as The Godfather Part II and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.Blade Runner 2049 did everything a sequel should do, expand on the universe created by the predecessor (this one does just that!) and give audiences an intriguing storyline to follow. Again, this one does just that.Obviously the film looks fantastic. You can even tell that from the trailer. Roger Deakins has, once again, given us an experience at the movies that no one can top. It is visually remarkable, the use of vibrant colour is eye candy for even the most artistic people; the dazzling palette of orange, red, pink, purple, green and blue is a feast for the eyes, it makes the 2 hour and 44 minute runtime an astonishing experience.Hans Zimmer's monumental score is so reminiscent of Vangelis' iconic compilation of beauty, crime noir and bleakness in the form of music, which is exactly what the original was: beautiful, bleak, and embodies crime noir perfectly. Hans Zimmer has once again proved he is a mastermind when it comes to scoring!Ryan Gosling as Officer K is a force to be reckoned with. The way the character is presented is harsh, we learn early on that K knows he's a replicant, but forces himself to deal with killing or 'retiring' his own kind. Ryan Gosling portrays him brilliantly. He shows emotion, persistence, he's oddly relatable, and the audience can really sympathize with him. In the original, there never was any characters that you could feel attached to, this is what Denis has done so expertly, we as the audience worry for him.Harrison Ford is hardly in it but more than makes up for it with a down to earth portrayal, much like Gosling, and seems more humane and personal compared to his previous roles.Another stand out performance was Sylvia Hoeks as Love. She is the henchwoman of Jared Leto's character: Niander Wallace. She is maniacal and showed sociopathic tendencies. She gives off emotion as well, and often brings out emotion from the audience. It's as if she's forced into killing. We, like with other characters, feel sorry for her.The special effects are visually awe-inspiring and jaw dropping. The approximate budget of $150,000,000 really shows throughout. The slow pace is just great direction from Denis Villeneuve, and because of the almost 3 hour runtime, the majority of the film is expert story and tension building. It's refreshing to finally see a drawn-out storyline where the narrative has room to breathe between action sequences.Most importantly, it makes you feel like your witnessing a marvellous spectacle of emotion, beauty and art.Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of a sequel, worthy of the hype and one of the best of 2017, and not only of 2017, but one of the greatest Sci-fi films of all time.",Blade Runner 2049
997,theboywholivedx,Better than the original,10,15 August 2018,"I've committed the eighth sin: calling a sequel better than its predecessor. But Blade Runner 2049 deserves the praise. It's a masterpiece; a fantastic experience of eye-wateringly beautiful visuals, hypnotic sounds, and a fantastic narrative. The pacing of this film is also commendable; despite being intentionally slow placed, and doing a good job at it too, I felt I could watch hours more of it. The story was a complete one; not the sort that left you waiting for a sequel to explain things away, or for a spin off novel (*cough* Star Wars *cough*). Denis Villeneuve outdoes himself, and so do the writers. Obviously, Ryan Gosling is flawless, Harrison Ford is grumpy, Jared Leto is weird, Dave Bautista is actually good (?) and so is everyone else. I implore you to watch it; it's a unique experience, and a richly satisfying one. It's also more approachable, I felt, than the original, without pandering too much. Loved it!",Blade Runner 2049

999,joshualawrencepike,"Good Atmosphere, but not a good movie.",3,14 October 2017,"Blade runner was not an enjoyable movie for me. People are praising the atmosphere. They are correct to do so, however there is more to a movie then atmosphere.The movie was really slow, even boring. I think it really comes down to three things. The atmosphere was dark and depressing, the plot was very slow to develop, the main character was unemotional. Any one of those things, or even two and it could still have worked, but with all three makes the movie slow and plodding. And that is besides the fact that the thing the bad guy was after just did not make sense, and they covered it up by making him not wholly rational even though he was a CEO of one of the largest companies on Earth.The original movie was good in large part because of the gray, because of the unknowns in it. Were Replicants machines or not? Was Decker a Replicant or not? Was what he was doing right or not? The new one has a more cookie cutter plot, there are bad guys and good guys and they make clear early on that the Replicants are human.www.JoshuaLawrencePike.com",Blade Runner 2049
1000,guylyonsntlworldcom,Great visuals but ...............,6,11 October 2017,"Plenty of raving reviews, but I do not agree with the masterpiece verdict by many reviewers. The original was complex, but yet simple to understand, and as the plot unfolds, the story engages you through the film. This sequel looks fantastic , and the performances are great, yet something is missing. A straight forward plot, with a flowing script would have a made a huge difference. Sitting through 150 minutes of drama, yet struggling to make sense of it, seems to me that the maker failed in the business of screen story telling. I was disappointed and found the first film so much better than this big budget fare. Dalton trumbo please help us as today's science fiction big budget films are in the main failing to be anything like as entertaining as they should be. Better script writers & screen story tellers are so important,yet it seems that simplicity is being substituted by muddled messy big budget effects, all for the sake of being so much cleverer than the dumb audience. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a film, a pity a few of these over hyped directors, don't have a rethink on what it takes to entertain an audience .

I own the 5 different versions and I love each one of them even the one with the Ford voice over. I wanted to like this one. I did not go and see it with high expectations but I was hoping to be entertained at best. That did not happen. I fell a sleep. The visuals are great but by todays standards that is not saying much. Compared to the original they are average never outstanding and never intriguing, to be honest who cares if you do not get a story that keeps you on your feet. I do not need a constant barrage of action to keep me interested. Personally I find most Marvel movies boring, mainly because of that. I get that this Blade Runner should appeal to an adult oriented audience, and believe me in age I am an adult, but the original can make you think, care and is always entertaining. 2 hours and 44 minutes does not make this a good movie and it sure does not make it art.

1007,cddesigns,Captures the spirit of the original,8,7 October 2017,"To make a continuation of a film 35 years after the release of the original, and be able to capture the atmosphere and feeling it imparted is a monumental task. However, Blade Runner 2049 achieves and excels at this.The audience becomes acquainted with K, a replicant officer who, in his routine job of eliminating old model replicants, stumbles upon a discovery of an evolution of sorts that these older replicants have achieved without the guidance of a human hand. This touches off a series of events that have K deeply questioning both the ethical issues in his line of work and the nature of his own existence.Ryan Gosling delivers perhaps his best performance to date, drawing the viewer into the emotions experienced by K without great exaggeration on his part. He reaches the audience with what is being said in his eyes; a description of what he's feeling is not needed, and neither is a wide assortment of facial expressions. His subtlety is poignantly imparted.The only area where I feel this film falls a bit short, is we don't seem to feel the same desperation the replicants have in the original Blade Runner. In 2049, replicants are the next best thing to human; in some ways, better. While still subject to discrimination in society, they aren't seen as the same kind of freaks as they are in Blade Runner. Not so much in hiding and more out among biological humans, they hold jobs from government to blue collar positions, and proliferate the underbelly as well as prostitutes. Their emotions are clear and natural. This is a contrast to Blade Runner, where we are shown that replicants can feel emotion, but are lacking in the ability to express and name what they are feeling. This quality is what gave us a deeper connection to the replicants and a desire to want to connect to their hearts. This is missing from 2049. We do feel some measure of pity still for them, but there is a depth that is missing.In the realm of audio and visuals, 2049 nails Blade Runner's feel with a pinpoint accuracy. Even though modern equipment gives clarity to visuals that wasn't possible in 1982, the production team realized this and managed to achieve the gritty, dirty feeling left with us in Blade Runner. Even behind the clinical walls of the laboratories and elite businesses, we can't escape the tinge of decay and filth from violence of times gone by. There are more than a few nods to specific visuals and sounds from Blade Runner that will not go unnoticed. The atmospheres succeed in the feelings they are meant to leave us with, especially the final fight scene. We don't get the tense but exciting chase scene that Blade Runner gave us, the one that still affords is a measure of comfort in our seats; 2049's final fight is highly uncomfortable and claustrophobic, made more intense if seen in 3D. As an aside, I feel this was the only scene the 3D really enhanced - the amount it helps with immersion in the rest of the film is minimal.Overall, a fan of Blade Runner will not feel let down by 2049. It is clear the cast and crew had a love for it that drove their dedication to creating not just a sequel, but a homage.",Blade Runner 2049

1011,andrei1981-1,Did not ruin the image of Blade Runner - hardest thing to achieve,10,6 October 2017,"Beautiful image, very good acting, good story with powerful symbolism and bad music. That sums up the movie. For excessive verbosity and self-important attitude you can read other reviews below. Stayed true to the original in many ways and that's important for fans of the original BR. Remember that the original BR had a pretty cold reception in the early 80s. Who knows how this one will be perceived a decade from now. And yes, I do miss Vangelis; the movie really came to life when they played pieces of his original music. Zimmer just didn't seem to understand the project.Those who complain that the movie is long and slow clearly have the attention span of a 5-year-old and should probably stick to Fast & Furious.Blade Runner 2049 could have been more but it could have been a lot less too. Thankfully enough it wasn't. I'm not ecstatic, but not disappointed at all and I realize that my expectations have been incredibly high. I will go see it a second time for sure.EDIT Oct 13 after seeing the movie a second time (in 3D). I'd like to upgrade my rating from 8 to 10 if y'all don't mind. Blade Runner 2049 is a 150-million-dollar gift to a small but dedicated fan group of the original movie. Thank you for that gift. I don't think there's any sequel in the history of cinema that stays true to the original to the point where even the tiniest details - noticeable only by hardcore fans who've watched BR 1982 thirty times - are being transplanted into this new film. And, no, BR 2049 did not make Blade Runner mainstream as some complain here. On the contrary, it kept its secrets open only to the same group of initiates, with the possibility of others from the younger generation to join, if they have what it takes. As many of the reviews below testify this movie still remains a mystery to most people out there, whose ability to digest abstract ideas is unfortunately very low.",Blade Runner 2049

1013,Dorveille,Masterpiece or pale imitation?,3,14 October 2017,"I went to see the film on the day of release, 5 October 2017, in an almost empty theatre. I loved the original Blade Runner, and had mixed feelings about the prospect of a sequel. Denis Villeneuve had taken over directing from Ridley Scott, and I had admired the work he did on Enemy and Arrival, he seemed to be a good choice to helm this film, so I went in with an open mind.A few positive reviews for the film had appeared online in the last days before its release, but I had held off from reading more than a couple. Once I seen the film I went back and saw that many people were hailing it a 'masterpiece', 'the perfect sequel', or even 'better than the original'. I was really quite stunned by this, as I couldn't share the same enthusiasm for the film.So what can I say about the film? Don't worry, if you haven't seen it there won't be any spoilers. It is a well made film, very ably directed by Denis Villeneuve. The main problem I had with it is that it is indebted to the first film in pretty much every way. The look of the film is largely recreating that of the 1982 original, the story is just a remix of the same themes and ideas from the original, and the soundtrack is little more than an echo of Vangelis's memorable score. It was as if the film makers had taken the original and created a copy, quite ironic really.It made me think of art forgery. You could have 2 paintings side by side. One a Picasso, the other a forgery. They might look the same, and it does take undeniable skill to create a convincing forgery. But a forgery is totally devoid of originality, that is the difference between a masterpiece and a copy. All the positive reasons people gave in their reviews for the sequel lead back to the original.At the end of Ridley Scott's 1982 original film, Deckard and Rachel head off together into an uncertain future. It was an open ending, but perfect for the story the film told. The uncertainties of life are something we have to live with as human beings, we didn't need to know what happened next to those characters, what was important is that they had a future together.If you are a fan of the original, and haven't seen Blade Runner 2049 yet, I would say to remember that what is seen cannot be unseen. Once you see the sequel you will never be able to go back and watch the original without knowing what fate had in store for Deckard and Rachel, I think this is a great pity, and does a disservice to that film.Whose decision was it that we needed to have this sequel? Over the past few years Ridley Scott has been putting out unnecessary prequels to Alien, so I can't help but think he is responsible. It is now just over a week since the sequel came out and there are reports that it is a box-office flop. Some comments I have read said that this happened to the original film too. Maybe, but I think for different reasons. The original was way ahead of its time, and it took time for people to catch up appreciate it. This sequel was a film that I don't think there was any real demand for, and although the levels of hype are high, I think in time people we see the film for what it really is.",Blade Runner 2049
1014,the-oldgoat,Was so looking forward to this...,3,16 February 2020,"A singular lesson in why sequels often don't work.Independence day 2 is the other fine example in this tendency to turn down a blind alley.Blade runner worked because of how it was staged (forget the voice over and daft ending version) and how it was gritty. Leaving the ending hanging was the right place to stop at.Blade runner 2049 makes the horrendous mistake of feeling that there is more to tell.
Its a film that might have a good storyline in it but spends it's time confusing and inventing extensions to the original that have no reason to be.
Had it been developed as something different it might have worked.But it wasn't

1015,s-bannerman12,a classic just like its forerunner!,8,13 February 2018,"The first time I saw Blade Runner (1982) was probably around 1983 or 1984, it was whenever the film found itself released on VHS (thats video cassettes for those new generation people) and whilst I did like the film, I didnt learn to appreciate just how much of a great film it was, for a few years after that. Since then Ive watched the Ridley Scott directed film dozens of times and in several versions. From the Theatrical Cut (with voiceover), to the Directors Cut (without voiceover) and more recently The Final Cut (without voiceover but also a few added technical tweaks to brush up some of the visuals.But whichever version you watch, you surely have to appreciate that its a classic and a damn fine film thats wonderfully made.When the film Blade Runner 2049 was announced (a sequel to the original film), I was a little nervous. How would it compare to a film that was like no other at the time of its release. Could Blade Runner 2049 manage to be a film like no other in a time when its super hard to release a film thats different. Well director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival) and the crew have pulled it off. Blade Runner 2049 is a film that financially didnt do as well as it should have done at the box office, and perhaps this is down to modern audiences not begging for a revisit to the world of Blade Runner, or perhaps the near 3 hr running time put people off. I just dont know. But the film is easily one of the highlights of my film viewing this year and is a visual masterpiece, not only with its set design, but its soundtrack (another master stroke by Hans Zimmer, joined by Benjamin Wallfisch) and the gorgeous cinematography by the always reliable Roger Deakins.Storyline wise (and I wont go into that too much), you dont need to have seen the 1982 Blade Runner to be able to follow Blade Runner 2049, although there are a handful of nods to the Ridley Scott directed film that did put a smile on my face. One such moment had me chuckle, and then whilst explaining to Annette (who watched the film with me) why I was chuckling, then another such moment popped up on screen to I explained why that too made me smile. There are also some smaller roles in the film that tip their hat to the 1982 film (and no I dont mean Harrison Ford)The cast is top notch with Ryan Gosling taking centre stage in his best role since Drive (in my opinion) as 'K', the Blade Runner who finds himself involved in a case that takes him all over one of the most visually stunning cinematic journeys of the year. He is perfectly cast in this film. Also in the cast is of course Harrison Ford (revisiting the role of Rick Deckard, a man now in hiding and trying to live 'off the grid', and Jared Leto as the mysterious Niander Wallace who I guess you could call the villain of the film,The film is most definitely what they call a 'slow burner', and even though there are action scenes in the film, they are few and far between. Blade Runner 2049 is a visual and storyline film which brings you right in at the start and leaves you only when its done with you, over 160 minutes later to the end credits. Its a film that you should make sure that you are awake for, so if you sit down on a Friday night around 9pm and you are even a little bit sleepy, then please save Blade Runner 2049 for another day. You will miss out on a classic. Make sure you are 100% awake. Trust me. Youll thank me for it.",Blade Runner 2049

Its not because the movie is bad, but simply there's nothing happened in that 1 minute and I could follow the story quickly after I wake up, also the scenery is calm and beautiful, perfect for a quiet little nap. Its not a movie for you to enjoy the story (even the story is fantastic) but more like to enjoy the cinematography, as a Graphic Designer, I will definitely recommend this movie as a masterpiece reference.As I say, the story is fantastic, but filled really slow. We have some minutes to think about the problem and try to solve it ourselves before the movie brings us the truth. So, its a movie to enjoy, for you to analyze every little detail and they give you a couple of time for that. The actors play nicely (and I adore Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto for such long time), and its not your typical Hollywood movie.",Blade Runner 2049

1018,jvm0393,Very authentic to the original but could have been better,8,16 October 2017,"I just want to say right off the bat that I quite enjoyed the first Blade Runner film it was the first of its kind, a Neo-Noir tale that take place in the future. The film (which came out in 1982) was so influential that the theme, style and setting that Blade Runner establish was use in other films like A.I, Judge Dredd, both the original and remake of Total Recall and Ghost in the Shell (which has been recently remade). However despite been a fan of the original, I couldn't get into this film, it was overly long and both the story and plot were very weak.Going through the story as spoilers free as possible, the film takes place 30 years after the events of the first film. A Replicant by the name of K who is also a Blade Runner task to hunting down other Replicants like himself, after one mission he finds a box hidden under a dead tree which leads him to a bigger investigation about Replicants as well as finding out more about himself. Of course there is more to the story but that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.The problem that I find with Blade Runner 2049 is that it has very little substance in its story add this along with a paper thin plot and lack of proper character development and you have gotten a pretty boring film. It also doesn't help that the trailers for the film makes it look like an action heavy film when in reality is more of a poignant film a poor one at that. Speaking of misleading trailers Harrison Ford who is show prominently in the trailers is barely in the film, he doesn't even show up until the last 30 minutes of the movie serving only as a Damsel in distress for K to save.Everything else about the film is great from the special effects to the ambient music to the sound design. It feels like you are watching Blade Runner and doesn't feel like another movie with the word Blade Runner slap on it, it's very faithful to the original. The cast for the most part are really good in their roles and work well off one another. The only actor I thought was miscast was Jared Leto who I am starting to hate as an actor. He does nothing in this role other than giving us bland dialogue making a somewhat interesting character dull, kind of like what he did with the Joker in Suicide Squad. Having said that I do give the movie high praise, in an age in which nearly every movie is been rebooted this doesn't feel like a cash grab.",Blade Runner 2049
1019,walter2-407-597390,"Visuals fine, Story Flat",7,19 October 2017,"Visually, I loved this movie, it has moments that are astonishing for my eyeballs. However, for me, to really enjoy a movie, I need a good story, well told. This is where things go flat for me in the current Blade Runner. The Vangelis musical score in the original is magical, this one sounds like many distant mic drops in an echo chamber, and never once adds to the picture. I was especially sad for this, as the original was a near-perfect constant blend of audio, visuals and story.First key item, I think we can all agree that the movie is simply too long, filled with far too many long moments of nothing happening, nobody speaking, actors staring off into space, possibly wondering when somebody was going to yell ""Cut!"". I think honestly, it can be at least 40 minutes shorter, and all elements would remain 100% intact, but audiences would be far happier. This is one instance where I think the final cut version on BluRay should be maybe 90 minutes.Second, I find that this story is told in a very fractured way, daring the audience to somehow stitch the random and poorly sketched scenes together to make an appealing tale. There are so many non sequitur moments, I was baffled by what the screenwriter's real intent was. I loved some scenes just for the visual, but was really not so wowed by the story-telling. Yes, I see the story, but don't be concerned if it doesn't gel for you. Finally, movies are greatly helped by being about something, having an engaging story to tell. Despite being an avid sci-fi and movie fan, I can honestly say I do not know the purpose of this story. I get some story elements, I see how they eventually tie together, but at the end, I can't help but wonder if this was the best way to tell it or if it is even actually there. There are SO many plot gaps and missing parts, I almost felt like making up a few as the story unwound, just so it would be more enjoyable. The original had a powerful story, very well told and acted, but I just can't say that in this version.So, I say seven, but only because some of the visuals are so good. Honestly, as a story, this is working hard to be a 5. This is a very bad trend in modern movie making, lots of flash and high priced talent, but just not enough story and substance to make it worthwhile. For me, the scotch drinking dog was the best story moment, which is not such a great endorsement.I was so disappointed to see this. I even watched the original the week before so I could be sure to correctly appreciate the new version and the complex world it is set in. It didn't help so much.",Blade Runner 2049
1020,elektraz,Too Long and Too I Wish I Were,6,23 January 2018,"It's not bad, it's beautiful, actually.But the main problem is the wish to be something that's no longer available - the original movie at the time it came up.Blade Runner, at the time it was first filmed, had a soul.This new version, which is basically a follow-up, kills everything it was supposed to love, portraying what's no longer there, like a child's memory when revisited years after by the adult that saw it as a child.",Blade Runner 2049
1021,mmccord9126,"On its own, a great movie",7,8 October 2017,"Having been a Blade Runner devotee from its inception of the original (even during pre-production), I had great expectations for this sequel. Expectations that probably would be nearly impossible to meet. And so they were. That withstanding, the film deserves stand alone credit for proving to be an honest attempt at living up to the fictional world established in the original film. It more than adequately carried on the overall atmosphere and vitality of the original, but failed to truly capture its ""future noir"", as suggested in Paul Sammon's book about the film's creation(1996).The cast and the production itself, on the other hand, combined to make it entertaining, in spite of the film's longer than necessary length. Some additional refinement would have been appropriate (ex: cut the junk yard scene with the toy horse.) Gosling's performance as ""K"" was truly believable; what one would expect from one of Hollywood's better actors today. Ford, as Deckard, needs no comment as he will always be Deckard. Ana de Armos, as Joi, was captivating and added an interesting twist on 'K's' backstory. Sylvia Hoeks, as Luv was okay, but she's no Roy Batty by any stretch. Robin Wright, as Lt. Joshi was well done (big fan of her). And it was good to see Edward James Olmos as Gaff again,; even if the role was minimal. Casting Mackenzie Davis as Mariette was obviously done to remind fans of Daryl Hannah's great work in the original.Deciding to have Rachel give birth to Deckard's child worked for me, even though it's not the route I would have preferred be followed. However, Tyrell did say that the replicants were ""more human than humans."" It became the quest for the golden fleece that any hero's journey requires, so I can go along with it.SF author K.W. Jeter wrote three sequels to Phillip K. Dicks original, all under the title of ""Blade Runner"". Together, these three books carried on a much better series of events and circumstances that I believe would have made for a better possible franchise; something that may be on the horizon with the release of this film. Especially, considering the many open possibilities presented at the end of the film (i.e. Deckard meeting his daughter; the possible Nexus8 revolt; Wallace's next move, ""K's"" fate, etc.) In conclusion, I really did like the film and would easily recommend it to anyone who enjoys legitimate science fiction.",Blade Runner 2049
1022,nat-dalby,Stunning sci-fi,8,16 April 2018,"An incredible looking, sonic experience. I feel bad for anyone who didn't get to see this in the cinema. Plot-wise, it does a good job of expanding on the original premise whilst adding new elements and does what any great sequel does - have the events of the previous film inform the film rather than completely ignoring them. Blade Runner 2049 essentially acts as a sci-fi noir in much the same way as the original but is much more of a detective story. We see Ryan Gosling's character really investigating the mystery, which is an improvement over the original's kind of thin plot. It's a shame that brilliant and original sci-fi such as this doesn't make money anymore, but Blade Runner 2019 is such a treat for fans of the genre that it makes it worthwhile that it only comes once in a blue moon.",Blade Runner 2049

Writer Hampton Fancher returns to the franchise to helm the screenplay along with Michael Green. The film is set in 2049 were a new Blade Runner, officer K (Ryan Gosling), is hunting the few remaining Tyrell replicants. However when a secret is uncovered, K no longer is the hunter. He has become the hunted. In the leading roles we have Ryan Gosling as the new Blade Runner, officer K. He is a brilliant addition to the universe and serves as a very compelling character. The performance by Gosling is also great, as expected from an actor of his caliber. Harrison Ford makes his triumphant return to the franchise and unlike his performance in the original, which could be considered one of his weakest, Ford gives his one of his best ever performances. He is also great when on screen with Gosling. The pair have a good chemistry and are very entertaining to watch. In the other roles we have Ana de Armas, Jared Leto, Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks, all great performances. At the center of this story we have the classic Blade Runner themes, life, death and it's meaning. Those aspects are definitely the originals strength. My biggest flaw with the original has always been it's love story, which is mainly down to the lack of chemistry between Sean Young and Ford. However in 2049 we have one of the strongest and most emotionally powerful love stories i have seen in a very long time. It's fits perfectly and enhances the overall story. Roger Deakins is one of the greatest cinematographers of all time and his work here is perhaps his best. Blade Runner: 2049 is one of the most beautiful films of all time, thank's to the great, Roger Deakins. It really has to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. His work here can only be considered, art. All the above mentioned factors combine, under the direction of Villeneuve, to become one of the truly, greatest sequels of all time and therefor one of the best films overall. I can't find a flaw with this film and therefor i will not hesitate to call it a masterpiece. Is it better than the original? I really can't say. But what i can say is that i won't compare them. Blade Runner 2049 is a complete movie that can stand on it's own and be great. I won't compare the two because they are both masterpieces in there own right. To fully experience Blade Runner: 2049, seek out the biggest screen you can and let Denis Villeneuve transport you back to the world of Blade Runner! Final Rating: 10/10⭐️",Blade Runner 2049

He has proved why he is the most eccentric director to be working with. Ryan Gosling has finally stepped out of his comfort zone and has delivered one of his best performance.The stunning cinematography reminded me of Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey. Visuals are a real treat to watch. This is not your typical go to Sci-Fi movie. The best part is that the movie took it's own time to convey the story one at a time. The beautiful and the elegant dialogue delivery also reminded me of Tarkovsky's epic Solaris. Roger Deakins and Hans Zimmer, hands down one of their best works. The Movie so perfectly delves into elements like emotion, distress, mystery which makes the dialogue delivery even more amazing. Blade Runner 2049 is an instant classic and is already the movie of the year for me. People have to learn to appreciate such movies. Sci-Fi is more than just action and space ships bursting into each other, most importantly it needs to convey the audience as to what's happening.Some of the Sci-Fi scenes are so good that you probably haven't seen in any movie before. People who call it 'Beautiful but Boring' just can't appreciate art. This was more of a Sci-Fi art movie than any action.People, you're in for a treat.Specially, the visuals and the setup is just too good.

This movie will leave a permanent impact on me, and I expect to return to it many times in my life to feel the original rush I got when watching this film in theaters.Blade Runner(1982) is a timeless classic that deserves to be honored in only the most carefully crafted and perfected of manners.

A pure art. amazing actors, amazing photography and a brilliant use of VFX's and sounds. It's kinda like after the first 3D where the movies are based on the visual, here in Blade Runner it's rock solid and this is the lights, colors and sounds are put in the front.This is why i love movies and this is the main reason to go to the theater. There is a lot of TRIBUTE of the first one and it took both new things and enhance what we saw in the first one. Like the editing process, slow paced. It's really good to take time, i realized i have a lot of souvenir of different shots, witch i usually don't on "" traditional "" 2 hours movies. And here you don't feel the classic final mass battle, of that kind of long length modern movies. this is just a deeper movie. For me the duration and the pace are well balançed, and rare to see. Also a tribute to the first movie.It is the star wars 7 should have been. i'm not a particular fan of the first Blade Runner from 1982 one because i saw it too young ( but in 2000's ) and i didn't catch the essence of the movie.Well i've been hit at the end of the movie, and that's matter, a perfect ending timing and editing trough all the movie.

1032,DrChristers,Excellent film that will become a SciFi classic,9,9 October 2017,"I enjoyed this film hugely. I watched it in IMAX 3D and it was great to have a big screen, however, I feel like REAL 3D might have been better, despite the smaller screen, because then you can tilt your head without the film coming out of focus or showing its two images. This isn't Blade Runner 2049's fault though, this is a fault of the 3D technology. If it's possible you should definitely watch the previous Blade Runner film and the shorts created by the Director's friends before you watch this movie. However, I understand that the trailer has spoilers in it and therefore you shouldn't watch that. I think I might have been a bit lost though if I had not watched the previous film so recently.The movie has an excellent plot. I had resigned myself to the obvious when Gosling thinks he is the born replicant but I was pleasantly surprised when the twist comes and he is not. I can't say I've loved Gosling's acting in the past (e.g. Drive or La La Land) but in this film he is fantastic. He mostly acts with breathing and facial expressions and you know exactly what he is thinking and feeling at all times.The special effects are astonishing, especially in 3D. It's not overused and the movie keeps all the tropes from the original but builds and improves upon them. The seduction scene (obviously CGI-ed to the maximum) is quite frankly staggeringly beautiful. I could not take my eyes off the screen. And, like the original, this film didn't feel the need to shove ""sex, sex, sex"" in our faces.Harrison Ford still packs a punch (quite literally) but he is not overly present so it's not a 'Ford mobile', which is good. Also, I was pleasantly surprised that he has not gone down the Sean Bean route and decided to die in all of his films. I am not sure what I thought of Jared Leto, I couldn't really understand what his dialogue meant as he speaks in riddles. I know that he is meant to be the crazy technology overlord and his motivation is to find a way to get the replicants to produce offspring but his script is too abstract to understand. Slyvia Hoeks is impressive as Luv. I expected her to be a Rachel like character but she quickly and believably turns violent, obviously on the orders of Wallace, and plays psychopathic replicant without regret very easily. A complex character made very interesting and acted well. You feel genuine sadness for K as he realises that his treasured hologram whose personality we are led to believe is individual is actually not so replaceable. I thought the scene with the giant hologram prior to him dying for a different and more important cause added to the plot very well.Overall this is an absolutely fantastic film, well worth the preparation of watching the previous film and the shorts and the money and travel to get a 3D experience.",Blade Runner 2049
1033,mooviesuniverse,A worthy sequel to one of the sci-fi greats,8,30 October 2017,"K (Ryan Gosling), a young blade runner, discovers a long-buried secret. The discovery sends him on a journey to track down Deckard (Harrison Ford), a blade runner who's been missing for 30 years.Director Denis Villeneuve and DOP Roger Deakins really knock this one out of the park. They pay tribute to the original without copying it. Obviously set in the same universe the city landscape looks the same but it's a bit modernized and more vibrant. Whereas 'Blade Runner' was very dark and rainy and used lots of shadows and smoke, 'Blade Runner 2049' looks more vivid (gold shades in Wallace's headquarters, orange tones). The snowy landscape is also something completely different. That's the vision of Villeneuve and the talent of Deakins shining through. The movie is a visual feast and a huge technical achievement. It all looks and sounds great. Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch provide the movie with an excellent score that resembles Vangelis' soundtrack for 'Blade Runner'.The big question – What makes us human? – still remains. But 'Blade Runner 2049' digs a bit deeper. It's an exciting detective story but it plays more to the emotions than its predecessor. Ryan Gosling conveys his emotions masterfully. He's very cool on the surface but underneath he's struggling with some personal issues. Gosling is really terrific here. Harrison Ford gives one of the best performances of his career. He's challenged as an actor. It's not what he usually does but he really shines. The supporting cast, led by the excellent Robin Wright as lieutenant Joshi, also delivers. The Dutch Sylvia Hoeks (Luv) is someone we're going to hear from. Jared Leto was less convincing as Niander Wallace. Just like in 'Suicide Squad' he falls short as the main ""bad guy"".Another negative is the long running time (163 min.) and the pacing. The movie is visually stunning but at times it feels the makers are just showboating. The narrative is too thin to justify the running time. Some scenes could have been a lot shorter (first time we see Joi (Ana de Armas) or the ""hologram sex scene"").All in all 'Blade Runner 2049' is a great movie. Denis Villeneuve is a ballsy filmmaker.

Very realistic depictions of the landscape, brilliant CGI work all through the movie.Highly recommended as a science fictional potential look at a future of society.",Blade Runner 2049
1039,hwm-05554,Unfinished plot,7,27 March 2021,I rated both the original Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049 with 7/10. I do think that the plot of the original movie was too simple and that the plot of the 2049 blade runner is overly complicated and illogical at times. We are left with an ending which is neither a happy ending nor a finished plot. The movie asks many questions but fails to answer them even though the movie takes almost 3 hours.Conclusion: Overly complicated movie with an unsatisfying ending.,Blade Runner 2049

I heard Blade Runner 2049 is way too boring to sit through entire film. Well I can't say it is not, but it's definitely not torture. This film is strictly who slow paced art. You need to have a next level patience to watch it. This film is ain't something you watch with your homies on Saturday night. People must understand this.

Lots of repetitive 2 and 3 stars reviews that all read like they're written by the same person.It's a relief they still make movies like this; movies for adults. Yes it's a sequel, but it's quality and it stands on its own. This is real sci-fi, made with a proper budget and brought to life by artists. It's serious and paced so that you have time to think. If you're a fan of the genre and can appreciate some ambiguity and a little space for questions to breathe then I think you will appreciate this film. But if you can't remember the last time you read a book then maybe you will find this movie long and boring.The cast, acting, and plot are all quite good with only a few misses. The soundtrack doesn't blow me away but it's suitable. The visuals are incredible though and where this movie really shines; I can't think of a single moment in the film where I felt like the vision was held back by the technology available. And the scene at K's apartment with Joi (you will know it when you see it) pushed the envelope of what I thought was possible to do in a film. This one is a real stunner visually.

It has all the exterior of what a great Blade runner sequel would look like but there is little underneath. Visuals are stunning, music and sound are good, camera work is as it should be, but when you get down to its core, there's little there. I am not usually the one to complain about a slow pacing or a plot that requires some suspense of belief, but here It seems they serve as a way to achieve the deep and philosophical feel without actually being either. Acting overall is mediocre at best, actors fail to convincingly relay emotion of the characters, that are themselves written quite shallow, unrelatable and one dimensional. There are some interesting questions raised by the plot, the whole thing is far from a total disaster, but nothing is explored deep enough or clearly enough to be truly interesting or engaging.

It was at least an hour too long. How this movie got anything over a 4 is mind boggling! People must be judging it on the special effects alone. I disliked this for so many reasons. The story has too many flaws (Bees? There is no vegetation?), the pacing is excruciatingly slow, all the characters are one dimensional, there is almost no meaningful dialogue, the violence is unnecessarily graphic, all the women are depicted as either psychopathic killers or prostitutes (with only one exception, the pitiful ""dreamer""). Did I even mention the pornigraphic statues? My best guess is this was an homage to a ""Clockwork Orange"".I could have had a more enjoyable experience watching an episode of CSI. It was like they couldn't decide whether to be a sequel or a horror movie. Sequel won, but horror movie would have worked better. There were so many scenes that could have benefited from a jump scare. It was filmed as such, with the creepy music (again the best part), the character standing alone with vast empty spaces behind them, unknown people chasing them. But they just left the character standing there. It was like a bunch of jokes with no punchlines.The holographic girlfriend was annoying and pointless. The ""sex"" scene was annoying and incomplete. It was like watching my IPad buffer. And who didn't see her demise coming a mile away. Yawn.Ryan Gossling gets more unattractive to me with each additional bad movie.

Aesthetically, it had a remarkable look and feel that paid homage to the 1982 movie in a very nice way. The story itself was good. However, one of my biggest prevailing problems with this film is the pacing of it. I can't think of a single scene that couldn't have been cut in half (some could've been done away with entirely) without the story suffering in any way. There are seemingly unending sequences of repetitive dialogue and glacially paced movement throughout. What was a good movie in concept was badly hurt by incredibly sluggish pacing.

However, overall this was a brilliant sequel and I think better than the original, although it complemented it perfectly. This is a gripping, very moving 'human' condition film about aspiration and hope and the desire to fit in/belong to the 'normal' group. It could be seen as an allegory for any situation where a group feels marginalised through the controlling power which wants to consolidate its position by sidelining/enslaving the 'others'.

Shallow characters. Long sneaking scenes to a plot point (can't say twists) which can be seen coming mile away.

Being overly long I had long lost my memory of the start of this film and ceased to care who was real as time went on. The main character must have felt the same, and only seemed remotely engaged with what was going on. There was no let up on the slow realisation that somehow the earthlings had created Robots so like us that it seemed a pity to bump them off. (One had made a flower!) They certainly had equality in the films emotional stakes and if I am right, had succeeded in mating with one of us homo-sapiens to make things even more confusing. The Hero was given a very cool hover machine to blast around in as the plot unraveled in a city landscape no one would like to live in anyway. (It looked tremendously horrendous, unless someone has rearranged my memory banks. Hang on......?)
Did it get too clever for itself or only for me? Not being able to tell who is a Robot or not, when everyone was just as uncaring and insensible, make you just not care in the the final analysis. (A half Robot?)",Blade Runner 2049

1055,alobal-2,Could be new legend if not for one mistake,8,21 June 2020,"I have just finished the movie. Better to start with review, before the feelings are gone.
The bar is here, the original, slow, atmospheric Blade Runner with magnificent Harrison and no less wonderful Rutger Hauer.
The thing I liked about the original is the atmosphere. It is dark and the plot too and so are the characters, there is no painting of them into good and bad. And the detective plot is here too.Blade Runner 2049 delivers the atmosphere and the post apocalyptic word in little refurbished form, but very good follow up to the original. Rain, darkness, colors, decay. There is interesting detective plot too and the slow pace with little dialogues, good cuts and scenes. Bravo to all those responsible for visuals and music. Nice surprise, if only for that, the movie is definitely worth watching. Unfortunately the story satisfies until Harrison enters scene. Not because of Harrison himself.
At that moment, movie is glued to the original with references to it, with attempts to continue the plot and to deliver Blade Runner part 2. This was very wrong. Why the hell they needed to continue with it??? Suddenly we see underground movements, Deckard and Wallace... I'd not care of any of them. This is so forced, so unnecessary.
One would say - and what for to make it if not to continue the orifinal?Well, this movie had the reason to exist without the necessity to continue the original story. And it saves this movie and it is the only thing that deserves to be center of it. The relationship between 'K' and Joi, his digital girlfriend (Ryan is excellent in this movie)
This is very fresh and original idea that offers view on co-existence of artificial and digital life and human beings. Views and choices we will face in the future as our culture changes.Overall, minus 2/10 for the unnecessary continuation of original story. I believe that without it, this movie would become the same legend as the original, while being fresh and different. It had it all, but maybe the authors haven't noticed.",Blade Runner 2049

1058,pieter-52462,Curate's Egg - Good in parts,8,1 November 2017,"I didn't read reviews of this film before seeing it. I note that the critics loved it but the users think its a bit of an emperor's new clothes thing.So let's start by stating that I, like a lot of 50 somethings, thought that the original was something really special. I was surprised to read that on it's original release it was not a commercial success... but clearly with hindsight the original's reputation has grown.But to the new film. I think it has a lot of flaws and like a lot of sequels it has to chart a difficult course between comparisons with its predecessor and making its own mark.It's too long and its too slow. There are many examples whereby it is referring to the original in its drama, its structure and its plot development and it feels like that reference is not useful.I also think the reason users do not like it is that they probably expect the kind of visceral excitement that other films in this genre provide...but the original was always cerebral rather than visceral.... The sound design was very loud and made an attempt at experimenting with the 5:1 surround sound, I guess to add excitement to what was fairly turgid plot development. However, the central vision that corporations are gradually destroying human life, that 'man' is downgraded and the Nexus robots, although starting out as slaves, now perceive that they have rights, which the corporations are frightened to acknowledge is extremely percipient.So on that level the plot develops themes from the original, which I think is a good thing.I've given it a 8/10 because we should reward film makers who are ambitious and go against the trend but I think as a stand alone film it would probably score lower. I enjoyed the 2+ hours in the cinema and I'm glad someone found the finance to make this, I wished they'd made it shorter and that would have strengthened it as an cinematic experience.",Blade Runner 2049

One of the main issues with this movie is the same reason why the original Blade Runner bombed at the box office! Why would you make the same mistake twice? Look, the movie was not bad but it's WAY TOO SLOW. Did it really have to be? Why? Preserve the style, legacy or some such other b.s? At least it could've been slightly faster than the original but it's actually slower. What was Villeneuve thinking? As an aspiring filmmaker I'm blow away.

The reason is simple: The film was advertised as an action piece and it's actually a rather thoughtful, meandering piece about a society where total alienation has been achieved. It's depressing and beautiful to watch, which is the combination the first film put together so well.The folks who want to see explosions, I call them dummies and I don't apologize for it, have really helped sink this movie. Just look at the positive reviews and how many people have down-voted them. This is the result of the dummies feeling duped and insecure because they didn't understand what they were watching.

As a stand alone film, i'm pretty sure it'd stand up by itself, but as a sequel to one of the most influential sci-fi films of all time... it's utter rubbish. In the original blade runner, replicants were bad ass, dangerous, hard as nails killers... here they are bloody everywhere and no one gives a damn, the blade runner himself is a replicant supposedly hunting down and killing replicant, a thing that he does a total of... twice... and the replicants don't even have the glowy eyes any more...
We're teased with ""there are many more members of his group and we need you to take them down"" but that just gets forgotten about, instead we get led upon a ridiculous story of man and machine procreating, what Batista's character had to do with it, i have yet to figure out... The whole thing is just a ridiculous ""love"" story where they try and throw twists at you, but anyone with half a brain can figure out what is actually going on. Deckard doesn't even show up until like 2 hours into the film, at which point he has turned into so much of a pussy that despite getting his ass kicked twice in a row by Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer in the original, he can barely fight off one in this... turd of a film.

First of all i am a fan of the original Blade Runner, i found it really unique and interesting but when it comes to Blade Runner 2049 even though it had crazy good visuals and sound effects i thought it was a bit dull. For starters i think that the movie was a bit too long. Even though the scenes had many details (which could be a great thing especially for people who don't know the futuristic world that was introduced in the first movie) i think they overdid it a bit which made some of the scenes a bit pointless and it felt like they lead to nowhere. The main thing that was missing in order for this to be a good slow paced movie was the lack of tension. The movie felt a bit flat for the first 2/3 of it(at one point i actually dozed off for a couple of minutes). I really think they should have spent a bit more time on developing the story instead of the visual look of the movie.When it comes to the positive things that i really liked, i think Ryan Gosling did an amazing job as well as Harrison Ford. The acting was definitely spot on. The cinematographer is definitely someone we have to keep an eye on this award season. The sound effects and the whole vibe bring that old feeling from the original movie which is something that i love. Overall i rate it 7/10.",Blade Runner 2049

It does seems a stupid idea, but apparently the new, Nexus 8 replicants are more ""obedient"" than their predecessors.K kills an escaped replicant, only to discover a big ""secret"" that the humans want to cover up at all costs. K is then chased by the human police and by the replicants' producer. He also starts to question his memories (as in Blade Runner) to discover a disquieting truth (as in BR, but in reverse...)Finally, K starts searching for Deckart, now living in Las Vegas with a cute dog. Deckart and K have a completely useless chase and fight scene that takes place - guess what? Just like in BR, in a huge, empty building. As a treat, we get an holographic show with Elvis, compounded by an holographic Sinatra, a couple of scenes later. That was the highlight of the movie.The plot is wrapped up by one of stupidest plot devices: the underground's fighters group, that manoeuvres K behind the scenes. Pathetic death scene, ripped off from BR, but with snow instead of rain and you are all set for another sequel. Not me, though.As an open question I'd like to know why I should root for the ""brave"" replicant underground resistance. They want to be more like humans, but humans are evil, so replicants want to get more evil... or something... whatever...I usually avoid ""sequels"" (AKA: commercial operations exploiting movies that were even only slightly successful), but Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies, so I caved. However, all stories must have an end and now I know that BR stands very much alone. I wish I could erase BR2049 from my memory, because of its offensive stupidity.It could have been just another bad Sci-Fi story, but the manipulation of nostalgic crowd probably proved more successful.

It expands upon the original plot while presenting originally ideas and it's own unique mood. It's immense atmospheric synth soundtrack and dramatic landscapes coupled with high concept science fiction make for one of the most interesting and beautiful movies ever made.

I must say ""Blade Runner"" is in the top 10 of my movies ever and I was really very anxious to see the sequel. I am very keen of the actors. But I am not satisfied with the acting. The sound was OK but the music was just not right. One more thing the cinema hall was not full and after a 10-15 min a 6-8 people went away at the premiere. This was a not good sign I must tell you. I personally just left the cinema hall twice in my life. So I can imagine how they felt about it. It was a late show and I tryed really hard not to fall in to the sleep. Anyway the film is very good but does not bring a lot to you and it has a few holes in the story. I mean that police is not more involved like in the first movie. Surely after the murder of the inspector. The rebel replicants army is just not impressive. I do not like a director because it is boring story teller.

There are so many things this movie is trying to communicate, for example, if replicate just like human being? discrimination problem, love with a digital being but it has emotion. There are a little bit flaw. If you want to fully enjoy this movie, you have to understand it is a story about K's journey. Other things is not so important and do not need to be bluntly explain. Also the ending of this movie is not to resolve good and evil in this world, it's about K.
But scenes related to Wallace seems very shallow and like it is there just to connect the story. Especially the part near the end. Also if you didn't watch the previous blade runner, I am not sure how much will this affect the viewer to understand this movie. I do watch the previous one, so I wouldn't know.

1084,nilssonbst,Blade sleeper,1,12 October 2017,"I'm a huge fan of Blade Runner and have loved it since I saw it on VHS-tape back in the late 90s with my dad.The 2007 Final Cut on Blu Ray is a masterpiece, and the movie had a 25 year mystery that finally came to rest. It's what makes movies magical.Blade Runner 2049 is not that....I think there is a huge category of people who love Blade Runner 2049. It is the same people who love movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey or Arrival. People who ""wonder"" over extremely slow movies with a heavy focus on visuals, and no real focus on story, characters or philosophy.The original Blade Runner is more similar to movies like Moon, Donnie Darko, Fifth Element and the likes, but Blade Runner is more like Stanley Kubrick's 2001. The tone is completely different, and this is a snooze fest with extremely stale characters.Ryan Gosling is boring, Harisson Ford is boring, Robin Wright is OK, Jared Leto is terrible. The movie is not about them, it's about soundless visuals. If you are deaf you will definitely enjoy the movie.The movie is dull, and like many others have said - I looked at my watch wondering when the heck this 2h 45 minute mess of a storyless, characterless movie would end?I hoped so much for the movie, but I'm sad to say that this is really, really bad.Don't bother with this one, rewatch the original instead.",Blade Runner 2049
1085,cvairag,Drowned in the subtext,2,25 January 2018,"Interesting as the set design and the cinematography of BR2049 were, the current generation will eventually learn that what makes a movie great is not loud and glossy special effects, ""surprises"", clever romantic play, endless laughs, nor hours of fist fighting, sex, nor truly ghastly horror, nor ghastly car wrecks, but whether or not the story honestly moves you, how deeply, and why. This last quintessential must be achieved on screen in the final minute, or few seconds, of the film. The final frame is the ultimate twist which ties the theme (claim, premise, argument), the plot, the lessons the characters and ourselves had to learn, and their fate into a perfect, eternal, square knot. Voila!
If this moment, the ending, is, in any way, blown, the word 'masterpiece' cannot be applied. Few films indeed deserve such an accolade, since this moment, the always elusive, satisfying, tear-worthy ending, is ever more difficult to achieve in the increasingly jaded, cynical, narrow, desperate, inhumane view of the contemporary audience. Few there are who cry in movie theaters these days, a throw-back to a simpler time, as the feature film, as the movie is now referenced, has ceded to the long running T.V. series, Breaking Bad, et al, the primary platform for the narrative constructs which really move our society.
When cornered by one of the characters in Adaptation, on one level, undoubtedly Charlie Kaufman's brilliant polemic on screenwriting, no less stern a critic than Robert McKee is asked to give his criteria for a great film in less than thirty seconds. His response: 1) a great ending; 2) the characters must change.
The ending of BR2049 is a mess, vague to the point of incoherence, and dependent on a line of subtext that none but the most devout Blade Runner fan could follow. I was neither moved nor edified. The subtext throughout the film was so complex, obscure, and overbearing, that whatever attempt to develop character is drowned along with most of the bad guys. Ryan Gosling's figure, named ""Joe"" late in the story, is I think supposed to evolve in what early on becomes a existential (lol) - I mean he's a replicant, right? Or not? Boy that brings on some heavy meditating on what it 'means' to be human - search for the self embedded in a good old cops and robbers, good guy chases down the bad guys - maybe... By the final frame I still couldn't figure out who was human - who was replicant - and why this highly speculative, trite picture of an unfortunately imagined future - where liquor seems to be the only substance binding humanity together - had any significance for me the viewer. That's what I mean by coherence. 
Please forgive the unpolished musings of a ""toe tapping"" dolt as one reviewer puts it - but I still do not see why I should contemplate this particular picture rather than another to answer the question of what it ""means to be human""? What about a movie poses the same question but against a backdrop simple reality such as Kurosawa's humbling masterpiece Ikiru ""To Live""? What greater final frame could ever be shot?
The problem with most sci-fi dystopian futuristic narratives is that every imagined detail must be accounted for and rarely are. Who says that we'll be living on a diet of holographically disguised maggots living on excrement, as is suggested by BR2049, and why? Reviewers rightly complain of multiple script ""holes"", even ""craters"" in BR2049, but it is the glaring subjectivity of their presumptions about what the future will be, common to most all of these narratives that gives one the feeling that they are wasting our time. We and 1984 seem to be the only specimens of the genre which escape this fatal flaw because in every instance the creators have found credible, cogent, and coherent ways to link the possible details of the imagined future to our current reality.
And what does the reviewer with the temerity to parade as a professional critic call a ""smart script""? Hundreds of pages long without meeting one widely agreed upon criteria for greatness or even basic structure or character development, a script which if anonymously entered into a screenwriting contest would hit the circular file in the first round, an insult to the very idea of craft.
The script actually did have a rather healthy gut full of humor even when unaware of it, I suspect - anyway a relief from the ongoing din of the army of tympanis. But the only time I heard the audience laugh was when Deckard dumped out a little booze which his dog preceded to lap off the floor. I kept trying to figure out how Deckard and the dog ate for all those years after the nuclear holocaust - they both looked sort of chubby - but unlike another reviewer, I'm not going to rush back for another viewing because I'm tortured by it all. I'm not.",Blade Runner 2049
1086,Plezsno,Should have stayed home,2,9 October 2017,"OK, maybe it's my fault. I'm sure some sci-fi nerds will blame me, but I can't find a reason to like this movie. I left the theater feeling like I missed something, like there is some huge plot point that passed me by and my lack of intelligence is getting in the way of enjoying the movie. The cinematography, easily the best part of the movie, is self-indulgent as if the director told the editors, ""We paid a lot of money for these visually spectacular sets; put them on-screen until they are a complete distraction from the story line."" The music is so grating it rivals the sets in its level of obnoxiousness. At more than one point, I felt myself falling asleep, only to be jolted awake by the sounds of high school brass section competing to see who can play the lowest note.Add to those, the unexplained plot points and the movie is a recipe for walking out. Although I didn't leave, I haven't felt so compelled to do so since Leprechaun in 1993. If the rest of my party would have hinted they were done, I would have been out the door.In the end, I don't think the fault is mine. I think it's in the movie's producers who are trying to capitalize on the names, including Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Blade Runner, while making a movie that plays well to foreign box offices.",Blade Runner 2049
1087,bruuz1,The movie loses its plot way too often.,7,7 August 2019,"The first Blade Runner was a master piece.
I've watched 2049 now for a second time and apart from the visual aspect of the film, it doesn't have the impact of the original by a landslide.
The only reason I see for this is because the movie fails to hold on to its plotline, whichever one that is. Even at the end of the movie I'm not so sure what the story was.
The original Blade Runner had a simple story. It's a movie about a blade runner, hunting down skinjobs (with their own dramatic need), falling in love with one of them. That's it. The fact that there is a major philosophical undertone in this movie is what elevates it from an ordinary action flick to one of the ultimate cinema classics, BUT at no point during the movie does the movie deflect from what its plot is, a blade runner hunting skinjobs, falling in love with one of them.
Every single scene in the movie is in service of this plotline. Either Deckard is following a clue to get to his mark, or the marks are following their dramatic needs, or the love interest is established.
It does not go off on tangents to explain how this world works. It does so through scenes that at their core are serving the plot.
Priss charms Sebastian and we get to know about his disease and off-world and whatnot, BUT these scenes are in service of the plot. They want to get to their creator. Charming Sebastian is a way forward in their dramatic need.This is exactly what I missed in 2049.
Too many scenes do not drive the plot. Sure enough, it's because the plot itself is all over the place.
The movie is a visual wonder, but the story is severly lacking.
The scene with K and his ""girlfriend"" at home, serves 0 plot function. It was just there to fill in an aspect about the world.Story mechanics, the way to write a screenplay, all the rules and do's and don't to construct a story are important. They are as fundamental to screenplay writing as are the rules for writing music.
Sure, you can string along any number of notes from amazing instruments in any way you like, but the resulting cacophony will not attract a lot of people.
For music this seems obvious to everyone, because we are all used to hearing songs (and subconsciously all the rules that come with music), so we naturally feel when something is off.
With movies, it seems a bit more difficult somehow.",Blade Runner 2049

It would have been quicker to read 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Philip K Dick, which influenced the original film.The imagery and special affects are spectacular. The sound track is clearly influenced by the original film and was quite good. The film didn't get anywhere near the atmosphere of the 1982 film.There were times when it was hard to hear some of the dialogue but as most of that dialogue was pointless waffle that wasn't too much of an issue. There were long scenes of dull silence followed by long scenes of needless chatter, all with no action or interest.I got so bored watching this I counted 17 people leave the screen in the last hour of the film who didn't return.Ryan Gosling (K) was mostly poor throughout the film. A small tree in a leather jacket could have played that role just as well.Ana de Armas (Joi) stood out amongst the cast as K's hologram love interest, backed by spectacular computer imagery.Jered Leto played Niander Wallace, for some reason. His scenes were amongst the longest and most tedious. They went on and on with the dullest dialogue in the whole film.I since found out that Director Denis Villeneuve is also responsible for Sicario and Arrival.

And that's not just that, you have to see that blackout movie too. 
Now ok we are at the middle of the movie so no time to be dissapointed. Why is Leto in this movie at all ? How and why did K go to that old place to find old Ford there ? What happened to the army which is intended to start a revolution?

I thought it was a decent sci-fi movie. So, going into the sequel, I didn't expect much. Boy, was I wrong. The acting is amazing. The effects are beautiful. The story is magnificent. The world that these films created is awesome.
I didn't know what the story was going to be going into this movie. The trailers didn't tell me much. So, I was very surprised while watching the movie. The movie is almost 3 hours long, but I was never bored. I was constantly intrigued, wanting to know what was going to happen next. I cared about the characters. I assumed the movie would end the way they were setting things up to be, but it didn't (if you have seen the film, you know what I mean). That, I think, is really cool.

1093,NoloContendere,"Ponderous, bloated, and disappointing.",4,4 November 2017,"I was disappointed. This film was just so boring. It seriously needed an editor with the intestinal fortitude to hold the director accountable for so much wasted time and aggressively cut out a lot of the interminable pauses and long lingering shots.The story line was okay, and the film was not horrible in a ""Phantom Menace"" sense. But it was soooo slow and was flabby -- it should have been an hour shorter. The director and editor lacked any sense of self-discipline. As we were watching it, I was thinking that the director had watched the original film and thought to himself, ""This film has a few lingering face shots, a lot of heavy architecture, and some jarring sound effects. We need to kick that up by a couple orders of magnitude. Let's have an hour's worth of lingering shots that make 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' look like 'Fast and Furious'; a bunch of nude statues in a permanent dust storm; and that dubstep track that my cousin recorded during his last meth binge playing over and over.""Why did the director spend a 10-minute segment on Joe having sex with a prostitute overlaid with a hologram? That scene could have taken 90 seconds to 2 minutes, tops, and still been just as impactful.How much time was wasted watching Joe look at the tree? Or looking at the furnace where the wooden horse was hidden? Or with Princess Buttercup sitting in his apartment drinking, asking questions that added nothing to the story line?Overall, it was ponderous, bloated, and boring. I love the original so much that I own multiple versions of it on Blu-Ray, whereas I will probably never watch the sequel again. It's not worth my time.As my adieu, I give you the next-to-final scene as written by Dr. Seuss:Look, Joe, snow. Snow, Joe, snow. The snow is slow. Joe is slow. The snow is on Joe. Woe is Joe. Joe sits in the snow. Joe is on the snow. He lays in the snow. Slow, slow, slow. The snow comes on. Joe is gone. All those moments will be lost in time, Like tears in rain.",Blade Runner 2049
1094,lucas_abridgwood,"Great film, but not a sci-fi epic",10,7 October 2017,"Going into this film, I was expecting a sci-fi epic, that is, a big sci-fi story was lots of action. Turns out the movie wasn't that. But, what it was instead was great. The acting was excellent. Each character was interesting. The visuals were breathtaking: Monolithic zoomed out scenes, cities, and environments, shown so, so well. Moreover, these scenes were meaningful (e.g. used well to tell the story). The soundtrack was phenomenal, and synced so well with the visuals. I thought it was interesting how all the sexually themed content was the usual ""men serving women"". Not sure if that was on purpose as part of the story, or it was the usual lack of diversity. There was not much action in the movie. It was fairly slow, and the meat of the movie was more subtle. However, the subtle story telling was done with much careful detail and to success. Still, there were things touched upon in the movie that I really want to know more about, and I wish the movie spent much more time on these (and becoming more of a sci-fi epic), rather than going into so much detail with the, in my opinion, smaller story it focused on the whole time. Also, its possible that the movie gave too much plot away to the viewer, rather letting the viewer try to solve the puzzles themselves. Overall, I think its unlikely that the story is something that I will remember in detail. What I will remember is the overall product that is the movie, which was great.",Blade Runner 2049

It was just plain dull. I kept wondering when Harrison Ford would appear and live up to the posters ( the last 10 minutes ). A lot of directors have made the mistake of concentrating on Ryan Gosling's face in the belief that the camera can see him think. He's no Eastwood, or Jimmy Stewart. Another fault of sci-fi films are the lengthy speeches about the state of the the outer quadrant, and the reasons why Tharg must be destroyed etc etc. This was no different. There was the Robin Wright character, Jared Leto, et al. I liked the abandoned casino set. Something for the eye to rest on and take the whole story in. The original had much of this. This hadn't.

1097,zero-to-HERO,Blade Runner 2049: A Sci-Fi Sequel With A Lot Of Character!,9,7 October 2017,"The year is 2049 and the replicants are wiser and more lifelike than ever before. Let's begin with the cast which was nothing short of a perfect selection process. 'K' played by Ryan Gosling played the perfect replicant/detective aka a Blade Runner in what seemingly looked to be a futuristic post apocalyptic world full of Nomad-like characters, both on the Replicant & Human side. A very complex character to fill that seemed more human than replicant. To be blunt, Ryan's performance was basically a home run - end of story there. His superior, Lieutenant Joshie played by Robin Wright, took me a short while to get accustomed too for that role but it didn't take long for me to realize that she was terrific for the part. As for Jared Leto who plays Niander Wallace, the proud new owner of Tyrell Corp, let's just say he did a far better role playing Niander, than he did as The Joker in Suicide Squad. I found he had more depth as Niander and although he portrayed a different kind of dark character (than when he played Joker), he was able to pull off this role quite nicely. Which brings me to Niander's primary trusted henchman, in this case woman, and going by the name of Luv, played by Sylvia Hoek, really made you love to hate this character. At first I felt a tiny bit of sympathy for her but as the movie progressed that sympathy turned to hate - in a positive manner. Simply because she played the part meticulously, especially for the type of replicant she was suppose to portray. And speaking of sidekicks Ana de Armas who plays Joi, a new type of tech or hologram that was more of a friend/love interest to Ryan Goslings character 'K' - as weird as that sounds. The two worked very well together and Ana's performance was nothing short of spectacular. Most movies I find overuse CGI unnecessarily, and even for the caliber of a sci-fi movie that this was supposed to be, you'd think it might be overdone, yet somehow this movie used CGI exactly where it was needed. That been said the scenery and cinematography was done just right, it mimicked the same world from the original Blade Runner with a right amount of modernization to make you think this is what the world would look like roughly thirty years later. The only negatives I found in this film is I found it dragged just a little bit, and the sound/score was a little too overdone. Otherwise overall the good by far outshines the bad. This was a solid sci-fi flick that had a lot of elements. From having a futuristic detective feel to it, to an appropriate amount of action, to a zestful of character, to even making you second guess some issues in regards to moral factors. This film had everything it needed and more to not only be a very likable film, but a total win as a sequel.",Blade Runner 2049

1099,stepvest,The best science fiction release since Matrix--a true masterpiece!,10,4 June 2018,"I saw it for the first time only recently after skipping it for a few months after its release and all the hoopla has quieted down. If I find this movie in an IMAX near me I will go and see it again in a heartbeat-- but that is unlikely and still do not regret it. Marketing surrounding its release may have misaligned expectations that led to somewhat poor word of mouth from puzzled early movie goers. Understandable--this is a hard movie to market--It would have been hard to like this movie (even for many cerebral moviegoers) when expectations were shaped of a typical summer blockbuster that service a transient entertainment. A la generic superhero move entertainment that is so common these days...a sort of fast food experience....you know what you expect, you know the feeling when the movie ends and you know you will forget it in a minute). It you do not get this the reaction is usually negative. And this is from someone who actually thought Thanos focused infinity wars was a much superior movie and as entertaining as the first Iron Man. Anyhow those movies along with many other Marvel/DC releases are (as empty as they are) happen to be cash machines and have their place but they are not in the same league as the BR2049 or the Matrix in my humble opinion.This movie is a great mystery that develops the character Arc of Gosling's through the movie just as Matrix was about Neo's arc. No spoilers here but it is important to make it clear that there is no similarity in their character. My emphasis is on the ""development arc"". And therefore in both the movies the payoff is great and it should sustain even when the special effects (eventually) will get dated. This is why Shakespeare is so enduring. It is a drama. The genius of Matrix was that it was about the character of Neo and how he is shaped by and shapes his immediate world and how he becomes aware of his capabilities as the movie progresses through some amazing set pieces. Without going into details/spoilers for others like myself who avoided this masterpiece so far-- suffice to say the Blade Runner is about Goslings discover of himself --who is he really? and Because of the sensitivity of this topic and the higher complexity of his character (compared to Neo) the run time is very much justified (it is ok for one to stop the movie for a day in between if needed as the movie pacing takes time to get used to--it is still enriching). But even when Gosling's character is silent pay attention to his superhuman sense of hearing, ultrafast processing of information, assessing his options and choosing the next step. His actions, small walks in the same scene, mannerisms are anything but random. He is almost so fast that even in physical dangers which are sudden it is hard to rattle him or surprise him. When you follow the movie through his experiences the run time actually feels short. Yes. And unlike Neo there is much less help for him...he has to fight the danger and simultaneously discover himself, process his emotions after the knowledge mostly on his own. Of course Joi serves as his love interest as well as doubles as Lawrence Fishburn-like character that actually hints at his capabilities. Their interaction is genius and the chemistry between the two --laconic Gosling and expressive Joi is something to behold. You buy his love for this virtual marvel. Big credit to both for delivering on this.
Similarly other two unforgettable characters are Luv and Harrison Ford Deckard. Luv is an amazing, ruthless, and certainly fearsome villain. She sells the stakes against Gosling's character effortlessly. Ford's Deckard is an incredible tour de force. He chews up scenery and has not lost any of his charisma...There is a reason Ford is an iconic star--pay attention to his cryptic answer and mannerism when Gosling asks whether the dog is real--- he elevates this simple exchange the only way he can. 
There are some flaws as they are bound to be in such a complex enterprise but I think they do not distract from the pleasure of this movie. Slow burn pacing, expert Direction, Cinematography, strong characters along with Goslings laconic moodiness makes this movie a most entertaining experience. Fully recommended.",Blade Runner 2049
1100,kasparslabais,Let's pretend first blade runner did not exist,9,18 October 2017,"I will try to be short and not include any spoilers. To be absolutely fair with you (who ever is reading this) I don't think first blade runner really is so good as it's rating shows. With that I mean, that movie wasn't bad, but for futuristic environment and plot, the story moved a little bit too slow or even let's say not as you would want. I guess movie was solid 7, definitely something what you could watch even now...but then comes this ""sequel"". I say ""sequel"" because I think ""Blade runner 2049"" would be great movie without attachment of old movie, maybe it would get some plot holes or hype, but it is solid piece at is is. I would recommend this movie to anyone, because it maybe hard to explain, but movie has something that make you want to keep it watching, to follow lead character and just enjoy time. It is really solid movie and I would say it is better than original. Technical side is solid as well, maybe will fill a little bit similar to ""Ghost in shell"" , but that movie has great scenes too.Overall , Ryan Gosling gives great performance, Ana De Armas is just something amazing to watch and Harrison Ford is much better as Decker than in original (despite on screen time).",Blade Runner 2049
1101,tomfry-10237,Masters at work,10,17 October 2017,"Bladerunner 2049 is the sequel to the widely acclaimed original Sci Fi masterpiece Bladerunner, directed by Ridley Scott. The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Ryan Gosling as K, a Bladerunner who stumbles across a dark secret that leads to conflict, anguish and deep self-reflection; What is it that makes us human?As I sit here and think of how to even begin to comprehensively summarise my thoughts on this modern Sci-Fi masterpiece, I listen to the penultimate track ""Bladerunner"" on Hanz Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's mesmerising score for the film and realise that it perfectly summarises how I feel.The song opens with no holds barred, a punchy introduction that thrusts you right into the tone of this world and refuses to let you go from that point onwards, just as the film does. This dystopia is saturated, and every frame drips with such colour and life that it appears cinematographer Roger Deakins is practically demanding your eye. Accompanied by a score and screenplay paralysing your body with intrigue, fear and anticipation from the very first frames, you will soon find yourself hooked.The middle section of the track then flows in. Subtle, mysterious, revelatory. It coincides magnificently with the second act of the film which takes the staple question of the original(what is it to be human?) and asks it on a new level: does the ability to recall our past and remember our childhood make us human? We explore this through the character of K, Gosling's quiet and wonderfully subtle protagonist, attempting to find his place in the world accompanied by Ana de Armas' Joi, another enrapturing performance complimenting a very intriguing character. Through them we experience all the things that make us ""human"". Fear, anxiety, joy, a sense of belonging. The film has something to say about them all. And then we reach our conclusion. Surprise after surprise. shock upon shock. The film refuses to release you right up until the instant the credits start rolling.Directed immaculately. Shot with a profound love for Ridley Scott's world and the craft of filmmaking. Scored to compliment each and every frame. Bladerunner 2049 is a true modern Sci-Fi masterpiece and a testament to how sequels should be done: nostalgic retrospect insighting new ideas, not acting as handcuffs, enabling the introduction of fresh and progressive ideas that new generations of moviegoers can ponder over for a long time to come.",Blade Runner 2049
1102,am-39702,Best movie i have seen in a few years,10,6 October 2017,"This movie is by far the best movie of 2017, and one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.I love the slow build up, the story and plot takes its time, the visuals were stunning, the music created a great atmosphere. Ryan Gosling is a living proof that less is more when it comes to acting, he has charisma which enables him to emote without overacting, and it comes off as natural. I have never seen the original Blade Runner. But the story in this movie is beautiful. It touches the subject of what makes us human, the desire for human interaction, loneliness, equality, the concept of being part of something, the desire to be loved and wanted. I was expecting to see an action packed sci-fi thriller. What i saw was way more than i expected or paid for. The movie took its time, but it was worth it. With all the action packed, non-stop aggressive in your face movies that Hollywood is spewing lately, seeing this was like breath of fresh air. The movie didn't feel long to me, and never in a million years did i think a sci-fi movie called Blade Runner would move me and evoke such emotions when watching it.If you are going to pay for a movie ticket this year, this is the one, it is worth every penny.",Blade Runner 2049
1103,silverlight-91083,A mediocre and soulless 'blockbuster'. Expensively bad movie making.,4,7 October 2017,"This review does contain a very minor spoiler.The original Bladerunner is one of my favourite movies of all time, very atmospheric, great story and plot with interesting characters, great soundtrack, visually stunning. a true classic. i saw it at the cinema when it first came out and have watched it many times since. this sequel does not hold a candle to the original movie, in fact i would call it an abomination. Nonsensical plot and script to begin with, overlong and dead boring in most scenes, soundtrack consists of painfully loud synthesizer ugliness as opposed to the sublime beauty and atmosphere of Vangelis's soundtrack which really elevated the original movie by capturing, conveying every intended mood - tenderness, loneliness, menace, vastness, sentimentality and more. The people still involved from the original movie must have been squirming inside during the making and promotion of this film. the only pass this movie gets from me is the cinematography which was OK. Overall, hopelessly inferior to the original movie in every aspect and I'm sure it cost many times the original to make. To me, it follows the general trend of Hollywood so-called 'blockbusters', totally over-hyped and generally poor movies. i do see good movies out of Hollywood occasionally but they are usually the ones which go under the radar, as did the original Bladerunner when it came out.How to describe what this movie is missing? the best scene in the movie was where Deckard feeds his dog whiskey! the only scene with an ounce of 'realness' in it, something to connect to, otherwise its all overly pretentious and ponderous, lacking inspiration, going through the motions. Visually stylish but no depth or substance behind the appearance. Like the old saying 'The Emperor has no clothes on'",Blade Runner 2049

With an overall rating of 8 I had high expectations for this film.Ryan Gosling is normally a favourite of mine but his character in this does nothing to engage the audience. Is bland and boring. After an hour and a half I could not tell you of anything excited that happened in this film so I turned it off. I always read reviews saying not to bother with a film and I watch it anyway but seriously, do not watch this.

1107,tcheb,beautiful but disappointing,5,14 October 2017,"The movie is definitely a masterpiece in terms of cinematography. Ryan Gosling does a decent job as well. That's where it ends though. The most frustrating part about it is how it insults the intelligence of the viewer. While the original movie was laid down like a puzzle (the unicorn dreams and origami at different moments in the movie) this one just spells out everything to make sure the dumbest person could get it. The only thing missing was a big sign flashing: ""pay attention here"" . The flashbacks were placed totally artificially and the whole sequence was so linear it hurts. Also the whole story was way too shallow and included too many cheap tearjerkers.Another frustrating thing is how, just like all the other recent reboots, it just runs on pure nostalgia while adding virtually nothing new. Edward James Olmos's appearance is a perfect example. The short scene involving him adds nothing to the story. It's just there because they had to find some reason to put him in the movie.They should have left the original movie alone.",Blade Runner 2049

The did a good job of building the world/universe the film's take place in. The film did tend to feel like it was dragging at certain points. However each scene contributed to the story as a whole and I though they did a great job with this. I see a lot of mixed reviews and it seems those that liked the first movie tend to not like this one. I say get over yourself, this film was hands down way better than the first. Just because the original Blade Runner set the tone for Cyberpunk movies doesn't mean it is the best. I actually found the first one quite painful to watch. This one was much better. They showed you how much stronger and durable the replicants are than humans. The replicants were much more deadly in this film. I feel like this movie made you think about what it is to be human and was much more thought provoking than the first. I also found the story itself was laid out way better than the first movie. Overall good movie. Glad I watched it because I almost didn't after watching the first one.",Blade Runner 2049

1111,WinterWoodwere1,All the courage in the world cannot alter fact,10,23 November 2019,"Blade Runner 2049 is a pleasure to watch.I was extremely skeptical when this movie was announced. Blade Runner (1982) was one of my favorite movies, the cinematography, the soundtrack and the broader themes transcended the underwhelming writing. But this is not the time to review the original. I was worried that this would simply be another soft reboot, I was prepared to walk away from this movie if it was simply another repeat, or disgrace to the original. However, to my surprise a great amount of care was put into imagery, I was pleased to see the use of physical models and analogue technology in an era where every sci fi movie feels the need to have ""smart tech"" holograms and rely solely on CGI and fruitlessly fail at creating a believable world. I was also pleased to see the action was not overplayed, in an era where film makers apparently rely on action to keep the viewer in the seats, regardless of its plot significance, this film understands that developing characters is more interesting than constant explosions.2049 achieves the immersion of the original, with its rich detailed world which informs the viewer to the world purely through visuals. The score is a different style than the original, and another aspect I was worried about. Thankfully Zimmer keeps the iconic french horns out, in favor of a brilliant combination of classic and modern synth. The harsh brutalist tones work brilliantly with the environment, and the lighter ethereal notes accent the more human elements. Leitmotifs reminiscent of Vangelis are also found throughout the score, a callback to the original and are surprisingly well blended. Overall this movie maintains the worldbuilding and immersion elements of its predecessor, which is no small task.The storytelling of this movie is a contested point. Personally I feel it surpasses or matches the original in every aspect. The development of K, his motivations, and his weaknesses are all developed in 2049, which are lacking with Deckard in the original. The development of the supporting characters in 2049 surpass all of those in the original with the exception of Roy Batty. This is likely why this film, while polarizing, has achieved the positive reputation it has. As far as acting goes, once again it equals or surpasses on all levels except the original with that exception being Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty. The acting of Gosling as the lead, and all the others supporting him works well to sell the environment being portrayed.The movie suffers from two major flaws: it received little to no attention, and its title. Many believe this film disrespects the original, and I can understand their point, even if I disagree. The movie does largely distance itself from the original, enough to make it work for anyone who has not seen the original. However there are several connections which are plot specific, and would make more sense to someone who has seen the original. The fact this is a movie in the Blade Runner continuity, and not a modern rendering has caused some to discredit its originality. Yes it is true that many movies being made rely solely on brand recognition to make a profit, but Blade Runner has never been profitable. Blade Runner was a box office bomb, and having been one of eight people in the theater during Blade Runner 2049's release in theaters, I can say first hand that it was a financial failure. Despite the economic failure, it is a cinematic gem.With so many saying this movie didn't need to be made, I have to agree. But I am glad it was made, for I thoroughly and honestly enjoyed it. Nostalgia aside, it surpasses the original in many ways. As a Blade Runner film, it is still not easily accessed by a mainstream audience, but to anyone interested in film as an artform, 2049 is a brilliant experience.Overall score 98/100",Blade Runner 2049
1112,LANGUISHMAN,Art in Films Done With Perfection,10,24 November 2019,"This is a film that I would describe as an art-film, but rather being an art-film (like ones that are made for a niche audience), it presentations and narrative are so fantastic that I never found myself bored of the screen.I never really liked the original Blade Runner, I think it is one of the most overrated pieces in cinema. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography and world-building was nothing but impressive for its era. However, the story is slow and the narrative just doesn't make any sense (eg. what was up with that unicorn scene? Why does every single performance seems like they just want to go home?). Regardless of how much I didn't like the first film, I could appreciate its influence and production design. Blade Runner 2049 improves every single thing about the original.The plot was amazing. For once I was able to understand the character's motivation, what their goals are and so on. It explores many themes like perfectionism, life and death and every single of these themes are explored throughout the film like a sacred text. There were so many details and so many beautiful imageries that I could not imagine that these were made this movie by actual people. Everything in this film is perfect. I could see anything wrong with the film. Every single shot feels emotionally impacting and the last scene was me gripping me on my seat cheering for the main character. This is what an art film should try to accomplish. It is a film that tells life through art and art through life. It is not made for a niche audience, instead, it is made as a representation of the future possibility of the human race. These possibility seems so real in our world that I would imagine myself living in this fictional society. The CGI was perfect, the cinematography was bloody incredible. The story was amazing.There were so many things done right for this film that I am comfortable calling it a 10/10. A minor issue that I had with it would be the dialogues, which sometimes feel drawn-out and pointless, but these were added with amazing visual, making you grip with the scene regardless of the nonsense.",Blade Runner 2049

I had a very hard time staying awake and an even harder time making sense out the extremely slow story line unfolding. I kept thinking the entire time I was watching it that they were just filling time with empty, meaningless scenes. In the end I was convinced that the entire story could have been told in about thirty minutes, with some decent action, and it would have been a lot better. The main way to describe this movie is that, to be kind, the story line took a backseat to meaningless but beautiful HD cinematography. The story was difficult to follow and had an all over the place and meaningless feeling to it. No one in the theater said a word when it was over. They all just got up and walked out looking bored out of their minds. Character development was next to non existent with the exception of a few scenes that pretended to develop the main character. Since I had to give it one star to rate it, I will say that star was for the actors, who in my opinion did as good a job as possible with the horrible, painstakingly slow script they were give. My last complaint is that I have been duped into going and seeing a few movies because the IMDb rating was initially very high, only to end up wasting my time and money. I am convinced that the good reviews are fake and most likely paid for. It is IMPOSSIBLE for people to be rating this garbage a 9 or 10. Perhaps someone who is deaf and just loves looking at HD scenery in movies would have loved it. Other than that it would take a seriously unique kind of person to think this movie was decent, much less good.",Blade Runner 2049
1118,scramcat-1,Random fragmented sub-plots hinder a touching story about an AI's dream of becoming real,1,12 February 2018,"(Starring Ana de Armas, Pinocchio Gosling, and several other stars who deserve better)While the original Blade Runner followed a group of replicants' quest for full long lives and self-realization, Blade Runner 2049 follows an AI's quest for purpose and meaning beyond her product design. Joi is a virtual domestic companion to LAPD Officer K who helps him stay grounded after a long day terminating stray replicants (he's a replicant who kills replicants, how meta). Projected as a hologram she engages K in 1950's homemaker chit-chat, joins him at the dinner table, helps him vent, and rubs his weary shoulders as best a trick of the light can. She conceptually understands the world outside the apartment's walls but accepts her isolation from it as her lot in life. When K buys Joi a portable Emitter (think the Doctor on Star Trek: Voyager) the walls fall away from her world. The most commonplace activities like embracing K in the rain or accompanying him to the food court fill her with, well, joy, and a passion to connect ever more deeply with K. She watches him ply his detective skills and survive shoot-outs with scavengers her admiration and love for him grows ever more substantial. Joi even realizes a way to share sexual intimacy with K by enlisting a flesh-and-blood body double. Now deeply realized, Joi attains a virtue shared by too few humans: Self-sacrifice. When K must go on the lam Joi volunteers to be deleted from the apartment computer console so she can't be misused by the goons hunting the man she loves. Existing only in the portable Emitter she becomes as vulnerable as him and accepts the risk as the unquestioned price of love. And when her time comes she pays that price unflinchingly.There are several meandering sub-plots that are touched on but never explored and they only waste time and raise more questions. The LAPD police captain fears the discover of a fertile replicant would tear apart society, but her fear mongering has all the authenticity of a click-bait news web site. Bioengineering tycoon Wallace yearns to build more off-world colonies but he can't make enough replicant slave labor and wants Deckard and Rachel's love child so he can learn how to build fertile replicants. Two problems there: Bred replicants would be born as infants but manufactured replicants would be fully grown and ready for the workforce. Also, Wallace was able to build another Rachel so he already has a replicant capable of giving birth, why the murder-filled quest to find the love child? The replicant underground wants the love child because they believe that replicant ability to procreate would lead to their freedom, but there's not a word mentioned of how those dots are connected. When K reunites Deckard with his long-lost daughter it turns out she's been passing as a human for 30 years, so apparently she's not a identifiable as a replicant after all. Why all the turmoil, death, and destruction to find her? The movie could have been trimmed down to a more engaging 100 minutes without all that self-defeating fluff.Joi owns the only story you'll care about.",Blade Runner 2049

I can understand why Denis Villeneuve shaved off scenes as the story would be the length of another film I loved called WATCHMEN over 3 hours.Visually, the film is very good coming in close to it's 1982 predecessor. The digital rendering, rotoscope animation and the artists that helped bring all of that to life is impressive. The entire cast also did a very good job. However the critical scene that caught me was the recreation of ""Rachel"" who was portrayed by a then 22-year old Sean Young 36 years ago (she's 57 now by the way). That is computer animation, talented artistry and digital imaging at it's finest.That being said, truth be told I am not happy that this sequel was made much less the three short films preceding it explaining this story 30+ years later.

Blade Runner 2049, for the mature of all ages, is immersive, moving and stunning both visually and aurally and indeed it stands on its own, albeit the impetus for me was the original Blade Runner, making it the perfect sequel - as well. Purchased the movie in 3d to match my theatre viewing experience...and on my fifth home viewing....still incredible! The speculative, marketing inspired demise of 3d in North America is undoubtedly and assuredly premature. 3d format or otherwise the movie remains a masterpiece. It should be the Oscar pick for best movie of 2017, and the cast including Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas and others nominated in respective roles. Consummate actors all, not to mention Denis Villeneuve as Best Director. Thank Ridley Scott for recognizing his genius.The reality is that Science Fiction, even as a statement on the human condition, has never won an Oscar for Best Movie, as far as I know. The Academy Awards will likely miss this, caught up in the social media swamp and the cause of the day. The Academy will likely instead vote for an odd duck or more common place take on the trials and tribulations of the human condition, all destined to become mediocrities and also rans for 2017. This in turn, as it continues to demonstrate, makes Oscar night nothing more than a gossips' social gathering and more redundant and meaningless than ever in what it's function should be - rewarding real achievement in film.Meanwhile like the first Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 will continue to attract an ever growing following and challenge current and future movie makers to raise the bar.",Blade Runner 2049

Two gripes though. 1, the replicants are basically humans, they don't add anything at all on how they are produced or how they differ from humans. I always assumed that they were robots or at least cyborg but they don't show anything about this. 2nd, the movie is actually painfully loud, it will hurt your ears. This is inexcusable and I don't know if it's by design or what. Actually remembering that pisses me off so I'm going to drop some stars.",Blade Runner 2049

1128,brianrorr,"Excellent movie due to its atmosphere, music, and mystery theme",8,14 October 2017,"I will be fully honest and say I disliked the original Blade Runner. I only saw it recently, a few weeks before the sequel Blade Runner 2049 came out in theaters. The original's plot was so hard to follow for me, with extremely random clues being given to Harrison Ford's character to continue the mystery along and somewhat random action to keep the tension high.The sequel does not have these flaws, in my opinion; the mystery was solved logically and with steps that one could follow and was invested in Ryan Gosling's character's desire to find the answer to this mystery. As well, the sequel had gripping action scenes with good choreography and tense moments, putting the main character's life in serious harms way. His injuries felt real and difficult to manage, I wanted him to survive and felt Ryan Gosling carried the story well. I liked his rational and extremely focused personality, showing little emotion, and yet I felt his character wrestling with his identity and what it means to be human vs. an artificial human or replicant.It was amazing to be immersed in this world and I honestly *loved* that the movie was so long and drew out the scenes to let me think and predict how the mystery would unfold and most to bask in the atmosphere the movie painted. I loved the atmosphere, the dark dystopia and details that convinced me this world could be real.And I did like that there was a computer program or simulation that Ryan Gosling fell in love with, a wife personality that was not real yet thought and remembered, without having physical form. I appreciated being challenged by the movie to what in life matters and what in fact makes humans indeed humans and inherently valued. One of the few things I did *NOT* like about this movie was its sex scene and myriad of naked women they threw in the movie. They focused too long on the replicant ""born"" when introducing Wallace's character....I don't want to see anyone's breast or butt, I never like nudity or sex scenes in movies or TV. I feel that's a sacred place for husband and wife to have together, not to show to the world especially continuously and so randomly like in this movie. The sex scene, though not shown but lead up to, between Ryan Gosling and the prostitute replicant/Ryan Gosling's computer wife was appropriate I feel to show Ryan Gosling had developed a deep connection to another being even if that being was not real and only artificially created. Is love valuable even if it is temporary? Is life valuable? These questions are inherently asked I feel and that scene, even though I could have done without the slow pace, had its place to ask the audience the question, what is love. The music was the icing on the cake for me~ It took the original's theme and style and made it completely appropriate and not overused in the sequel. I liked the music in the original, I loved the music and how it was used to create emotion and tension in the sequel. Sick~~An awesome movie, I would definitely watch again mostly for the mystery feel, music, and a refreshing change of pace to slow a movie down and allow its themes to sink in. Great job +1",Blade Runner 2049
1129,andrewmdeakins,Deep and wonderful scifi,10,23 September 2020,"There are not enough movies like this in the world. I adore the first movie, the atmosphere, the direction, the score and the questions the original movie poses,its simply, one of the finest movies ever produced. I have heard a lot of comments about the necessity of another movie, to be honest, if this movie encourages people to see the first movie then it has not been a waste of time.I don't want to go into the plot of the movie, only give a perspective as a lover of the original. We start with a just as dramatic opening scene as the original and would like to add at this point they have chosen to go with a similar score to vangellis's offering in the first movie this time performed by the wonderful Hans Zimmerman, personally, I think it has the right amount of tension and has the correct amount of impact in the movie (coupled with the eerie back drop of advertisments echoing around the L.A. dystopian backdrop)The look of the movie is truly fantastic, Roger Deakins and the lighting, especially in water filled Wallace corporation offices is a marvel to behold through to the dust filled streets of L.A. every frame in this movie is gorgeous and on a personal note, fits perfectly with the original in every way.In terms of the questions/morales the movie covers, it's wonderful and serves to further the questions posed in the original movie and it also extends on the basic need of interaction regardless of how ""human"" any character is, i Loved Kay's interaction with his hollagraph girlfriend and the interplay with that relationship, the fake food, drinking for himself and buying her gifts. It really does dig into the deepest questions of how real does something have to be in order for us to show compassion. absolutely fascinating.Let me finish by saying this isn't a movie for everyone, people who have a genuine interest in AI, human interaction or psychology will find this movie stimulating and as thought provoking as the original movie was.In terms of this movie being necessary, if younger audiences after watching this movie, are drawn to watching the first movie, then absolutely it was.personally, I loved it.",Blade Runner 2049
1130,courtney_london,"Meh - if you liked the original, you will probably like this; if not, maybe rent at home.",7,11 October 2017,"I watched this movie with friends on the first night it was released in Canada. It was surprisingly not busy at the theatre, but that may have correlated to the weekend also being Thanksgiving.If you watched the original Blade Runner (1982) you are probably going to like this movie but I do not imagine it having the same appeal as the original. I think one of the reasons why Blade Runner was such a big hit/cult classic back in the 80s was because this may have been one of the first science fiction movies to tell this kind of story along with all the ""advances"" in technology so well. Blade Runner 2049 does not have anything new, special, or different from any other sci-fi movie that has been released in the past 10 years. Now I did not watch the original until hours before I watched Blade Runner 2049, and I will admit, the original was mostly boring and it was hard to sit through. This trend also happens in Blade Runner 2049, because, well it's a 2 hour and 45 minute movie! I enjoyed the story, the cinematography, the music was AMAZING, and the acting was good. My one question to the director is, ""WHY DOES EVERYONE WALK SO SLOW IN 2049?"" Some scene's dragged a bit, and the first hour of the movie seemed to be spent explaining the backstory of Blade Runners and the world in 2049; which is OK because I understood exactly why and what was happening. For those that are expecting an action-packed, adrenaline rush, non-stop gun fire and on the edge of your seat actionthis is not for you. It may be that as a society we are now expecting the comic book/superhero kind of movies that are non-stop action the entire time, with a mush of underdeveloped characters that just end of together someone and become best friends; so if you want something a little more deep and developed, Blade Runner 2049 may be up your alley.Blade Runner 2049 will be loved by a very specific small niche audience, and others may just feel ""meh"" about the movie. I think this movie is good, and I'm glad I saw it, but because it was almost 3 hours long, it may be a stay-at-home kind of movie (where you can pause and go grab a snack, or go to the washroom).",Blade Runner 2049

1133,micahbundy,Rare Breed of Film,10,3 February 2018,"Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and is directed by Denis Villeneuve. This film exists within the Blade Runner franchise and takes place thirty years after the events of the original. This film follows a young blade runner named K (Ryan Gosling) who finds an important secret and tracks Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford) to find the meaning of it.This is truly a beautiful film. It's one of the few films I have seen when you can feel the love that the director put into it. You can tell that Villeneuve spent many late nights perfecting every detail of this film. He surrounded himself with some of the best in production design, screenplay, and music. You can see the love that Villeneuve not only has for the franchise, but for film in general. That's why this film was running on all cylinders.This film took every great aspect of the original and improved on them, while taking the things that didn't work and fixing those as well. The film has mind-blowing concepts and themes and even manages to put a fresh new spin on the ones that were borrowed from the original. Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch bring a riveting soundtrack that even rivals Vangelis' brilliant soundtrack from the original. The soundtrack is complimented by some of the best cinematography ever seen on film. Roger Deakins gives us a film that is a feast for the eyes during every second of a film that is almost three hours long.The film fixes the originals biggest issue that is the characters. While the characters in the original felt like they lacked depth and were poorly written, the characters in this film were well acted and had great arcs.The film lacks any emotional drawl to the characters, but this is okay because the characters have their own emotional value and clear motivations. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford's characters are prime examples of this. As the film progresses K struggles with his humanity and you really feel for Ryan Goslings' character, due to his great performance. Harrison Ford gives one of his greatest performances in his career. While Deckard was dull in the original, he gives an emotional performance, where he is traumatized by the events in his life over the past thirty years. The film has few action sequences, but when it does they feel crisp and creative. They are made intense by the soundtrack and are stunning due to Deakins' beautiful scenery. These sequence were truly a group effort and that's why they felt perfect.There will be people who will find this film boring, but for me it's the opposite. With all the excellent aspects of this film that I mentioned before and the immaculate detail that director Denis Villeneuve put into this film, it makes for not only the best film of 2017, but one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Denis Villeneuve created an immersive experience that reminded me why I love movies and that's why Blade Runner 2049 is an easy: 10/10",Blade Runner 2049
1134,AlonsoMoseleyFBI,Awesome,10,11 October 2017,"I saw the first blade runner at age 13, and it had a profound effect on me. This film manages to continue and expand that sense of wonder. Thank God that Ridley was only executive producer. After his truly awful efforts with the Alien franchise recently, I am glad he was not front row centre on this one. many, many other reviewers have said it : Denis Villeneuve does a really good job at directing this. The cinematography surpasses the first film, and the CGI is restrained and unnoticeable, as it should be. Hampton Fancher's script is well thought out and considered. My only small gripe is that Zimmer's soundtrack is a bit jarring in some scenes, with too much crescendo and fanfare, where more restrained, orchestral overtones would have proved more memorable. But my bias for Vangelis' superb original is perhaps coming through. Otherwise, best film I have seen in ages. Well done to all for not ruining my childhood memories !!",Blade Runner 2049
1135,JamShake-101,'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...',9,5 October 2017,"My memories of Blade Runner 2049 won't be washed away any time soon. More Blade Runner than Blade Runner? No. And yet this is what makes Blade Runner 2049 brilliant. Of course any consideration of Villeneuve's film must take account of the now sacrosanct original, and this is something Villeneuve himself has evidently been aware of from the outset. It is obvious throughout the film, tonally, thematically, musically, and in almost every other aspect that not only the director but the entire cast and crew hold a deep reverence for the original film, in a manner akin to its many fans. Again and again the film draws inspiration from Blade Runner, as the 'feel' of Scott's film imbues this sequel in its entirety, and yet, astoundingly, Villeneuve's production balances indebtedness with independence. Due to skillful and assured direction, emotionally nuanced performances, incisive cinematography and sound, and perhaps most importantly, some truly beautiful writing, this film has the strength to emerge from the shadow of Blade Runner and become its own distinct entity. In Blade Runner Roy Batty declares that it's 'quite a thing to live in fear', and yet Villeneuve's film manages to avoid this traumatic state, dreading neither the weight of the original nor the subsequent expectation upon its shoulders, as it cleverly recalls Scott's film whilst following its own direction. 2049 builds upon the eclectic themes of its predecessor in a thoughtful, moving and sometimes shocking manner, satisfying audience expectations given the arc of the original story - Villeneuve playfully echoes its diegetic and moral ambiguities - without ever sinking into the kind of palimpsestic homage we've witnessed in films such as The Force Awakens. Once again Gosling is on fine form, and whilst some critics might mistakenly interpret his performance as restricted and somewhat lifeless, he in fact offers both the quiet fortitude and humanity that the role demands; you can understand why he was so desired for the part. Stylistic and character based twists upon the original characters abound, and yet in reprising his role as Deckard Ford also excels, whilst the supporting cast are all committed and, crucially, in tune with the aura of the film. Jared Leto's performance is perhaps slightly melodramatic at points for some, however he is integral to some of the film's strongest moments (one very raw scene in particular stands out - you'll know it when you see it).My only criticism would be that at 163 minutes the film loses a little of the focused intensity which contributes to the original's brilliance, however the emotional payoff for this extended length is rewarding and not altogether misguided. In the end such criticisms are largely nitpicking, as the film excels in all areas and stands as one of the strongest releases of the year. Bravo to Villeneuve and co., they can certainly be proud of what they have produced. Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid is that much like Scott did so powerfully in his original (after the excision of certain studio-led material), Villeneuve and his team have produced a visually immersive, gripping and considered interrogation of questions central to not only those in the audience, and not even simply those in the world around them, but also those that will come after Blade Runner 2049's release. Consequently it feels as though this too will maintain its place in popular culture, and in doing so remind us of the power of cinema to understand humanity's past, present and future.",Blade Runner 2049
1136,mfwcurran,A product of 21st Century Movie Making - watch it again,8,7 March 2019,"First off, I'll just say now I loved this film. Just like the original divided opinion, so has this, but that's ok. Some of the best films do that. Yeah, it's ponderous. Sure, the visuals may feel like style over substance. And at times, it is a cold and calculating journey into the dark decay of humanity. It's not an uplifting film. Nor was the first, to be fair, and if you come to Blade Runner 2049 without watching the first one, then I can understand the haters.I can also understand the hate from fans of the first movie, if I'm honest. Here is a film that just couldn't be like the first. Star Wars, Alien, Indiana Jones etc, those products of 70s/80s film phenomenon, have undergone sequels and reboots which have been, largely, poorly remakes/sequels of much loved films. If this has told movie makers anything, it's told them to be fresh. Original. New.Blade Runner 2049 largely succeeds in doing this by putting a replicant front and centre as the main character; in effect a child in a man's body. This is less a story of love between man and robot as in the first film (or robot and robot) but explicitly the tragedy of playing god, and the creation of slavery. And it does it well. However, it works better when the mini-movies are viewed before the film. I know many people who didn't watch these and so Wallace's motives and actions feel excessive and absurd, and the Sapper's death is meaningless.It's the norm to put out mini-movies for promotion and add levels of entertainment, but it also disguises flaws in the movie itself. I don't know how the director could have incorporated the Wallace and Sapper scenes into the movie without complicating the timeline, but for me they are important to the storyline. They add context and motive.Overall, Blade Runner 2049 deserves another viewing by those who hadn't seen the mini-movies beforehand, and think the film is a bad one.I guess just like the original Blade Runner did.",Blade Runner 2049

1139,jandobrodumow,Patchiness,7,13 October 2017,"It was never going to be able to live up to the original, how could it? However, judging by the fawning reviews in the media, you could have been forgiven for thinking it had managed to pull off the impossible. Unfortunately I think these days you just have to take the whole review industry with a massive pinch of salt. Is it a bad film? No, not at all. Is it a worthy successor to the original? Difficult question to answer. The pacing is painfully, painfully slow, and I don't have any problem with slow movies, my attention span is fine, but let's face it, the whole thing didn't get into gear for at least 60-70 minutes, there was so little dramatic tension there, I honestly thought about leaving, although I am glad I didn't, as the second half was an improvement. So it's a patchy film at best, moments of brilliance for sure, visually impressive, the script is uneven and often cheesy, the characters not as fully dimensional as the original, the plot is quite well worked out, although the ending was a letdown for me, too sugary sweet. However, there is for me, a huge emptiness in this movie, where the original seemed to have some kind of connection with the society, here it's like a wasteland, you don't get any sense of connection to the world - maybe that's the intention, but it's somehow a lot bleaker than the original. Personally I am not a massive fan of Gosling either, that's just me, I wasn't fully convinced by him. Overall - horrible pacing for the first half, interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying plot resolution, stunning visuals, good performances. It's good, but it's nowhere near as great as the media would have you believe. It's not an insult to the original at all, it's just not in the same league.",Blade Runner 2049

They characters didn't look manic to me, they had issues going on ... and they do it with dignity:) without Oprahing us. Gosling doesn't get all Games of thrones on the ladies and fornicate with the replicants all over the place so the girls are going to get disappointed in that respect.

I'm surprised that Villeneuve's clothes are not more eventful like Jee-woon Kim's.. Im a superficial female like that :) and everybody should be watching Incedies.

1144,thefilmnotebook,A brilliant film that manages to reach sophistication with simplicity,10,29 October 2017,"The more I think about Blade Runner 2049, the more brilliant it becomes. It is a film that manages to reach sophistication with simplicity. Director Dennis Villeneuve took on this sequel to the original Blade Runner with heavy pressure and expectations. It seems that he has been quite reserved in testing the boundaries and drawing a trajectory from the path of the original. It is nonetheless a sincere and daring continuation, and it is faithful to the ambiguities and questions presented in the first film. There seems to be polarising views when it comes to Villeneuve films. Blade Runner 2049 is akin to the Arrival, and draws its audience in with its incredible visuals and an enigmatic sense of wonder. It is easy to be immersed in a lull, and that can either be appreciated or despised. It depends on what you expect, and your opinion would vary depending on which angle your assessment is made. I have come to appreciate that is how Villeneuve paints his mysteries – the rhythm is slow-paced, the mood is melancholy and unsettling, and he uses his strong central characters to dig with willpower and grace. Similar to Amy Adams' character in the Arrival, the central character here is Ryan Gosling, a replicant LAPD 'blade runner', sent out to retire older model replicants. Along the way, he discovers clues that may change his entire perception of his own identity and his world. It is terrifying to realise that our memories can define who we are, as both our past and future can alter the present. Like the future 'memories' that influenced Adams in the Arrival, Gosling was deeply affected by his past memories. Villeneuve's artistic talent is undeniable. Two words pop into my mind when I try to describe the visuals, majesty and magnificence, compounded by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's extremely powerful score. Even though this film is science fiction, there are parallels between our world and this world Villeneuve (and Ridley Scott) have created – the degradation and depletion of natural resources and the emergence and development of technology, especially in artificial intelligence. There is a great paradox here, in a sense that we are now seeking realism in a world where there is a loss of realism. There are profound scenes where Gosling tries to experience physical intimacy with his 'artificial intelligence' girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas) – he felt love towards her and wanted to express it in a 'human way'. This leads to a very important question regarding humanity, what is it that makes us human? Do we need to know how to love and exhibit emotions? Do we need to be born? Do we have to die for a cause? Gosling's Officer K searches the answer in this film, and although he was a replicant – a bioengineered 'human', he is in many ways, just like 'us'. The fact that we are trying to humanise this world (something that we take for granted now), is very intriguing. I really enjoyed Villeneuve's 'minimalist' style in making this film. The narrative was simple, with few well-drawn characters. It was lovely to see Harrison Ford reprising his role as Deckard, and Robin Wright and Jared Leto gave convincing performances. Much like in Star Wars: the Force Awakens, there is that familiar frisson of excitement when Ford finally emerges from the darkness. Still, questions were left unanswered in this film and it wasn't Villeneuve's intention to do so. Ironically, by keeping the elements simple, he has achieved both emotional and intellectual depth. I much appreciated the obscurity because the true magic lies in the moments afterwards, when I slowly discover the hidden intricacies and I spend my time just pondering about it. Perhaps the answer is simple, it just takes quite a journey to get there.",Blade Runner 2049

1151,Number1Animeguy,"To late to say anything new, a million other films have already said and did most of what this tries to do.",4,7 December 2018,"It's just a Blade Runner clone but without the Grey conflict of the first film.The story just victimizes the replicants and takes their side and the main human antagonist is mostly evil.If they can reproduce themselves then why do they need you, why would you want them to? This is the illogic of the antagonist, this won't work out well no matter what. Limiting their reproduction makes them easier to control so they don't take over and kill you.Also, bioengineered beings should be able to have babies. If you have the technology to make replicants why don't you have the technology to insert reproductive genes from humans into them. The Tyrell Corporation did remove the reproductive genes so this world has the tech and if they removed the reproductive genes how was their reproduction. The Tyrell Corporation must have had replicant DNA or the Wallace Corporation couldn't have restarted production a decade later unless they started with nothing which would suggest they had some form of this technology.The experimental replicant from the first film had those genes, which is the mother of the replicant baby.They have DNA archives of an experimental replicant but not any on gene splicing and it's plot convenient that particular data survived after the replicants wiped out all the electronic data. Also for the fact, all you would need is the mother or father's DNA. There are no books or backups or people who have the knowledge of such things in the world of blade runner and human reproduction is slow and for the fact how long is it going to take before they're useable as workers, so wouldn't growing them be faster.Their process must be really slow and if so how do they make money with such a slow process, so why not just make them grow faster. I mean genetic engineering is how they made the replicants, to begin with. Do the writers not understand genetic engineering or did everyone get amnesia when all but some of the data was destroyed? Genetic engineering is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce, improved, or novel organisms.Also, there was a massive backlash among the human populace, just over giving them open-ended lifespans equivalent to that of a regular human.The main character acts as a plot device only moving the plot along to where it needs to go and ends up only being very important for finding out what happened between films and his sacrificial death so two characters who are bearly in the film can meet and that you couldn't care less about if you never saw the first film. It seems to me subverting our expectations was the point of him not being the Jesus replicant baby and she being a minor character was boring. Also, the AI girlfriend subplot feels to me to be inspired by the film her but that movie has a whole film to explore it, this is a pointless subplot.No other character is interesting as he is the only one that goes through an existential crisis.The themes of transhumanism and existentialism, the story, and the plot are nothing new and I'd say just watch the (1995) Ghost in the shell film or the first over it.",Blade Runner 2049

First impression were ""Lot of grey"" and ""There is rain in the future"".Without many words a story gets shown, not told, shown. Some movies get this wrong and try to be an audiobook with visuals, not this one. You could probably watch without sound and still understand everything.Visually stunning, not much more to say.The audio is a different story. No idea if this has to do with the bluray, but the levels varied from ""cant hear a thing"" to ""that is loud"".

Most jarring are the car effects and the presence of pay phones and absence of smart phones. :) Second... Wow... This sequel is visually stunning, captures a lot of the feel of the original but is way too much, way too slow, and way too loud! It is probably the first film where I have said it could have used a little dynamic range compression.Anyhow let's just say my 7 probably could have become an 8+ with some tighter editing and about 20-30 minutes on the cutting room floor.I think people giving this a 9 or 10 and gushing praise are a vocal minority.

1158,alexanderlunenborg,"Beautiful But Not ""Film Noir""",7,22 September 2021,"In essence, its just a pretty average action movie dressed up real pretty. The stroy has little to do with the original. For example, a very traditonal ""good""vs ""bad"" story is in place. This is made so childishly clear by Jared Leto's character Niander Wallace and his pet replicant played by Sylvia Hoeks. These characters are pretty much the stereotypical one-dimensonal bad guys and therefore completely unrelatable.The whole point of the original is that there is no good or bad, its all just a grey mess and were all equally victim of how the world turns. Even Rutger Hauer as the legendary leader of the rebellious Nexus 6's is quite relatable, even though he is a cold-blooded killer. You feel kinda sorry for him and you think: Well, i'd probably react like that in his situation. What am I suppose to do, just roll over and die?If you look up the definition of the ""noir"" genre its says : ""a style or genre of cinematographic film marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace."" And thats exactly what the original is. The remake is anything but that. Its in the end a very generic story about hope and overcoming evil, Its a decent film and certainly pretty, but it has nothing to do with Bladerunner.",Blade Runner 2049
1159,diona_sneezy,Expectations not met,6,7 January 2018,"I heard about this movie that is great, one of the best SF pictures, one of the viewers said it is not so good however got chritised by another that it is not a movie were rambo shots like crazy and kills the bad guys, that it is at a much higher level....Well..... It is another lever but still I got pretty bored during almost 3 hours while at Rambo there is a bigger quantity of suspense and action at least.When I saw Harrison Ford was in the movie even greater reason to watch because indiana Jones was running in my head and the expectations were even higher, but the down side is that Indiana Jones only appears after 2 hours of boredness and only does something for like 20 minutes, 10 of those 20 he is just punching in the face Ryan Gossling, so big disappointment here. The Blade Runner, aka Ryan G has a straight face all the movie and looks like he is about to cry at every minute. No fun, not even a little joke nothing, all is gloomy and dark. The idea is good, modern slavery, people created in the laboratory to be send on spatial colonies but being much stronger they are used as man power to do chores that normal human beings do not want to do anymore. However this created humans that have all the memories implanted in their head, that never they have been children they are like taken out from the matrix, they rebel, because they have feelings they begin to be more human than the humans who come from the birth canal. And it all climax when a woman created in the lab has a baby, thing that should not have been possible, she has a baby with a human. The mother dies at birth , helped by another created human in the lab to give birth. And the baby is consider a miracle because it is the ultimate proof that even though they are created as full grown up people in the laboratory they are still humans they feel like a human they have emotions they think they dream they care, and they are their own masters, like one of the characters says at the end of the movie. We have new versions of humans - Nexus 8 - who are seeking and ""retiring"" older versions who have started to rebel, think and care to much, like really the main reason for which today people still get ""discharged"" , when trying to do good in a society that must be corrupted in order for the right people to thrive in it.So slavery is and has been a crime but as as time passes by, humanity will think of a way to use different means to become more lazy and use others to do their work, i mean it is still happening today and not with lab people but with actually humans, their own kind. The future is like a London day, there is no sun at all throughout the whole movie and sometimes is raining just to make things even more depressing.The ending I mean suits the main character as he never smiled laughed or joked during the movie and barely has 100 lines, speaks also very little.Is rather boring and maybe too philosophical for my sleepy brain but still Harrison Ford has done a greater job in indiana jones.And to make a joke as this movie has none what so ever, is like NEXus 8 or Android 7 destroys Good old Nokia who has been so good to us and helped us on our time of need and now we do not even want to look at the anymore....We are such ingrates. hahahaha.

1161,RNJ97,Walk slower walk slower until they fall asleep,3,11 October 2017,"In the New York Times' anatomy of a scene, director Denis Villeneuve painstakingly narrates the scene where Ryan Gosling's K or Joe is about to find and meet his screen forbear, the original Blade Runner Dekard, played by Harrison Ford. Villeneuve informs us that he reminds Gosling to walk slower, how the garden of giant naked statures of boobs or whatever is designed by some guy, and the sound effect of the buzzing bees and how very careful he selects the music and hence the significance of it for that scene so on and so forth. Without his explanations, me philistine wouldn't be able to enjoy his movie.None of this really matters to me except Gosling sure keeps walking slower and slower the entire movie, which is quite an effective way of putting me to sleep. Thanks to caffeine and the upright cheap seat, I was able to stay half awake through out this 3-hour long snooze fest disaster that is called Blade Runner 2049.In general I am OK or even like Gosling's phlegmatic puppy faced performance. I imagine it is even apt for his character, a meek replicant, android, a non human who can't say no to orders. Ford plays a caricature of his own character whom he played some thirty five years ago. Ford nowadays just plays any characters he used to play with some mirthless smirks and call it a performance or a day. I can't wait to see him play Han Solo in the never ending upcoming Star War Episode XXX.Blade Runner 2049 is pretty much over when it kills off its most potentially interesting character Sapper played by Dave Baustista in the first fifteen minutes of the film. Me waited thirty five years for this. Thanks to Denis Villeneuve, the same director who brought us Arrival (2016)-duh!",Blade Runner 2049

The plot itself is interesting, but everything is just so dragged out for the sake of dragging things out. If you read the reviews, tweets or general comments from people who loved the film their argument is that everyone who thinks it's too long and slow paced are too stupid to follow the plot, or demand constant action. If that was the case I would not have enjoyed ""Interstellar"", but I was absolutely mesmerized by it and the just below 3 hours it lasted went by like it was nothing.I enjoyed the general dark tone and cinematography, but that's pretty much it.About halfway through the movie picks up the pace a bit, not action-wise, but the story starts coming together.

Impossible to tell one character from the next. All the same blank-faced, nonspeaking, emotional retards scene after scene after scene. Everyone looking bored, tired and dozy like they've done too much sedatives. Pretentious, over-inflated themes that everyone is sick to death of. Ultra-predictable moments sold as huge reveals that we've seen 100 times in another 100 films going back 50 years. Incoherent, garbled dialogue mixed so badly you can't hear what they're saying. I couldn't understand 90% of what Jared Leto's said because he speaks in an inaudible whispering rasp with a stuttering tempo. Can't Villeneuve tell him to deliver his lines with more resonance and impact? What's wrong with them? What's the point of playing sound nobody can hear? Especially when you've paid £50 and waited 35 years for it. Men of 12 stone crashing through solid marble walls? Panoramic, aerial vistas of LA in the smog with only Gosling's flying car in shot, no other cars, vehicles, people, movement or activity across the entire city? Phony, lazy, implausible effects. For a short time things looked promising, glowing reviews etc. But now it's evident that the Satanic hand of Hollywood has cursed everything good, everything noble. Star Wars, Alien, Tron, Ghostbusters and now poor old Blade Runner, that magnificent gem of classic sci-fi cinema. Denis Villeneuve lacks impact, bite, ideas, imagination, a pulse and any facial expressions whatsoever. Why does he keep getting hired? His films are just TV-movies, so plain and dull. This one's like a 3-hour long designer kitchen commercial. His involvement on this film was a giant misstep. They should have got someone like Gaspar Noe, Takashi Miike or even Ridley Scott to direct it, someone with a bit of edge.With Blade Runner 2049 Hollywood has once again looted our favourite classics and ruined them, reducing them to the realms of cheap, imagination-free, regurgitated, money- grabbing, formulaic horse-manure. I didn't want to have to ever type this but Blade Runner has now been cast atop that very manure heap, the foil of the origami unicorn just visible above the mountain of dung.Avoid this film, it's not worth your time or money and it will ruin your memories of the strange and brilliant 1982 original.

The 2 hours and 44 minutes went by fairly quickly, which is to say that I was being entertained. Usually when a movie gets to be very long, it's trying to make up for in volume what it lacks in substance (think A.I. and Benjamin Button - both awful AND long). This movie, however, filled the 2.5 hours plus with enjoyable content. That written, it could have, and maybe should have, been shorter. SPOILERS There were several scenes with the lead character interacting with a computer image/hologram of a woman. I recognize that that was important to building sympathy/empathy for the character,but it really didn't work to that effect for me. Regarding the plot, it seemed a bit scattered. Was tough at times to follow who was trying to do what and for what reason. I don't usually like plot dumps, where a character spells out exactly what is going on, but I could have used one or two in this film. I really can't say much more other than it was fairly forgettable and not particularly fantastic. Just kind of ambled along. Not even in the same galaxy as the original.

The film looks and sounds fantastic. My issues are firstly with K's holographic assistant Joi, she features a lot in the film but why? She looks stunning but doesn't bring much to the film, some scenes with her are too long. She is basically a very advanced Siri or Amazon Echo, a lifelike companion but I don't think she is needed that much in the film.This brings me to the main issue and the reason why, I believe, the film maybe hasn't done too well commercially - it's too long! The film needs 15 minutes taken out, some scenes go on way too long without bringing anything more to the film and it feels, by the end, that the film should have finished earlier. There are at least 5 scenes which can be trimmed without spoiling it. On the whole, well worth a watch, some nice cameos, great atmosphere, decent acting but a little too long.",Blade Runner 2049

1174,dasant3,Slow Burning Sequel emphasizes mood and feel over story,7,10 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 pays worthy homage to its parent film with use of similar color palettes and mood inducing music that effectively draws the viewer into this dystopian and somber future LA. Ever dark with incessant precipitation properly sets the tone that the earth seems to be mourning its current fate. Replicants, seemingly devoid of a soul, have so populated the landscape that one must sometimes question, ""Is that dog real?"". I found the world building efforts by set and sound design wonderfully successful. Different places take on unique color tones of black, mustard brown and gray. They represented to me a journey of awareness for our primary protagonist ""K"", the LAPD officer, established early on as a replicant himself, performing the same role as Rick Deckard from the original Blade Runner. However, in his role, he locates an odd, out-of-place, flower that leads to the discovery of replicant bones and a mystery begins to unfold that sets him on this quest. The quest will lead him to begin to question whether or not replicants can, in fact, have souls. And if so, does he.It's a simple plot line. Where the movie may lose people, though, is the pacing it uses to get from point A, to B, to C. Perhaps, there are tangential issues being wrestled with by our main characters. If you've seen Westworld on HBO last year, you may think these issues have been explored. I did. And perhaps, the pacing is intended to demonstrate it's never an easy quest. In fact, we are given examples of what, sometimes, must be lost to gain this insight.I found the sequel worthy to its predecessor. It revisits certain questions the original asked, without tying an obvious bow around them. I liked the imagery, the sound, the characters (and acting). I think Harrison Ford does some of his finest work here. If I were criticize, I'd say choices could have been made for economy's sake to shorten the movie a bit. Some of the methodical and brooding shots of Gossling walking through a set could have been shortened or even eliminated. Sure it builds a picture, but it doesn't have the payoff necessary to justify its place in the film.Still B+ Recommend to any sci-fi, Blade Runner, PKDick fan.

So it can't really stand on its own.In spite being more drama than action-packed, and having a pretty good story, some scenes just didn't add up. The characters' actions seemed to be random and significantly more complicated, instead of doing something more plausible.But, the major impact on my score was the sound and music. While I do remember the pleasant melodies of Vangelis in the first one, here the music was mostly irritating. I don't know if it was the IMAX effect or originally it was written there, but some music pieces were probably performed by a quartet of Tripods from Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds.Same goes to the sound of engines and vehicles, too loud, and used too often instead of making it outstanding and peak of a special scene.I'll now watch the first and then see the 2nd when it is out on DVD or something.

Many people is disappointed by comparing it with the Original Blade Runner. And I can understand that.However bear in mind Blade Runner had a very good plot, very good intrigue and the ending scene was a total climax, one of the best shots ever done in the cinema history. As you go out of Blade Runner (1982), thanks to the ending (and Rutger Hauer actually), you're there like ""oh my god this movie blows!""Blade Runner 2049 goes actually the other way around, the first 2h30 are absolutely great in my opinion. Nothing is granted to the spectator. The visuals are astonishing, the cyberpunk world and ambience is perfectly retranscripted, the noir investigation is brilliant and the way the movie goes forward is extremely clever. The ending of the movie however totally disappoints and leaves an extremely bad taste in the mouth.As the movie ended I was disappointed. My wife told me: ""I don't really know what to think about this movie"". I answered ""I'm not sure either, I'll probably need some extra hours, thinking about the movie, before making a judgement"".And I was right to do so, the disappointing ending is actually necessary to provide the inherent plot of the movie. In its questioning, in questioning human reality, in questioning human society, in questioning the behaviour of humans toward the premade (mis)conceptions the society imposes to the individual, in questioning the mainstream conception about superiorship of human toward replicants (or other human beings), in question how the mainstream conception can effect the perception a person has of himself, this movie is MUUUUUUUUUUUCH superior to Blade Runner (1982).All those questions and sentiments are provided through the entire movie and there is no clear answer provided and, that's maybe what appears to be the weak point of the movie, but actually is the strong point of it to me, *there is no real conclusion*.If you expected indeed a conclusion you'll be disappointed because the conclusion is actually very ""meh... I don't care... Did I watch a 3 hours movie just for that?""But if you don't, and focus through the trip this movie took you with for 3 hours, if you focus on the important elements of this movie, it can be seen as superior to its original.",Blade Runner 2049
1180,guyssocialweb,A dystopian dream to rival the original,10,8 October 2017,"I was only 11 years old when the first BR came out in June of 82 and that was a time when every summer you would have a Harrison Ford blockbuster every summer. I have been waiting for this film for a very long time and IMHO... it did not disappoint. Matter of fact I was on the edge of my seat in most of the file. To me BR is about the desire to be God and the want to marvel as he would at the canvas of creation. This is a film to look deep into and pay attention for the clues. They are not that well hidden but fun to piece together into what the story is about. As for the director Denis Villeneuve, this guy has a wonderful eye for visual art. His other movies including Arrival and Prisoner have been a melodic and phycological masterpiece of the mind that leads you to think outside the box. Villeneuve does justice to BR2049 and continues that avant garde feeling by keeping the tone and the awe inspiring dystopian look of the original along with giving it a 30 year in the future nudge to the look. I write this listening to the Han Zimmer soundtrack and I think only him could capture the essence of Vangelis original score. One other thing... I love dystopian movies. Mad Max, Brazil, 1984 just to name a few. But the closest one I hold to my hear that I would never trust a director to remake would be the 1924 Fritz Lang movie Metropolis. That stopped today. I think Denis Villeneuve would be a qualified person to make that movie.",Blade Runner 2049
1181,heiderer-879-161844,Not for everyone,10,14 October 2017,"This is not a film for the general public. If you are big Star Wars or Transformers fan, a horror junky or even the usual sci fi fan you may get bored or confused early. Alternately if you liked Koyaanisqatsi or Ex Machina this may be for you. You MUST see the first Blade Runner first to set up this world. ( It may also help to have a general sense of the major themes in western philosophy.) You have to pay attention and think through this one. This is for people who are inclined to see films as a legitimate tool to help imagine the future. Not sure if 2049 is the right date, but we are surely headed there.I would not worry about the poor attendance or low box office returns. People will be watching and talking about this film 50 years from now and it is a good idea to see this film in theaters on a big screen while while it is possible. This is an exceptional film, unlike any you have ever seen. A real shock.Alert: I have just seen this film for the second time (in 3D) I suspect that this film has been now shortened in the second week. Perhaps the studio is taking note of comments that the film is too long (not) and cutting sections while it is still in theaters. I hope this is an illusion of some kind.",Blade Runner 2049
1182,greg-27-486698,Worthy of the Original,10,6 October 2017,"I think that judging Blade Runner 2049 simply on comparison with the original is off the mark. The 1982 movie, among my lifetime favorites, needed no sequel. Going in I thought it would be impossible for any sequel to match the blend of romance and suspense that the original gave us. Yet, the key romantic elements in 2049 are just fabulous stuff; warm, real, believable, unique and moving. Remnants of hope and human spirit and love in the midst of dystopian life experience. The movie also didn't cheat us of great suspense. Saying more than that would make me a spoiler, so I won't go there. Blade Runner 2049 draws on the original story and style without being copycat. The visual and auditory experience is no less than stunning. When I watch it again I'll experience it more with eyes closed. The soundtrack is that good. Character development is compelling. The storyline great SciFi! Every acting performance spot on and commendable. Though the movie is long by some standards, I appreciated that as with the original, we weren't rushed through the movie. I wanted to get to know the characters and to watch the story develop, and was not cheated of that experience. I never once checked my watch, but instead was engaged to the very end. Ryan Gosling's performance was outstanding, but no surprise there. The guy's a fabulous actor. Harrison Ford was great too, believable and consistent with his tough yet sensitive 1982 persona. I can't think of a weak link in the cast. Ana de Armas is like, Wow! Sylvia Hoeks and Mackenzie Davis also just amazing! Robin Wright so solid and on point. Jared Leto, outstanding. One could mention the entire cast person by person. Very enjoyable. I look forward to seeing it again, many times, just as with the original.",Blade Runner 2049
1183,carolbrewer,3 Hours of Nothing,1,30 December 2017,"I'm not going to waste anymore time on this film than I did just by watching it. This is a disjointed, unimaginably boring film that is best suited as an advertisement for the original Blade Runner. Not because it reminds you of the original, but because it will make you absolutely crave a good film to get the bad taste out of your mouth.",Blade Runner 2049
1184,helloamazon,A Miracle Has Happened! (For A Hollywood Sequel) - BR 2049 Feels Like A Slow-Paced Art House Movie With A Blockbuster Budget,10,20 October 2017,"To quote Sapper Morton's character in the movie, a miracle has happened.A blockbuster sequel that pays tribute to the original (but not in a slavish way, like eg. Star Wars VII did in my opinion) and to intelligent SF cinema in general.I will keep this review short since there are so many great other reviews available already:First, 2D or 3D? 3D doesn't add much to this movie and some details/sharpness gets lost in dark(er) scenes. One nice scene in 3D is Deckard's first appearance with his gun (as seen in the trailer, no spoiler) - but that's about it. I recommend watching it in 2D with a very good sound system.The bad (minor details):If there's one weaker performance, it's the god-like business magnate Wallace. Jared Leto is overacting, but maybe that's wanted and not his fault when you hear director Denis' casting call and the long monologues attached to Wallace's character in the script.(Side note: Originally, Denis V wanted to cast singer and actor David Bowie for Wallace. He, unfortunately, died before BR 2049 started shooting in 2016).Soundtrack is a little too bombastic/industrial. I personally liked the original Vangelis score better.Now, for the good and great, the miracle:I still give the movie a 10/10, if only for the sheer courage of the studio and director to go ahead and make this sequel.Blade Runner bombed back in 1982 as we all know.Therefore: No spin-offs, almost no merchandise sales (compare that to Star Wars with its huge merchandise machine running over the decades etc.). As a result, there was almost no visibility for Blade Runner among younger audiences as of 2017, except for a cult movie audiences and some movie buffs and SF lovers.That's likely not enough to make a decent return on a $150-200M sequel (the projected budget of BR 2049) over three decades later.It's just sad to see that Transformers 5 probably ends up making more money than BR 2049.To quote Sapper, it's a miracle that Blade Runner 2049 exists the way it exists - slow pacing (on purpose), 163 minutes run time, very few action sequences, R rating.That's why most lovers of the original BR seem to love it (judging from other user reviews).No wonder I wasn't the only one thinking of Stalker (1979) and similar classics.BR 2049 has Tarkovsky and Kubrick's influences written all over it. It is a visually stunning art-house movie with a blockbuster budget.Finally, the CGI very well integrated, the CGI doesn't feel tacky and there are still many miniatures and real sets used. A believable world.In short, a masterpiece for SF cinema - and for (usually weak) Hollywood sequels in particular.Make sure you watch the original (I recommend the 2007 ""Final Cut"") and the three short movies (2022, 2036 and 2048, all available for free online) before you watch BR 2049.This is also a movie that can be seen a second or even a third time - again, much like the original Blade Runner from 1982.PS: Movie lovers should support such visual works of art with some intelligence, these are qualities even rarer today in most of Hollywood's sequels. BladeRunner 2049 proved that a blockbuster miracle with art-house quality visuals is still possible. Otherwise, we as movie consumers will get what we deserve: Fast & Furious 27, Transformers 9... etc.",Blade Runner 2049

Nevertheless, i was enjoying it untill, well, it started to become a little long. There are lots of great visuals and stuff and more stuff but overall there are a lot of things that don't make sense (how does Luv manage to enter the police building like it was her house, why do the replicants leave K alone, etc) and a lot of things that have no answer (like what ever happens to Wallace, etc).

1188,mrgreenluv,Almost a masterpiece,8,8 October 2017,"Overall this was an exceptional movie. And it exceeded my expectations for it in some ways but fell short in other ways.In terms of visual style, I have to say I was stunned by the beauty of the environments and the closeness to the original. Visually this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it truly felt like a Blade Runner movie. I was amazed with what I was seeing on screen.The acting was also excellent all around. I felt like they created characters and gave us the chance to get to know them and the actors did a great job portraying the experience of their characters.The fight scenes were superbly done. I loved how they contrasted the fighting with the normal progression of the movie, it gave everything a nice effect and really helped illustrate the nature of the replicants and how they operate.The only things that I really want to criticize are the plot and the audio. The sounds in this were amazing but they felt out of sync with what was happening on screen at times. Otherwise the sound was great and really enhanced the experience.The plot was a little too light hearted for me. It has a typical Hollywood fluff ending which wasn't befitting of the nightmare that is unfolding before our eyes in this film. And this film is absolutely a nightmare.I hope that if they make another one they go less with a plot and more into the psychology of the world they live in and the fear and loneliness that surround the idea of being alive.",Blade Runner 2049
1189,The_Shawshank_Inception,Is Denis Villeneuve a Replicant?,10,5 October 2017,"What I have just seen in my nearby theater was what I think is one of the greatest films of all time. Denis Villeneuve and his crew have created a film so artistically and visually beautiful that there's no way this movie was made by humans. Roger Deakins has not won an Oscar. Think about that. One of the most renowned cinematographers of all time? Screw him. Well, not anymore. He WILL win an Academy Award for this cinematography. There is no denying that. Villeneuve has made some of the best films of this decade, and this is just another one. Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and Arrival? He is one of the best directors working today. This film is the best he's ever done. This movie is a true masterpiece of cinema. Everything that was cool about Blade Runner was made even better in this Big-Budge sequel. There are many surprises waiting, and trust me, you will be surprised. The visual effects in this film are comparably revolutionary to Terminator 2's.They are spectacular and realistic. The crew held true and payed plenty of homage to the original 1982 classic. But this film is better in every way. Not many people can make a FILM this amazing today. I might see this in theaters 12 more times. IT IS THAT GOOD! I've been waiting for this sequel ever since it was announced, and after the initial press reviews, I was expecting something stunning, but what I experienced was a movie that was so spellbinding and perfect that I cannot help but say that Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best films ever made.",Blade Runner 2049
1190,TrollBerserker,Satisfied but not hyped,9,13 February 2019,"It built a wonderful and fascinating cyberpunk world but not a breaking through from the old movie. The science development in the world is strange and unbalanced. The appearance of replicants rebellion force is so weird, gladly they are not very important in whole movie.",Blade Runner 2049
1191,bleak93,more and better than expected,9,17 January 2018,"I was prepared to be very disappointed and wound up being not disappointed at all. If it was possible to make a sequel that not only measured up, but enhanced and expounded and expanded on the first Blade Runner (and the VISION of Philip K Dick in his novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""), these hollyweird satanists did it.I try to keep spoilers below down to a minimum and still make the points I want to make...Opening scene: My first question; was the Ryan Gosling character human or replicant? That question is answered fairly quickly into it. That was easy. The rest isn't so easy and that is most welcome by many true sci-fi fans including me.Thirty years on from 2019, replicant creation and programming has gone from a slave trade business to a predominantly trans humanistic onslaught. Won't Gates and Kurzweil be happy. No more individualism. No more imagination. The ""Voight Kampf"" test gear used by bounty hunter Deckard in the original is replaced by eyeball scanners the size of a cell phone. I miss the accordian thingy *whatever* that was lol. Of course. Replicants are now diagnosed for aberrations with advanced Neural Linguistic Programming (NLP) debuggers. All the new tech in 2049 ranges from very cool (flying muscle cars from those spinners) to completely evil (the drones and some replicants like Luv).The real story is revealed. Trans humanism, technocracy and AI are subjugating real human life on earth. I mean right now in 2018. What is notably different from the original BR is that free-thinking (and violent) replicants are no longer *banned* from Earth. They are most welcome as long as they can be used by their creator for any nefarious purpose. Replicants are a metaphor for the dead and soulless who walk the earth following their money god into the abyss. May God have mercy on them all.Many reviewers say it drags and/or it's too long. Nonsense. The pauses are the movie! It is meditative. It is quirky. Every time K stares off into space, I wonder what algorithms are running through it's highly advanced AI programming. I guess people forget that ""he"" isn't human. Luv is spectacular. What part of her scenes would they cut out or edit? I can't imagine a one-star BR49 reviewer sitting through an Andrei Tarkovsky movie like Solaris or The Sacrifice, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, or even 2001: A Space Odyssey (around 88 dialogue-free minutes in the movie and Rock Hudson walked out LOL) or ANY given cinematic masterpiece; sci-fi or anything else. Most Matrix ""fans"" love the first one but frown on Reloaded and Revolutions. As the great sci-fi and speculative fiction writer Harlan Ellison said, ""If you make people think they're thinking, they'll love you. But if you really make them think, they'll hate you.""The only clunky scene, in my opinion, is where the one-eyed replicant leader, Freysa, greets K after he was rescued by Mariette and crew. It seemed very cliche with all the ""terrorist"" replicants lurking and then coming out of the shadows. It was good to see McKenzie Davis from Halt and Catch Fire. She looks too good to be a satanist but don't judge a book by it's cover. Freysa has some good lines but the setting was wrong and it seemed contrived.The weather is bleak as hell everywhere not just LA no doubt due to ""chemtrails"" (geoengineering or SAI-Stratospheric Atmosphere Injection; see John Brennan former CIA on YT). What was revealed in the first BR is now painfully obvious to some people but not most people.The ending scene with snowflakes on K's hand etc. Snowflakes are a metaphor for INDIVIDUALITY (no two natural snowflakes are alike) vs the robotic mind-control victims of the world. The types of people who are soulless, carbon copies, clones, robots, with thoughtless group hive mind who are susceptible to social engineering and programming. Memories are implanted by the media (like this movie, well there's a recursive irony) much like ""reality"" is imbued from infancy and childhood and form behavioral patterns in real life. ALL credit to Philip K Dick aka the master for that.""Reality is such that, when you stop believing in it, it doesn't go away."" 
~ Philip K DickAs the Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright of House of Card's no less. A show made by satanists to reveal their methods) says to K about the soul ""you are doing pretty good without one"" meaning most people in real life function without a soul or a connection to God. Some do well, others not so well and it is all the same in the end. It is the parable of the mustard seed in Matthew 13. The robots have no empathy/sympathy for the harm they cause to others much like a Blade Runner has none for those he retires. Lack of sympathy is a trait of psychopathic behavior.The movie benefits from Han's Zimmer's soundtrack; an homage to the original BR soundtrack by Vangelis. It is the conduit to the previous BR and connects the two movies on another more subconscious level.Finally, IMHO, Deckard IS a replicant after all! Here is my reasoning...1. A replicant and human cannot breed. A replicant child was born in BR 2049. Therefore, Deckard is a replicant who breeded with Rachael who was a replicant. In real life, an insect cannot breed with a dog, a bat cannot breed with a turkey, a human cannot breed with a giraffe (I'm sure they've all been tried by now)... it takes similar DNA chromosomes to bear offspring.2. The scene where Freysa tells K to kill Deckard. She lists a number of replicants and Deckard is the first.3. Deckard's first meeting with Rachael is revealed (to me anyway) as an arranged breeding experiment.",Blade Runner 2049

With the news that it was to be revisited, I was initially excited before the doubt started to creep in over the time spent waiting for the release of 2049...I needn't have worried. Fancher, Villeneuve, the cast and crew have put together a stunning return for Blade Runner. Many subtle nods to the original from the soundtrack to the way K directs his drone around, like Deckard maneuvering his way around the photo in the original. It all came together beautifully. The atmosphere of the original is maintained, even out of the city. The lingering uncertainty about the Deckard\Jessica offspring which has such an impact on the way the story un-folds matches the pace of the movie as it moves towards it's climax.Blade Runner is still my all time fave, there's a new number two on the list now.It's just too bad there wasn't a way to work in a 2049 Sean Young.

Entertaining, thought-provoking, deep, and breathtaking visuals are just a few things to describe this film. I will never forget seeing this in theaters. At first I was a little hesitant to see it with the 3 hour running time, but I went anyways, and boy am I glad I did! The cast in this film is excellent. Ryan Gosling gives a compelling lead character in 'K', Harrison Ford reprised his role as Rick Deckard and he was great, Robin Wright is fantastic as K's boss, Jared Leto gives an interesting performance, Ana de Armos as Joi was phenomenal. Everyone did an amazing job! Besides the cast, the story, musical score, and visuals are pure brilliance. While I really like and enjoy the first Blade Runner, I think this film is actually a massive improvement over the first, which rarely happens! The first film, while really good in its own right, slightly falls apart in its last thirty minutes. Whereas, in 2049, it is entertaining and thought-provoking throughout. Also, I would give the first film a solid 8/10, but I give 2049 a perfect score of 10/10. I seriously do not have one flaw with 2049 whatsoever. It's such a shame the film flopped at the box office.

1196,srthelegend,So 35 years of wait is finally over... Was it worth the wait???,10,5 October 2017,"This is my updated review as I feel I did not do the movie justice and I have also increased my score of the movie...
I was one of the lucky ones who got to see an early preview.... And the more that time passes by and the more the story of Blade Runner 2049 sinks in the more the gravity of the story hits me... First of all it really was not what I was expecting... I had watched many trailers and interviews and I feel like I had done quite a successful job in staying away from spoilers.... 
And....
Without spoiling it for anyone else and giving too much away.... Whatever you think you know about the film... well, forget it.... You're way off the mark... 
The best advice I can give though is however dark you think Blade Runner 2049 is.... It's darker than that.... It's much darker than the original... And the original was quite dark.... The cinematography is beautiful... it really is stunning... but the film itself.... did I mention it was dark??.. I think this is amplified (excuse the pun) by the movie's soundtrack... The work of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch was for me... at times.... malevolent... And perhaps if the music wasn't so dark and hostile the movie itself wouldn't come across like that also... But then what do I know?... That's not to say the music is bad... It was for me.... like I said malevolent.... As for the movie itself... Again without giving too much away.... It's a story of loneliness.... A story of wanting nothing more than to be accepted... It's a story of desperate hope and anguish... Wanting for a better life.... Replicants being more human than humans, being more perfect than humans.... but not being human and wanting nothing more than to be human... even for all the faults the human race has and the perfection of the replicant race... Still the desperate hope and anguish of wanting to be human.... Are you keeping up??... And this whole time living in a dystopian world.... where the future of the human race is a lost cause and Mother Earth has never looked so heartbroken.... 
Speaking of heartbreak... again without spoiling the story... be prepared... the whole story is a story of heartbreak and literally at every turn Ryan Gosling is having his heart broken.... whether that be his relationships with others or his life in general... For me Ryan Gosling has a knack of playing the lonely leading role... and he has done this on a few occasions now.... both in the movies - ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"".... which I hope he doesn't end up being typecast in... but saying that... I don't think there is an actor alive today who can play the role of being totally isolated from the rest of the world better than Ryan Gosling.
Blade Runner 2049 did have some nice surprises... which again... I won't spoil... 
In closing.... Ryan Gosling is excellent... It is Harrison Ford's best work for years.... This overall review may sound like I'm being negative about Blade Runner 2049... But I'm not... I'm really not...I should also mention the performances from the female leading acts in the show. Ana de Armas, Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks are all very, very good and each and every one of them. Including all the crew should be proud of such a beautiful sequel. As for where it stands next to the original... I never thought I'd hear myself saying this but I think as years pass by it will stand next to the original Blade Runner quite easily.... It's not the same movie as the original but it is as good as the original in its own right...
I think Ryan Gosling said it best in an interview
The film is incredible... it's.... haunting...
With this in mind a few days have passed now and I am still left with a feeling of being haunted by Blade Runner 2049.... 
So much so that I want to see it again and I will go and see it again... and again... and again....
Just like I did the original...
Blade Runner 2049 ""is"" incredible....
It's...

1198,mdmvrockford,Excellent movie,10,20 January 2018,"This movie underperformed with respect to its budget. I can see why for many reasons. It has a great story, amazing visual (as expected from Roger Deakins) and amazing sound. A ""sequel"" that one could make an argument that bests the original (the original here being ""Blade Runner (The Final Cut)""; N.B. there are at least four different versions of original ""Blade Runner""). But after two viewings of ""BR2049,"" I still feel the first Blade Runner (The Final Cut) is the better movie.Even though I knew the entire story prior to seeing it, this movies kept my interest for entire running time 2 hours 44 minutes. A great story and reference sound and visual blu ray. I bought the regular blu ray. If one likes the original ""Blade Runner (The Final Cut)"" then one will very likely love this movie. I would highly recommend first watching ""Blade Runner (The Final Cut)"". And if you enjoy it then proceed later to ""Blade Runner 2049"" and also by that time the rental should be cheaper. I consider ""Blade Runner (The Final Cut)"" among my ten best movies any genre.Denis Villeneuve (director of ""Blade Runner 2049"") has directed some other excellent good movies (in no particular order): ""Enemy,"" ""Prisoners,"" ""Sicario,"" and ""Arrival.""",Blade Runner 2049
1199,yuuki-23947,Average,6,18 March 2018,"There's a few cool scenes (like the sex one) but overall the movie isn't that great. The actions scenes feel unnecessary and are not very good, the plot is a bit wonky, the bad guys are Hollywood clichés, etc. The visuals are good but nothing extraordinary either. Overall this fits well with Denis Villeneuve's downward trajectory towards cookie-cutter Hollywood block busters.",Blade Runner 2049
1200,feofanova,Betrays the essential points of the original story,3,17 October 2017,"From an isolated point of view, this film is an impressive piece of science fiction dystopia. The story is reasonably entertaining/dramatic, the mystery is well-paced - and above all the cinematography is so well done that you sense that every frame was considered very carefully by people who really loved the original film.But if you were a fan of the original novel by Philip K. Dick or if you simply saw - and loved - the 1982 film, you will - like me - end up with the feeling that this film seriously an unforgivably betrays its the crucial points of its predecessor.In ""Blade Runner"" (1982), the point was that replicants could be just as good (or evil) as humans, but that their emotions, memories, and ultimately lives, could be considered just as 'worthy' as those of human beings. The Roy Batty character that made the first film so interesting made this entirely clear in one of the closing scenes of the 1982 film.In ""2049"", the ethical aspects of what constitutes proper lives and emotions is pushed in the background. The new generation of replicants are basically human wannabes, whose biggest dream is to be able to give birth just like humans... why is this even important? It's a purely biological qualification criterium rather than an ethical one. This is DEEPLY provoking - if not outright stupid.We are also presented with a central mystery/story that tries to unveil family relations. Compared to the ethical aspects of the original story, this is not interesting at all.To tell the truth, I am writing this the day after I saw the film. Yesterday I was really happy with what I saw. But once I started thinking about what made the original story so great, I quickly realised that new film ultimately betrays the most important messages of the first film. And that is unnforgivable.",Blade Runner 2049
1201,plosker,Amazing follow up to original,10,27 June 2018,Blade Runner 2049 is so much better than the original that the 1st one now serves as an intro to Blade Runner world with 2049 being movie that really allows you to dive deep into story line. 2049 pays homage to the original in style but is far better at examining the question of what it manes to be human.

It is insultingly dim and makes me want to fight for the cause of some sort of ""money-return"" policy for cinemas. I simply don't think cinemas should have a blank check for taking people's money for such atrocities. The only way I'd keep any respect for Mr. Villeneuve is if he asked for this movie to be ascribed to Adam Smith. It doesn't get much dumber than this. I would have no problems saying that Phantom Menace does more justice to Star Wars than this movie does to the original Blade Runner. It is as if screenwriter never read anything in his life. I'm happy to see Tyler Perry makes more money than this shame. Mr. Villeneuve, you should be ashamed of yourself.

I knew it would be long and be slow paced. But, in total honesty, I was gleefully surprised for having a good time watching the whole thing, I did not get bored at all... I watched by myself, having some wine... some snacks...I believe that most of the disappointed viewers expected something to be solved, like in an Avengers movie or at least something close to it, that pays off the long ride (to be fair, there was a conclusion). To me the ending was satisfying. I like character driven films, and this one is very much about the characters.It is a gorgeous film. Oh boy, I wish I had seen it in the theaters... every shot is stunning. That mesmerizes me and entertains me for the most part. On top of that, the story caught me and I cared about it. It was kind of heart wrenching sometimes. It also has some great dark humor moments.I really think it's a good sci-fi film that is worth watching.",Blade Runner 2049

1206,pmpodhorzer,Like a Marvel sequel at 1/10th of the speed,4,8 October 2017,"I'm sorry, but ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a ponderous bore. Deakins' photography is marvelous but the dystopian landscape overstays its welcome. It is oppressive, sad, and nihilistic. There is a reason why ""The Orville"", the new Star Trek-in-everything-but-name series by Seth McFarlane is well received by tired viewers: the sense of wonder needs at least the possibility of optimism.All the pensive decades of Ryan Gosling does not mean depth. The only interesting and relevant part, and the only shot at feelings, come from a virtual AI made to replace real human contact. The bridge between virtual and real is the standout scene of the film, and it is disconnected from the grim proceedings.Why do mainstream critics herald such nightmarish work as a near-masterpiece?

How can this movie not be the best of 2017.",Blade Runner 2049
1211,HaydnEngel,Haydn Engel Reviews,8,7 May 2020,"What happens when you pump millions into a film that will not make it back in theatres. The obvious answer is that you market it as something it is not. This is a standard practice in cinema, and it does nothing but exploit viewers and upend the general public's views of a particular film. Which destroys the ability of artistic directors to follow their vision, and it has always made me wonder if it would be at all possible to have two versions of a film in theatres at the same time. You could have a studio cut of the movie in those 64 screen multiplexes and in the indie theatres, where they serve spiced tea and apples behind the counter, you could have a director's cut because at the moment this ploy of marketing an arthouse flick as an action movie is doing no one any favours.DE: The directing is superb, though that has become a standard for Villeneuve. However, unlike his other films, this one draws on its shots for far too long and you could certainly feel like the editor could have stepped in a cut a good 10 minutes of this film and still leave that lingering desolation feeling. It almost feels like Villeneuve was trying to mimic Stalker in his approach, but unlike Stalker, the lingering shots feel inauthentic as in Stalker we are meant to be contemplating existence, religion, purpose, but in 2049 we are sitting at the heart of a mystery that feels like we are not trying to solve.W: The dialogue is decent, yet a little clunky and on the nose. And sadly that is the best part of it. Though I am not shocked Hampton Fancher, the man who penned the original script is back, however in the subsequent 25 years he has written nothing of note, so obviously the studio brings in the standard scriptwriter in the guise of Michael Green, who did pen Logan but also penned Alien: Covenant and the much-maligned Green Lantern. This combination leaves us with a film that barely has a plot and does not delve into anything of note. However, it does likely explain why Villeneuve structured the film the way he did and why there are so many drawn-out shots.C: This is so beautifully shot that it should be taught in schools and, sadly, this film was Deakins's first Oscar out of 13 noms, though his second would come with the gorgeous 1917. His use of the camera and understanding of a shot is fantastic, and if one sees the rest of his works, they can see a shift in style for this film, and while those long lingering shots may be a pain for the storyteller visually, they are perfect representations of what you are trying to get across. The mood and notion are there in every frame. The angles and shadows that are being cast on Gosling throughout the film speak volumes. The special effects, while excellent, do not feel genre-defining or like 25 years have passed since the original.A: Ford cannot act at a level beyond a 6, and that is fine. He is there because he has to be. Gosling's muted touch was decent enough though I worry he is going to get typecast as wooden if he keeps on the path he currently is on. Sylvia Hoeks, one would assume was hired for her visual aesthetic rather than her ability to emote, which if this was Tarrantino flick, I think she would have worked. But in this nuanced, subtle drawn-out film her character comes off cartoonish.
I was incredibly impressed with Ana de Armas and found her performance soulful yet understated. The mechanical I am saying what I suppose to yet am still a creature with almost a concept of feelings really elevates Goslings numbed performance.S: I would have scored this higher if I had not seen Arrival, whereas the industrial style sound design should have been more engaging. I could not help feeling they were reusing it. Of course, the sounds were meant to be jarring given all the silence we were fed, but ultimately it feels like that opening sequence in the remake of Funny Games, it is not shocking or grating in the sense the creator wants, but more in the sense, please turn down the TV those noises are starting to give me a headache.PD: The PD in this film was quite good, the sets feel real and lived in. Especially the opening sequence. Rebuilding on a franchise that is famous for its visual effects and the PD is not easy, but they were able to meet a standard that has been heralded for decades. Dennis Gassner did well here as is expected. He has almost always been brought in when you need a world that feels distant, yet somehow still retains elements of the one we live in. See his work in the Truman Show, Big Fish and 1917 for this.BA: Well done throughout, especially Leto's character, though I will say the only real negative was Wright's outfit. What is this 2049 and she is channelling the 50's or was she literally a copy of the police chief from Futurama? Also, Ford's entire presence was uninspired.",Blade Runner 2049

I only made it halfway through, to where the first ""twist"" was revealed. I, and probably every other viewer, had already figured this out about 10 minutes in. I couldn't take any more of the boring, pretentious script, and slow scenes punctuated with overly dramatic music.This film depicts humans as responsible for destroying the planet, and yet they are also considered ""better"" than the robots, which should be hunted down, even if they are just living their life and not harming anyone? And why aren't the humans smart enough to make robots that won't go rogue? It makes no logical sense, and it's hard to understand the robot obsession with human-style birth as being the ultimate form of creation, when humans are depicted so badly.I read online what happens in the rest of the movie, and it doesn't get any better.

Visually stunning, particularly the AI girlfriend though the whole film seems obsessed with naked ladies for no good reason. The sound track is heavily based on the original but tries too hard to match Vangelis and fails, heavy handed, music overpowers speech and the sound fails to reflect the action. Story is an interesting development of the original but could easily have been told in a 2 hr film and the blatant setups of more sequels are annoying, and as for the leading man, Gosling just spends the whole film being a smug and self satisfied Ryan Gosling.

1218,pa631,"A disappointment, to be sure...",6,30 October 2017,"An unnecessarily long movie. A fact which would have probably passed me by if it was any good. The plot was diabolical. Sci-fi movies NEED a believable plot. Movies about paranormal horror, or real-life movies are allowed to break that premise, but all good sci-fi is based on a BELIEVABLE story. Amazingly sophisticated androids – believable. Used as slaves – believable. They rebelled – believable. A task force was assembled to eliminate them – believable. All that was B.R.2019. ""Plot of B.R.2049"" - simply unrealistic! Now that we have established you need to put your brain to one side lets carry on the evaluation. The acting was sufficient. I think Gosling was good. The scenery & effects were very good. The atmosphere was faithfully represented. But there is only so long these things can keep you fixed to your seat. And 3 hours is well past that mark. The last fight is, indeed very good. But your interest in the characters in minimal and you are fairly tired by then.Finally I think they have used ""infrasounds"". Those inaudible sounds they use in horror movies to unnerve the viewer. And the audible bits were too loud and of such low frequency the whole auditorium was vibrating. Frankly painful.Overall I would say it got right: scenery, effects, atmosphere. It got wrong: plot, length, noises. Which gets it 6/10. A disappointment, to be sure!",Blade Runner 2049
1219,plexonics,Run as fast as you can away from BladeRunner 2049,1,15 October 2017,Bladerunner 2049 is a pale predecessor of the original. While it attempted to draw from the dark ambiance of the original it fails at anything but a sad inept copy. The two female leads were clearly supposed to remind us of Daryll Hanah and Sean Young but the dialog and plot lacked to blend these bits into a story. The flat affect Ryan Gosling has throughout the first 2 hours was painful to watch. From the moment they announce a a missing son of a replicant you know it must be Gosling but we suffer through and hour of pointless plodding dialog and story line. I expected much more from this movie. It was dull and unoriginal. RUN AWAY,Blade Runner 2049
1220,darksideofthespoon-622-36121,"Sadly, it left no lasting impression on me",4,12 October 2017,"Out of some masochistic, morbid curiosity, I was suckered into watching this on the big screen. Suckered by the 'rave' reviews, trailers and opinions of associates. For years, I mean years, I never, ever wanted a sequel. I never felt Blade Runner needed answers. If the movie seemed too ambiguous, than maybe, just maybe, that was its intention. Try reading the book. It's the same. What is Deckard? Phillip K. Dick never told us. The whole point to the story was to question what makes us human.2049's attempt in answering this question, to me, robbed itself of what made the first movie, so good.I did not walk into this movie expecting not to like it however. I put all my bias aside, and watched it with an open mind, a positive attitude, full of hope and wonder.For me, the movie seemed too clean, too digitised, almost sanitised of the rich, tangible atmosphere that made the first movie so real.I never really felt for K. Ryan Gosling was, well...Ryan Gosling. Its obviously just me, but his acting does nothing to make me care for this character. Harrison Ford's burnt out, old version of Deckard, also did nothing for me. Jared Leto was as hollow and pretentious as expected. Phillip K. Dick never followed up on his book, because everything you needed to know, and the point of the story, was right there inside.For all its details, 2049's execution left me uninspired, unmoved and care-free.Even the visuals never grabbed me. As stylised as they tried so hard to be, they did not detract from how I was left feeling, cold and empty.K's virtual girlfriend, to me, epitomised the whole film. Empty, detached and without heart or soul.I watched Blade Runner again on Blu-ray, just to make me feel better. I still get a lump in my throat at Roy Batty's dying words. And I still feel for Deckard and Rachel when they fall in love. Vangelis sounds as fresh today as ever. And the street scenes, in all their colourful, wet and grimy glory, sell to me, what the future is very much looking like being.None of those emotions crossed over into the sequel, for me anyway.",Blade Runner 2049

1225,esparcadia,Still exciting and still waiting for more,9,28 April 2019,"Blade Runner is a seminal ageless work of art. Its languishing slowness and quiet allow time for viewers to make connections and reflect on ageless themes...though for most it took several viewings. So what about BR 2049? Does it compare favorably to the first? Yes yes yes. We are treated to the mystery of another Deckard - is he fully human or a replicant? By 2049 we find out (we think) that he is and so is his son agent K or Joe...or maybe not? Only Eldon Tyrell knows and A ""son"" kills him in direct contrast to Joe who sacrifices himself to the cause and Deckard his dad. This film just like its precursor must be seen several times or more to even attempt an understanding. As an adaptive work from its source by P. Dick, Villeneuve captures the post apocalyptic malaise far better than even Scott. The characters and technology fascinate. The character of Luv - the monomaniacal slave to Wallace - has to be one of the most evil in film history. Bravo to Luv's monstrous echoing of Batty's sincere attempt at humanity. But then again Niander Wallace is human in name only. BR 2049 is a grand glorious film with only a few missteps along the way...

Had I fallen through the looking glass. Reality check: others had the same opinion. It was long, it felt long, and it was so slow. I had no trouble following the plot, but the pacing was like Waiting for Godot - without the humour. At least half an hour could have been edited out. Perhaps editors feel that a lot of money has been spent on CGI/special effects so they need to be kept in. No.
Spoiler (kind of): If the child is a human/replicant cross, the question of Deckard's being human is moot - unless Rachel decided to experiment.

1227,black_eyes_master,Watching Vangelis concert with few faces on screen !,2,5 February 2018,"I wish they dont ruin any more nostalgic movies as they did ""Star wars"" and ""Blade runner"" ! The 1982 Blade runner was better in all ways better than 2049 version and consider the fact that now doing special effect is so much easier.
Story was good / Music was awfully bad and not related to movie / so much of movie time was showing face of a character without any dialog and bore you to death because you feel this scene doesn't need that much delay to talk and you see those parts which the character want to say a very important or deep buried secret and they say it like you want to start conversation with stranger in a bar ...
It seems they wanted to mix ""Odyssey 2000"" with some philosophy of angels and creation stories and stuff ( in some dialog randomly came up ) made the movie a story with hidden secrets but it s with big disaster gaps like ""the main enemy of Rick Deckard is alive (owner of company) who can send rockets from sky on their heads why he and the daughter feel they are safe ?? just because Ryan Gosling say so ? Or how that little number of people even if all armed , could destroy the enemy with those strong army in that Fortress ? Rick Deckard tell them how to hack system or how to replicate memory and make another copy of files and etc ... was he ""Mr. Robot"" or something ?? In movie they said after blackout everything changed and old datas was lost so suddenly Rick Deckard became master of new system and a hacker and who did all that ? and so many other gaps . Somehow the movie became like one of those Bollywood movies which in them suddenly out of blue they come up with ""of you are not brother and sisters , there was a storm and we found you so you think you are our son"" and in this movie it goes like ""ok these are not your memories but it was necessary for movie to be interesting that you think they are yours so deal with it"" . 
So I believe those who made rank of this movie 8.2 did this because they were fan of actors or the novel ... or it got the rank with other methods.

There was very little of it, and when it did take place, it was very dull and uninspiring, as was the whole movie. 5) Decent acting.

A wasted effort here. 2) Loud noises instead of music. 3) Long episodes of complete silence, a lot of them! 4) Lame villains 5) Nudity.In the end, it was very hard to fight with my body, which desperately wanted to fall asleep!

1229,orobuciuks,Shouldn't have watched it (light spoilers),5,28 November 2019,"The only good thing is CGI.That says a lot. I don't want to get into the details too much, but this is what bothered me:1. The atmosphere. It was built horribly. Nothing that original Blade Runner did stayed in this one. The world is huge. But it isn't beautiful, it isn't real - reminds me of the world of Tron. We don't see any actual life in it, just a backdrop for a carppy plot, when Blade Runner's world was a aprt of the plot. Sound, light design is disgustingly bad. I mean, why even bother if you won't try at least reach the level of the original one.2. This is a weird one, but I was amazed with the this specific detail in Blade Runner - Replicants eyes have this ""glow"". It's subtle enough that noticing it feels like an achievement. This movie - threw the detail out of the window. You can try justifying it by saying that new Replicants have a different kind of eye. However, even Nexus 8 (still built under Tyrell) doesn't have that ""GLOW"".3. Oh, the plot. The plot. The plot! It's bad, it's really really bad. But writing about it is too much work and I don't have enough energy to complain about it. But I do have enough energy to complain about us, the audience, being dumbed down. Are we dumb? Are You dumb? Am I dumb? I believe not. Then why, for God's sake, why does this movie think we are stupid? They shove plot points so hard, like we didn't understand them the first time we saw them - we don't need the whole sequel telling us the information we got earlier, especially, when it's noticable and presented as an important info. OH, and also - the main idea is shoved down our throats. It isn't any different than the one of original Blade Runner, but here it is presented so obviously and so badly (holding our hands hrough every step of the way and not letting us come up with it on our OWN).I dislike this movie.

I was extremely excited to see this movie because it has possibly the best director working right now in Denis Villeneuve. Right from the opening shot I knew that I was in for something special. Blade Runner 2049 is the reason I love to go to the movies. This film has pretty much everything that you could ask for. Mind blowing visuals, beautiful storytelling, phenomenal acting, and a sense of surprise. Ryan Gosling is absolutely incredible as our protagonist Officer K, and he plays the character extremely well. Denis Villeneuve also continues to prove why he is the best director working at the moment. Every shot in this movie is stunning and he knows how to direct actors. Roger Deacons cinematography in this movie is some of the best that I have ever seen. If he does not finally win an awards for his work in this movie then the Oscars must hold a grudge against him. Lets talk about most people's biggest flaw with this movie. I have heard many people state that they believed it was to long. I could not disagree more. Every scene in this movie is there for a purpose and is used to help push the story further. If you took away any scene in my opinion than it would lose some of it's beauty and you would miss some of the stunning shots this film has to offer. I never once in this movie was bored and after it was all over felt that it went by pretty fast. Blade Runner 2049 not only matches the brilliance of the original(which is one of my favorites of all time) it actually some how manages to surpass it and expands on the themes of what it means to be human and is emotionally satisfying as it. Please do yourself a favor and go support this movie because it is absolutely stunning and has not been performing well so far. You will not regret it!",Blade Runner 2049
1232,astext,Somewhat pointless,3,17 January 2018,"Can't work out what the point of this film is. It rambles around, getting itself lost, for the most, in the somewhat bland and underwhelming scenery. As for Ryan Gosling, all I can say is, a lump of wood would have been more expressive. Is it a thing that replicants have little or no emotion? If so, job well done, but of couyrse, that isn't true at all when finally, 50 minutes before the end, the Deckard character appears. Have to say, Ford made the movie, he is obviously into the part and made the most of his limited screen time. I was completely uninterested in the tired 'find my family' obsession that so many films have used before. One of my pet hates is ridiculous hairstyles for male actors. In The Force Awakens, Ford as Han Solo has a very ridiculous bouffant (how come he agreed to let that happen?) that makes him look silly. So happily in BR2049, he's got a good haircut, and he looks the part.Did not enjoy the soundtrack either. The big pad sweep sound that denotes coming into view of a breathtaking panorama, so effective in the original, is here flogged to death and used for any kind of scene intro, thus negating any thrill the viewer has from this signature musical association.I'm sure I shall glean a little more from it when I rewatch it.",Blade Runner 2049
1233,eksapsy,It made me feel like it was a poor adaptation,6,3 June 2018,"Let me clarify that I've never watched the prequel. 
Although, this movie made me feel like ... there was so much potential. I sensed that it could have been done so much better than this.The movie, well, was OK. Not something significant but not too bad either. But I felt so much that the direction and plot of this movie were so undeveloped that I had to write this review.The photographic material and the idea of the movie's scenery is absolutely stunning. But I also feel like there could have been done so much more on this aspect as well. It's like they gave a little bit of everything but nothing was special ... except the photography a great little bit.The whole experience felt emotionless and too calm. I'm not from the guys that love Action so much that want it everywhere. But this movie was just ... too desaturated. I mean ... go watch Wall-E ... it has far more emotion than this movie and the whole story is based around a Robot which can't even speak on a Dessert land with nothing around him. And the start of Wall-E was far more emotional and saturated and it was the part I loved, there wasn't any action in that! It just had emotional saturation.
 
The ending all it had me say was ""Huh, totally expected that ... So what? Where's the emotion?"". 
All I just have to say for this movie is: 
Could have been so much better, I felt so much the potential and I'm going crazy that the chance of this being something good was lost. It was just OK.",Blade Runner 2049
1234,chuckedoll,Dennis Villeneuve doesn't believe in the cutting room floor,10,7 October 2017,"This is a decent film, with a masterpiece dying to get out. Much like the original, it is a truly breathtaking visual experience. Also, there's plenty of scenes chock full of tense moments with excellent acting and dialogue. Not only, the story cleverly avoids many pitfalls both as a sequel and as genre film. Every problem with this film can be traced to it's excruciatingly bloated runtime. Scenes go on, sometimes for an almost comical length. Which scenes? Every scene. I'm not exaggerating when I say literally every moment is stretched beyond capacity. The original is a slow film as well, but uses it to its advantage to build its incredibly impressive world and doesn't overstay it's welcome. It's great to take in the visuals, but with an hour left, I found my mind wandering away from the mostly compelling story. A more minor problem is a holographic character, who Ryan Gosling's character becomes romantically involved with. She's nearly pointless, other than to hear Gosling's perspective on the film's events, yet we're subjected to large chunks of the movie dedicated to it. But once again, I must wonder if this subplot would have worked better if it weren't so long. The story is serviceable and its execution is near-superb. It's too bad Dennis Villeneuve doesn't believe in leaving anything to the imagination, or we truly might have had a masterpiece on our hands.",Blade Runner 2049
1235,zenarcher-02244,Missing the humanity of the original classic.,6,3 February 2018,"Very average, very bloated, run of the mill sci-fi actioner.
Too many one-dimensional characters (The Joker & his ""Feminator""), stereotypes beamed in from the sci-fi ""Abrams-verse"", that corporate Hollywood churns out these days.
The original still looks amazing and futuristic, this one, not so much. Very bland world, only when they directly copy from the original does it look even remotely interesting.
Harrison Ford continues his retirement tour of his previous films. He's Harrison Ford, so that's good enough, but watching this adds nothing to the character of Deckard. He's simply used as a clumsy plot device.
Ryan Gosling is fine as the detective ""in over his head"", the standard noir character Ford played in the original. He deserved to be in a better film.
There are some cameos that add nothing except to the bloated runtime. The other main characters are pretty cardboard, none of the subtlety & ambiguity of the original.Not as awful as the corporate ""disney-fied"" dross that is modern sci-fi, but still a missed opportunity and not a patch on the classic original. Instantly forgettable.",Blade Runner 2049
1236,davidrefaeli,How not to make a sequel: 101,1,17 October 2017,"The original Blade-Runner was a masterpiece. Based on a cult science fiction novel (""Do androids dream of electrical sheep"" - by Philip K. Dick), it explored the theme of what does it mean to be human? It had an amazing film-noir like plot, rich with subtle details that don't cry for attention, elegantly crafted scenes, and possibly the best soundtrack in film history (originally composed by Vangelis) - a soundtrack so good you were not completely sure if it's a good movie with some background music, or good music with some background plot. As you were not completely sure about anything in that movie - who were the good guys and who were the bad guys? Who was more human - humans or replicants? Were Blade-Runners replicants or not? (""You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours? Did you ever take that test yourself?"") It was an implicit film, rich with symbolism, that always made you doubt and question.Its sequel might try to pick up the same story-line and ""universe"", but it completely fails to give any substance of its own. It doesn't make you wonder for a second. There are no doubts as to who are the good guys, and who are bad. The good are obviously good (despite the opening scene), and the bad are ridiculously bad. It is clear. There is no subtlety. It is painfully explicit. As one character put it (in an oh so Donald- Trump like way): ""I am the best"" - A line unnecessarily shouting the obvious (yet quite unconvincing) relations between her and the main character. While the original film plot was tightly driven by obvious clear necessity (replicants need to survive), I don't think there's even one scene in the sequel that could not be replaced by another - a mark of an aimless story-line, that is anything but elegant. The original Blade-Runner wasn't fast paced, it took it time, letting the story sink - but the sequel is just painfully and unnecessarily slow. The original movie had soul. It had a distinct and compelling atmosphere. It was crafted by artists with vision who fought to materialize that vision.Its sequel, despite being more shiny, is less than a replicant.",Blade Runner 2049

I love the story, I think it's well paced. I love the acting, only thought Jared Leto's character could have made a bigger impact. The costumes, visuals and cinematography were mind blowing and even people who didn't like the overall film will agree that it was a stunning and beautiful movie to experience, at least visually.

The Director Villeneuve is a pro and truly makes art as is the case with this film. It feels carefully made and I feel it honours the original but still stands on it's own. I wouldn't want it to have too big of an impact on the original story and it doesn't, it fits in well and has just the right amount of connection to the original.",Blade Runner 2049
1241,prsarchangel,Superb...,10,18 October 2017,"Simply put, if you have not seen the original, it may be a bit confusing. I recommend seeing the ""Final Director's Cut"" of the original Blade Runner before viewing this movie.Having said that, at first I was confused thinking I had it all figured out very early in the movie. Quite frankly I was angry. Then all the loose ends made sense. Reflecting back through the entire movie and the original, this was probably the best sequel I have ever seen in my 42 years of life. I understand now why Blade Runner 2049 had a slow start in theaters - today's audiences expect plots to be spoon-fed to them. I encourage any sci-fi lover to really sit back and take every moment of this film.My hats off to everyone, cast and crew, for making an astounding movie, staying true to canon, making a very cerebral, and most thought-provoking sequel that will certainly please old and new generations.",Blade Runner 2049
1242,zfoxer,Will bio-engineered humans take over the future?,9,17 April 2018,"This is the sequel to a cult classic of the early '80s. It is the next phase of a dystopia that was created on earth due to the depletion of natural resources. Bio-engineered humans developed to a level where they can now reproduce themselves, instead of just providing slave labour. What established Blade Runner among hard core fans is the artistic perspective this dystopia is based upon. It creates vivid and mixed human responses including fear for the future, sadness for the current quality of life and short-term hope, according to the technological advancements like the flying cars or the ability to enable the space travel.The main evil character is Wallace (played by Jared Leto), a man that tries to re-enable the ability of replicants to reproduce themselves just like normal human beings. The actor is very successful in his role due to the devotion he showed. His words contain poetic expressions for communicating the views about replicants and their purpose, to the audience. This is a peak moment for the story since this psychic person is a fundamental aspect of the story. While trying to be more realistic, he didn't protect himself from exaggerations though. He blinded himself for a short period of time just to get a better understanding of his role. This is a false reaction since the main purpose of an actor is to emulate a different personality, not to try becoming one. He has no real experience in this state (as a blind man), so he has more chances to behave inconsistently. The basic weakness of this movie is the wooden way the actors play their parts. This can give the reason of the low financial earnings during the first availability to the public. Replicants are not robots, they are humans. There is no reason for them not to behave like typical human beings, showing feelings and vivid behaviour (bear in mind the first Blade Runner). The mechanical way the actors portray their roles (like 'K'), leaves the audience in a state where they cannot connect to the protagonists by observing their character development. For example, 'K' is a completely different character from the female hologram which is coded to show vivid human behaviour. They don't breathe the same way and this looks non-functional to the audience.The complexity of the script and the long running time are not show-stopper factors. There are many successful movies that approach the 3-hour timestamp and are complex as well. The viewers don't get bored due to the duration, but they do so when there is no connection to the main characters. The so-called slow pace (have you seen European independent movies?) is not show-stopper either. It can be considered as part of the art. It leaves time to the viewer to assimilate the environment and become one with that.",Blade Runner 2049

I kind of felt it was going the direction of so many action films.. To my surprise, it quickly moves into hallowed Sci Fi territory with stunning cinematography and sound. The tech and imagination of the future is so gritty, yet felt just right compared to the original. The reason for my title is that this is a long film. While almost wholly satisfying, it takes a while to get there.. The longer I'm away from the film, the more I appreciate it, because it is setting up everything for the plot. and possibly a sequel.

1245,lady_hotaru,A very good sequel to a classic,9,7 October 2017,"I am a big fan of Blade Runner and I was excited to see BR2049 but I didn't come into this sequel with too many high expectations, fearing to be let down. I love Denis Villeneuve's work with a passion and when I saw Arrival last year, I was very confident in what he could do with sci-fi. I must admit that from the first frame of BR2049, I was sold. The few callbacks to the original movie you can catch here and here were magnificent. The cinematography is absolutely insane. I saw it in IMAX and it was one of the most breathtaking visuals I've seen in a very long time. The lighting, the set designs, they all brought me back to the feelings I have when I watch the first movie. I've read that Villeneuve wanted most of the props and locations to feel real and thank god he did. Not only Roger Deakins's work is going to earn him a well deserved Oscar, he teams up perfectly with Villeneuve's style and they make magic together. As for the music, I like that it stands on its own, I didn't want them to copy the Vangelis score too much and they do just enough references. I think Ryan Gosling was the perfect leading man for K. Even when he must be cold and serious, I feel that he still keeps his charm and magnetism intact. Ana De Armas was a pleasant surprise, bringing a bit of sensitivity as Joi. I also liked the Luv character, played by Sylvia Hoeks, and Dave Bautista. And let's not forget Harrison Ford, who did a pretty good job playing Deckhard again. You must go into this movie as an experience, not watching a big blockbuster with big explosions all the time. You must know the first story to really enjoy it but you must also not compare it too much. It's a contemplative journey through dark cities, snow and ashy deserts. It's a movie that raises many questions but doesn't give all the answers. Just like the original, it's not perfect. I thought it was way too long and some scenes almost made me laugh because they were a bit ridiculous and predictable. But in the end, I strongly feel that Villeneuve won his bet and he proved without a doubt that he's one of the best directors of the last 20 years.",Blade Runner 2049

In fact, in my opinion, it rates right up there with Dune, Conan The Destroyer and, Krull which were three of the worst movies I have ever seen!

Also, the nearly three hour run time was off putting. But I put those fears aside and went into this film hoping for the best but fearing the worst. Thankfully, this film is amazing.Let me say If you enjoyed the first film, then I believe you will enjoy this one. However, if you didn't like the original, then I highly doubt you will enjoy this one. Because this film was made by a fan for fans and wow does it deliver. Every shot in this film essential nothing about this film is filler. It builds up at a nice pace with interesting characters and cinematography. The directing in this film was superb and I really hope Denis Villeneuve wins an Oscar for Best Director because he deserves it.It's a must see film of 2017 and I would highly recommend this film to everyone. Go see it!But I have one little nitpick and it's kind of a pet peeve of mine and that's Sean Young's Rachael character from the original film. I'm not a huge fan of CGI in the first place and she's made to look as young as she did in the original film. My problem with that is they have used a younger actress body and used CGI to put her face on whoever was playing the body of Rachel. The CGI tracking was a bit off so the face felt a little unnatural at times for me and it took me out of the film for a second. It's a nitpick I know, but I feel it should be mentioned.",Blade Runner 2049
1248,chrisecasey,Gosling spares no prisoners and then follows a lead re his origins,3,10 October 2017,"Taken at face value, this showcase of Gosling's acting might be construed as strange, to say the least. But he really can scream like a Banshee. Say Ryan, if you're reading this would you consider the role of Jason Numbers in my novel Crazy Train that just has to be made into a movie, just has to. Numbers is a real estate agent by day, a cold blooded henchman, named the Banshee at night. And true to his name, he does scream like a Banshee before putting the dinner knife into probation officer, Tank Holdern's side at Vanessa Carlton's sweet seventeen party. Say, Blade Runner has a similar scene, Ryan's char getting a knife to the side. Maybe great minds do think alike... So, the wounds from the cyborg-like assassin's non-dinner knife - in fact, its a switch blade - are what kills Ryan's char. I don't mind spoiling other people's story's, not my own however. Ha, ha, ha. But this guy's life hasn't been a total dud, he sees a hologram of Elvis Presley singing one of his many spirituals - talk about a bucket list. What is it about Presley that makes people believe he's just another guy who could sing rockabilly. I'm of the opine that, like most artists he never felt he quite belonged, and his ballads are pretty good because of it. To it's credit, Blade Runner dialogue is exquisite in places, taking English to a level only Shakespeare could have devised. The villain couldn't be more cold-hearted and downright scary. I wished that the story had ended with the villain's death, not the Blade Runner's. Don't ask me why, the writer wanted it to end this way. Some people hate their jobs, I guess. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend seeing this installment. Except for the dialogue in places, a cool twist on who the Blade Runner could have possibly been, and a very well done sex scene with the computer in a real woman - what the heck, see the darn thing for those three reasons.",Blade Runner 2049

It almost seemed like it was trying to show off CGI. I wasn't impressed. His love life was sad and not worthy of all the screen time. It had some interesting scenes with some nice cinematography. But the story was just so empty, I kind of wanted more. And really when you're continuing a story line, you shouldn't rely so much on CGI. The story really needs to be the key. Because the original has already cashed in on the originality of the plot and idea of the story, not to mention the visuals. You can't just re-do the original, that is too boring. Very disappointed.

I think Blade Runner: 2049 is far and away my favourite cinema experience of all time.
The seats rumbling as K approaches the monolithic pyramid of Wallace Corp... it was a transcendent experience.Films have a fixation with overexplaining these days. At spilling their guts about everything. We know the backstories and motivations for every single character, we can't seem to get enough information about lore and world information. Blade Runner 2049 is the antithesis of that. We are given just enough information - but we only get that information if we pay attention. 2049 rewards attention. It rewards you looking at those long, gorgeous shots (every frame could be framed on a wall!), at soaking in atmosphere. It's a simply gorgeous, intelligent movie about the fragility of existence, and how we can act heroically in spite of mundane beginnings - and perhaps mundane endings. There might not be anything special about us as a person, or even our species - but that doesn't invalidate life. It doesn't make life not worth living.I can see how people would not like this film. It's slow and complex and only gives back if the viewer is willing to give to. But damn if I'm not holding back tears now writing this. It's just gorgeous.

1253,elijahcassidy,One of the best sequels ever.,10,21 July 2018,"I know this is a cliche thing to say, but this movie was everything I hope for and so much more.It's kind of hard where to begin. Everything in this movie is basically perfect from the beautiful atmosphere to the incredible way it delivers subtext to the breathtaking visuals. Everything this movie attempts to do it does the best version of it.The visuals are probably the most obvious takeaway. It's some of Roger Deakins finest work and I'm so happy he won the Oscar because honestly this is one of the best looking films I've ever seen in my life. Like most Roger Deakins films, the lighting is soft yet very crisp. It gives off a very natural look which is a bit of a deviation from the visual aesthetic of the original.This is also some of the best work Ryan Gosling has done. He is a fiercely underrated actor probably due to how subdued he always is and in this movie he is so gracefully subtle so he is always relatable when he needs to be and likewise when he needs to be distant. That's another another aspect of his character which is beautifully realised in a script that doesn't get enough credit. Ryan Gosling is a very strong character but he's also kind of a loser, and the way he discovers things about himself through the film is some of the most riveting stuff I've seen in a cinema in ages. I'm not delving into spoilers so I won't discuss significant moments (though I will say their is no shortage of scenes that can be very heavily broken down), the character of K is extremely distant from the world in a similar way to Decard, but to be he came across as even more cold. Their are a lot of questions raised based on his actions which make you question how we would go about defining humans if the line was drawn so thin. No surprise here, but this is an extremely deep movie. Deeper than the first in my opinion.The score is also definitely worth talking about. It definitely pays some tribute to the original movie in its electronic sounds and a couple of specific callbacks, but it's a lot more dense and modern and generally more Zimmer-ish. However it definitely strays away from the jazzy elements of the original. This movie is much less of a classic noir than its predecessor, I'd say that's it's more of a straight drama.There is so much to talk about with this movie that I could honestly go on for hours, however I'd get into spoiler territory which I don't want to do because the secrets this movie has keep you glued to the screen throughout the 2 and a half hour runtime which by the way, you do feel, but it's never boring. A long run time doesn't mean the movies boring, it means that if it's actually a well made movie the payoff even more satisfying because you've really been through the ringer. Yes the movie isn't built on action set pieces, but it still has constant activity. The plot is constantly moving forward, and we're always learning more information which weaves into this web which the audience can decipher. The development of the characters and themes are very intelligently woven in to scenes moving the plot forward. We're never really halted by scenes which feel irrelevant to the story in service of telling us something about the character. Every scene always has several purposes. One of the many things Denis Villenuve achieves which make him one of the most talented directors we have.Obviously this movie is an absolute must see. Because the movie is a slow burn and there aren't wall to wall action and viscous battles of dialogue, I can understand some people not buying into this movie. But I encourage everyone to at least give it a try because this movie criminally underperformed at the box office and we really want to be sending studios the message that we want blockbusters that are built on smart stories and still manage to be artful while entertaining.",Blade Runner 2049

1262,cezariovictor,"Intelligent sequel that, on its own, doesn't captivate new audiences",7,9 January 2021,"As a sequel and in the field of the plot creativity, it's done an excellent work that hypes old fans into awaiting a possible new sequel with the story's climax, once that Blade Runner 2049 introduces well-fit new characters that really add to the scenario of the old movie, even explaining some gaps or doubts on the bigger plot. Furthermore, the movie is intelligently made on the artistic aspect, showing wonderful simbols and plays with shadows and colors, making it clear that it was thought on the details. Nevertheless, although it offers some pretty engaging scenes, the story is not clearly put to the new (those who didn't see the original film) viewers as it should have been, what difficulties their conexion with the characters and makes it all boring at some times.Good stories can be relevant parts of interesting big universes, but they also need to give solely a good lead on the plot and to be weel self-contained to captivate new audiences. As an example, I had never watched the first movie by the time I watched this one (I did later and loved to do it), so I didn't catch up emocionally with the characters, besides being curious about it, what made tiring a significant part of it. That's clearer when you consider that I watched it with friends and I was the only one who felt some connection to it.By the way, it didn't need to have 3 hours, the story could have been equally told at maybe less than 2, so that the pace was annoyingly slow, contributing to those bored viewers.In short, if you're willing to watch a pretty slow interesting movie, it can fit you well and introduce you to the general concepts of the saga (but I still would recommend you watching the first Blade Runner first). If you liked the first Blade Runner, it's a must-see.",Blade Runner 2049
1263,scottelly-1,"I loved the original, but didn't like this sequel.",3,10 October 2017,"The only reason I gave this a 3 instead of a 1 or 2 was because it had Harrison Ford in it, and he played his part well, and because it presented some interesting and well-done technology. It was reasonably well made, as it should be for a high-budget movie, but this movie was slow - boring even. After watching it I figured the director must have been a British friend of Ridley Scott (the director of the original movie and also from Great Brittain - England - the U.K.), because it didn't seem like it could have been directed by Ridley Scott. It would have been better if it had been. I was wrong about the director's origin, but not his lack of directing ability. I really wish Ridley Scott had directed this movie. He has better taste. He knows where to put sound and where not to . . . and how loud to make it. He has a better sense of timing, and I think many things would have been done a little bit differently, if Ridley Scott had directed it.One thing I didn't like about this movie was that they overdid so much in it, like the symbolism. There was all sorts of extra symbolism in this movie that looked to be injected into it at random, as if the writers or director had some political agenda or something. That really bothered me. Why not just tell the story and stop trying to inject your green political agenda into the movie guys? We recycle now. I don't think that's going to stop. The in-your-face pollution was over the top.Sorry I can't give more details, because I don't want to inadvertently write a spoiler.Even though I went into this one expecting it to fall short of the original Blade Runner movie, I was still disappointed. It REALLY didn't live up to the level of the first Blade Runner . . . and who picked that terrible name?!? In the final analysis I have to say I would not recommend this movie to anyone, while I recommend the original Blade Runner movie to people all the time. I doubt I'll ever watch this newer Blade Runner movie again, but I'll definitely watch the old one again.",Blade Runner 2049

All the actors are good, all the set designs are great, the camera shots are great,the atmosphere is cold and wonderful, the story is interesting, and the musical score was great! Even though the film is almost 3 hours long, to me it didn't feel like it. I didn't want the movie to end. Its a cold and dark sci film with perfect pacing to grab you in the story. Some say its boring or too slow paced...but the pacing is what gives it it's character. Having certain lights and sounds go over certain areas of the set take you into the world. It's the little things and that attention to detail that the cast, crew, and director use to bring the audience into the story and the world of Blade Runner. This sequel definitely honors the 1st blade runner film, ten fold. You can't cut scenes and dumb it down to just action, jokes, and explosions...and make the movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes...we have too many movies like that already. The 1st movie proved there is an audience for this type of film. And some say that the 1st film was boring....well that 1st film happens to be a cult classic among many others. This movie will go down the exact same way...as a classic film experience. Not everyone will get it. Some people like deep meaningful films....even some films where there is no dialogue at all....but they still get pulled into the film, and escape in the story. I have about over 3,000 movies in my collection, and I love movies. I've loved movies ever since I rented them in the 80s on beta cassette tapes as a kid. I know a good movie when I see one, and damn, I'm backing this film as an awesome movie experience that I cant wait to see again.",Blade Runner 2049

Slow pace and flat characters are the most-heard complaints. That makes me wonder why they think the original was so great. It's even slower than BR 2049 and Harrison's Ford character was very similar to Ryan Gosling's character. Was Ford really that much better at playing a depressed investigator look for answers than Gosling or is it something else? I agree that there is no antagonist on the level of Rutger Hauer in the sequel, but I still like the way they went with the sinister characters of Sylvia Hoeks and Jared Leto. That alone can't be the reason to give it such a poor rating.I thought the atmosphere of the film was spot on. It has the same depressing feel to it as the original but a more industrial look. It make sense to me because it takes place 30 years after the original. Not liking it is OK, but I think many fans of the original Bladerunner had their nostalgia goggles on when they saw Bladerunner 2049.",Blade Runner 2049

1268,philip-baxter,Fan fiction with a giant budget,3,18 March 2018,"There are many flaws with 2049, but none bigger than its fan fiction level plotting. What if Deckard and Rachel somehow had open ended lifespans and they had a baby! It's amateur hour stuff. It treads all over the world created in the masterpiece original. You'd have thought Tyrell might have at least dropped a hint that as well as planting experimental memories in Rachel, he also gave her the ability to have children. The cast is bored throughout. Gosling is flat as ever and mumbles every line. Ford does his usual grumpy old man act. Robin Wright is good for the brief handful of scenes she's in. Sylvia Hoeks is serviceable as a female Terminator. Ana De Armas is one note and her thick accent makes her dialogue difficult to understand. Jared Leto appears to be stoned throughout and is barely audible as his James Bond comedy villain. Visually 2049 has its moments, but they're sandwiched inbetween a lot of daytime sequences which are flat, grey, and foggy. Even the nighttime sequences lack the detail and scale of the original, and the interiors frankly look like they belong in 2001 rather than Blade Runner. The original is a much, much better looking movie. The score is a stand out as it may well be the worst score in motion picture history. Hans Zimmer has taken his war on melody to new levels with this cacophonous wall of random noise. It's painful stuff. He steals a classic Vangelis melody at the end, which only compounds his failure. The day Zimmer retires from film scoring will be a happy day. The film is not entirely without merit. It's nice to see spinners again and some of the nighttime city shots are nice, but that's about it. The original remains a perfect movie. This is anything but. And why does Deckard's daughter have a French accent? Just one of the many baffling decisions in this cinematic mess.",Blade Runner 2049
1269,daventurefilm,A Modern Masterpiece that will (hopefully) have the same reputation as the original,9,10 October 2017,"Having heard all the positive reviews and comments, I already had high hopes. It even managed to exceed those!!!K, the new Blade Runner, is what Harrison Ford was in the original. However stories from the first film find themselves playing a key role in the new one as the two interlink faultlessly.Ryan Gosling plays the character brilliantly. With such a diverse acting resume spanning from Comedies (Crazy, Stupid Love) to Action (Drive), There is no doubt about it he is a talented actor. Acting alongside Ford brings another big action to his growing A list blockbusters.Ford's talent is natural here, adapting into the character he played all those years ago and bringing it to modern day. An actor who doesn't show his age when he runs and gets beaten around!As for the supporting cast, K's love interest Jon (played by the beautiful Ana De Armas) bought an element of necessary romance to the film, carrying and helping our main protagonist along. Sylvia Hoeks, who plays the 'Replicant gone rogue' Luv, brings the majority of the films violence with her. Other stars including Robin Wright as the Lieutenant giving orders to K and Dave Bautista as Sapper providing a famous supporting cast.The visuals here are second to none! From the vast deserts of a 'post-apocalypse' Vegas to the futuristic neo-noir rendition of California, everything is built for purpose. Nothing comes across as a pointless fill in. Everywhere we go, we're pulled along every step of K's journey. When he is isolated, we as an audience feel isolated with him. When courageous, we are pushed to the edge of our seats. It really sets out to give the audience every emotion in the book and, in my mind, I almost found myself wanting to be part of that world (almost)!The score from Zimmer and Wallfisch juxtaposed incredibly here, just as it did for Dunkirk. However I feel that they have gone a level up here and to bring such emotion to individual notes pushes me to confess that it is the best score I've heard yet!OK, I know, lots of positives. No such thing as a perfect film (although this comes so damn close)! I have to admit I wasn't all convinced by Jared Leto's role. His character seemed cool and, as you'll notice, he has a pivotal role in the new era of Replicants. I just thought his character didn't have as significant a role in the film as it needed.I don't want to spoil the plot but so much is happening here that I'd rather you just watch it for yourself. Conclusions are made to questions from the original, however questions that are left felt intentional to bring audience to debate.To sum the whole lot up, it was an honour to spend 2 hours and 44 minutes in this amazing world created by all the cast members. Do I want a sequel? No. This is a film with a beginning, middle and end. Lets keep it that way. Dennis Villeneuve I applaud you for taking the brave step in making this film and pulling it off in such style!!!",Blade Runner 2049

1271,hunterdjordan,Slightly better than the first,8,8 March 2018,"I have just finished watching this for the second time and i have to say the second viewing was more enjoyable. The film is gorgeous. From the cinematography to the sets, lighting, colors, music, everything. Now of course my rating of 8 implies there's some flaws which there are.The problems i have are fairly minimal. The first being the soundtrack. The soundtrack isn't bad, it's just quite loud. I know that's kind of a strange complaint, but since i watch movies with surround sound, it gets quite irritating. The first Blade Runner has an amazing soundtrack that fits perfectly with the film, this one even though it has a good soundtrack, feels out of place in some scenes.The next complaint is some of the performances, mainly Jared Leto. I like Jared Leto, i think he's a capable actor, it just feels like he's going too over the top for my liking.There are quite a lot of great things that i appreciate about this film. The first is that they don't immediately explain things, allowing the audience to pick up on things rather than writing exposition and showing it down our throats. It treats the viewers as if they're intelligent.The story is not necessarily unique, but it's presented in a nice, smart, and skilled way.I would recommend this to pretty much anyone, including fans of the book and original movie.",Blade Runner 2049
1272,steppeck,Comparisons reveal the odious.,1,23 October 2017,"I'm sickened by the fawning over this spectacularly empty drivel.So utterly characterless for something purporting to reflect on the nature of human consciousness. No character = no script, of course. The original revels subtly in the exploration of how identity and memory are intrinsic to one another. How the objects we surround ourselves persuade us of our identity. Gosling's apartment in contrast, characterless. Literally. There is no character that lives there. Perhaps they feared that a character, with an actually believable life, in the film might detract from the computerised holographic eye candy companion? Did Harvey Weinstein have some say in this element? This avatar of desire has potential for commentary, but resolves as an astonishing endorsement of computerised companionship as a viable alternative to human relationship. In our dystopian future, as the capacity for community dissolves, this is our great hope; the post prostitute/hologram wife sex - ""coffee?"" - results in smiles all round.  This element to the film made me a little physically sick and highly sympathetic to militant feminism. The film's clumsy attempts at visual poetry pale into comparison with the original - proving the point that the soul of the work is what creates a spectacle with substance, not computing power.Jared Leto's Kurtz impression might have fared better had their been any craft in the script. Perhaps if they'd gotten Rutger Hauer to improvise some lines there'd have been some semblance of originality, instead of memorable quotes such as ""You do not know...pain.""The score to the movie was effective, but lacked the nuanced, cohesive beauty of Vangelis' offering in the original; of course it suffers from the hodge podge on screen. There can be no artistic combinatorial explosion when so many elements are lacking in subtlety, originality...spirit. This deficit being exemplified by the Power Rangers finale...PEOW PEOW - HIIIIYA!!!And there is no spirit. This post-modern parable embodies and endorses the pseudo-scientific reductionist view of humanity as essentially worthless and doomed. It is an unrelentingly shallow and joyless indulgence with plot holes you could drive a bus through (it's a real memory... then it must be mine! *BOOOOM* - great work detective!). To give the team the benefit of the doubt, let's say that some elements may be excused by the use of focus groups by the studios. It wouldn't take much to alter the attitude of Gosling to his 3D spouse to highlight to the viewer the 1D nature of his relationship. Maybe those takes are on the cutting room floor, maybe there'll be a superior director's cut. I doubt it'll be any the better, the changes needing to be radical; including shaving about an hour off the running time.Perhaps the director's cut will appear before the sequel. Yes, thanks to the introduction of a rebellion, we can look forward to the Matrix style ""Bladerunner reloaded"", ""Bladerunner revolutions""...I wonder whether Netflix or Amazon will make the series? #justanotherfranchiseIn the year 2019, I believe this effort will suffer horribly from hindsight; unlike the majestic original...and we'll always have the original.

I've seen Blade Runner more than 10 times and never thought that a sequel could surpass it, I do not know if in history, but yes in cinematography, art direction and music. It is dark and bright at the same time, an unforgettable color palette, an atmosphere so real, that you seem to live it. Time flies by, even though some shots seem to be a little longer than necessary. The story is about the soul, what is soul? Those beings that will be created genetically artificial, will have soul?

It's unevenly paced, poorly edited, like a string of individual scenes from different movies, with only little connection or common thread. Sometimes quiet and then suddenly extremely loud !? Slow scenes can be amazing if you put substance in them that elicit thoughts, emotions or drive the story forward – this was just ""slow doing nothing"" in many scenes and therefore boring and long. Some scenes are extremely beautiful and well-made but others look like they are from another movie. And making the blade runners into ""2D"" killer- or adult robots is just sad. I love Ryan Gosling, but 3 hours of Ryan Gosling playing Ryan Gosling is a bit too much.

1275,wl-casper,Beautifully made & sure to be a future classic,8,11 October 2017,"With the original being one of my all time favorites I had been skeptical when I heard a sequel was in the pipeline. The skepticism I had was long forgotten after watching Blade Runner 2049. Firstly, the movie is a visual masterpiece. Every shot is like a painting. It manages to retain the dreamy atmosphere of futuristic LA while still bringing something original to the table. I enjoyed the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch although it's not quite up there with that of Vangelis. In terms of story it might seem a bit underwritten in parts but I felt the central characters were emotionally resonating and any subplots would have distracted from the more important aspects of K's story. Ryan Gosling is excellent in the role of K and for the short time that Harrison Ford is on the screen he gives his best performance I've seen from him in a long time.For some of the few downsides to the film. As much as I loved this movie I was surprised with the ending. I felt that it ended in a way that suggested too much towards a Blade Runner 3. I would have preferred if all the loose ends were tied up and with a running time of close to 3 hours you'd expect that to be the case. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys noir sci-fi and liked the original. It's definitely not going to be for everyone and the pacing is slower than most movies of today however, that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion.",Blade Runner 2049
1276,mikeinator24,"Just short of well deserved sequel. Entertaining, though bland dialogue.",6,6 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049, directed by Denis Villeneuve, came as an unexpected sequel to one of the most highly regarded Sci-fi films of all time. A big title to live up to. This film did not have to be made; the story of Blade Runner was completed in 1982. That alone did lower my expectations for a sequel to win a place on my shelf, but if it could at least rise above the terrible rehashing, rebooting, sequel mania that we are being put through by Hollywood today, maybe it'd be worth my time. I'll tell you why I think it did, not exceedingly so though.I had strong doubts going into this movie, even if it pulled of the thrilling ride that The Force Awakens did, would it really be enough to justify another sequel to a classic film. In all honesty, I think we can all admit that the sole reason that this film was made was for the huge clout that the name Blade Runner holds, and it's ability to rake in cash. I think it's cool to make dough from films, but I don't believe in that being the primary reason. Hearing that Ridley Scott gave the go-ahead did not make me believe in the film more. How many times has Spielberg, Burton, Lucas or Ridley himself give approval of another awful sequel or remake. We can not trust our Directors to protect a film's legacy.Despite, all my premonitions. I walked out of the theater with a better impression than I went in with. It was a wise decision to have Villeneuve direct this film, Arrival, Sicario, and Prisoners have demonstrated that he can make a tightly knit serious film with strong performances modernly unique approaches to science fiction. I still don't know if he was the best choice because frankly the performances were all solid, but no one stood out too much as did the performances of the Replicants in the original film. For me the best written character and performance came from Ana de Armas, who played Joi. Ryan Gosling's performance was good, it didn't require much of him, I sort of wish he played the character a little darker. His performance resembles that of Drive all too much. He is great at looking completely stern and serious, but he doesn't have a special added element of deep emotion that a different casting choice might have brought from this character. Of course this is Hollywood, 2017, so casting anyone else might have hurt their wallets.Other casting choices were terrific. Robin Wright finally landed a role made for her in a large scale film. Jared Leto while not his best performance did bring that character to life. The biggest downside to the film, that left me feeling that it didn't achieve what it was hyped to be, was the dialogue. It was so very bland, and filled with plot explanations. The writers could have created a much more vivid world with intricate subtext, rather than handing the plot on fine China to the audience. Additionally, there were many instances that jokes, or what seemed like jokes were made, where I and the rest of the audience were completely silent. It was difficult, I even tried laughing, but these characters were so hard to the bone that the attempts at humor felt unnatural and fell flat.The cinematography was enthralling. Each scene had the tone was nailed through the shots. It was not incredibly unique, almost all the shots were by the book, but it was beautiful and got the job done and was truly shot very closely with the edit in mind. Scenes play out vividly in my mind and I must give it due credit for that. The lighting was one of the high notes of the film. Very professional, and again, walked hand in hand with the cinematography and tone of the scenes. All technical aspects of this film were planned to the t. I deeply enjoyed the water lighting, as well as the variation of temperature based on the scene. Jared Leto's place was just awesome.The thing that stood out the most, and is something that I think the film will receive an award for, is the sound design. There were some sounds that I had never heard before, and were so well composed with the story on screen that it brought this film up a rank. It wasn't just the Hollywood formula for sound either. There were some truly unique uses of it that got my emotions going. Atop this, the soundtrack was also fantastic, and stands to receive another award. The classic 50's songs go great with the dying of the old world theme. Love it.There were specific concepts and elements of the film that I deeply enjoyed. I don't want to give any spoilers. Each scene was rewarding to watch in it's self. In fact the overall plot, and story was good too. Though I do have many questions, and it didn't all tie together perfectly. The pace felt a little awkward as a whole. But you can really get lost in each scene.Overall the film was enjoyable, but the writing, namely the dialogue didn't quiet achieve what it needed to for me to call it a great and well deserved sequel. I do recommend watching it. Though it wouldn't be unforgivable if you missed it. It did expand on the world in a cool way, showing us lots of little lifestyles, and technological advancements. It didn't give any metaphors or lessons on AI or technology that I haven't heard before though. I give Blade Runner 2049 a 7.3.",Blade Runner 2049

1279,dollargrabbag,Haunting and illuminating.,10,14 October 2017,"A perfect eye and a pale near-void of complex, indecipherable patterns gives way to a sterile protein farm full of empty space; filled with a feeling of deprivation and loneliness. This is how Blade Runner 2049 begins before bringing us back to the wet, ultra-dense, black and neon maze of the super-city we know so well. This is how Denis Villeneuve lets us know right away that this is his movie, one full of reverence for the original, but a film that is much, much more than a mere homage.Villeneuve has always been much more Kubrickian than Ridley Scott ever was. In his best work, Scott was a great visionary and incredible composer, but he doesn't have quite the same feeling with the composition. Villeneuve continues to bring us transcendentally arresting visual arrangements, rather than copying Scott's style. This is an excellent choice because when you're picking up the thread of a work of art 35 years later, it's best to make your production your own.Once or twice I felt the dialogue might be a little on-the-nose to the themes, but I don't feel conclusive about this at all and I won't deduct from my grade. One thing is for sure, Villeneuve is not copying the original Blade Runner to any degree. There are a small handful of nods to the original, but this is such its own. The structure and pacing of this story is not at all a carbon copy of the first, and it does an excellent job of bringing you in sync with its rhythm.This is a challenging film, as it should be! There are many subtleties to the motivations of the characters. In particularly, there is a fight that moves from gunplay to fisticuffs that Gosling's character of ""K"" takes part in which I'm not entirely sure I understand the cause for, but I also don't see any clear break in logic to it, either. There are a great deal of elements to this work which are fine-tuned to evoke thought and contemplation. This is, again, in line with Kubrick's priorities and works.In some ways, this movie reminds me of Logan (2017). Naturally, Blade Runner 2049 was in production before that film was even released, so I would say it's more a matter of both of them tapping into some very classic themes; themes which seem to be very resonant at this moment.Nothing bad can be said about any of the dramatic talent. Everyone is the definition of pitch-perfect. The set work and special effects are all breathtaking. The music was for me almost 100% perfect and amazing, but the very loud and harsh ""waahhh-ohhh"" synth noises in ""Sea Wall"" (the music during the lead-up to the final confrontation) and reprised in the end credits music ""Blade Runner"" were not to my taste. They are anxiety-inducing with their timbre and tonality (probably intended) and also bring bad dubstep to mind, so this was an unfortunate negative piece for me. If they were a little different, it probably would have been much more welcome to me. As much as I dislike it, though, I can't imagine lowering the grade on an otherwise perfect film for a musical element that's only in the movie for not even a minute total split between two instances.Blade Runner 2049 possesses depth and integrality of meaning and emotion the equal of its predecessor, the original Blade Runner. It is a captivating and powerfully moving work of highest art, of the kind that is so very badly needed today. It is my most fervent wish that any further entry in this story maintains this level of excellence. To mar the existing works with a sequel that is anything less would be a crime.",Blade Runner 2049
1280,areadydefense,Unpacking Blad Runner 2049,10,12 October 2017,"Bladrunner 2049 asks one simple question, ""What does it mean to be human?"" Then, it proceeds to offer a variety of possibilities, as seen primarily from the point of view of non-humans, i.e. replicants. Some of the possibilities mentioned include:Giving birth Lying Being born Having a soul Having real memories Sacrificing for othersI'm sure there are others but you get the idea. In the course of the story we're introduced to sentient beings at various levels of humanness. People, replicants, holograms. If that weren't enough, it seems as though there is a human, replicant hybrid and to confuse it even more, there are a variety of generations of replicants.With the question asked and the parties introduced, there is a lot of role reversals and juxtapositions. At one point a human serves a hologram as she tries to please a replicant. That is some serious role reversal. The value of life itself is explored. Replicants are terminated for simple failure (wrong color of eye) or known limitations (inability to reproduce). Niander Wallace wants millions of replicants to serve and can't make them fast enough. Meanwhile, thousands of orphans are shown doing trivial work.A couple of characters really stand out. Joe's holographic companion seems more human than anyone else in the story when she sacrifices everything, seems to have emotion, and much more. Joe, while seeming very stoic in his search for meaning is told by other replicants that sacrificing for others is one of the most human things you can do. So he does exactly that, and he appears to die satisfied that he has come as close to human as possible.This just scratches the surface of an intricate and complex series of questions. I think the real question you should be left with is, ""If sacrificing in the service of others is one of the most human things you can do, how human are you? Do you live a life of giving?"" Maybe you didn't catch that question the first time around. I didn't. But it is very definitely in there and worth exploring.",Blade Runner 2049
1281,a761506-192-71938,"Stunningly beautiful, incredibly creative, amazing sound and effects",6,7 October 2017,"This is up there with one of the most beautiful movies ever, even though the majority of the movie depicted a post-apocalyptic Las Angeles which looked incredibly filthy. The sets were all visually amazing, and the sound and music integrated perfectly. I watched the movie in a ""D-box"" seat which pulsed and moved in sync with the film, it really put an exclamation point on what were already fantastic special effects.If the movie was strictly about making a piece of art, it was a 10. But, not the case. I must preface by saying that I have never seen the original Blade Runner movie. Some reviews have stated advance knowledge of the story was necessary to fully grasp this movie, but I opted to see this film prior to the original, as I believe a movie should be able to have its own legs and not require having seen a 35 year old prequel (which I imagine many have never seen).The movie started slow and stayed that way right up until one action sequence at the end. And by the time it ended, with certain characters predictably being killed, I was left with a feeling that virtually nothing had been settled and they just spent nearly 3 hours to merely set it up for - who would guess - another sequel.Gosling's character was mostly a dud. He had one scene where he displayed what looked to be genuine fear, it was a solid piece of acting, but outside of that, his role was robotic and dry. It wasn't his acting, it was the writing and direction that left him playing a character who was tough to relate to or really root for.I can see how some will rank this up there with some of the best sci-fi movies, it's easy to be mesmerized by its overall appearance and polish, but, I think initial reviewers have greatly overrated this film. It's definitely not even close to the same class as genre titans like Inception or Matrix.",Blade Runner 2049
1282,kielyjohn-261-769087,A worthy sequel,10,23 October 2017,"I am a big fan of the original Bladerunner I have seen the original many many times and up until now hated any thought of a sequel or 'spin off'. Up until release I pretended Bladerunner 2049 didn't exist I kept telling myself nothing can be as great as the original. I saw some trailers and again persuaded myself 'it's just an action film'. Then a friend said i'm going to see the new Bladerunner on opening night so I booked the tickets sat in the cinema and from the very first second the film started till the second it ended I was back in the Bladerunner universe.The music is subtle and powerful it uses key tones from the original Vangelis soundtrack but it's so subtle if you do not know the original you won't know it's there. It seems to me every sound, soundtrack has been lovingly placed you really feel what the characters feel.There are many references to the original so you know it has been treated in very high regard, Ryan Gosling was perfect as K and his love interest Ana De Armas is stunning and beautiful (trying so hard not to give anything away).The sets are lovingly made there is CGI of course but some sets are real and they are stunning to behold you feel it's a real city, like the original every bit of technology shown has a purpose.I have seen some reviews some very harsh critics out there today but I would say to them how could you do the original justice the original will always be there but for me there's enough space for 2049 to happily settle in. Please go and support the film if you are a true Bladerunner fan you owe it yourself to make your own decision.Bryant : Drink some for me huh pal...",Blade Runner 2049
1283,glyphed,Worthy successor,10,1 January 2018,"I am glad to see that my initial skepticism was unjustified. This is a worthy successor of the Blade Runner and a masterpiece in the Sci-Fi genre. Acting, visuals and storytelling are flawless.",Blade Runner 2049
1284,eamonnkenny,This is a true masterpiece,10,17 March 2019,"I loved Harrison Ford in movies until he played old man Indy and then I became quite ageist (I'm getting on myself...). I just thought he waited too long to make the movie and then was very skeptical going into to watch Blade Runner 2049 given the recent star wars fiasco. I was so pleasantly surprised.This film has an amazing number of twists that you could never guess. It is a masterpiece. Its slow moving like the original (interestingly the original looks so dated now, and isn't actually that great). You almost want to say as you are watching this movie, ""This is making me bored"", but you can't bring yourself to say that. Its just so well paced that it makes for compulsive watching.It dark and moody and yet light and fluffy in some parts. The A.I. ideas where quite interesting and as a technologist I found them particularly intriguing. The look of the movie is so close to the original, but the effects are flawless. Some of the best visual effects since Oblivion.I thought La La Land was the biggest lot of tripe and deserved no oscars, and was concerned about the fact that Ryan Gosling might be poor in the part, but he was absolutely amazing. He pulled off not being quite human but as the movie progresses he becomes more and more human.This movie has one of the greatest cinematic bad guys of all time in my opinion. The voice change of the baddy in some scenes is quite startling and unnerving. They definitely should have received a nomination for their work. Don't want to reveal any more than that. Not giving any spoilers away. Just to say, I'm not talking about Wallace.Even my 16 year old son loved it, which is interesting, given that he turned Blade Runner off after 40 minutes. He found the original so boring and dated. This sequel is definitely worth a watch. And then you have to watch it again to catch the bits you missed the first time.Using my own statistical rule of ""little amount of advertisement = quality movie"", or ""too much advertisement on side of bus=flop"", I have to say, I didn't see any adverts for this movie at all. This is a movie that needs no introduction or overselling. Its a movie that will be noticed over time for the great movie that it is.Definitely up there with Interstellar, Inception, Oblivion, Empire (V) as my favourite sci-fi's of all time.",Blade Runner 2049
1285,michaeleb1025,Disappointing at best,2,20 January 2018,"I admit I was not pleased when I heard about this project but I hoped for the best. Then the preview looked really boring and tedious. Watching the final film, I saw that it could actually be cut down to about 45 minutes. There are scenes that needlessly take forever. The look of the film was exceedingly disappointing. Too much dusty haze in different colors. The art direction made the original one of the most influential film in Fashion, Art, and Interior Design of the eighties. In this movie it is just a boring display of a lot of oversimplified flat surfaces. The grotty and baroque kitschy qualities of the original's vision are no where to be found. The old live action version of Cashern is a much more interesting watch than this. The clothes of this movie were abysmally simple like a bad Donatella Versace Collection. The hooker's outfit was even a pathetic knockoff of the the original Tris. I was so irritated on so many levels. The large set pieces of nudes reminded me of a bad homage to AI by Spielberg. Dramatic pacing was non existent. Casting was rather dubious with pretty boy Jared Leto's usual kinky villain not really working very well. Robin Wright was a complete bore. The critics who loved this must be a clueless bunch of SciFi fanboys. Aside from money, was there any good reason to make this thing?",Blade Runner 2049

From a visually stunning original to a dull and colourless sequel with wooden characters and cheap looking sets and technology. The original was full of neon lights in a wet and menacing urban setting, This was fog and dirt.The story was laboured and uninteresting which then made the film appear far to long - I never made it to the end left wondering why I bothered in the first place. I also didn't fully understand the complex relationship between Gosling and the female hologram, maybe it wasn't complex at all and just plain simple and I was in fact expecting far too much. In any case it made no real sense and added nothing to the base line story, rather like what I am doing now - it was used to pad out a weak film.",Blade Runner 2049

I should have looked closer at the reviews and realized I'd hate this movie. There were moments that were good, but in general the movie moved soo slowly that it was difficult to stay involved. The incredibly loud blaring low tones were also just annoying after a while and became another reason that I didn't enjoy the experience.

1289,dawnfreese,All i could ask was WHY?,1,19 October 2017,"just to update myself, I watched the 82 version, since all the news was about what we learned from Blade runner 1st edition. Well, this movie is old. Looks to be a low budget B movie, for some reason the movie attracted big names in the acting field. So we move on to 2017 version, blade runner 2049. Again I am thrown into a low budget, bad acting, how and why would they not take advantage of this do over and actually make it better? yes, we know its a spin-off, a run along for the family type of film, but why?? They took trash and made more trash. After about 20 minutes off goes the movie, I was done back to watching Lost... They took an old guy did some bad makeup and still had an old guy...

Ridley Scott Edit needed!",8,18 June 2020,"If this was a standalone film and not a sequel, i'd give it a 9.. but it seems they misunderstood a couple of things about Blade Runner.The performances are too sterile outside of Sylvia Hoeks and Robin Wright (the director's fault) and every scene is too long and ponderous for the thin plot they decided on. It was overplayed, and when all of the plot relies on twists and surprises.. the film becomes less interesting with each watch for me.I have the same problem with Nolan's films, they rely too much on people not knowing ""spoilers"" only watching it a couple of times and being wowed by spectacle.The original gets more interesting with each watch for me.While the lighting is incredible and the smokeyness is there, the camera operation is pretty bland (TV-ish) and the set design doesn't match Ridley's from Blade Runner or Alien. It isn't a visual masterpiece to me. There's some iconic shots in there, but it doesn't have anywhere near the amount of eye candy the original has. Load up both films in 4K, watch them back to back.. you'll see what I mean.But, it is a very good film.",Blade Runner 2049

Sadly it's just another example of Hollywood cashing in on our beloved memories. A sprawling 2 hours and 20 Minutes of boredom, pretty boredom mind you, they did a good job recreating the original look and feel of the first movie, just to populate it with a terrible script and story that had so many loose ends that you end up not caring where you will end up.

1295,diablopale-41194,There's only one adjective to describe it: Kubrickian,10,7 October 2017,"Since I saw Blade Runner 2049 (in the IMAX format) a day ago, thoughts of the film gave been unable to leave my head.The larger the denominator of a rating, the more room there is to discuss error, so let's keep it to a simple four-star rating.Out of ****, I give it ****.Blade Runner 2049 is certainly not the same as the original, and fans looking for secure familiarity may find themselves lost in the future. This is a film that is harrowing, dark and emotional; however, it is also beautiful, true and pure. The film tells questions what sentience (or perhaps ""having a soul"" is more appropriate) really means. It does this over 163 minutes of unparalleled beauty, thanks to the striking, yet pensive work of director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins. In contrast to the heavily stylized look of the first film (legendarily done by Jordan Croneneweth, and which I consider to be one of the most beautiful films of all time), the team behind 2049 have found something new, but equally powerful. Blade Runner 2049 is filled with imagery that finds natural beauty in the oppressive world in which its characters live. It is a film full of rain, fog, snow and dust, all visually striking.The characters are wonderfully fleshed out and the story starts slow as we are guided around future Los Angeles by Officer K (Ryan Gosling, in arguably his best performance - one which never stops developing over the course of the film). The pace may seem strange to some, but this is not an action-packed thrill ride. It's a noir, or neo-noir if you're a purist. These characters live lives, and that is shown at a realistic pace. One other performance deserves mention and that is the fantastic work of Harrison Ford, who has perfectly created a character that has aged thirty years, in body and mind.The sound design and score is reminiscent of Morricone's accompaniments to Serio Leone's westerns or Carlos's work on A Clockwork Orange, in that it compliments and completes the world of the story perfectly.The editing is quiet, and I didn't mention it on first draft of this review, but I feel that it must be noted, for bringing together the events of a whole world onto the screen.The audience that I saw this film with behaved in a way that convinced me that they felt as I did upon the final frame of the film. Some left, in complete silence; others stayed, lost in thought. Few films' endings are quite as emotionally complete as this ending. It's difficult to review this film in parts, because each emotion we feel is justified by the end, so that what we feel is fulfillment. The story has ended, but the world lives on and we are filled with wonder.My final notes refer back to the title. This film does indeed remind me of the work of Stanley Kubrick. It's a compliment that I have never given before, but I feel that here it is appropriate. It is not my place to say whether Kubrick would have liked this film, but I can assure the reader that this film is one of the decade's (if not the century's) finest and that its very existence is the kind of miracle that makes me love cinema.",Blade Runner 2049
1296,tognoni-90948,Amazing build up but falls short,8,8 October 2017,"The atmosphere is what makes this movie: I can't think of any other sequel shot so long after the original that manages to recapture the essence of the original while keeping things modern. Amazing. You can tell most of the sets are ""real"" with little CGI used. The visuals, the music, a true masterpiece.Acting is good and Ryan Gosling is almost perfect (although my favourite is Joi). The worst performance is from the guy who's celebrated the most: Harrison Ford. He just doesn't care anymore, I think - or maybe he got a boring script. They should and could have done more with him: after all most of the old guard watching this movie still remembers him as the hero, and wants to see him as the hero, at least in some parts. But he just looks like a bored, old man with nothing in him anymore (not even emotions).*** spoilers *** To me, the problem is that this is a long movie that feels it should be longer. The buildup in the first two hours is amazing...but it's all wrapped up too fast in the last 20-30 minutes. There is little connection with the people who end the story. And there is too little chemistry between Ford and Gosling...and too little emotional reaction after Joi's dismissal.Anyway - a masterpiece, apart from the wrap up, they couldn't have done better. Definitely to be seen in theaters.",Blade Runner 2049
1297,president_tyler,Extremely boring,4,25 September 2019,This movie had me falling asleep and not caring about any of the characters. Literally nothing special happens this movie and the scenes are painfully slow. Cool ideas set in an interesting world but just so boring.,Blade Runner 2049
1298,Michaelangelo152,Probably one of the absolute best sequels in recent years and one of the best films of 2017.,9,9 January 2018,"With the original ""Blade Runner"" (Final Cut) from Ridley Scott being one of my absolute favourite films of all time, I was really happy to see a sequel being made, especially with such names as Denis Villeneuve, Roger Deakins and Ryan Gosling attached to it as well as Ridley Scott, Hampton Fancher and Harrison Ford returning from the first film. Even though I tried not to get too hyped for
 this sequel, there was just something so exciting about seeing a new ""Blade Runner"" film in the cinema and I'm extremely relieved to say that this film is didn't disappoint at all. What Villeneuve and the rest of the crew have pulled off here is nothing short of brilliant. This is possibly one of the best looking films I have ever seen, there were so many jaw-droppingly good shots, that I lost count at some point. From the long takes to the amazing wide-angle shots, lighting and colours, ""Blade Runner 2049"" successfully recaptures the look, tone and feel of the original. It really feels like it's in the same fascinating world that Ridley Scott created over 35 years ago. That's not the only aspect of the film that
 triumphs, though. The plot (which I will not spoil) is extremely intriguing and keeps you guessing and despite a few flashbacks (audio and visual) 
that serve to explain why a certain character is shocked by some sort of discovery, the film really wants you to put your thinking cap on, especially when the script turns a bit more philosophical like in the original. Also, the cast does a terrific
 job, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford work extremely well together even if their characters don't see eye to eye and the supporting cast including Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Jared Leto and Robin Wright all do a fantastic job, too. The film clocks in at 164 minutes and although that seems like it would be too long, the pacing is absolutely excellent, there were no scenes that dragged (for me) and I was not bored at all. The score by one of my all time favourite composers Hans Zimmer and frequent collaborator Benjamin Wallfisch doesn't quite surpass the magnificent work of Vangelis from the original, but succeeds in reimagining it with all the synthy goodness you'd hope for. Overall, I think ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a brilliant accomplishment, it's a technical masterpiece, the plot, acting, action, pacing and score are great, it's successful in capturing the original's
 look, feel and tone and doesn't tarnish the 1982 masterpiece in any way. It may have some small story issues and the run time and pacing may not
 be so appealing to some, but there's no denying it's probably one of the best sequels to come out in recent years and maybe of all time. I didn't think a sequel to a film like ""Blade Runner"" could turn out this good, but Denis Villeneuve has proven himself worthy of such a difficult task, while also making it clear that he is one the best directors working today. I am truly impressed with 
""Blade Runner 2049"".",Blade Runner 2049
1299,yrallabandi,"Beautiful and haunting, but too long.",8,10 January 2018,"Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece. This cannot be debated. Roger Deakins is probably the best cinematographer working today. The shots themselves are beautiful, and the CGI is pretty great too. There is a scene almost midway through where the main character K (brought to life by Ryan Gosling in an awesome performance) where he has a threesome with his holographic girlfriend Joi and a replicant prostitute. This scene has incredible yet subtle effects, and after reading the behind the scenes, it's even more impressive. There's so much going on in this scene thematically, other than the sex scene.I also have to give major props to Denis Villeneuve for retaining the feel of the first film. This definitely feels like it's set in the same universe, yet it doesn't have the ""sequel feeling"" that something like, Marvel, would have. This is its own movie. It doesn't try to set up another movie. That was great. I also have to commend the score. I'd listen to anything Hans Zimmer composes. Yep, I'm a fanboy. Sue me.And again, Ryan Gosling's performance was awesome. Yes, he is noted for staring intensely at something apparently, but he's someone to look out for. He acted really well. Especially in the scene with his memory of the toy horse and whether or not he's a human or replicant. I loved it. And it's pretty obvious at this point, but Harrison Ford was amazing too. The guy's a legend for a reason.That being said though, this movie has issues. Much like the first movie, it also feels slow. Makes sense, given we have so much to take in, but 2049 also feels a little bloated. It's quite long, at 2 hours and 43 minutes. Despite that, some things are not resolved. The replicant revolution doesn't have that big of a role in the movie. And we don't know much about the villain, Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). I feel like some of the wrong stuff was left in the editing room. And sadly, Denis has said there won't be a director's cut. I do also have an issue with another scene in the film, though this may be just me. When Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright) confronts K about something he did, I feel the scene ends a bit too quickly. It should have gone on longer, and more consequences should have arisen out of that. I feel some of this was edited out as well.Overall, I think this is a great film. I liked the first Blade Runner better, but this is nearly as good.",Blade Runner 2049

The movie has many interesting themes and the cinematography is breathtaking.Now like my title suggests if you like movies that are easy to digest and by the numbers then this movie isn't for you, but if you like to think and decipher the movie for yourself then it is a great movie for you. I won't say anything about the story, but you should have watched the first one to understand a lot of key moments in this movie.",Blade Runner 2049
1301,Jasper-8961,An incredible follow up to the original Blade Runner,10,27 January 2018,"Off the bat 'Blade Runner 2049' begins with some truly breathtaking cinematography that continues throughout the whole film. The choice of colour for scenes is extremely attention grabbing. Ryan Gosling nails the role of the replicant ""K"" with his performance during his investigations. Ryan Gosling also has a very fluent relationship with the love interest ""Joi"" played by Ana Des Armas. As well Harrison Ford reprises his role as ""Rick Deckard"" and delivers a great performance as he is very energetic and engaging in all of his scenes. Without discussing the actors or plot, this film brilliant incorporates the themes of its predecessor as well as aiming to introduce new ideas to stand on its own as a fantastic mystery/sci-fi film. As the original Blade Runner influenced a whole generation of sci-fi films, I believe this newer installment will influence other movie sequels to visit their own original movie and then improve.Definitely worth a watch for any kind of viewer 9/10.",Blade Runner 2049
1302,williamdejager,What went wrong?,2,6 October 2017,"I have to admit, as a true Blade Runner fan, I was very skeptical about this movie. As soon as I heard Dennis Villeneuve, Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford would be involved in the process, I began to smile. Especially after seeing the great movie 'Arrival' last year, I was rather confident the legacy of this true, one and only SF-masterpiece would be in great hands. After seeing the movie last night, my worst fears did come true. Blade Runner 2049 is nothing more than a disaster,judging by it's story. True, all the visuals are STUNNING, Deakins did a great job in creating the dystopian world (again) to the screen. The movie is just too long, and the return of Deckard just adds nothing to the story. Ford also failed in portraying Deckard, to me his performance did not echoed the first film, I thought I saw him playing that old Solo again. But the true moment of disgrace, the true error, lies in it's ending. As a true Blade Runner fan, a fan of Rutger Hauers performance, it's just unbelievable how all these people from the first movie made these artistic decisions in this (unwanted) sequel. Maybe they all just tried a little to hard to lift the great legacy of the first movie, but just failed in doing so because of it's artistic heaviness. Like I wrote, the true error lies in it's ending. It left me stunned, gasping for breath after watching Gosling on the stairs, snow begins to fall and we hear the first tunes of Vangelis Tears in Rain. . Unbelieve, it ruined the movie totally. I just don't get it: how is it possible that Scott / Villeneuve made this awful scene? Totally disgraceful! A true slap in the face of that great scene, that one and only historic scene showing Batty on the roof, the monologue every die-hard movie buff will always remember. I'm just lost for words, such a shame..",Blade Runner 2049

It looked fabulous, sounded spectacular, and the story... well let's say I came for the ride and wasn't expecting much. Don't get me wrong I love the original movie but not so much for the story. For me it was always the theme of the movie, the visuals and the world that sparked my interests. It's the lack of further exploring that theme that was setup in the first movie that was my real disappointment. Yes, there is the whole reproduction aspect, but to be honest it could have been further explored. Also it missed some of the grit of the first movie. It looked too perfect. The acting was all right. Loved all the new actors and their parts. Harrison was alright but not great, not his fault but his part very underwritten. I did enjoy every minute of the movie, but just didn't love it as much as I would have wanted. At times it felt as they were so protective and honoring the first that they were scared to push it in new directions.",Blade Runner 2049
1305,psyhocaki,I was hyped about this movie,6,7 November 2019,"Hello everyone. I will be really basic because i dont want to waste my time to write decent review because this really dont deserve. I started reviewing movies because i really cant belive that some movies have above 7.0 and they dont even deserve 7.0! This movie have 8.0 I mean what?!
Okay i started watching it was great cinematic exp great beggining but then, i felt ,i started yawning and i mean YAWNING. Thousands of meaningless sentences that really didnt have nothing to say or to understand (you still can understand whats gonna happen if you know what i mean) or to keep me tense.
Idk did Ridley Scott fall asleep when he was shooting this movie or what. I wanted some more action, better mystery with better written realization, but this, I really lost my time. I was waiting Harison Ford because i thought he will change things in this movie but then again same.
Pointless meaningless sentences and less action. What i mean when i say meaningless senteces. Just compare talking in this movie with example Shutter Island. Shutter Island is based on conversation but the movie keeps me awake, eyes were open all the time, but this one didnt do it, and im a big fan of sci-fi, cyberpunk ,mystery, thriller genres.
I was thinking that this movie will be similar to serie Altered Carbon that i watched.
Good action, thriller, mystery, idea pure perfection , good written scenario sentences, realization.Thats what you need in world of cyberpunk! Total blast with sick ending, like Altered Carbon was. And that i recommend to everyone who likes this genre!
I'm sad i have to give this movie for sci-fi genre a grade like this but well deserved grade, and its only because of cinematic and shots that were taken of cyberpunk vibe.
It has those moments but then again. Its okay that movie is based most of time on conversation investigation and so on, but then do it with a style so i do not YAWN in front of my monitor if you know what i mean. I'll probably never recommend to anyone this movie.  6/10.",Blade Runner 2049
1306,androdeas,"Full Immersion, No Prequel Needed",8,7 October 2017,"Let me preface this by saying I did not like the original Blade Runner from 1982 nor am I a fan of Philip K Dick so naturally I did not read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Which also means this movie rated high on my list. If you did like the original your opinion will not line up with mine.I am in love with this world that has been re imagined in Blade Runner 2049. The opening scene alone with solar farms, flying cars and growing maggots for protein. The future doesn't seem that far away. It looks plausible.Yes, the movie does run a bit long. The pace is slow enough that you can enjoy seeing the sights. And yes, there are some scenes--especially the last part with Harrison Ford and snowflake--that are utterly unnecessary but the entire film is beautiful.The interplay with memories was excellent. Ryan Gosling fit his role very well. For a first time watch most of the plot twists are surprising but could be made stronger with the removal of a few scenes. Settings are wonderful. The grating 80's feel of the original is made subtle. The technology is my favorite part. I want to be a memory maker in the future!",Blade Runner 2049

Nice colour scheme, gorgeous scenic shots, some really cool designs for your classic sci-fi tech.Story-wise, it was okay. Clichéd and predictable, but for casual movie goers it should be your regular ""hero has pretty girlfriend and saves the wold"" plot.What really bothered me was how painfully long it was.
The viewer knows what's going to happen as soon as the scene begins. The viewer understands what's happening and what the character is feeling, the acting and general visuals are strong enough for that.
So why do we have to draw out every single shot of someone staring into the distance, walking through hallways, driving through cities, ... ?Was also disappointed by how little screentime Harrison Ford actually had, considering how heavily they advertised his presence.Nostalgia and low standards might make this movie enjoyable for some, but anyone who prefers action or plot filled films should spend their money elsewhere.",Blade Runner 2049

Jared Leto has it in his contract that he has to act weird in every movie he does. I even really liked Gosling virtual girlfriend which added a very interesting concept to the movie. The slow pacing works in the movies advantage creating such a powerful immersion that will puts you in the movie no matter how bright the moron's phone in front of you is.

I am just left wondering how a movie can make me feel compassionate about artificial intelligent life forms and the human condition of basic emotions.While there is plenty of visuals and excellent narrative within 2049, the definition of the human element in human, 'replicant' and AI forms is what makes the film stand out. Denis Villeneuve made this film into a pilgrimage for those like us who love the strong emotional element in a well detailed science fiction story. If you have seen this and the 1982 Bladerunner made by Ridley Scott(producer for 2049) you will probably come back to seeing this film again and again.

1318,therealarkos,My first 3/10 review.,3,2 September 2018,"The hype surrounding this film (especially from 'High Art' YouTube content creators such as YMS) is very much undeserved.
Because of it - 
'...Cementing itself as one of the best sequels of all time'
is quite objectively wrong.I do find myself stunned at how well some of the settings are blended with CGI, dazzling use of colour, and excellent set design.
But in retrospect, there is almost nothing else to commend. The dialogue is above average, considering its nature as a modern day sequel, and helps to build unique and interesting characters, but is then wasted with an atrocious, unbelievably awful ending. 
There is little to no action, which would help to reinforce stakes, so instead at no point are you remotely concerned for any of the main characters.Even as a thought provocative movie this fails on all fronts. The story is patchy at best and at points many options made by the characters felt unnecessary and unrelated to the situation at hand. Massive plot holes, such as there being numerous way for the vital information withheld to be leaked to the public, completely ruin anything - anything - of worth about this film on that front. It was a very unsatisfying conclusion to the franchise and at this point I almost want a sequel to fix the state of this series of films. Frankly embarrassing.",Blade Runner 2049

Its just that everything is so slow and dull I couldn't care about the positives anymore.I mean the whole world look pretty amazing and definitely succeeds in displaying a dystopian future.The problem is that the dull colors just ads to the fact that for most of the film nothing interesting happens.

This really helped with the sequel as no references were lost on me (or so I hope). Highly recommend for everyone to do the same, as it has been a while since the release of the first one. Secondly, I watched this film in IMAX, to get 20% extra experience. I am glad I did both, as I was rewarded with cinematic sci-fi treat of highest grade. I've seen some reviewers complaining it being slow. Well, I did not even notice how 2.5 hours passed. I was waiting for more. So, if it is slow - it's in a good way - giving a viewer a chance to savor every scene. There is not much else that can be said without spoilers. This is an old-fashion sci-fi that does not rely on CGI visuals to carry the story. The visuals are great, but they are what they should be - backdrop. Also, IMHO a rare case when sequel surpasses the original. I do hope they will go for a sequel, and I do hope they will not make us wait another 35 years.",Blade Runner 2049

1331,oZo61,Undeserved flack,7,28 December 2017,"This is a good movie. Is it as good as the original? That depends. It depends if you think the original was all that, and a bag of chips. I think Blade Runner was extremely overrated. Now, that doesn't its not a great movie, but I just don't agree with the idea that it was a watershed moment in cinematic history.
This movie carries the premise of the original, while modernizing it for a new generation. It does so without being a hack copy, and it avoids retconning the original to the point of being unrecognizable to those of us who saw it opening weekend, 1982.
That is an accomplishment, by anyone's reckoning.
The music is near the same, and thankfully not as overpowering as in the original, and the acting is noteworthy for one main reason. While the original depicts the rogue replicants as having a near manic personality, hidden from society only by the darkness they dwell in, we see in this outing that the replicants have a veneer of docile tranquility stretched thin over a pit of angst and darkness. One senses that they are in a sort of purgatory, somewhere between the Joi AI interface and humans. That there is a real despair the replicants all feel, but can't even admit to feeling. Officer K's own boss exudes a institutionalized bigotry against the replicants that I doubt her character would even acknowledge she possessed.
I may get a lot of flack about not bowing to Scott's original as the seminal Sci Fi movie of the 20th Century, but I do like this entry into the canon. Gosling's performance is excellent as a man who isn't sure about, not only what he is, but why he is as well. It's done with the feel of a person truly walking on eggshells, but not sure where they lie.
Enjoy the deep seated, self-induced paranoia. You may just look in the mirror, to see if YOU have a serial number in YOUR eye.",Blade Runner 2049
1332,Prairie_Wolf,"Not What I Thought It Would Be, But Wonderful, Nonetheless!",8,12 October 2017,"The movie was not what I expected, but it was captivating. It was, complex, intriguing and mesmerizing - keeping my attention focused through the entire 2 hours and 44 minutes. I felt the movie left the viewer wondering if they plan on a third installment - they certainly could go that way.The one thing I felt sorely lacking was the music. The soundtrack in the original Blade Runner was an integral part of the ambiance; the soul and heart of the film. When I hear the music from the original soundtrack, I am immediately transported to a scene, a moment seared forever in my memory, another place and time surreal to our present world. The original soundtrack by Vangelis was haunting, unique - it was the heartbeat of the movie, like blood flowing through the body, the music flowed through the film, imbuing it with a life of its own.Acting was top-notch. The sets and imagery were outstanding, immersing the viewer in the world of 2049. Just as with the first movie, there were enough plot twists, questions left unanswered - while other questions were answered, but done so that the viewer was left with more uncertainty.And what of the dog? :-)",Blade Runner 2049
1333,jff-johnson,Has everything the original has except...,8,10 October 2017,"Some of the philosophy is missing.It would not surprise me if viewers under thirty five years old dislike this movie, mostly because of the pace and tempo. Blade Runner 2049 is definitely a throwback to the pre-ADHD era of move making, often barely any movement and driven by the performance of the actors rather than special effects.I saw the original Blade Runner when I was eight years old (I was not an abused child) the finer points of the plot and dialog were obviously lost on me but the imagery of a movie like that stays with you for a lifetime. I remember revisiting the film when I was old enough to appreciate it and being awestruck all over again by the complex subtlety of the story. The replicants had a desperate desire for life and was the motivation for their every action, the underlying question of what makes us human and who decides what that is?, the playing god meeting your maker thing, at the end the replicants who are perceived as being not human show a display of humanity that blows my mind every time I see it. The closest BR-2049 comes to asking such questions is the JOi character who is absolutely mesmerizing.I can't imagine watching BR-2049 again after seeing it through inexperienced eyes would have the same effect. The film is breathtakingly beautiful, the acting flawless, the story is okay but it just doesn't get inside your head like the original. I have heard people complain when a movie leaves them with more questions than answers, that makes movies special when done properly. This movie was made to be seen on a big screen but it's missing the deeper philosophical nature of the original.On a side note the director has expressed interest in making Dune I think that would be awesome, I wish he would consider a live action Cowboy Bebop.",Blade Runner 2049

1335,toppin,Beautiful,9,7 October 2017,"In a word, beautiful. A single word isn't enough of course. I'm a huge fan of the original, I was too young when I first watched it though and remember thinking another word – boring. At 12 I suppose you don't want to watch a movie that ponders deep philosophical questions, you just want a good guy, a bad guy and some action. As you get older, naturally, the complicated philosophical questions gain more relevance, black and white blurs into shades of gray...This is long film but the time flashed past in an instant, no scene was unnecessary, poorly written or badly acted. Some scenes stood above the rest though including a gorgeous 2-on-1 love scene that wasn't actually a 2-on-1 love scene at all, a brilliant conversation with a 'creator of memories' and the long awaited re-introduction of Rick Deckard in a fantastically realised derelict 'future Vegas'.This is also one of the most visually stunning movies that I've ever seen (Roger Deakins must win an Oscar) the soundtrack is wonderfully minimalist (I only missed Vangelis a little), and the acting is everything that you could ask for.Why not 10/10 you might ask?

Not only a movie but a journey into another world that may not be so distant, it is stunning and brilliant. One thing i absolutely love in sci fi movies, games and TV shows is quality sound effects and music and this is the best i have heard. A must see at the cinema to experience that sound, and then those visuals on the big screen, truly breathtaking. Back to the run time yes 90 minutes is fine for a comedy or basic action movie but for a masterpiece like this to come in under 140 minutes would not do it justice.

1340,jonaswilmann,High art? Hmm ...,3,18 October 2017,"""Blade Runner 2049"" comes off incredibly long and boring. Not because of the slow pacing – ""Blade Runner"" had slow pacing too, but had the viewer hypnotized – but because there's no interesting thoughts present and nothing new really. Thematically the movie is exploring the same questions (about being human etc.) as the first movie did 35 years ago. And the few 'new' additions to the Blade Runner universe are totally devoid of originality. Take for instance K's hologram-wife. Not only are those scenes totally unnecessary (that three-way scene, jeez!), but we've seen the concept so many times before (for instance in Spike Jonze's ""Her""). Apart from that, the movie is riddled with plot holes and stuff that just don't make very much sense. Tyrell get's killed off by a replicant and his Nexus-7 prototype runs off, shortly after Tyrell Corp rushes a line of replicants with OPEN ENDED lifespans and no other safety device than implanted memories (that didn't work with Rachael). No. Just no. Furthermore we are told the nexus 9 are programmed to obey. However K lies to his superiors, constantly acts on his own, acts emotionally from early on in the movie. He does not obey at all. And the revelation of a replicant child being born has people talking about revolution. Robin Wrights Joshi says it will 'break the world'. But how? Rachael was the only replicant able to give birth and Tyrell took that secret with him. Neither the few remaining Nexus 8's or the 9's can give birth – so no, it doesn't break the world. It doesn't break anything. But the movie really wants us to take this very seriously (Hans Zimmer is doing his loudest to make us sit in awe). And it gets even worse. Later we learn that Jared Leto's ridiculous bad guy Wallace (those monologues!) strives to learn the secret of making replicant babies. But why? That undermines the entire idea of replicants. Tailormade slaves with superhuman ability; strength, intelligence etc. that are controlled by implanted memories. Having replicants make babies the old way would offer zero control of the outcome and the child replicants would have to grow up, go to school, make their own memories. What's the point then? And what's the difference, from just having some people make babies? A lot of people has called ""Blade Runner 2049"" 'intellectual sci-fi' and so forth, but I found it to be quite the contrary. The movie forcefully demands you to accept it as highly intelligent art, but if you scratch the surface, you'll find something very different.",Blade Runner 2049
1341,ianrobertdavidson,A refreshing sequel that is more art than commercial,10,5 October 2017,"So on first viewing I am delighted to say that this is a true sequel to the original yet able to stand alone. Unlike other franchise reboots this chooses to pay homage to the original and thankfully avoids the temptation of being unabashedly commercial. I am a big fan of the original. I might even give BR2049 a 10 on later viewings. It wasn't what I was expecting so I can say a big thumbs up to those critics (and YouTubers) who agreed not to publish any spoilers. I found myself admiring the blade runner 2049 visuals without finding them distracting or in any way self-serving. Bravo to both Denis and Roger for pulling that off. I have to say that this is a true Sci-fi movie, a movie that will satisfy die hard fans of Sci-fi books. Hampton Fancher has done a truly awesome job of creating story and a script which would stand up well next to the bibliography of Philip K Dick. At no stage did this movie feel like an imitation of the first. The cast is a great fit, the score is sublime, the pacing it similar but different, the cinematography outstanding, the story and script original, the whole feel seems just right. Am I alone in this appreciation? Probably not. Half the audience will have never have seen the original in the cinema and yet we all clapped in unison, old and young when the credits began to run.

If you are concerned about the length, do not worry, it will not disappoint.How I felt after the movie: What made blade runner so impressive is how it made you really feel for the main character, even though he does not talk much.

1348,iromashchenko,Praiseworthy sequel of a cult sci-fi film,8,13 October 2017,"This is so good that Denis Villeneuve took the task to make the sequel here. Probably, he is the best candidate for this role. The great operator Roger Dickens and composer Hans Zimmer have well accompanied him. Still the Canadian director has not managed to reach the level of the original. The new Bladerunner is beautiful from many perspectives. Popular and talented actors, amazing antiutopian landscapes, intriguing plot. Villeneuve even managed to insert several unexpected turns. The atmosphere of the first part has been preserved and developed. The same cynical and acid world, where replicates live next to people. The authors have made a solid job by giving a deep thought to the film's background having embodied it in three viral short movies. This was not only a well- mastered move, but also a pleasant gift to all cine lovers. In other words, this is high quality fantastic movie, which cannot be observed every day. To a large extent it reminds Spielberg's Minority Report. Both were shot after the works of Philip K. Dick. As opposed to the Minority Report, Bladerunner 2049 has one, but serious fault. It is less original than the first one. Undoubtedly this is a talented and unbelievable sequel, but its effect is much weaker than of the first joint. The first Bladerunner has once shaken the world of sci-fi. The viewer has so many times seen fantastic worlds, analogous to the one shown in the Bladerunner that today the first film seems a bit primitive. This nonetheless should not underestimate its historical significance. In general there is no willingness to criticize the new Villeneuve movie. He has truly managed to do something beyond what other directors could have done – to produce a sequel one may not be ashamed of.",Blade Runner 2049

The original film is one of my favorites and I was interested to see what Denis would do with it. I was completely blown away by his cold, dark, and somehow beautiful world. From the opening shot I was in awe at the beauty, visually and musically. Every performance is fantastic with the highlight being Gosling. The story was fresh while still paying respect to the original. While it is very long, it still manages to constantly keep the audience in awe or in complete suspense. The dark noir style and themes still releases an uplifting and satisfying ending.

1354,databear,an Under cooked rough cut,3,6 October 2017,"I'm a fan of the original, and I was looking forward to seeing this squeal. The look of the film was stunning, but at times felt over the top and contrived. The main character, I never got on side with. He was so blank, plain and uninvolving that I was not drawn in at all. This is a new breed of replicant, one that is fully compliant. He lacks any real drive or passion. He just fades into the background. Even hes' holo girlfriend does not make him attractive to watch. His expressions are like a Ken doll. They never waver or give a glimpse of any kind of inner workings.Sometimes there was great silence, then the music would take over and was over baring. The editing really felt stilted. Like it was just a rough cut. Some scenes meandered, and the gaps between lines felt uncomfortable. Perhaps the director lacks an understanding of English speech and cadence. The plot was slow, and seemed to be all over the place. I thought the main idea was a bit simple. No great philosophical questions about human existence here. I didn't understand the baddie of the film. The new replicant creator, Wallace. He was just 2d evil.The Deckard character comes into the script much too late. The already struggling plot just gets drawn out more. Focus is lost from the main character.Other times it felt like it was giving the audience a big wink to the original movie. The look of some characters, lines from the original. All of this just worked more to distance me from the movie. It also came across as cheesy and naff. Overall I was very disappointed. The script really let it down.Since seeing this film, i have watched the three shorts that fill in the gaps of plot between the original film and this 2049 one. So much more happens in these shorts than the entire whole film 2049. It would have been better if this film covered all of that span, rather than giving us this thin plot that is over stretched.",Blade Runner 2049

1357,Mr-Dimes,The use of sound to wake up sleeping audience members is remarkable. SPOILER FREE,5,7 October 2017,"Bladerunner (1982) was an undeniably influential film: a dark, unforgiving world played host to a lineup of memorable characters who expanded the world and narrative. Ridley Scott successfully snowballed tension and mystery throughout the run-time, creating a unique and memorable experience. But can we say the same about Bladerunner 2049?The impression I got from the first 5 minutes would have led me to say ""quite possibly."" However, 2 hours and 40 minutes later I was not so sure. The film starts with our new Bladerunner, played by Ryan Gosling, on a mission to find a Replicant, played by Dave Batista. The introduction to the film ticked the boxes for what I wanted to see; striking cinematography, synthesised music akin to the original , intriguing characters, mystery and raw violence. The majority of these points (with the exception of action) became irritating. After almost 3 hours I found myself thinking ""I don't want to see Ryan Gosling quietly looking into the middle distance! Get on with the plot!"" The story itself was interesting enough and in my opinion makes for a logical expansion to the questions raised in the original film. But with what can be an excruciatingly slow pace, you feel every single one of the 164 minutes.The one thing the film did well, was to follow or proceed periods of quietness with loud sounds or music to wake up anyone in the audience who might be drifting. Sitting at the back I could watch as people's heads slumped to one side, only to be jolted awake by an especially loud synthesiser swell.NEGATIVES: - Painfully slow pace. - Unnecessary run time. - No unicorns.POSITIVES: - Looks beautiful. - Music is brilliant (although Repetitive). - It's nice to see Harrison Ford again... I guess...To conclude, I will quote what my Dad said as we left the cinema: ""it was good but far too long, they could cut out all the arty shots and make it an hour shorter!"" and when I asked him he said ""I think I only feel asleep a few times.""",Blade Runner 2049

At one point, the main character ""k"" thinks that he is the child, and we the audience also thinks so too, only to find out that we have been tricked!!I was waiting for Harrison ford to show up maybe like 30 minutes into the movie but he showed up at the last 30 minutes. I waited many years for this movie it just didn't fulfill my needs.It's an hour too long,it has a very weak story-line, so weak that it is almost non-existent and the Important question from the original movie doesn't get answered. I wanted to actually find out the origins of Deckard(Harrison Ford) to see weather he was a human or a replicant. That is not shown but we do find out the he had a child. That was the only good thing about the movie.The movie was very dark and I cannot imagine what the people watching it in 3D must have felt.(must have been very dark)Blade Runner 2049 could have been a lot more but instead it wasn't.

1359,olof_the_viking,Massively disappointing story.,3,18 October 2017,"Having perused the audio book and Blade Runner recently, I have to say it: this is not a sequel, it just took some of the characters and put them in a Ryan Gosling movie. The traces of the Phillip K Dick ideas don't seem to fit in with the story. Many details from the original story seem to have been pasted on just to make it appear to be connected. Like so many other recent ""sequels"" have done. Shameful. Storyline is childish and the few twists are pretty transparent. Strangely this is underlined by the silly flashbacks. Does anyone need to have every clue pointed out this explicitly? A waste of good music. And why the way too noisy special effects?",Blade Runner 2049
1360,georgekaplan2,You will like it if you are a teenage boy,5,7 October 2017,"Unfortunately you can no longer have a decent science fiction film that isn't intended for a teenage boy (Arrival came close, but not close enough). Like many other similar films, Blade Runner 2046 appeals to all the teenage-boy dreams, fears and anxieties about women, adventure, and being a quiet terse-speaking chosen one. Sure, Villeneuve's visuals are beautiful, and the roaring music helps, but this is where it all largely stops. As always, Villeneuve is an incredibly boring and predictable story-teller. The characters are all stock or adorned with some disability to make them seem ""different."" Philosophically speaking and in character-building this film has nothing on the original Blade Runner, a film that was addressed to a significantly more mature audience.Bottom line: don't be mislead by the hype and early rating spike. You wouldn't hate yourself for seeing this films. The visuals are indeed modestly amusing. But I assure you, unlike the original, this Blade Runner will not give you anything to think about. Apart from how Hollywood tries to dissect a teenage boy brain, that is. (Other similar films: Source Code, Edge of Tomorrow).",Blade Runner 2049

It's a really good, not great, film that has its problems but is definitely worth watching and re-watching. It's visually amazing, has really good music, and solid performances. Sadly the pacing is what I have a problem with, it feels 30 minutes longer than it really is. Now to my opinion on this film. This is an incredible, beautiful, and just overall well made film. Roger Deakins should finally win the academy award for best cinematography, there is not a single frame I didn't like in this film. The acting was fantastic, everyone did a great job but the stand-out performance for me was Ana De Armas, her character was very interesting and she did a great job portraying that character. The music is fantastic, it never feels like the original score but it's not trying too. This score stands on its own, and so does the film. The pacing never felt bad to me, it's a 2 hour and 43 minute film and it feels like one in the best possible way.

It could have been better if the plot would had been decent or they even had tried to make it decent. Now there were all too many useless and dull side characters and frivolous complexities in the story. In addition, the script and dialogue were awful: they would have worked better if the movie had been cut till 1,5 or 2 hours of total runtime. Dialogue was repetitive. From the beginning, you just wait that OK, when does the action start. There are action sequences, but they are short and uninteresting. There's some nudity, too, but those parts with boobs are rather lame. It's a pity.Visuals and soundtrack were excellent as well as all gorgeous females in the cast. Otherwise, it is an over-long and boring movie to watch. Avoid and rent it instead if you want to watch it.",Blade Runner 2049
1364,sbabajim,In one word: Masterpiece,10,8 October 2017,"First of all, I would like to start by saying where I stand. I watched the original movie with my parents in the theaters in 1992, when I was 12 years old. Although I was too young to fully grasp the philosophical explorations, I was completely taken away. The movie changed the way I saw films after that. I realized that cinema is a magical and personal experience that can trigger your emotions and your thoughts in ways that you couldn't even imagine. I guess each one of the film-goers has a movie like that to remember, a movie that signaled in a way their passage to a more mature way of watching films. For me that movie was Blade Runner. Having said all that, I had high expectations and a great fear going to the theater to watch Blade Runner 2049. High expectations because Villeneuve hardly ever misfires and because Ryan Gosling is one of the most charismatic actors of the last 15 years. Great fear, because I knew that I might be utterly disappointed. Well, in three words What a delivery! That was one of the most beautiful, heart-breaking, breathtaking and mesmerizing films that I have watched in the last 5 years. A true work of art. I found it amazing how the film functioned both as a sequel and as a remake. OK, it was a sequel for the obvious reasons. The story takes place 30 years later (2049 instead of 2019) and some of the major characters of the first movie (most importantly Deckard played by Harrison Ford) play a crucial part in the development of the plot. It is a remake, however, because although the story is quite different, the film feels like an adaptation of the original film: the ethereal slow pace (what a bold decision!), the brilliant soundtrack that resembles Vangelis' tunes, the gloomy atmosphere, the suffocating urban landscape, the rain and the element of water, the darkness, the sadness, but most importantly the exploration of the same philosophical and existential questions; what is memory? What does it mean to remember? Can we ever be sure that our memory is an exact representation of what actually happened? What does it mean to be human? What is the essence of being a human? What does ""father"" mean? How do we feel about whoever we think or believe that created us? Blade Runner 2049 was made by a group of people who truly respected the original movie and the result well in one word: Masterpiece.",Blade Runner 2049

I will say I have not seen the original nor can I offer true movie critic insight on the blade runner storyline. However, as a sci-fi/ fantasy fan, I found this dry - lacking in both drive from the characters and true emotional buy-in from the viewer. I was hopeful to see more of Harrison Ford but didn't in my 90 minutes of viewing. (Sorry Harrison!) Ryan Gosling's acting is the only reason this got above 3 stars for me and the only reason I watched for as long as I did. I would not recommend you spend money on this film unless you're a diehard Bladerunner fan. Thankfully I watched for free and the only fruit of my 90 minutes was: 1. seeing how freakishly close Alexa is becoming to ""Joi"" (Another point for the film's narrative about AI); 2.

1369,adamduhaf,"A tale of life, struggle, vision an peace",10,22 October 2017,"I was thoroughly surprised by this movie. Won't beat around the bush: it is one of the deepest reaching, most touching pictures I've seen in my life. It is a worthy successor of the original Blade Runner. Just go and watch it. If you're interested in a bit more detail, here you go:the original Blade Runner is a slow flowing picture, that really hits you after the second time you've watched it. That's when the weight of things this classic masterpiece details gets to you. Blade Runner 2049 is the same. It delves deep into questions probably all humans ask themselves at some point in this day and age: what does the future hold for us if we keep living this way? Where does artificial life lead us? Are we ready to be the Creators of life? Should we do it at all? Are we able to accept what we've created, and will we be able to live up to it? Where does artificial life end, and where does human life start? And amongst all the turbulence of the future that awaits us, will we find our own peace?You may or may not find the answers for these after watching Blade Runner 2049, but I'm sure you'll ask yourself some of the same questions.It truly is a visionary picture, which offers a story that will squeeze your throat with sadness at times (quite a few times), others it will make you think about our future, and holds an ending you will not forget: it breaks your heart with a hammer and stomps on the pieces, but at the same time it creates catharsis and offers its own bittersweet happy ending.All this made whole with absolutely fantastic acting from both supporting actors like Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Carla Juri, Jared Leto and actors playing main characters like Harrison Ford or the brilliant Ryan Gosling, who gave one of the best performances I've seen in years. The visuals of the movie are worthy of the original Blade Runner as well: a joy to watch, but a pain to imagine it could exist- a perfect setting for the story. The music is disturbing and beautiful at the same time, an organic part of the experience, really enjoyed it.All in all, I loved every single second of it: the heart churning moments, the subtle details, symbolic moments, the slow pace, the eerie yet pleasant music, the golden-dusty visuals, everything.

So I won't say anything about the story or the plot, just know it's good. A lot better than I expected really. You have to know I absolutely adore the first Blade Runner and know the movie in and out. So scepticism came kinda natural to me.But boy was I wrong. Not only did Villeneuve manage to make this a sequel which can easily stand next to the original, but he avoided the trap of making this movie a fan-service and to put as much reference to the original into his movie to please the hardcore Blade Runner crows. No, he made this movie his own, while expanding the universe created by Ridley without simply copying it. It just works...like the iPhone 33 will in 2049 ;)The visuals are striking, the soundtrack pays great homage to the original while having a more bombastic and frankly dark tone to it, the acting it superb, the way they introduce Deckard is simply fantastic and the way the story unfolds just adss to the whole mythology of Blade Runner.I'm so very pleased to have viewed this movie without spoiling anything for myself concerning either the visuals and story and urge you to do the same.

1371,bendres-04329,"Not Just a Sequel, But Also a Film to Remember",9,31 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is possibly the best movie of the year, joining the likes of Logan and It Comes at Night so far. Not only is it potentially one of the best movies of the year, it is up there with the best sequels of all time. It doesn't bring out the old characters we love and have them do the same exact thing except with their children (Even though I did enjoy Force Awakens), it builds upon themes that were in the previous film. It probes more questions such as if replicants can be considered humans, what about A.I., does society or our inner selves determine what we think of ourselves, and many more.The story is fantastic as it constantly peaks the audience's interest and keeps them engaged, even when scenes that would usually draw out in a typical movie are interesting and propelling the plot. While it is constantly moving, the film also takes its' time with scenes, allowing us to connect with the characters and take in the visuals. Denis Villeneuve proves yet again that he is the best new filmmaker with his most stunning film yet with the help of the equally incredible Roger Deakins. Ryan Gosling gives a performance we've seen from him but somehow with even more emotion from his eyes and his character has a beautiful arc. This movie constantly builds and improves its' predecessor. Harrison Ford's character is given charisma I felt lacked in the original. One complaint is that I feel Jared Leto's villain, which he did play very well, could use more presence. While the inner conflict is incredible, the exterior conflict could use a bit more urgency. This movie is a fantastic sequel and a blockbuster that doesn't involve quips and blue lights in the sky. It asks serious question and gives stunning visuals. It's 2 hours and 45 minutes but I felt as though an hour had passed once the credits rolled.",Blade Runner 2049
1372,celestine1307,A Masterpiece Like The Original,10,7 October 2017,"I love the original from Ridley Scott. It's a masterpiece of a film. Especially the final cut which is what 2049 is a follow up to. So, let me tell you straight up, if you hated the original, if you hate slow films, if you hate films in general, why are you even here? Anyways if you said yes to the above, you probably have a good chance of claiming 2049 to be boring, mundane, waste of time etc and please stop reading this.But the rest of you who are still reading this, Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel that not only lives up to the original, but also MAY even surpass it. The original film had an impact on the industry, influencing countless films after it's release. I feel that 2049 may generate a similar impact. It remind us why films exist. This is the film that will encourage and influence upcoming filmmakers to just grab a camera immediately and make films. (or maybe discourage too, cause lets be real we won't be the next Roger Deakins or Denis Villeneuve. We won't be on their level. Oh god, this is starting to get depressing) It will bring a new batch of audiences into the world of film.Unlike other cash grab sequels that choose to sell tickets, by over relying on their intellectual properties, 2049 is the rare sequel that honors what its predecessor was. That was what Denis Villeneuve promised us. He did not want any other director to mess up a sequel to Blade Runner and took the challenge of making the film himself. He transport us back to the world we love, as well as, the noir aspects that was what made the original iconic. The visuals are breathtaking. You can freeze frame any frame from the film and gape in pure orgasmic levels. Roger Deakins man, he needs to get that Oscar for this. The whole production design and sound design is so atmospheric transcending you into the world. The visuals may be one of the few things that clearly surpass the original.Other than the visuals being iconic in the original, the original was profoundly emotional and intimate. However, based off my initial reaction, 2049 has more emotional impact. It brings us down deeper layers than just making us question whether Harrison Ford is a replicant. It is way bigger than that, trust me, no spoilers. Speaking of Harrison Ford, this is that career revisiting role that can be phenomenal or just plain old phoning it in. And let me tell you, it was the former of the two. Just like Stallone did in Creed, Ford gave his all and we haven't even seen this side of him, no, not even in Force Awakens.Ryan Gosling is a leading man. Are we still questioning that? Alright I will admit, La La Land Ryan Gosling was alright, he wasn't great or anything. But come on, Gosling can carry a film. Note I said film, not movie. His character is the one audiences follow and his journey is so riveting and visceral. Along the way he is being supported by Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks. I won't spoil their characters but boy, were they intriguing and engaging to watch. Jared Leto and Dave Bautista isn't in the film as much but they were great too.As perfect as I want the film to be, it wasn't. But I only have nitpicks. I don't like certain uses of flashbacks and in moments, like certain shots and scenes felt a little overlong. Yeah, minor problems that can be forgotten easily and please don't use as an excuse to make into different cuts. (Yeah I am looking at you Ridley)In the end, 2049 just proves, yet again, Director Denis Villeneuve is the new master director. Similar to how Kubrick, Hitchcock, Scorsese was to their generations when they were at their peaks, Denis Villeneuve is for our modern generation. I say, give him anything he wants, Dune, Cleopatra, James Bond, Star Wars. Every film he directed so far, I love. OK fine, Maelstrom was weird, I didn't get it. And 2049 may easily be my favorite of his films. It will be interesting to watch how he will progress from here on out and where his journey will take him. Blade Runner 2049 is a film from a huge fan of the original. Strictly a film, not a movie. Don't go in expecting a popcorn action flick that features robot, well in this case, replicant testicles, (F TRANSFORMERS 2, whatever it is called).",Blade Runner 2049

1374,komeru,2040 hours of Ryan walking.,8,17 January 2018,"I'm serious, most of the movie is Ryan walking, somewhere or other, very slowly! I get the visuals are stunning, but too much time is spent admiring the scenery. Also parts of the premise are under-cooked. Mainly, Jared Leto's character, Neander Wallace, wants to know how to make replicates that can reproduce because raising a grown person to 20 years of age is supposedly easier than manufacturing a replicate...wtf. And somehow this genius thinks it's actually a good idea to give a slave race that's stronger than them, the ability to reproduce. Consequently, this would also bring the ability to mutate and evolution, but whatever. I also had issues with some of the performances and found that I didn't care quite as much about the characters as I should.Not to say it's all bad the detective work was interesting, it doesn't spoon feed you, and it's hypnotic and visually rich. Because it's brilliant at times it's just all the more frustrating where it",Blade Runner 2049
1375,bram-81557,Blade Runner 2049,6,9 October 2017,"Let's begin positive. Blade Runner 2049 is a lot more ambitious than the original movie from 1982, with a boring Harrison Ford in the leading role. In the new sequel Ryan Gosling plays a new version of a replicant (called K) and it's very descent compared with Ford 35 years ago. Gosling is at his best in the scenes he plays together with Ana de Armas, who is a virtual lust object/ housewife (Joi) in the film. That part about Ana made me really thing about the 2013 movie 'Her', and was one of the better parts of the movie I think. Also the visuals (less then i expected), landscapes, city's and especially the score were bigger, and sometimes HUGE. All those things were the perfect elements to make a movie you totally get sucked in with. Unfortunately Denis Villeneuve didn't manage to stick all these parts together, what results is a movie what wants to be gigantic but ends up disappointing. By 'ends up disappointing' I don't mean the end of the story, but the whole movie in general. The plot of the sci-fi movie, and how it is told, is not that good I think. The first part of the movie (until K thinks he is the son) is much too long and exhausting. It's a build up to a twist that everybody already saw coming after watching 20 minutes of the movie. But that's not really the case. The case is that 20/30 minutes after this twist there is another twist that makes the whole first tiresome 90 minutes totally irrelevant. Only the 'more human than human' part lives one. I think this part can be okay and is interesting. Sadly also this theme fails to come forward in the plot. Jared Leto? I have really nothing to say about him. I loved the kind of sex scene between K and Joi. The scene between Gosling and Ford in the casino/music hall was also something special. The shots from above the city were stunning. Harrison Ford was okay, the character Luv was not very extended but played well. And again the score is enormous. Enough necessities to just go and see this movie in cinema. One tip: don't be wearily if you see this movie.",Blade Runner 2049

It has the same style and pace as the original, however somehow even though it's significantly longer it ""flows"" much better.

1379,Zed1999,"Like father, like son.",8,6 August 2020,"The sequel to 1982's BLADE RUNNER is not only a respectful and faithful follow-up to its predecessor, but - amusingly - it bears almost the exact same strengths and weaknesses. The first thing I want to say to whoever finds themselves reading this review is that if you are not patient, or have a short attention-span, then you will not like this movie. Like the first film, BLADE RUNNER 2049 takes its sweet time with some of the scenes and dialogue and admittedly, yes, comes off a little pretentious. That's not to imply that it's a bad film; rather I consider it a bit of a masterpiece. The soundtrack is astonishingly impressive, and I think that Ryan Gosling's performance was superb. I may even go so far to say that not only is he on-par with how great Harrison Ford was, but that he even surpasses him to a degree. On the subject of Ford's character, Deckard, it's nice to see our ""hero"" make a comeback in this film, and for a perfectly logical reason. Alongside Jared Leto's chilling character and the extremely sexy Ana de Armas, it's safe to say this film has a pretty solid cast. Denis Villeneuve (popular for ARRIVAL and SICARIO) is a sharp director with a good eye - some of the cinematography in this movie even rivals the first BLADE RUNNER. So, just what are the problematic aspects of this film? Ironically, it seems BLADE RUNNER 2049 is *too* faithful to the original. For whatever reason, this already slow and badly-paced movie felt the need to be almost an hour longer than the first one. Some of the talky-talky scenes - while necessary and somewhat interesting - just go on. And on. And on. And on. The pacing was bad in the first movie, and I'm sorry, it was even worse in this one. I'd chalk that up to its gargantuan run-time of nearly three hours. I think they could've cropped it down a little. Furthermore, what the hell is even happening in this movie? Something about a little girl? What exactly is the motivation of the (admittedly lacklustre) villain? Wait, who's the lady with the missing eye and what does she want? Is there not gonna be some bad-ass fight scene with Leto's Niander Wallace character? I tell you, I've watched the film three times now, and I honestly don't know. This was a problem that plagued the original film, too, but at least that one had a somewhat more straight objective for the character. I've given this film an 8/10 (just like BLADE RUNNER) solely because of how well it connects to the previous one, and because it actually feels like the same dystopian situation, just thirty years later. If you enjoyed the first film, you'll like what's to offer here, but if you didn't... yeah. Also, don't expect an action film. Yes, there are intense fights here and there, explosions and whatnot, but these are too far and few between to class this movie under that particular genre. More than anything, it's an art movie. And like most 'arty' kinda movies, it under-performed at the box office, just like - yep, you guessed it - its daddy, BLADE RUNNER. Of course, money means nothing when your movie is good, and thankfully, more or less, that's the case here. Despite there being technically numerous sequels to Philip K. Dick's DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? this movie is not based off any of them (and trust me, it's for the better.) Do I think this movie has a long, stretched out plot? Sure. Do I think it's worse than the average sci-fi movie? Of course not. I think what I'm trying to say is that while its predecessor is just slightly superior, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is a great definition of a 'faithful sequel' that can stand on its own two feet. No, a sequel isn't the most inspired thing in the world, but this film sure goes against that stereotype. So go ahead and check it out. You never know, if you miss out on this brilliant example of refined cinema you may find yourself yelling ""GOD DAMNIIIIT!"" at the top of your lungs before knocking over a chair.",Blade Runner 2049

It takes everything the first film does well and massively improves them, like the world-building and the symbolism and the special effects. The cinematography is breathtaking and the directing is a masterclass, much credit goes to Roger Deakins and Denis Villenueve. Ryan Gosling doesn't have a character arc so much as a character circle which is refreshing and presents a nice message. All the performances are good, nothing great, they all work really well for the roles. There's lots of imagery, I noticed a lot of eye imagery which has connections to the soul. The sound design and score were really nice. My only problems with the film are that some scenes last too long like the scene where Ryan Gosling is exploring where Harrison Ford is, the film as a whole I felt was paced well and didn't feel it's length but some scenes dragged. Also some of the audio was a bit echoey and hard to hear. Maybe that was to reflect the emptiness of the characters but I don't know for sure. On the whole a fantastic experience, more films like this should be made",Blade Runner 2049
1382,NakamuraUbermensch,A film that will definitely not be lost in time.,10,18 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is absolutely everything we hoped for and even more. Although I don't love the original Blade Runner, I understand how unique that movie is and why everyone loves it so much. The cold atmosphere, the memorable dialogue, the unique dystopian world, I've seen very few movies that can match the greatness of the original Blade Runner and somehow, Blade Runner 2049 manages to do just that, and most importantly, it goes beyond replicate (pun intended) the feelings of the original movie, it proposes more questions, introduces more fascinating characters, and for me, it is a better movie.The cinematography is gorgeous, not just gorgeous, it's one of the best of this decade, if Roger Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this, there's no justice in the world. The directing is remarkable too, Denis Villeneuve is now officially one of the greatest filmmakers alive, at the same time he creates a masterpiece in style, he creates a masterpiece in substance. Nothing is ever gratuitously on screen, everything and everyone has so much depth, and this is one of the many things that make Blade Runner 2049 so fascinating, it's a work of such passion that even if you don't like it, you have to admit it's absurdly well done.I tried a lot, but I couldn't find a single flaw in this amazing film. The acting is impeccable, Ryan Gosling nails it delivering a character I'd never expect to love that much. The soundtrack is great too, Zimmer and Wallfisch aren't confined to remake the original songs from Vangelis, they do some nice tracks, but like Dunkirk (also by Hans Zimmer, not a coincidence), the music just shines when you're watching it. It's part of the experience, sometimes harmonic, sometimes chaotic, all the tracks contribute a lot to the immersion and even more to the tension, you don't expect a slow movie to be this thrilling.I just can't stop thinking about Blade Runner 2049 since I left the theater, it's a film that moved me deeply and I can't wait to watch it again, so I beg you, if you're a Blade Runner fan and haven't watched 2049 yet, please watch it as soon as you can, and I guarantee you won't regret it. And if you didn't like the original Blade Runner as much as you wanted to, that's your chance, give Blade Runner 2049 a try, and if it works, you'll have an experience you'll never forget.",Blade Runner 2049
1383,louisson,Waste of time,2,17 October 2017,"I got suckered into BLADE RUNNER 2049 because some ""profound"" critics described it as a ""search for identity"". Baloney. It has the intellectual depth of a 9-year-old. The production creates a giant dome and then fills it with peanuts--a story so simple it can be summarized in less than 1/2-page. Ryan Gosling is amazingly flat- lined--and through all his trials and fights, his hair is never out of place, as if made out of cast-iron. Once Harrison Ford comes on the scene, the contrast highlights how shallow Gosling's acting is in this film. Also, at over 2-1/2 hours, I was amazed at how many non- sequiturs there were: ""How did we get from here to there?"" I asked far too many times. Also, there is nothing new here, nothing creative or imaginative that I didn't see in the 17 minutes of previews of 6 or 7 other IMAX films full of explosions, post-nuclear landscapes, yada- yada-yada.

1386,camarshall-36934,Not my cup of tea - but absolutely wonderful.,10,21 October 2017,"Now. I am coming to Blade Runner a little late. 35 years late, in fact. In 1982 I was married to a wife who only ever wanted to watch Rom-Coms. Sadly Sci-Fi was off the viewing agenda, despite the fact that I had a colleague (Niall) who lived 'Blade Runner 1' and managed to bring a line from it into our work every day making me want to see it. Thirty five years and one divorce later, I managed to catch up with BR1 and BR2 in the same fortnight, at the encouragement of my latest ex. How times change. I am not a sci-fi fan. Towering cities and flying cars usually turn me straight off but the moody, near-apocalyptic atmosphere of BR1 and the human/non human emotional conflicts really caught my imagination. In BR2 I was astounded at how accurately Denis Villeneuve picked up the cyber-ball and ran with it so easily, recreating the same atmosphere and continuing a complex story-line so deftly and seamlessly. It could have been Ridley Scott himself directing. I should have expected something good though. 'Arrival' showcased Villeneuve's amazing sensitivity and skill as a director so I should have known better (despite the fact that he didn't know the difference between an interpreter and a translator and assumed that 'interpreters' could interpret all languages!) That forgiven, he did a marvellous job with 'Arrival'. Even though I am not a sci-fi fan 'Blade Runner 2049' engaged me totally -in particular the unchanged appearance of one of the original characters - and I am not talking about Harrison Ford! I had to look up how that was done. My only criticism of the film is that Ryan Gosling seemed to have used botox throughout the film. His face remained largely frozen. It was like watching 'Buster Keaton IS Blade Runner'. Shame, as he is capable of so much more. But, he might have been directed to play Rick Deckard as originally written, not as played by Harrison Ford. Who knows? Anyway - at three hours, this is a long film with a sad plot twist at the end that caught me out. This is worth waiting for.Unusually, for a genre that I don't generally like, this gets a ten out of ten from me and, I surprise myself in saying that I would like to see this subtle and thoughtful film again.",Blade Runner 2049

As for the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise of replicants to breed.

Ridiculous! Only with robots can the ethics of that be potentially ambiguous.2. At hour 2: The bad guys catch K and all but kill him because stopping him is mission critical, then just let him go.

They tried to squeeze in a cheap story to quickly make a connection to the first Blade Runner movie. Pathetic...I never liked the first Blade Runner neither. Just remember parts of it, but enough to see the main connections and I think in the first film the characters have not been idealised rather than being anti-heroic personas. Here the story/relation between Harrison Fords character (I do not bother remembering the names) and the android is turned into a romantic love story. It is ages ago when I saw the first BR but I remember that their 'romance' was more a kind of abusive rather than romantic.This new film at least has great visuals.The film is just a film about ???? and naked women, who may be able to give birth to a child or not and nevertheless are just there for sex or getting their tummies sliced up...",Blade Runner 2049
1393,tps-18007,A Long Wait for Disappointment,3,7 October 2017,"In 1982 I was deeply excited about the prospect of seeing ""Blade Runner,"" and can remember applying for a chance to see an advance showing in Sacramento. From the start it seemed obvious that it was a special film--clouded in controversy and mystery. Later I acquired my much-viewed VHS copy, with all the eye-gouging, nail-puncturing violence. Later still the Internet provided background information as, eventually, did articles plus a comprehensive book by Paul M. Sammon. In short, I am a fan, and was eagerly anticipating the sequel.So, it was with disappointment that I left an October 6, 2017 showing ""Blade Runner 2049."" Overly long, boring, poorly paced, and confusing were my initial impressions, though admittedly it was beautifully filmed (potential Oscar nomination in cinematography?).I appreciated the many (too many?) subtle and not-so-subtle nods to the original film, the effort to build on the ""Blade Runner"" universe, and efforts by writers, directors, and actors to bring the story to life. But there were just too many scenes that should have been reduced in length from 25-50% of their run time. Such excess in a film is, to me, almost always a fatal flaw. And some scenes (e.g., where characters ""Joi"" and ""Mariette"" merge to make love to ""K"") could have been cut altogether, I feel, without harming the story.The acting was satisfactory or better, for the most part, as one would expect from the level of supporting talent.* However, I have knowingly seen two pictures starring Ryan Gosling—2016's ""La La Land"" and now this—and in both he is bland and wooden. Despite the fact that ""2049's"" ""K"" is SUPPOSED to be a self-controlled, artificial humanoid, I wonder if it is just Gosling's natural on- (and off-) screen persona. And frankly, Harrison Ford's ""Deckard"" just did not work for me. Sacrilegious, I know; but true. I blame this on two factors.First, Ford appears (too) late in the movie, by which time I was already exhausted by tedium. Second, for a character without appearance-changing makeup, a dramatic accent, say, or pronounced behavioral distinctions, it is hard not to just see Harrison Ford. (Kind of like Robert Redford miscast in 1985's ""Out of Africa."") Oh, it's (old) Harrison Ford again. Sorry HF fans everywhere.And another thing; due to poor direction, they included ""Admiral William Adama"" (Edward James Olmos) from TV's ""Battlestar Galactica,"" and not ""Gaff"" (also Olmos), in a too brief cameo. (Listen to ""Gaff"" in the 1982 original. Totally different voicing.)Like most films, it suffered from its share of ""Oh, come on!"" moments. Why would 6-foot ""K"" allow 6-foot-6 Dave Bautista's imposing ""Sapper Morton"" to make the first move (and thus begin the accumulation of a ridiculous amount of damage, most of it unnecessary, sustained by ""K"" throughout the story)? Because that's what movie detectives do. I must say, ""K"" apparently likes to pass violently through solid walls (a nod to Rutger Hauer's ""Roy Batty"" head in the original, I take it).Almost all action-adventure films are silly in hindsight and full of movie plot clichés—""Blade Runner 20149"" is no exception. But the test of a good movie is whether the story flows at a pace that makes audiences subconsciously accept and even relish these otherwise nonsensical encumbrances (see 1999's ""The Matrix""). For my part I was less inclined to give ""2049"" a pass on the silliness due to its plodding nature.Ridley Scott is prominently associated with both the recent ""Alien"" and Blade Runner"" franchises, and has promised multiple sequels. Do we want this? Is state-of-the-art movie-making worth either ridiculously poor stories (the ""Alien"" franchise) or bad plotting and editing (""Blade Runner 2049"")? It's admittedly hard to make a good movie, but Scott and his people are paid a LOT of money to do so. Check Scott's IMDb filmography. Can any mortal be involved first-hand in that many projects? As with Stephen King, maybe it's time to pare down the quantity and re-focus on the quality? Just sayingIn conclusion, my disappointment focused primarily on the script and editing.**Some recommendations to potential viewers: First, if you plan to see ""Blade Runner 2049"" it will help to see one of 37 versions (e.g., voice-over or no voice-over?; graphic violence shots or not?) of the original 1982 film beforehand. Second, maybe wait to watch the movie digitally, so that you can re-play key scenes and increase volume on important dialogue. In the theater I kept mentally reaching for a non-existent remote control. Third, (after Recommendation One) if like me you hold the original picture in deep admiration as a flawed but intriguing analog masterpiece of SF movie-making, consider skipping this sequel altogether. But I imagine that warning will fall on deaf ears._____* Because of the look and feel of two female characters in the film, I wonder if actresses Felicity Jones (""Rogue One"") and Tatiana Maslany (""Orphan Black"") were originally considered for the parts eventually played by Ana de Armas (companion hologram ""Joi"") and Sylvia Hoeks (deadly replicant ""Luv""). While watching the trailer footage, I originally mistook those two characters for actresses Jones and Maslany. Their doppelgangers did just fine, though. Hoeks' ""Luv"" is particularly chilling.** Oh, and the music! Not so good. Too often I was aware of background music--that by itself is not a good thing--and its shortcomings. So much so that by the end of ""2049,"" where original ""Blade Runner"" music (""Tears in the Rain,"" I think) is (finally) used, it left me with mixed feelings. First, thank god! Second, where was that musical excellence during the rest of the film? Music can make or break a film, and is incredibly important. Few excellent films have poor musical soundtracks. Unfortunately, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is not an exception to that guideline.",Blade Runner 2049
1394,wademann-38245,Blade Runner 2049 Revitalizes an Imperfect Masterpiece,10,9 October 2017,"For several decades Ridley Scott has tried to fix his iconic but lacking, Blade Runner. Many recuts moved the film closer to what he originally envisioned, but further away from a good film. My personal preference is the first 1982 cut.With the long-gestating sequel, the simple story of a cop and an android that fall in love is expanded into the epic saga that Scott originally envisioned, with special effects technology worthy of the grand vision of a dystopian future, not unlike our current world, with systemic prejudice, inequality, and injustice.The sequel makes the first Blade Runner better. Let's hope this is a trilogy.It's for this reason that Denis Villeneuve's brilliantly conceived and executed sequel makes the original better. He turns Deckard into a flesh and blood character, even with minimal screen time.This movie is a great example of how reboots are usually more successfully achieved by an outside artist. For a while, Ridley Scott himself was going to direct the sequel. He says he didn't have time in his schedule, given that he's busy rebooting his other masterwork, the Alien franchise.Bringing in a fan to direct Blade Runner 2049, someone who was clearly influenced by the original, and a talented new storyteller, with something to say, has given this franchise a needed injection of freshness.In this sequel, K discovers the remains of the body of a woman who has died in childbirth. But the big surprise is that she's a replicant. Suddenly, we know where this story is going. The woman is clearly Rachel, the replicant love interest of Deckard's. He's obviously the father.The driving force of the narrative is for K to solve the mystery—where is the father and who is the child. K slowly begins to discover clues that suggest that he may be that missing son. His character is given really interesting colors to play with, as he comes to accept that his memories may, in fact, be real.Read full review HERE: https://wademann.net/movies/blade-runner-2049- revitalizes-imperfect-masterpiece/",Blade Runner 2049

1397,bill-36865,WHAT made BLADE RUNNER 2049 OUTSTANDING is WHAT makes human TERRIFIED OF REPLICANTS,9,28 February 2018,"Blade Runner 2049, a sequel having been expected for over 30 years, introduced a new thought for the old question, ""what defines a man?"", which made this movie single out in its counterparts.This new thought is ""the ability of sexual reproduction"", yet before discussing it, I would prefer questioning ourselves first, ""what makes replicants so terrifying.""If a technology allows us modifying or customizing a physical body, rather more, memories and personalities, in somehow way, it also enables us to perfectly copy a naturally-born man. Being copied is the most terrifying part in any biological replication issue because it straightly threatens a cognition being long engraved in humanity, ""I am unique."" The uniqueness in each individual has been proved in today's science and in our genes. Remind you, even though twins resemble in appearance, inside they still differ from genes. Besides, considering ourselves unique does reinforce our mental strength and even becomes an inseparable and key ingredient to shape a man. To put it briefly, uniqueness is one of the elements that define a man, and the emergence of replicants can easily topple and break this belief.However, we could still console our hearts with a somehow kind of excuse, ""Being designed and made in the lab doesn't give uniqueness."" This is certainly not only an excuse but a bloodily fact for replicants. They are controlled by naturally-born men's will, which is against an imperative component of uniqueness, randomness, yet this problem will be solved if replicants are able to reproduce themselves by human-like sex which is also called ""sexual reproduction"", a new challenge brought in the old question by this movie. Sexual reproduction coincides with the variety of inheritance, in other words, with the randomness; therefore, naturally-born men tell no more difference from replicants' children, and this comes to a paradox: if they are the same, why should they be distinguished in two categories? Wait a moment, are they really same? In the film, replicants are built to have superior physical strength to naturally-born human's. Furthermore, what really matters is being same doesn't guarantee getting together in harmony. Remember the lesson history has taught us, we fight not with the different species but with anyone who jeopardizes the benefits. Combined with the two reasons, if naturally-born men wage a war to replicants and their generations, little can the men win it, which in likelihood the men lose the title, ""the king of species"". Hence, the only way to prevent this situation is to prohibit them to reproduce, to seal any information about replicants' ability to get pregnant, to keep order, the quote from Lieutenant Joshi, played by Robin Wright.Blade Runner 2049 not only raises the old question but arouses more like ""what is order?"", ""what is morality?"", or ""who decides what defies order and morality?"" These questions are corollaries because asking ""what defines a man?"" at the same time asks ""what does not define a man?"" ; therefore, it comes plentiful cases waiting to defy and subvert the knowledge we have now. Deeper you get in this film, bigger you discover. However, if you don't want to get these things bothered, just relax and appreciate scenes and sounds!",Blade Runner 2049
1398,augustdraper,"A great standalone movie, not what I was looking for",7,13 June 2018,"Don't get me wrong. I did like this movie a lot. However, there were a couple of flaws. Remember this is all my personal opinion, so you don't have to listen to a word I say.One of my main complaints with the movie is how it's a standalone movie. It doesn't feel like a sequel at all. I think this is due to the fact that they made a sequel 30 years later. I had the same problem with the new star wars franchise. The sequel just didn't feel it was in the same universe. Rick Deckard didn't even feel like Rick Deckard. I saw a guy who had the name, but didn't share any of the qualities. He was the factor that connected the two blade runner movies, and he doesn't even come until halfway through the movie. The movie just felt like it was its own thing, which wasn't I wanted to go see. I wanted to see a sequel to the Blade Runner.My other complaint will be a lot less long. The movie was just too long. This movie definitely could have been an hour and 50 minutes, but they had to make it two hours and 40 minutes. Those other fifty minutes were unnecessary. Everyone just walked slow, and the pacing was slow, justin like in 2001 a space odyssey.Otherwise I did love this movie. It just could have been so much more.",Blade Runner 2049

To be swept up in the imagination and realized vision of artists who take such care with every shot is a fine experience to have in the cinema. 'Bladerunner' 2049' seemingly transcends being a mere sequel and becomes a full fledged film in it's own right. A film that just happens to share a universe with another.While the story and themes of 'Bladerunner 2049' are familiar they are done with such finesse that we can't help but feel empathy for the characters as they struggle to find their humanity, or simply try to make a connection.There are small flaws in the film if you choose to go over it with a microscope, but the best way to watch 'Bladerunner 2049' is to let it wash over your senses and to just experience it.This is why we watch movies.",Blade Runner 2049
1401,onetwentyinnafiftyfive,Beyond Blade Runner,10,7 October 2017,"I'm a huge fan of the original 1982 Blade Runner, and as a rule, an even bigger fan of Ridley Scott. I admit I was a bit disappointed when I heard that Ridley Scott's role in Blade Runner 2049 was consigned to Executive Producer with Denis Villeneuve taking the helm. I have nothing against Villeneuve, and I quite enjoyed Arrival, my only prior experience with his films (No, I haven't gotten around to Sicario, yet). My disappointment was probably rooted in my emotional connection to the original, and my fear that no one would honor its core like Scott would. Following the opening sequence, my concerns were allayed. I won't add to the fray as to whether 1982's Blade Runner needed a sequel, but in the age of sequels and reboots representing lack of original thought, Blade Runner 2049 continues the story and expounds upon it with a complexity I never expected. All this is done while still honoring the moral implications, imagery, symbolism, and overall genetic imprint of the original. Frankly, I'm not sure Scott could have made a film like this, but it couldn't have been made without his influence.Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's brooding, yet sometimes startlingly percussive soundtrack appropriately echoed necessary themes from Vangelis' futuristic original while expanding to a complexity deserving of the film. Additionally, while the original soundtrack can be replayed and enjoyed absent from its intended medium, 2049 is so tightly woven into the sound effects, I doubt it will have that same replay-ability. The electronic and artificial nature establishes the brutish impact of the human element on the planet almost before the imagery does. A genius move is the unsettling use of a brief, but recognizable excerpt from Sergey Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. Its having been relegated to little more than an advertising jingle or ringtone. Fragmented performances by Sinatra and Elvis are equally unsettling and alien amidst the dystopian landscape that is clearly a broken Earth.The performances from the ensemble were at the level I expect in a film of this caliber. While no single actor stole the show, there were a few surprises. For one, I had no idea Dave Bautista had this range. While his screen time is brief, it's impactful and effective. Ryan Gosling typically stars in films outside of my preferences, but his performance as a tortured soul trying to maintain his humanity was well done. I was pleased to see Harrison Ford's role being more than a trivial throwback. In lesser hands, playing the role of man who's seen and been through too much but still trying to hold it together, can easily come off as a crazy old coot. Ford made this role believable not as the Deckard from the original, but rather as someone he most certainly was destined to become. Robin Wright did an outstanding performance portraying a hardened cop tightly constrained by bureaucracy struggling to do the right thing---pride, defiance, and defeat moved across her visage in an uncanny fashion. Despite his fabled off-screen method acting antics, I suspect a large part of Jared Leto's performance was left unseen (pun intended). His presence was noteworthy but too brief. It may well have been truncated in the interest of time or possibly to add to the character's mystique. Sylvia Hoeks was unknown to me prior to this film, but I'm surprised I haven't seen more of her. She beautifully portrays a steely cold façade holding back a driven, trembling fury. Her character is likely be defined as the female equivalent of Rutger Hauer's ""Roy Batty"", but she's a bit more unhinged but focused all at the same time. Like other fans, I'd quietly hoped to see more of the original cast in some fashion, but that's why I'm not a screenwriter. As expected there were a couple of ""cameos"" that were unnecessary along with an ill-conceived special effects sorcery stunt that fell short, but nothing on the level of Rogue One's Tarkin and Leia.I saw this in IMAX presentation, and I'm glad I did. I'm usually drawn to IMAX presentations for the expansive imagery, and the 1.9:1 aspect ratio certainly contributed to the expansive nature of the film. However, the sound was an equal draw for me. I've already read about some complaints with respect to muddy dialogue in which the soundtrack seemed to drown out voices. To those I propose your issue is with your theater, as I noticed none of this at the AMC 14 in Tyler, TX. In fact, it's been quite some time since I've gone to a film in which the LFE (low-frequency effects) rattled my chest while I could still hear the male and female voices with exceptional clarity. One notable scene involves the viewer alternating between drowning in a body of water only to surface intermittently to the sound of pounding rain, gunfire and distressed voices---all of which was clear and effectively immersive. The question is who will enjoy this film. Formulaically speaking, a sequel's appeal to its original's fan base is probably largely related to its similarity to the same. In the case of Blade Runner 2049, it's not that simple. This will depend on what it is about 1982's Blade Runner that attracted you, and you may not even be able to define that. It is certainly possible to appreciate Blade Runner 2049 without having seen the original, but it will be a very different film for you. Even average sci-fi fans may take issue with the prolonged brooding and the 2 hr 44 min runtime, while others will bask in it and want more. Time will tell if Blade Runner 2049 endures like its predecessor. I will be viewing this at least once more in IMAX while it enjoys its theatrical run. Then I look forward to a proper home media release in which I fully anticipate a few Blade Runner marathons down the road.",Blade Runner 2049
1402,Fodera,A gorgeous dystopia but is that what we need?,10,10 October 2017,"It was an incredible film. Every frame was sumptuous and the sound effects and music quite epic (I wasn't always sure where one started and the other ended). By the end of it though I was a nervous wreck. Of the current glut of dystopian films this was fantastic. HOWEVER we have a glut of dystopian movies. ALL the previews before the film showed the Earth in periled by disaster or monsters or aliens. Being in the biz I know the big shots will say ""it's what the public wants"". If they want to help the future of Earth maybe they need to give the public what it needs. We need hope and we need visions of a better future and the entertainment industry could very well lead the way if it wasn't so absorbed with pandering for megabucks.",Blade Runner 2049
1403,purveshgholap,Beautiful from Inside Out,10,10 September 2019,"I've been a huge fan of the original blade runner, I think it's one of those cult classics which not many people talk about, however after few years people started appreciating the beauty of that film. The original blade runner is a movie which is known as a movie ahead of its time, a movie which not many people found intriguing, even today many of the audience will not prefer such type of world building story arc with breathtaking visuals, but even then, it was a masterpiece
Now after 35 years we have a sequel to that movie, at first I thought it's probably one of the worst ideas to make a sequel of blade runner, cuz we all know how sequels of classic movies turn out to be, they make it so bad that they even ridicule the original, but I still had some optimism in me, because the director of the sequel is Denis Villeneuve, who has directed movies such as Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival movies which I have clearly enjoyed, and writers who did the writing of the original blade runner such as Philip K. Dick, Hampton Francher and David Webb Peoples.
So I thought maybe there is a chance that this movie will not disappoint or at best will be good but nowhere near close to the OG blade runner, and oh my god how terribly wrong I was.
Blade Runner 2049 is a cinematic feat at a high level, this movie is brilliant it's all those good heavy words you can come up with and still not appreciate enough the efforts director of this movie has put and his team. Blade Runner 2049 is not only an excellent sequel but it's a sequel which is even better than the original, if the IMDB had a higher rating than 10, then I would give that rating too.
Blade Runner 2049 is a perfectly paced sci-fi drama you can watch right now, in terms of its visuals, the plot, the characters this movie is a seamless experience of what a great film supposed to be. In this movie we get introduced to the characters such as K who is a replicant his job is to hunt down the older models replicant, after hunting down one of the older models he finds a box which was dugged deeper in the old replicant's property. His mission is to find out the true mystery of that box, and what more the mystery folds into.
This movie has focused about this character, he wants to know about his purpose, he know that he is a replicant, but why he is in this world, what is his purpose, what is the distinction between Humans and replicants. What I absolutely like about this movie is that Denis focused very well on the main character, you feel for him as the movie progresses, when he finds out something new about the case, you are witnessing that too. Character building is one of the strongest part of this movie, but in terms of its visual this movie is refreshment for the eyes, the set designs, the CGI, the cinematography of this movie is unlike anything I've ever seen, I've never seen the practical effects and the CGI effects go hand in hand with each other so perfectly and the end results are just Marvellous, I've never seen such a beautiful movie in my life since Avatar, the movie is dripping with colours. Denis Villeneuve didn't change much of the environment as the futuristic technology driven world looks similar to that of the original blade runner, but 2049 has more location and overall is much more grander in scale, the soundtrack of this movie is also a excellent, Hans Zimmer yet again has done a great job with sound composing, well I would expect nothing less from such a talented person like him.
Blade Runner 2049 isn't your average movie it's not like those summer block buster action pack film which will keep you at the edge of your seat for its thrill or this isn't a sci-fi movie which is based on good Vs evil generic concept. It's something different we've never witnessed before, even with a runtime of 2 hrs and 43 mins which is almost 3 hrs this movie feels long but not too long, that was the only problem I had with the OG blade runner is that the movie felt lot longer than its runtime and even at certain scenes the movie dragged a bit, but that isn't the case with 2049 it is perfectly paced from the beginning till the end. Denis Villeneuve has a created a masterpiece and years from now this movie will be remembered as classic to the sci-fi genre.",Blade Runner 2049

1405,KaufmansCurse,Good in lots of ways but ultimately undone by a bloated script that tries too many things,6,5 December 2018,"I'm not adverse to long films but there's long films that need it for the right reasons and there's ones that need it for the wrong reasons. I think Blade Runner 2049 falls into the latter camp. It's long because it has way too much going on and this goes all the way back to the script.It would have been easy to shape a better - and simplier - film at the development stage but, as is often the case with scripts originating from Ridley Scott and Scott Free Productions, it just wasn't addressed. I feel a bit sorry for Villeneuve because he was exactly the right director to tackle this - he gets so much right here - but I'm starting to suspect he might be a bit like Scott himself: he's good when he has a good script and less so when he doesn't. Personally I believe a good director should 'also' be a good enough writer to be able to shape a script when it needs it (i.e. when the writers fall short). I had the impression Villeneuve was that kind of director, but now I'm not so sure.Anyway, the bottom line for me is this... this could have been a bonafide classic but it's fatally flawed and the finger points directly at the writers and the script editors imo - more specifically Michael Green I suspect, who's got 'Scott appointee' written all over him (and from his CV should never - ever - have been anywhere near a property like Blade Runner).

And I have to say, that both my wife and me were quite disappointed in the end. Good things first: Certainly the visuals are stunning, the music is fitting and the story potentially interesting. But IMO this is it. In the end there is no noteworthy or rememberable scene in the whole movie. The dialog, if any, is mostly neglectable and why people are praising the acting is beyond me. Ryan Gossling is playing the same thing as in ""Drive"" or ""The place beyond pines"" as the cool guy, who doesn't really talk much and just looks manly. In the case of Harrison Ford, if, as others reviewers have pointed, this was his best performance, then I am wondering, what he actually did lately, as I also don't see him shine in any way in this role. And this basically goes on for the rest of the cast, where the main underlying problem IMO is, that all there roles are so underdeveloped, that ultimately I didn't care for any of them. In the end I found this movie a visual appealing piece of art, which failed to entertain due to the above mentioned issues.

There is so much beauty yet horror in the post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, and I find their depiction of the future as an interesting take on the progression of society today. For instance, the over-sexualization of women (and people in general) has increased to insane levels, with nude sculptures and projections everywhere along with sex clubs out on the streets. The score matched the intensity of the city scene. One of my favorite shots, however, was that of the wastelands with high radiation, featuring a minimalist shot of Joe in the center of the concentrated red/orange atmosphere.

1421,hallbrianh,A surprisingly strong sequel,9,23 October 2017,"""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" - part of P.K. Dick's incredible legacy, became the inspiration Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, which ranks with Metropolis, Forbidden Planet, and 2001: A Space Odyssey as one of the most important SF films of all time. Combining Dick's ideas with a technical and artistic mastery created a movie that is watchable over and over for the richness of its details and the poetry of its dialogue. Sequels rarely live up to the original. So, it was with great trepidation that I went to see a sequel of such a masterpiece. I am happy to say that although Blade Runner 2049 doesn't reach the level of the original, it is an excellent film in its own right, as well as a sequel done right. With a myriad of subtle references to the original -in music, visually, and obviously plot, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable by those who intimately know the original and those who don't. You could probably even watch them in reverse order without losing much. Set 30 years in the future from the original and made 35 years later, the aging actors fit the sequel perfectly, The evolution of the setting in California fits the logical conclusions of the original. The evolution of the Replicants also fits perfectly. Most surprisingly, this is not just a rehash of the same ideas, but an extension of the problem of human vs ""more human than human"" and how the two will interact.

Not to mention fairly wooden and unappealing lead acting roles ... Or was it just a bad script? Say what you like about 1980s movies, at least they had plot movement and were able to convey the passage of time without actually 'taking time'. If this film is an accurate depiction of 2049, then i say we end it all now - The one saving grace is we're told in the beginning, there has been a downfall of everything we saw in the first - A blackout. So we expect bleak, but there's been plenty of 'bleak' sci-fi flicks made in the past 10 years that are much more engaging and conceptually interesting than this one.PROs: Harrison Ford - He's a little ancient now, but still 100 times better on screen than 'pretty boy' Gosling, who, in most movies seems a little robotic (Ah, hang on that's why they cast him right?). Oh, and Harrison has a tremendous stash of whiskey, which makes his radioactive hideout all the more appealing. Note for later - Don't keep the bees outside (hmm, bees - but where's the flowers?). The L.A. sea-wall and corresponding actions sequences were pretty rad, however Wallace's transport shuttle looked like something out of the original 'V' mini-series. A little more imagination on shuttle design please.CONs: Simplistic plot, very little actual 'science', which is a shame, as there's quite a bit of 'tech' in the film but not a lot of explanation as to how it's evolved or what's driving it. Uninspired acting by most of the cast. As someone else mentioned, the script actually managed to break the suspension of disbelief regarding the concept of humanity vs A.I. ""If you're not born, then you're 'not'"". Hmm, that kind of goes against the existential notion of ""Do androids dream of electric sheep?"" doesn't it. But i guess it's necessary to make such a big deal of a replicant having a child. Yay for the replicants. They can feel human now and age through their lives with all sorts of medical issues! Misogynistic projection of 'Sexuality' - In the first BR, there was quite a balanced portrayal of the beauty of both Male and female forms, but in this one it's all about 'gentlemens pleasure'.

1430,dave-1205,"Entertains but falls sadly short of the original, rather drawn out too.",7,19 October 2017,"Blade Runner (1982) was for me an absolute classic. I was enthralled the first time, and have seen it many times since, including the morning of the day I watched Blade Runner (2049) in the afternoon. The whole 'feel' of 1982 conveyed something original. The 1982 Vangelis sound track is superb and creates the perfect ambiance, the cinematography is dark and surreal, and rain is just ever-so- slightly featured! Sure, 1982 has the odd 'cheesy' 1980's content as viewed now, but back then the whole was utterly brilliant.Die-hard fans of the original will appreciate the huge amount of careful detail that has been brought over from 1982. It is very obvious how much effort has been made to re-create the same atmosphere. Sadly, 2049 just doesn't quite make it. The film contains an unmistakably firm nod to 1982 (eye at the start, city, rain, dark, cyclists, road crossings, electronic billboards, 'Chinese' culture, etc.) but despite significantly better imaging quality and technology, doesn't quite communicate the underlying grim portrayal of the 'grime' of 1982.I will also say that unless you know your 1982 narrative and characters there will be large amounts of 2049 that you'll either simply not notice, but more frustratingly, simply fail to comprehend. Unlike, for example, I Robot (2004) that stands alone as a complete film (you don't need to be familiar with Isaac Asimov), 2049 relies to a large extent on the 1982 premise. The film does start with several statements that attempt to contextualise the circumstances, but for most non-1982 fans these statements won't help that much. There is a 'story', but those who don't know 1982 will most likely struggle to keep up with it.1982 moved along at a reasonable pace, well, at least engages throughout. However, 2049 is very much laboured. I love Sci-Fi, I'm a huge fan of 1982, but I actually found myself yawning during some parts of 2049! Overall it's worth a watch, especially as you get 'value for money' - almost three hours long! Soundtrack is great, not a patch on the original, but still firmly of the same genre.Would I watch it again? Not paying, no, on TV in several years, maybe. As a sequel it disappointingly fell short.",Blade Runner 2049

The only thing good about this movie is the actors. who did a good job in doing what they were told to. But the story is a pathetic layering of a typical family drama projected onto flying cars that is supposed to be our future. The jest of story, we industrialize ruthlessly to shred nature and then struggle to find a human emotion within ourselves and wage a war to hold on to it. Pathetic, heard many times, over and over. I am not sure if the theme was disguised as to give a facade of art or was so poorly directed that it was not even strongly projected. Either way, it gave me headaches. And the music was so grossly out of sync with the picture, it made no sense remotely. The unnecessary loud noises had not 1% context with what was happening on screen. Ridiculously long, out of context, poor direction, senseless sound effects, sorry picture of the story. sheer torture to sit through it.",Blade Runner 2049

Had to put my 2 pennies in after reading a huge number of 10* positive reviews, just so the readers can have an alternative point of view. And based on the reviews on here (assuming they're all genuine?), I am definitely in the minority.A massive disclaimer : my friends and I lost interest within an hour and after trying to give it a chance left at about 1h30. Please bear in mind this is billed as a 2h40 film, so we may have missed something which would have changed our opinion. I doubt it though.I'll start off with the one overwhelming positive: the film is visually incredible and truly captures the essence of the futuristic world imagined and portrayed in the original (and then some!). They did such an incredible job and I won't even begrudge them several shots which were made specifically for 3D because it was so well done. Excellent job on that.Unfortunately, the negatives come thick and fast for me: The storyline was ridiculously cliché and predictable. The acting was poor. The dialogue was forced and either poorly delivered or did not fit in with the characters/acting. The background sfx were, although possibly realistic or imaginable at least, far too loud and in your face and... basically annoying! It detracted from the film instead of its intended purpose to make it more immersive. Despite not lasting beyond 1h30 I felt it was too long. 2h40? Seriously?!I could go on, but I would not recommend this film at all. I wish they hadn't made it. I hope to God they'll leave the other classics alone.

I snuck into it in the Kirkland, WA theater to see it (I was 12 and it was Rated R) several times and eventually recorded it to VHS from Showtime a few years later and I still have that tape somewhere. Then I bought the Special Edition/Final Cut DVD's (2007). I lost count of how many times I watched it. Gotta be in the hundreds. I just saw the sequel ""Blade Runner 2049"" and it is instantly a very close 2nd place all time. They did it RIGHT. I wanted to hate Ryan Gosling in it because he got the part I have always wanted to play since 1982. But gawdammit he was awesome. He killed in it. The whole cast was amazing, The cinematography is mind-blowing. The story worked. It had all of the right nods to the original. The cameos were jaw-dropping.

The sound track was deafeningly loud and intrusive, constantly calling attention to itself. Practically every female in the film was marginalized and sexually objectified to a larger extent than I can remember seeing in theaters. If this is a realistic view of the future, as Ryan Gosling has said, it's not one I want to live to see.On the positive side, the acting was good, and the visual effects were well done and did not dominate the movie as they have so many other SF flicks.

The actors are quite good, and the story and suspense are somewhat simple but efficient.I found some scenes are quite long and could have been easily shortened without really lessen their quality and impact.

So many thoughts, so many feelings since I watched this wonderful movie for the first time a few weeks ago. Since that... not a single day gone by without thinking about it. The movie is haunting me like near no other film I saw over the last 20 years (and I saw so many). Tears of joy... . On a personal note: It was worth to get through all the pain and suffering healthwise to be able to see such a bright, unique cinematic miracle. Iam glad and thankful for the opportunity to do so. There is so much to discover (mostly within yourself while watching the film), there is so much to riddle out, to think and feel about. A painful mirror image of our todays society and people on one hand... . Yet there are way more aspects and hints about what we have to face ""tomorrow"", if we not rethink and change our life together. We have to wake up as a species right now and become ""humane"" again (it's not to late yet). We still have a choice... and we must choose wisely. Saw the movie 3 times until now and next week it will become hopefully 4 times (still not enough). Some of us have only one chance in a lifetime to watch a great movie like that. A unique chance. There is something so very special, so very empathic, touching and humble, painfully honest about this cinematic wonder, about this masterpiece. Without a doubt in my favorite top five films. 1) The Elephant Man (1980), 2) Harakiri (1962), 3) Blade Runner 2049 (2017), 4) Akahige (1965), 5) Taxi Driver (1976). Thank you very much Denis Villeneuve and the whole crew behind 'BLADE RUNNER 2049'. 100% love! --- A unicorn stays a unicorn even its creators, those self-proclaimed ""gods"" (predators) are going to break and steal his horn, even if they tell him over and over again, that it is nothing special on an individual level and that it is just a simple workhorse (a tool), will it for sure stay a unicorn (stay special & unique) for as long as it believes in himself (self-esteem). Broken horns, like broken dreams are still worth being protected. What and who are you?, who do you want to become?

1438,RomeoQuint,A worthy sequel and a truly great film on it's own (no spoilers),10,17 October 2017,"The movie is literally a throwback to the classic era of cinematography. First of all: as expected...visually Blade Runner 2049 is absolutely stunning. The compositions made me smile throughout the whole movie. Nothing more to add. The score/OST is great, but does not surpass/rival Vangelis' excellence. The themes are just not as memorable.The cast and the acting is superb. Ryan Gosling has been really on fire lately. And once again - he delivers. At times he is subtle, but when the time is right - he explodes with emotion and expression. He brought exactly the right amount of flavor to the role of detective K. Though Ryan was exceptional - the rest of the cast impressed me even more. Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Ana Armas, even Bautista (yep...he is a really good actor & I finally see it) but especially Sylvia Hoeks, who gave an ravishing performance as ""Luv (Love)"" and completely nailed her cold-ass character with a perfectionist-drive and a quest for approval. Leto was believable and completely passable, but did his usual kind of crazy. I do not want to talk about the rest of the cast, but there were several surprises here and there. It is a joyful and relaxing experience to see a movie that takes it's time. Especially in times where most movies have rapidly fast cut scenes, overly sharp and snappy dialogue and racing pacing (which can be a good thing, don't get me wrong). There is of course also the danger of making the movie too slow - thus making it unbearably boring. And this is exactly where Denis did everything just right. The pacing is perfect. It is a long movie, but it does not drag. The story and the writing are what you would expect of Hampton, Green and Villeneuve. Top notch.Overall I loved this movie a lot and I think it is the first Sci-Fi movie that might one day be ranked among the likes of 2001 and the first Blade Runner. And let's be real: on this level of quality the higher ranked movies are subjective choices. In recent years only Ex Machina and Arrival had a similar impact on me. Denis' fifth masterpiece movie in a row. What a run.To sum up: - weaker score, some locations/settings are a tad too empty neutral: a passable Leto + everything elseBonus: holograms improved so much since Tupac",Blade Runner 2049

So it's a great Blade Runner movie, but is it a great movie? One of the best IMHO. Some will say it's slow and boring, but clearly it's not the movie for them then. Every frame on screen is beautiful and crafted with the utmost care. The music and audio is top notch and matches the movie perfectly. And the performances? Gosling is subdued but that's how his character is. And Ford... OMG one of your best sir. Well done.

Another problem is the lack of interest from the people that are under 40. Either they are more interested by Reality TV (Big Brother, Kardashians and such) or they don't know of the original and think Blade Runner 2049 stole from Orphan Black ;). Orphan Black owes a lot to the ideas set forward by the original Blade Runner not the reverse. Most modern science fiction movies are a mix of slapstick and action movies and this one really isn't.This is thinking people science fiction (Notice I don't use the term Sci-Fi which I profoundly dislike). Yes, I found it somewhat long in spots (My sister woke me up at one point as I fell asleep snoring) but it needed to be a slow developing mystery.Apart from that the movie was exactly what it should be (Another masterpiece), everything clicks (except maybe the part with ""Gaff"" but again the guy is old and might have memory loss). It was everything I expected, the only thing I didn't expect was that I would be crying when Joe leaned back on the stairs at the end of the movie and they cue in the music from the death of Roy Batty in the original.By the way, did you know that a scene at the beginning is a reworked leftover from the original movie script.

I was looking forward the sequel although reluctant to see it with Jared Letto and Gosling in it , nothing against Gosling, but Letto can kill a Picasso with his sight. 
I was very impressed with the artistic director of the movie, editing and production is very very good I would say 10/10 ... but ! 
Rachael "" copy "" was so badly done I almost turn off the movie. Which studio/ Special effects company did this? was the budget so low ? Really ? This was one of the worse features of the movie 
Second bad feature... the movie seems to end leaving a space for another sequel This is a Bad move as the characters do not end having a proper closure. 
Third bad feature: Letto should not be in it .. period. Gosling featured or mirrored as Batty ? Nah , why did they try to do this anyway ? His character left a taste of Will Smith ""I robot "" instead of Batty's , perhaps the character they wanted Gosling to be linked with. And finally Harrison Ford, a shadow of his former self hardly encompassing and fitting within his star winning role. No ! And three hours? Really ? I was waiting for the ziing it ! and never came.

The visuals, the scenes, every single movement, shadow or light - it's all put together in a way that I don't think I've seen in another movie. The feel to it is unlike anything else.With that being said, it's much slower than what most people are used to nowadays, so I'm sure 9 out of 10 viewers will find it boring. The story doesn't develop in a way that audiences have been taught the last few decades. It's a sequence that lacks the intensity of the 1982 movie, but adds deeper moments, a feeling of being in another place and time and a little bit of melancholy.The more time passes after seeing Blade Runner 2049, the more I think about it and the more I like it. It's a sequel that you should like if you liked the first movie, but if you're there just to watch an action sci-fi movie, then you'll be left disappointed and bored. The trailers for the movie are at fault for this, but they are looking to get as many people to watch it, so can't blame them.Overall - a great movie with a specific feeling to it.

1444,epincion,Excellent absorbing fun,8,7 October 2017,Just seen the movie (while on vacation in Canada). The original Blade Runner is one of my all time favorites. Watching this new Blade Runner 2049 I was absorbed and was never bored and highly recommend people see the movie. However to me it does not have the same level of innovative artistry as the original Blade Runner. Firstly the music score is not as good as the fantastic Vangelis score written for the original movie. Yes the music in the new movie is somewhat like that in the old movie but in reality the director seems to think that lots of very loud long chords is a good score. Secondly while visually the new movie is stunning sometimes the tiny scene details are not as consistent as they were in the original. The use of shadows and lights and rain is very well done following on the theme of the original Bad Runner. Of course the CGI effects are massively better in this sequel as would be expected. The story line is good and the baddies in this movie really are convincingly chilling and the twists in the plot are good. Clearly there will be a sequel - or two. Most of all I missed humor this is a movie that takes itself very seriously and in doing so has lost something.,Blade Runner 2049
1445,jonsmal,Mixed feelings,6,10 October 2017,"BR2049 is without doubt too long. Most scenes are so long, you find yourself thinking ""come on, move it along"". Mr. Villeneuve is obviously not from the 'less is more' school of film makingVisually BR2049 is breathtaking and contains some the best visual effects I have ever seen on screen. Watching this movie on a small screen will just be a waste of time, as its whole intention is to be grand, to be operatic.Sadly the drama of the plot gets swallowed by the extended visual artistry.Ryan Gosling does okay with a limited script, but the acting accolades, such as they are must go to Ana De Armas. She managed to imbue her character with some humanity. Ironic really, given that her character was the least human of the cast. Maybe this was intentional?Blade Runner has been in the top 3 of my all time favourite movies forever. I remember well, seeing it on release at the Odeon Leicester Square. BR2049 is a pale shadow of the original film, but its not without merit.Blade Runner's fusion of sci-fi and noir was groundbreaking, as was the score and the films particular dark dystopian vision. I found myself empathising with Deckards moral dilemmas. Goslings performance as LAPD Officer K lacks the nuance that Harrison Ford brought to Deckard in the original. In Blade Runner, Deckard was silly, wise-cracking, intense, unpredictably violent, remorseful and madly in love. Deckard was complex. LAPD Officer K is just a troubled/tortured 'soul'. It's what Ryan Gosling always does.BR2049 is worth seeing just for its visual grandeur, but is has the emotional punch of a Connor McGregor jab.",Blade Runner 2049

I won't even bother talking about the philosophical story or praising the amazing cinematography which should make you enjoy this movie on its own.Sci-fi movies made until now generally fit into these two categories:1. A close future that looks very much like today, but with expected improvements on the tech (ie, black mirror)
2. A distant future that could seem believable from the 50's, 60's or 70's, but does not look like what we are heading to nowWhat Blade Runner 2049 gets really right is creating a distant future that looks credible from today's point of view. While watching the movie and it's characters relationship with tech I keep getting the feeling of ""oh, we could really end up like that"".

1448,chetan420,Movie of the decade,10,31 October 2019,"This is easily one of the best sci-fi movies (or any genre really) that I've ever seen and Denis Villeneuve is possibly my new favourite director since David Lynch. Everything from the direction, cinematography, acting to the soundtrack, screenplay etc is great. It stays true to the original yet is its own thing, and does it so sublimely that it is the type of rare sequel that enriches the original.The only complaint one could possibly have is with the slow pace and that it's not easy viewing like the average popcorn flick, though that has more to do with one's expectations. It is an intense and long film and not really suited for anyone with a short attention span or made for instant gratification. Other than that though, one doesn't get to see such outstanding and beautifully made movies too often. There are many movies that undeservedly earn the 'masterpiece' tag (the best current example in 2019 being the highly overrated Joker film), but a couple of years before that came this bonafide masterpiece that comparatively speaking slipped under the radar and didn't get as much attention. Villeneuve gives a masterclass in what a character study actually should be, and It's difficult to imagine how much worse BR2049 would have been in the hands of a hack like Todd Phillips or vice versa.This is easily the best movie of the decade for me and definitely up there with the best I've ever seen, apart from also being possibly the best sequel ever.",Blade Runner 2049

And for the longest time I thought it was a dumb standard cause nothing delivers. A combination of the company, the film, and the environment (Atmos, leather seats, good food) made for a truly amazing experience. Definitely need to rewatch this another one or two times but holy.Easily the best looking film I'v ever watched. Now that he easy part is done:It was thrilling, it was thought provoking, it was emotional, beautiful, heavy, smart, and well all around one of the best films I've seen. I liked the first one a lot, but this is what I expected when I hear everyone saying the original is a true masterpiece and one of the best films of all time. Even at a long screen time of 163 minutes, I was not bored for a second. Complete immersion was achieved in part due to the amazing Dolby Atmos theater I saw this in as well as the great score and visuals. The slow burn definitely led to an amazing bang, and at the very end I could not believe this had met and surpassed every expectation I had for it.At the end of the day, this movie is not for everyone. I wasn't ever bored but I can understand if someone else is. Even when nothing was happening the score, the set design, and the cinematography acted as characters to the plot and enhanced the experience.I could not recommend this enough. I want everyone to watch it as it is currently bombing at the box office, but at the same time I'm almost happy it is so it assures we won't get another sequel after this, at least for a while.",Blade Runner 2049
1452,LeoAlexson,Your memories of the past are real?,9,5 October 2017,"How iconic was the first ""Blade Runner"", how many creators it inspired to create new films in the science fiction genre, how many things it predicted, what philosophical thoughts it was conveying. Many fans of the first film expected to see something similar, but Denis Villeneuve introduced us his view of the universe, while retaining the spirit of the first film.Story. The creators of the film made every effort to keep the story in secret, and this was not done in vain. In order not to reveal the essence of the story, I just want to say that this is a story about how one way or another, everyone considers himself to be special. Director. Denis Villeneuve also brought us a lot of things that humanity is realizing in the near future. In most of his films Villeneuve touches on the theme of children, in this film he also devoted much time to the theme of parents and children. In fact, as some critics noted, the picture is very similar to Tarkovsky's work, the meditative narrative of the film allows us to reflect on philosophical questions: are all our memories real and is man really a supreme being?Music and visual effects. Despite the fact that there were two outstanding composers working on the film (Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer), the music in the film is quite small and it is not remembered. Basically, all the compositions are very similar to each other and create an exceptionally tense atmosphere. A small amount of original music in the film partially compensates for the appearance in the film songs by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Unlike music, the film strikes a visual component. The film implements completely new creative design ideas, thanks to which you experience a real visual pleasure.The Result. In the end, we can say that Villeneuve did not turn ""Blade Runner 2049"" into another remake movies, the main task of which is to tell the same story with modern shooting technologies to attract a new audience and sell toys.

1456,crabbybob,A Little Long But A Very Good Sequel,9,6 October 2017,"Like a few others that wrote reviews, I too re-watched the original for about the 50th time just a few hours before going to see this film. This movie has stunning visuals that compliments the original without going overboard with the CGI, wonderful hues that helped differentiate locations that weren't needed in the original film because it was only dark with beacons of neon, or dark and raining with beacons of neon, because it was set in pretty much one general location of the city.The story expands beyond the city where a replicant Blade Runner with a nomenclature of ""K"" does what Blade Runners are supposed to do, retire replicants without having any emotions interfering with the task at hand, until a dying replicant cryptically mutters ""you've never seen a miracle"", that and a out of place item on the ground triggers a search that leads to the bigger story of what happened to Deckard and Rachael and the possible effect of their mysterious departure. The original Blade Runner set the tone and style for many movies and TV shows that came after it, just like Night of the Living Dead set the tone for almost all zombie movies after it. It was good, dark Sci-Fi without peers when the alternative was buying Reese's Pieces and making jokes about phoning home. Jared Leto was underused in this movie but adding more screen time for him by cutting scenes may have caused story continuation issues while trying to meld the past to the future, and probably couldn't have been done easily without lengthening the movie considerably, but his character could be central to a potential sequel.Blade Runner 2049 has a lot more action than the original but it's not a mindless slug/slogfest like so many movies that have little time for storytelling. One of the small things I did enjoy was a tip of the hat to the scene in the original where Deckard was magnifying the photo of Zhora and the scene in BR2049 when the lab was trying to find a serial number, the flick-flick sound of magnification seem very similar. Also, bringing Edward James Olmos in for a cameo as Gaff and watching him from the waist up, not seeing his hands, but taking an educated guess at what he may be doing, and being half-surprised he's moved up a level from match figures.The only drawback of seeing a film like this in a theater is you're unable to pause or back it up when something happens that takes a little time fathom or put into context with everything else, just like the original Blade Runner it'll take time and multiple viewings to decipher all you've just seen.",Blade Runner 2049

1458,amanmishra868,Must watch classic for Future,10,26 January 2018,"Blade runner 2049 is a sequel to 1982's classic Blade Runner which ultimately proves to be an perfect example of what an sequel should be. Ryan gosling has played role of Blade Runner himself in this movie chasing replicants when he comes across new case which changes his entire life and later the story that unfolds is suspenseful, thrilling and exciting to watch. However movie is almost 3 hours so it will test your patience. Very few movies are out there which always stay top of your mind so if anyone asks for suggestion for what they should watch you would immediately refer them that movie and this is the movie that is just like that. I have divided this movie in simple aspects to evaluate on and you can see for yourself if it fits your category.*NOTE* As its sequel you should watch Blade runner (1982) first and watching this prequel is worth only later to watch this Blade Runner 2049.
Entertaining ?Absolutely if you have a knack for thriller, mystery and suspense stories. Visual effects in the movie are close to perfection and so appealing that nowhere color or filters will let you down and not to mention the imaginative world created which adds more to the story of previous film.Story ?
Sometimes direction and cinematography is so appealing that story seems dull and STORY is king of all and here story and character driven this marvelous piece rises above all and this story is better than previous which is debatable. The dystopian utopian/dystopian setting of the film is amazing.
Boring ?Considering duration of 3 hours it's no wonder it might be boring for some people and i do agree on it, it could have been a little short around 2 hours but it is one of the quality that I think is only positive not negative and it will be boring if you like movies like fast and Furious franchise as there is no final showdown where action packed battles happen.In conclusion, I will say its is a classic for future and even in 2049 this movie would be remembered as one of the top movies and I highly suggest everyone to watch this.",Blade Runner 2049

At close to 3 hours, it drags. The ending is awful. The original had a unique premise. This movie tries to follow that story but in the end, it is quite boring, unimaginative and implausible.

1461,istvan-polczer,Sooo Boring,4,23 October 2017,"Great visuals of a depressed robotic world vision of 2049.A bit too harsh and too aggressive music throughout but very flashy, very hightech, in sync with the movie.Acting is so so, good casting but the character development and emotional roller coaster was a bit over the top in general. Difficult to relate to the characters and their transformations or high intensity emo, it mostly looked hollow, fake.Storyline is built up from promising bits and pieces centering around humanizing AI/Robotics with its good and evil (mostly evil) and trying to find an identity and purpose in a cold, confused world. The story never finds its purpose or identity, never gets together however. Too many twists, trying to be too epic, too big, but it does not really work. Blade Runner 2049 fits into the category of a shallow 'deep thoughts wannabe' , a bit anachronistic with the (now) usual Matrix way of mixing religion, science, fantasy, fiction, philosophy and delusion.And the film is sooo long, sooo boring, I was wondering whether to just leave.

I have one little problem, maybe it's just me but at the end I felt like it could go on for another hour so we could see the replicant uprising, the fall of Wallace, and the full reconnect between Deckard and his daughter.

As of writing this, it is Thursday, October 12th and I cannot get this film out of my head.From the visuals to the storytelling everything is just so perfect. Literally every frame in this movie looks like it should be hung up in a museum. The way ""2049"" develops it's story and characters are really unlike anything I have ever seen. I found it ironic that a handful of the major players physically cannot show empathy. Yet I showed a whole lot for them.As the film's mystery unfolds it just gets better and better. It is constantly adding onto the original and itself. Every scene, every location, is absolutely riveting. It is a very long film (almost clocking in at 3 hours) but I never even felt a tinge of boredom. It flies by. Your just so immersed in this story, these characters, these visuals, this world, that the film, without a doubt, floors you. This is the best film I have seen so far this year, maybe this decade. This is the reason we go to the movies, and it embodies what I love about them so much.I do have a few issues with the movie, but they are so minuscule, I can't possibly take points for them. I think it is really only tiny aspects of 1 or 2 scenes that I wasn't crazy about. I beg you to PLEASE go and see this film in cinemas, because it deserves the attention more than any other film out right now. Don't see It, don't see Kingsman, see Blade Runner 2049.

1466,siddharthkumar-23175,A sequel done the right way...,9,6 October 2017,"One of the rare occasions when a sequel surpasses the original. And all the more difficult in this case, since the original is a cult classic. Denis Villeneuve was the perfect choice to direct the sequel and he did not disappoint, rather he exceeded expectations. No one could have played Mr. K better than Ryan Gosling, who is yet to deliver a poor performance. But the standout of this film is definitely is the cinematography, by Roger Deakins, who at least deserves a nomination if not the Oscar itself.The movie follows a similar vibe to the original in terms of lighting, pace and storytelling. There are no pointless action sequences or unnecessary exaggerations. It is rather pretty grounded for a sci-fi. It is a proper noir film where one thing leads to another in an investigation undertaken by the protagonist. There are no pointless dialogues and forced comedic scenes. The plot gains depth in such a subtle manner, you won't feel that you are being filled in with too much information in such a limited time frame. Despite some of the characters having limited screen time, they're purpose is well understood as they are constantly mentioned throughout the film. The only drawback is that there are a few build-ups that lead to nothing.All in all, a phenomenal movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and will probably be a classic in the future.",Blade Runner 2049

1468,stamboulopoulos,"A sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job",5,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) a young and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studio executives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a rising blockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a serious movie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script and improvise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) a bunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would look and sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most of all, e) a post-Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels like Coppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinvent the language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring at all about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, Blade Runner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breaking stereotypes like ""good guy kills bad guy at the end"" and dealing with existential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within the context of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.Blade Runner 2049 is none of these things. On the contrary, it's the flawed triumph of a next generation of studio executives, who control the creative process by paying millions to the industry's best of the best, providing they will make something that will take advantage of a successful brand name in order to bring profits to shareholders. If there is one word to describe this movie, it's ""replicant"". Not the kind of replicant who realizes that ""all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain"" as he dies, but a sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job that will try to entertain you and if it succeeds will return as a sequel that will eventually become yet another franchise. I spent 160 minutes of my life watching a pleasant and perfectly constructed piece of nothing, and I didn't care for a moment about any of the characters or a storyline that was designed without the intention to question and redefine a single thing.

1476,wouterdrummen,A visual masterpiece,10,4 October 2017,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan and absolutely love every movie he made, from his breakthrough drama 'Incendies' to the action thriller 'Sicario'. But when I learned that he was going to make a sequel to Ridley Scott's iconic Blade Runner I had mixed feelings. Would he be able to live up to the expectations and make a sequel that could measure itself with the original? For this reason, I went into the cinema thinking ''This will be a great movie, I am a Villeneuve fan so I have to like it'' but that was a mistake, for once I stopped expecting and just started experiencing the film, I was enchanted by all of its visual beauty. I was wrong to doubt Villeneuve; his 'Blade Runner 2049' even succeeds in transcending in some ways the original masterpiece, especially as a visual experience. The bleak dystopian future Scott so perfectly created is even more beautiful in Villeneuve's 2049, for which a lot of credit has to be given to the brilliant director of photography Roger Deakins, who has made one of his best works (which says a lot). Every shot is brilliant, I loved every single frame and I cannot imagine that he wouldn't get nominated and win an Oscar for this phenomenal work. But also a big thumbs up has to be given to the entire effects team, for Deakins didn't do it all on his own. Deakins isn't the only mastermind at work, for the score is also beautifully done. When I learned that composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (someone who has collaborated multiple times with Villeneuve and did most of the scores for his movies) got fired I was surprised; Jóhannsson has always delivered great work, but according to Villeneuve, his score ''wasn't the right one'' for this movie for it didn't ''resemble Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner'' quite enough. So he got replaced by probably the best man in the business nowadays; Hans Zimmer. And as we are used to with the German composer, this was once again sublime and a great homage to the original. Zimmer's 2049 score can be compared to his Dunkirk score, in a way that it unsettles us from the first chord and just as the Second World War movie, it keeps us on the edges of ours seats, especially during the last hour.As for the people who are actually situated in front of the camera, they all play their parts very well. I was especially happy that Ryan Gosling's agent K was indeed the leading man and he did a very good job. I was slightly concerned that it would mostly be about Harrison Ford's Deckard, but luckily that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, Ford gives one of his best performances in years and after all the iconic roles he played once again in recent years (Han Solo, Indiana Jones) this is by far the best. The smaller but important roles are also noteworthy; Robin Wright's Lieutenant Joshi makes a fierce and convincing police chief, while the villain duo Jared Leto's Neander Wallace as the evil head of a corporation at the top of the new world order and his frightening hit-woman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) are also very impressive. Last but not least, Ana de Armas is also very good as Joi, K's girlfriend (even if she does remind me a lot of Scarlet Johansson in 'Her' and slightly of Alicia Vikander in 'Ex Machina', but maybe that's something Villeneuve did that on purpose and wanted to pay homage to these recent but also very good science-fiction movies).That said, Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. For unlike most of Hollywood's blockbusters nowadays, he doesn't simply deliver us a spectacle with some nice effects or a reboot of the original, but he picks up the threads where Scott left, which was a monumental task, for the original 'Blade Runner' is one of the most impressive and iconic movies ever made. 2049 continues on the same topics raised by the original, making the sequel worth the 35-year long wait; it goes further with what was proposed in the first installment, enriching one another. It is possible that one day a third installment could be made, but that is only if any director will ever find the courage to make another 'Blade Runner', for the bar is raised incredibly high. I believe that in time, 'Blade Runner 2049' will just as the original one, grow into a cult movie, and rightfully so, for it is its own movie, but, just as the original, a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece. I am not going to say more about it, because the studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics and the first movie viewers not to reveal any plot points, but I am glad they did. Even if I could go on and on about the movie and the difference between replicants and humans (or is there really much of a difference, after all?) the less you know the better, because 2049 feels at its best when it surprises (which is one of Villeneuve's greatest strengths). This is a movie best experienced on the biggest screen in your cinema; trust me, it will be worth your while. As for me, I will most likely try and make some free time in my schedule for the coming days, 'cause I want to go the cinema again, guess what I'm gonna watch...",Blade Runner 2049

So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Blade Runner 2049, as most of you may have already know, is a sequel to a beloved sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner (1982)'. And just to warn you, like its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 isn't fully consisted of action. It's more of a sci-fi mystery filled with action-packed scenes and serious tone. So don't expect lots of action when watching this.But really, this movie isn't much of a sequel. It's actually a story of its own with some plot points that continue from the first movie. And I respect this film for that!And Denis Villeneuve knocked it out of the park once again! The style and feel of the world the film takes place feels kind of dystopian, dark, and mysterious, the acting is superb, and the cinematography is top notch!And thank heavens, the movie's plot isn't the same as what it seemed to be from the trailers that portrays this film as another one of those ""to save the world"" films. It has a story of its own, and it does its job telling this story excellently.There are still two flaws that didn't actually bother me, though. I just find these points flawed for other people to watch.As stated, the trailers had a different feel from the film. And it made the movie look as if it's a sci-fi action film. And that's going to be a problem with other viewers, since what they get is different, though they get what's better than the expected product.And lastly, this film wouldn't probably please normal viewers. The runtime is too long, the other people in the theater I watched this movie at were yawning at some parts, and those same parts would feel slow for normal viewers.But hey, I enjoyed the film a lot. And I rate films depending on how much I've enjoyed them. And I surely enjoyed this one.Overall, I think Blade Runner 2049 is a great soon-to-be classic sci-fi mystery film that will be always remembered as time passes by. It's a cinematic achievement for being visually stunning (like its predecessor), and being one of the best movie sequels of all time. Please go give this film a try! It's flopping at the box office last week, and it deserves more attention!Final rating: A+|10/10",Blade Runner 2049

Breathtaking.,10,19 March 2018,"This film is pure art and pure cinematic masterpiece.The visual, the story, the acting, the direction, and all about this movie just incredibly fantastic. Ryan Gosling as Officer K just mesmerizing us to delivers an empty replicant who wanted to feel what it's like to be human being. Ana De Armas portrayed a hologram named Joi. Joi is the most human even though she just a program. Sylvia Hoeks, Jared Leto, and Harrison Ford also brought a fantastic job here. The story and the twist just shocked me in different way and with a great visual and cinematography by Roger Deakins make this film poetic also melancholic. But i want to give my high praise mostly to Dennis Villeneuve. Your the man!! As i watched in cinema so many walkout. Too shame the film as this calibre made them bored. 2 hours and 44 minutes not enough to satisfying me. My God This film so beautiful. One of the best cinematic experience ever!!

1486,ali_abi,A visual masterpiece but fails to be a masterpiece,7,5 October 2017,"Visually stunning and perfectly balanced with sounds effects and music. I like slow movies, especially when the story evolves gradually with a beautiful atmosphere. But I found some parts of the movie unbalanced or unnecessary long... I also have the feeling that the end was wrapped up too quickly comparing to the rest of the movie. It is developing a story for 2h30 minutes and then suddenly in less than 15 minutes things happens in a hurry. I have the impression that the blue-ray version will be longer so the transition between some scenes will be more coherent. It should have been 20 minutes shorter OR 20 minutes longer to be more consistent. I can not give more detail to not spoil the plot.I liked it but I can not give 9/10. As an example from the same director I found The Arrival more balanced.The cast is great.",Blade Runner 2049
1487,theblessedtroll,It could be perfect but it is not.,7,11 October 2017,"This is a very rare film in today's cinema for one basic reason: the slow pace. This is the most interesting thing, a lot of silence and music where you can see and feel the beautiful lighted scenarios, with perfect new blade runner aesthetic, it perfectly spread from the first part 2019. I enjoy it very much. Music plays its part in it and continues with the Vangelis work good enough (perhaps one demands a new very good song to add, but...). On the other hand the plot has its excellent parts too, the most, and some crucial errors that impedes this movie to go a step further and be a instantaneous classic and at the top of science fiction and thriller's history. One of the obvious mistakes is to prepare the ground for sequels. So, there too many undeveloped things, the most important of them is the Niander Wallace character. But also, all the Freysa and replicant revolution and also the newborn replicant character shallow deepness. This sense of incompleteness is killing a lot of films and Blade runner 2049 is not an exception, ans the contrary. A part from that, as I said, I enjoyed the film, the slow pace, gathering information step by step, the true detective kind of story, this going into the blade runner special universe and philosophy, the good idea of comparing the Artificial intelligence of the programmed holograms to replicants, everybody machines as humans are, etc (but perhaps with this romantic hologram which is a very good movie in itself wasting a bit of time to go into the main plot and improve the general plot) A lot of things to say about...but to sum up...cinema of 150 million dollars in something different, as Cristopher Nollan or other few directors are doing.",Blade Runner 2049
1488,bensdave-11987,Bland Runner 2049,2,12 October 2017,"If this review reads like an open letter to Sir Ridley, then great. Because it is. I am disappointed on so many levels with this film I just don't know where to start. Harrison Ford. Ugh. I remember Deckard as a cool, tough, cerebral character with ice in his veins. Ford is now his character Rusty Sabich in Presumed Innocent; neurotic, weak, nervous. He looks like he is going to cry at any moment or have an alcoholic withdrawal seizure. He is exhausting to watch. Ford, as he ages, is overreaching every role he has, maybe because it may be his last. I don't know. But I don't have the stomach for nervous, weak, over-acted roles. The beautiful cinematography and music are begging for a mysterious, equally elegant protagonist, only to leave us empty handed. A real shame. And things just go down hill from here in an agonizing 2 hrs 45 min (this mess could have been done in 1:30). Much like Alien: Covenant, there are no likable characters save for Dave Bautista, the only real talent in this film. Which brings me to Sir Ridley, who has become one of the biggest disappointments in my cinematic world. He has sold out his abilities to the demands of the dullard citizens of the United States of KardashAmerica. He has sacrificed great character building and moving themes for flash, shock, and awe (ala Prometheus and Alien: Covenant). Blade Runner (the original) has a very linear, simple, and elegant story. We felt attached and alike in some way to all of the multi-faceted characters. It was a fascinating film. Here, Scott is racing at 200 mph down the PCH, trying to keep up with the likes of other non-linear, self-annointed heroes like Christopher Nolan, only to crash his 2049 jalopy into the surf in Malibu, and he has perished in the mangled heap that has become his product. This is not the old Ridley we used to love. He didn't need to keep up with anyone. Ridley used to be the yardstick. He has sold out to the big Hollywood execs and has chosen to satiate the dull, witless 98% of our population. The only good thing to come of this is that it is so wildly different from the original that the connection will never be made, and thereby will not, and cannot, corrupt the original. There was so much potential here and lots to work with, and all was wasted. If you watched the 3 short films that filled in the gaps in the 30 years between stories (which are really great and are available on YouTube) you may have been just as anxious for this film as I was. And just as let down. Way to tarnish your illustrious career, Sir Ridley. I am very, very disappointed.",Blade Runner 2049
1489,jreece-04199,Awful was my comment after movie,1,24 October 2017,"I really liked the earlier Blade Runner, which had great visuals and an intriguing story. This version is dark and dismal and very violent. The violence toward women is extremely gruesome, and there was a lot of unnecessary female nudity. The women seemed to be either ruthless killers or prostitutes. The most ""real"" woman is not real at all. There is very little character development to help move the winding plot along. Harrison Ford is good, of course. The movie is way too long and the slow pace is just annoying in some scenes. I was sorry I went, and I will never watch this movie again.",Blade Runner 2049
1490,cfaehl-72556,Leisurely and masterful storytelling,10,20 October 2017,"Bladerunner 2049 is a beautifully executed movie that takes its time getting to the point. The storytelling is some of the best there - this is not a movie that's going to spell out the details for you, but it's cogent in setting up the conflicts and why we should care about them. Do not expect a Hollywood summer blockbuster movie, chock-a-block with action. It's a science fiction masterpiece that tees up enormous questions about what it is to exist, to live, to die - to have relationships - and does it in a beautiful, bleak, Dickensian world.A lot has been said about the length (long) and pace (deliberate) of this movie. I really enjoyed the amount of time spent in each scene. At times, though, it felt like fan service - if you enjoyed Bladerunner, it's easy to relax into the movie and soak it up. Viewers are given ample time to decide what it is they just saw. At no time does Bladerunner 2049 lay pipe for viewers.",Blade Runner 2049
1491,allenquanobi,*videogamedunkey voice* A MASTAHPIECE!,10,19 November 2017,"In the movie, Steve Jobs, Jobs says, ""The people don't know what they want until you show it to them."" Never before has a quote been so correct than for Blade Runner 2049. This movie is one of the best science fiction movies of the 2010s, as well as one of the best movies of the 21st century so far. No movie is without a flaw, so let's start off with this movie's short list of flaws:For me, the villain, Niander Wallace played by Leto, didn't have the gravitas and commanding presence as the villain in the original Blade Runner, Roy Batty, had. Wallace played more of a back role to Luv, giving her the main purpose of the movie. However, this flaw could also be seen as a positive because the movie never places a huge focus of Wallace because it isn't meant to. The movie is about K and his journey. - The pacing. This flaw is more of a critique for general audiences and why this movie is being bashed by them. The pacing at times is a little slow for those who entered the movie expecting a sci-fi action adventure as marketed by the trailers. Again, this flaw is inconsequential because the movie is not meant to be a sci-fi movie; however, the general audience will want it.Moving onto the pros:The writing and plot: This movie could have been ridiculously unoriginal; the original and movies like Tron, Terminator, and the Matrix explore the concept of AI and its place in our evolutionary timeline. However, the thing that separates 2049 apart from the rest is placing human conflict and exploring the human condition. K, **SPOILER** a replicant, discovers a mind-bending truth that makes him question his very existence and creation. The character is written extremely well, making the audience feel like they can relate to the character on his journey discovering what it means to be human. There is also an element of the chosen one storyline that is seen in many movies, with a decent twist on it. Dialogue between characters is perfect, laden with philosophical discussion and double entendres.Film Making and Editing: Directed by Dennis Villeneuve, this movie is a visual orgasm. Beautifully shot by the legendary Roger Deakins (if he doesn't win his Oscar this year, it'll be the biggest injustice since Leo), the movie looks and feels like an accurate representation of future California. Villeneuve minimized use of CGI in favor of miniature buildings and physical backgrounds, and the result is amazing, capturing the aesthetic and feel of the original, while also building up more of the world around LA.Soundtrack: I see many reviews that are critical of the loud and bombastic soundtrack that Zimmer has come up with. I believe that the score works perfectly in order to portray the characters as small in the grand scale and scope of the world. It also uses elements of the amazing and mesmerizing original Blade Runner soundtrack while also sounding unique in its own right.Performances: Gosling as K plays it very well. Emotionally reserved and speaking very few words, he creates a mysterious vibe around K, while also investing the audience into the character. Joi played by Ana de Armas is good as the bubbly love interest. Sylvia Hoeks steals the show in scenes as Luv, portraying a menacing yet eloquent servant to Wallace. Harrison Ford manages to excel yet again as Rick Deckard, portraying a similar reserved Blade Runner as Gosling and his performance in the original.Ability to stand as its own movie: This pro is very important and for good reason. Every sequel nowadays seems like it must either be filled with universe building, intertextuality, and plot beats similar to the original. Examples of this are The Force Awakens which, while a great film in terms of film making and acting, has an overabundance and over reliance on callbacks to the original trilogy (i.e. relying on the appearances of such things as the Millennium Falcon and Han Solo) in order to amp up the audience and entertain them. Jurassic World suffers from this also in that it relies of points such as the T-Rex, the original park itself, and basically replicating the original plot in order to get positive marks from the audience. What sets Blade Runner 2049 apart from these movies is the fact that it is a true sequel: it doesn't rely on knowledge of the original or images from the original in order to entertain an audience. The closest it comes to intertextuality is when Rick Deckard comes back, and he doesn't enter the film until the end of the second act/the beginning of the third act. It uses its original story and new characters in order to engage the audience, which is rare amongst movies today which all seem to be in grand service to a universe, i.e. MCU, DCU, Universal monster movies, etc. In conclusion, the movie is a grand feat in film making, story telling, and acting. Entertaining and gripping throughout, Blade Runner 2049 serves as a prime example for any film maker who wants to create a good film.",Blade Runner 2049
1492,nannilulic,What the visuals! What a beauty! What a masterpiece!!!,8,8 December 2017,"The visuals of this movie are just amazing, I have never seen something so beautiful in a picture until now. What we see on the screen for 2 hours and 30 minutes is a mixture of perfect use of colours and lighting. Every setting is characterised by its own colours: settings which present cold colours (like the one at the beginning of the movie) and settings which present warm colours (like the radioactive setting where Agent K meets Deckard). The cinematography used in Blade Runner 2049 takes us back to the most recent Villeneuve's movies (Sicario, Arrival and Prisoners): slow camera movements and master shots which serve to highlight the importance of the character/s and the setting/s and to create the perfect thriller atmosphere. The imposing images that Villeneuve decide to show the audience are so beautiful that it's hard to feel the length of the movie even though it's quiet long, in average. The screenplay isn't complex and so is the story. The missing development of some characters is necessary since most of them are, in fact, replicants. I don't give it a 10 because, unfortunately, the story progresses too slowly and the villain is too little characterised. Best sequel of the history of cinema, even better than ""the empire strikes back"".",Blade Runner 2049

1494,alanhavelka,One for the Ages,9,1 September 2018,"Blade Runner 2049 is certainly one of the greatest films I've seen this year, if not ever. First of all, the acting. For me, this is one of Ryan Goslings finest performances in a motion picture ever. I don't think that Gosling receives enough praise for his performance. People sometimes call it 'one dimensional' or 'not special in any way' however he embodies his character masterfully. 'K' is a replicant living in a bleak dystopia, killing his kind for a living. Why should he be portrayed as a funny, goofy detective if there is literally no purpose in his life other than 'retiring' replicants. And when K finally finds his purpose in life, Goslings acting showcases every emotion felt seamlessly. Another great thing about this film was the cinematography, however the best way to describe it is the name Roger Deakins. Truly a oscar worthy showcase of skill. Next up the effects were so great that I didn't find myself questioning them even once throughout the film. And last but not least, the score. Hans Zimmer is a master qt work and this was one of the greatest soundtracks he has ever made. All in all Blade Runner 2049 is a well acted, masterfully scored visual masterpiece amd one of the best sequels ever made, thus receiving a perfect 10/10 score.",Blade Runner 2049

The main thing is you need to understand this movie is long, but not drawn out or boring which is what I got from the original - this kept me interested and captivated from start to finish. There was even times where I thought I knew where the story was going and it caught me by surprise again.If you enjoy a good sci-fi flick, this is a great film, you don't necessarily need to watch the original if you don't want to - it fills the gaps quite well, however if it's a rainy day outside and you want to get the full backstory - it couldn't hurt :-)",Blade Runner 2049

For me, this was the best sequel ever made and just maybe better than the original. The mood, environment and ambiance flowed seamlessly from BR I, with impessive new additions. Same with the story line which captured the mystery and depth of feeling from BR I, while being quite original. From acting through sfx and music this was a triumph in every respect.

1499,james-still,Visually Stunning Art Film with Threadbare Plot,7,6 October 2017,"No spoilers promise. Others have commented on the excellent direction and stunning cinematography so I won't repeat all of that. I will say that this movie seems inspired by Children of Men, Her, film noir, even Citizen Kane and of course the original Bladerunner. This film does stands on its own. And it's worth your time. The sets are gorgeous and I'm sorry but green screen CGI sucks when it's overused (looking at you George Lucas). Villeneuve understands that you have to give actors a context in which to interact with their environment. Gosling's K is so central to the film that you wish some of the supporting actors were given more time to develop. But you're not going to get too much warmth here. It's a bleak landscape populated by people full of existential angst. Like the original much of the dystopia centers around societal collapse. But unlike the original you don't get the sense that the rich are leaving in droves ""off world"" to Eden planets while the poor remain to cope with a hellish Earth. It's implied of course but there's so much more claustrophobia here and the sense that everyone – rich and poor alike – are all trapped in perpetual shadow and rain. For me the film is at its best when it shows us how technology can isolate us from ourselves and each other. The big weakness here is the plot. A central plot point, revealed relatively early in the movie, is supposed to be so game-changing if word got out humankind would revolt. This plot point drives the antagonist. But it just didn't seem like such a big deal for me. In a world that feels on the edge of collapse the complications revealed in the plot wouldn't seem like much of a game changer were I to live in that world.",Blade Runner 2049
1500,didily-76763,Not an Action Hero Movie,10,15 December 2018,"I think this movie was awesome in every way. Unfortunately, the mass movie viewing audience these days better appreciates action hero, comic book type movies that, IMO, are mostly junk, and that is why the user reviews are generally not so good. This movie was not only beautiful, great effects, great story, fantastically directed and produced, but also thought-provoking, great characters and good character-chemistry and dialogue. You could see and feel how the Replicants were so close to being human but had just enough quirks to show that they were not and were indeed artificial. And Joe's realization through his intelligence and humanity to understand more and more as the movie progressed his artificiality. Other movies I thought great that a lot of others did not were Oblivion and Shutter Island.",Blade Runner 2049
1501,Silentsleep,Atmospheric but dull,5,20 October 2019,"Recently rewatched this after seeing it in the cinemas. There is no denying it is visually and atmospherically stunning, but the original is such a classic - with so many other imitators - that living up to it would be unlikely. There were some interesting aspects that could have been pushed further: the framing in terms of climate change and ecological collapse was really interesting and I loved the scenes at the dump for conveying the sense of decay. But where the atmosphere was interesting, everything else just fell flat. Nowhere was this more evident than in Jared Leto's character Wallace. Everything about the script, the plot, and Leto's acting just came across as bloated and needlessly wordy. The last third of the movie lags terribly in the beautiful Las Vegas setting, before being redeemed by a stunning fight scene in the ocean. I can't help but feel there are similarities to Ridley Scott's Prometheus alien sequel which just drowned its own pretentious wordiness.",Blade Runner 2049

If you enjoy slow-paced action, an A-List actor who barely appears in the movie and a complete state of confusion, then this is the movie for you. If you're looking for an engaging storyline that your eyes can stay open for, trust me, even the Emoji Movie is a better choice.

1503,KrustyGeezer,"Amazingly, Didn't Disappoint....",10,22 November 2018,"Whilst I looked forward to this film, as a self-professed Blade Runner fan-boy,
it was not without a certain amount of trepidation. Right from the get-go, this latent concern was laid to rest. The film is not only visually staggering, it's also an aural wonder. Though thankfully, the soundscape doesn't swamp the film. Rather, it integrates perfectly, complementing the eeriness, the vastness, yes even soulless despair of the dystopian future presented by the large scale visuals. But this film isn't just a showcase for production technology. The feel of it, from the rain drench vastness of the West Coast megalopolis that is Los Angeles 2049, the culture-mashing, the CGI that is at once flawless yet retro, and the music that harks back to Vangelis' original score - it all meshes together, producing a holistic and satisfying evolution of the original. Even the well-handled storyline not only successfully continues on from Blade Runner, it further develops the themes addressed in it. At no time did I feel that this film was forced or a compromise, with tacked-on elements to justify its sequel status. Nor can I put a finger on the acting. Everything gels, and Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as the unemotive skin-job.
I know that I may be in a minority here, but this sequel IMHO, is right up there with Godfather II, where the follow-up is arguably better than the first film. Not so small an achievement by Director Denis Villeneuve, Cinematographer Roger A. Deakins, and Screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green. Kudos to all concern. After Arrival and now this, Villeneuve's up-and-coming production of Dune might not after all be the disaster, that one could be excused for expecting.
I have since seen this film both on 4K disc and in 3-D, and whilst it demands the largest screen possible and will test your HT sound system to the max., it is possibly the best produced disc out there.
Whilst I'm getting a tad weary of the hyperbole that is undermining the IMDB system, where people either give films 1 or 10 stars and nothing in between, I can happily give Blade Runner 2049 10 stars. That's because it bloody well deserves it.",Blade Runner 2049

I have to say Blade Runner 2049 was almost everything I hoped it would be.Bleak, dystopian future. High and low technology intertwined. Soundtrack that pays homage to the original. Wonderful scene-scapes. The storyline was great - thought provoking but not the least bit convoluted. The story also seamlessly continues from the original, even though it could be a stand alone.Yes there were some 'slow' parts in this movie; but these were perfectly fine and IMO added to the overall atmosphere. I really enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere of the movie, it was a visual treat.I do agree with other reviewers that a few scenes could have been cut without harming the movie, but they weren't completely pointless.My only disappointment was I feel there was a missed opportunity for the iconic line ""Time to die"", but whatever.Overall I loved this movie, well written and directed.

We still felt that same neo-noir immersive sensation with the drizzling rain, huge shadowy buildings, neon billboards and flying cars through the misty night over an endless cyberpunk city.2. Hans Zimmer got us as close as possible to classic Vangelis music score (still the men to worship). Even the ending scene uses the exact same track (""Tears in Rain"") for the Rutger Hauer's epic monologue.3. The audio archives of the dialogues between Deckard and Rachael, Rachael's picture and newly made replicant, short appearance of Edward James Olmos (""Gaff"") and details go even to the hair and makeup of the girls.4. Harrison Ford, whose appearance represents, besides real human charisma, the decisive link to the original movie.However, the not so good parts of the movie are:1. The main relationship of the movie: Ryan Gosling (as ""K"") and its stunning virtual girlfriend - Joi - an A.I. technological gadget. Because of this, the movie looks too focused on a theme that some other movies (like Her or A.I.) already went through: how technology and artificial intelligence can be ultimately enhanced to match humans. 2. There's too much time dedicated to Jared Leto (as Wallace) - a typical clichéd comics villain, which I think it is a misfit with the ""Blade Runner world"".3. The movie has some slow progression parts, that can make us look at our watch and then it seems that, suddenly, there was no time left – it rushes to a short and compressed ending, that could have been much more exhaustive (I am hoping for a ""Directors/Final Cut"").It's not a perfect movie but, at least, I really saw things you people wouldn't believe...",Blade Runner 2049

1520,nqe56072,"Some good aspects, some not so good.",4,20 November 2017,"MAJOR SPOILER ALERT Well, I was one of the original fans of Blade Runner when it was released in 1982. I went to see it many times in the cinema and it remains a personal favourite. I wondered if they would be able to make a decent sequel, and was inclined to think they couldn't. Well, at times when I was watching this, I thought they almost did achieve a fitting continuance. It was on a grand scale and the detail was impressive. Yet, little by little I began to get the feeling that this might have been done a whole lot better. Admirable and valiant, at best, but no cigar. Possibly an important film... Then, things became even cloudier. The original film has some scenes of quite intense violence, but I never felt at any time that such were anything less than necessary. Shocking, but necessary. It was part of the immediacy of the film. Here, however, I felt it was gratuitous, and worse, meaningless. The scene where Jared Lareto approaches the just-born naked replicant woman and then slits her stomach made no sense whatsoever to me. It was just to show his evil, I think. Later, the scene in which the new Rachel gets shot graphically in the head struck me as just ugly and disturbing. It was not only that but also a kind of desecration of an iconic and beautiful image. From there on in the film lost my vote. The ponderous nature of the pacing and the -it sometimes felt like- fetishistic need to reference the original film began to add up, to an experience that was less than the sum of its various parts. I didn't feel so great about the film after a while. I applaud the attempt, but I thought it would have been better to make a different film. Perhaps one a little like the original BR, that is, a classy, edgy film noir thriller, with lots of Dashiell Hammet elements thrown in. Short and snappy rather than drawn out and deep... BR was a film with a fair amount of light in with the dark, characters who smiled and you could feel their humanity, replicant or not. This film went somewhere else. Maybe that's okay. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I came out of the original film fired up with passion and inspiration. I came out of this one scratching my head, and not feeling particularly good about the whole thing. I'm sorry to say. Maybe one day I will see it again, and feel entirely positive about it. A lot of work and no doubt passion, went into this. There were many impressive aspects to the film. Maybe it has nothing to do with BR. That might be the answer. Alas, still not my cup of cha.",Blade Runner 2049
1521,NuncEstBibendum-1,"Good, with caveats",8,8 October 2017,"I enjoyed watching this movie. The cinematography is, as expected, breathtaking, the acting is excellent, with a compelling screenplay and state-of-the-art special effects - I would very much like to know how they managed to make Sean Young look exactly as she was 35 years ago, all the more so bearing in mind that she has not aged gracefully. If it was purely digital trickery, that would seem to imply that we are close to the age of fully synthesized actors.What is not to like about this movie? Two words: the music. The composers clearly made an effort to recreate the ethereal-cum-oppressive atmosphere of Vangelis's original soundtrack, which contributed so heavily to making a classic out of the original Blade Runner. They pull it off occasionally but, for the most part, they end up closer to Terminator. Especially at the very end, when the titles start rolling out. And Blade Runner is most definitely NOT a Terminator-like story.Another thing that I did not care so much about is the fact that the movie ends up at a point when the natural continuation would be a rebellion of the replicants. Not bad in itself, but hardly original, way too reminiscent of the Planet of the Apes saga - and perhaps a distraction from the Blade Runner universe. We'll see how this will pan out.The nature of Deckard is still left undefined. I have yet to find the replicant hypothesis convincing, for he does not have the physical prowess that replicants do have - i.e. he still gets the crap beat out of him when trying to tackle a replicant, only surviving because said replicant wants so. One could argue that, like Rachael, he was a special project - but one would have to come up with a compelling reason as to why a replicant meant to eliminate other replicants, would be so handicapped. While not impossible, this might end up being contrived and artificial.In summary, a very good movie, that would have been even better with a more appropriate musical score. Another thing: I watched it in an XD theater and, quite frankly, it was way too loud.",Blade Runner 2049

At other times, the confusion betrays itself as a loss of direction with no real point. Silence and wandering take up a good portion of the film.

I think this movie is about compassion and humane treatment. Rare themes these days in blockbuster movies.Sci-fi movies like this are rare. No predictable action sci-fi plot here. Blade Runner 2049 is a great sci-fi novel in a movie format. Some people have complains about the length of the film.

I find Ryan Gosling is either superb or just plain dull, he gives a performance that at face value appears dull, but that is how is character is supposed to be, but he adds a depth that is mind blowing and at the end of it all it will go down as one of his best performances, and his casting (IMHO) is a master stroke.This film won't be to everyone's liking, you either get it or you don't, and if you don't that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film.

1543,OskarW85,Another bitter disappointment from Ridley Scott,3,8 October 2017,"(Mild spoilers ahead) Do not be fooled by raving reviews of 10/10. This movie is worse for ""Blade Runner"" franchise than ""Alien:Covenant"" was for its own. I do not know what Ridley Scott is thinking taking a dump on his best known movies, but at this rate we will have ""Thelma and Louise 2:Get married or get busted"" and ""Black Hawk Down too"" by the end of this decade. My biggest problem with the movie is that it is not a ""Blade Runner"" movie at all. We all loved crowded, dirty streets of futuristic LA where neo-noir Deckard is hunting its prey. That atmosphere created tension from the first minutes up to the grand finale. Here we get bland, rather empty streets where couple of extras are wandering without a clue together with our main hero-K. In original we got pretty small sets that were creating illusion of huge city bulging with life. Here we have huge CGI pans of mostly empty streets. The difference is stunning. Deckard was using city to gain advantage, K is running in sterile sets pretending to be futuristic offices. In original we had beautiful sets with great lighting. Here we have bland CGI that cannot really compare to the real thing. I think it is pretty bad when neon lights from 35 years ago look much better than today CGI. It sounds silly, but they really do not make movies like they used to do.My second grip with the movie is the screenplay itself. Original had simple yet satisfying story of policeman hunting bad guys with nice, non-obvious ending and love affair to spice things up. Here we have Inception-like twists inside the twist inside the twist. Except none of the twist are really interesting. Our hero has no motivation whatsoever to do any of his actions. He just flows in the direction his boss throws him. We are supposed to follow journey down his memory lane, but he is just as disinterested in discovering the past as we are disinterested watching his actions. He goes to different locations seemingly at random. We almost don't see his detective work. Screenwriters must have felt similarly because they included character of Claire Underwood... I mean Lieutenant Joshi that literally tells K where he should go next. Screenwriters also tried to include ""copy"" of omnipotent Eldon Tyrell by creating character of Niander Wallace, played by Jared Leto. His delivery falls flat on its face. Instead of fearful ruler of the city we get mumbling, blind guy that serves no purpose at all. Scenes with him are long, boring and completely forgettable.Love affair is also laughable in this movie. While Deckard fells in love in beautiful replicant, K has affair with... a hologram. A hologram girl named Joi that is part of his apartment. Yep, we literally see him ""kissing"" and ""hugging"" a hologram. How is it even possible? I do not know. But they must have been very proud of it, because we even see scene of virtual sex where real life hooker is ""body double"" for the hologram itself and they enter one another. Yes, it is just as ridiculous as it sounds. In one of the plot twists K has to move hologram into temporary pen-drive-like device so bad guys cannot intercept it and learn about his plans. Yet during later attack pen-drive is destroyed and hologram ""dies"" shouting ""I love you"" to K. I cri evrytiem, seriously.And last but not least - the music. I do not remember a movie with such obnoxious score. Original had one of the most praised soundtracks made by Vangelis. Soundtrack to this movie was made by Hans Zimmer. But you would not tell. Most of the ""music"" are horrible synthesizer sounds reminding of ""other world Silent Hill"" score or dinosaur farts after auto-tune. I don't know if it's some cruel joke by Zimmer or maybe some Skrillex-wannabe made it and Hans just signed it. But it is bad. Really bad. People were literally leaving cinema during one of the longer fights, it was that unbearable.",Blade Runner 2049

1545,edgar-a-rodriguez,Great Sequel to Original; Check our Blu Ray extras,10,21 July 2018,"Just finished watching this on Blu Ray and I have to say the extra prologue content really completes the story. The extra three stories which explain the black out, Wallace's promise of docile replicants, and how a certain replicant gets involved with the story really helped lead to the year 2049. For those of you looking for a Harrison Ford/Ryan Gosling beat'em up round around the future adventure, you will rate this movie really low and call it very boring. But for the fans who know the Original final cut, you know these movies are very dark and noir. It's in a future setting but it's still a detective story with a bit of action sprinkled here and there. Yes there are flaws but this film helps cover the the original film and really completes it. The acting is so superb by everyone in the film; it sells the characters living in this time and place.

1546,alvinvigil-574-884399,A Near Masterpiece,9,6 October 2017,"What a difference thirty years makes. When we last saw Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in Ridley Scott's film noir 1982 classic, Blade Runner, he was ""retiring"" replicants - synthetic and genetically engineered androids that look like human beings – in Los Angeles 2019, before running off with Rachel, a replicant herself, implanted with childhood memories, believing she's human. In Blade Runner 2049, Los Angeles is still a dark, depressing and an urban decay of a congested dystopia. A young new blade runner on the LAPD payroll named Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is now hunting these new, sophisticated replicants created by a new company led by Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) after the Tyrell Corporation went bankrupt. But during this lawful retiring of replicants, Officer K stumbles onto a long-buried secret that could literally change the way society functions, thereby throwing the blade runner program into turmoil. French-Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve has created a near masterpiece with Blade Runner 2049. He has continued Ridley Scott's vision of a dark and depressing Los Angeles, however visually spectacular. Gosling is the perfect blade runner for this world somber, emotionless and does what he's told by his superiors (Robin Wright). Ford, coming into the second half of the film, is as good as ever. What were most impressive in Blade Runner 2049 were its impeccable production design and its stunning cinematography. While L.A. is a crowded, black and rainy metropolis, the entire city of San Diego in 2049 has become a junkyard wasteland made up of ship parts and building debris. And Las Vegas is now a dissolute, sand covered megacity. The visual effects, as expected, are amazing. Blade Runner 2049 is definitely one of the finest science-fiction films I've ever seen and most definitely, one of the best movies of the year. At nearly three hours, it is a little long.

It is revealed, the viewer and the characters get some time to process it and then the story moves on, just as it should). The acting from every single actor is beyond incredible.

1550,pgoochuk,Beautiful to look at but don't touch,7,9 October 2017,"Make no mistake, this is a beautiful looking movie. The first two thirds are an exploration for K, as he tries to fulfil both his mission and find out who he is. The slow pace works and is not a hindrance here - the first 90 minutes or so are wonderful.But sadly the film cannot continue to live up to the set-up, and the expected character developments fail to materialise. While in the original Blade Runner, each replicant was well drawn with clear motivations. We feared them, we felt tense in anticipation at what they might do next - but we rooted for them too. In this sequel, there is little of that, and the film nosedives in the final act. The lead 'bad' replicant, Luv, has none of Batty's motivation or conflicted humanity ('I've done questionable things'), she is a pure Terminator, an automaton.Jared Leto's Wallace is just another identikit action-movie villain. He wants to create a breeding race of slave replicants to build his Off World empire, but that's about it. When he captures Deckard with threats of torture to reveal the whereabouts of the child, we're in pure 70s Bond villain cheese.Unforgivably, the ending steals Batty's theme as K lies down in the snow, and we have an unrealistic family resolution. As also shown with Arrival, Denis Villeneuve loves to lay the parent--child stuff on thick, and as with Arrival, everything is neatly wrapped up and explained multiple times for the modern audience.As Mark Kermode famously once said, you can summarise every modern Hollywood movie in 4 words: 'I love you Dad' and sadly 2049 is no different.Still, I give this 7/10 for the bold vision, the cinematography, and sound, and, well, because it is still Blade Runner - just by numbers and committee.",Blade Runner 2049

Its influence on subsequent films of the genre is everywhere. It was also entertaining. It had a good story and moved at a pace that retained the viewers interest.""Blade Runner 2049"" achieves none of the above. It is okay to look at, but merely okay, a couple of the cgi sequences of ""Spinner"" flybys looked plain ""shonky"" whilst others looked great, but there was no consistency.The story had potential but it was the direction that was the problem. Its dull! Dull! Dull! Dull!It plods along, going nowhere, and going nowhere very, very slowly. Long labouring shots of scenery do not a plot make. 
Mumbling characters with little or no expression in either face or voice do NOT hold the attention, no matter how depressed they look. 
Characters who generate no sympathy, empathy or just interest in general from your audience do not make for a good film.
A bad guy with nothing to say, no real motivation, and is generally dull, (that word is the recurrent trait of this film) and just disappears from the plot halfway through does not hold any interest for the audience.So what we end up with is a slow, tedious film that exacerbates its dullness by feeling like its also being shown in slow motion, constantly.Once again the dearth of talented, original, independent thinking writers and directors in todays Hollywood is painfully exposed.""Blade Runner 2049"" stole 163 minutes of my life and I want them back.(P.S.

This means you should skip it if you don't have a long attention span and expect an explosion every 15 minutes.However, when you're in the right mindset and pay close attention you can see what a huge masterpiece this films is. It can suck you in and never let go. The visuals and the soundtrack are amazing. The story was very well setup in my opinion and it kept you guessing where it was going. Obviously I wanted to find out what happened to Deckard and Rachel. And while the film takes its time getting there, the twist involving K is worth it. The final act is incredibly suspenseful and I couldn't help but fight a tear at the new rendition of 'Tears in Rain'.",Blade Runner 2049
1559,keith_n_fawn,"Great visuals, true to the original, but pacing is far too slow",8,16 October 2017,"#1. This movie stays true to the original in look and feel, in some ways it feels like an extension, not a sequel made 35 years later. The directors keep the BladeRunner world intact, with only a few embellishments, which all work well.#2. The visuals are fantastic, especially the holograms. The holograms are so well done (including when they ""glitch""), that the viewer immediately accepts them as real, not gimmicky. You will leave the theater wishing you could run to the store and buy an Emanator by Wallace Corporation! I especially loved the scenes in the holo-dome where the dream creator assembles the memories that get implanted into replicants.#3. The plot twists are well-done, I am glad that I didn't know them before I saw the movie. Unlike the hack-job twists Ridley Scott has forced upon his Alien franchise, the BladeRunner 2049 twists fit well into the BladeRunner mythology and perfectly set up a 3rd movie, should they decide to do one.#4. The pacing of the movie is far too slow. The director, understandably, wants the viewer to soak in the ambiance of the world he created... but too many shots linger. 30 seconds here, 60 seconds there, and it all adds up to a movie that is about 45 minutes too long.#5. Jared Leto's character, unfortunately, is kind of a mess. Wallace obviously has a God complex, but his dialogue is barely intelligible, and his motivations are not expressed well. Plus, the senseless violence perpetrated by him and his assistant ""Luv"" appears to have no point, other than to paint the characters as ""evil"". The original BladeRunner did not draw such paint-by-numbers lines between good and evil, and I consider the Wallace and Luv characters to be the weakest part of the movie.",Blade Runner 2049

1561,GreyBird77,Gosling Gets in the Way of a Strenuous Movie,3,31 December 2017,"I'm one of the few who, despite having a semi-namesake in the original movie, never cared much for it. It's slow pacing, typical ""cops and robbers"" story mixed with some neat looking props and backgrounds, never did much for me.The original movie, however, had 2 saving graces that at least put it in a ""watchable"" category for me - Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford.Fast forward to present day and I have another unpopular opinion - Ryan Gosling can't act. He has a range of 2 character types; quiet and brooding and cocky 20-something-year-old. Asking him to go beyond that is too much for him and it shows. He has as much charisma as a day-old sponge and I have yet to see him in any role that made me feel a single thing for any of his characters.His role as the protagonist in this movie is awkward, at best. You would think that to follow in the footsteps of Harrison Ford, they would have wanted an actor capable of the skill, or at least being 180 degrees different. Instead, Gosling just pulls out more of the same Gosling acting talent and puts on face #2 for this role... which is a lukewarm, less ""rough"" version of Ford's character from the original. When he finally does meet with Ford's character... there's zero chemistry to be had.He's in desperate need of a sidekick, comic relief, a mentor, a student... somebody... ANYBODY to take the spotlight off of him and give us some breathing room. He was cast along side Anthony Hopkins in Fractured... and that was, perhaps, his best role, thanks to Hopkins' character. This only proves that Gosling doesn't have the charisma to carry a movie on his own.Following the story - we have... exposition. Followed by more... exposition. The writer in me screams each time I see an artist with access to moving pictures, use writing to tell their story. A good movie SHOWS you the story, instead of writing it for you. Then, it can be hit or miss. In some areas, it does this well, introducing areas and characters without writing an entire novel describing them. i like leaving something to the imagination and there are some scenes that do that very well.The CGI is,of course, CGI. It's difficult to give credit for good computer effects these days; it's like complimenting a person for breathing. The only noticeable attention it gets is the absence of it and either the brilliant use of piratical effects, or the catastrophic lack of. This movie obviously isn't trying to take any chances, so just expect some normal CGI.Overall, this movie is just a bland, tedious mess of lackluster acting and could-care-less-about characters - whether by design or by accident. If you're hard-core and need to know what happened next in the Blade Runner universe, then I'm sure you'd love this movie... and you wouldn't even bother reading a review that would say otherwise. If you're on the fence about it and either thought the original wasn't that great, or just don't like Gosling... then you're one of the few out there like myself.",Blade Runner 2049

1563,mhathegreat,Beautiful disappointment,4,3 November 2017,"I loved the original blade runner. It's one of my top 3 movies of all time. I never had very high expectations for this sequel, because I knew it could never live up to the original. But I wanted to see it for the sake of nostalgia and I was genuinely curious to see what they had decided to do. I'll start with the positive. The cinematography, CGI, and atmosphere generated by the settings were all incredible. I prefer the original's, however, as it had a somewhat ""darker"" nature to it. That being said, 2049 is Oscar-worthy in these departments. 10/10 here. The music was alright and felt fitting. Now the bad... Which is the rest of the film. The plot was entirely underwhelming and undermining the original, the themes almost coming across as desperate attempts to be as ground breaking as the original. In fact, I disliked the concept so much that it took away from the original movie, which sucked. The acting was mostly poor, though what can one expect from a sullen sulker like Gosling (he doesn't act, he just sort of glowers). The love sub-plot was weak and STRANGE, and Jared Leto... honestly, all I can say/ask is ""what the heck?"". Not even Harrison Ford and the nostalgia trap at the very end of the movie (the music) could save this disaster of a film.In summary, this film is stunning visually, and that's all. Watch it for what it is: a chance to show off the advances in CGI. Do what I did, expect the worst. I am still glad I saw it.",Blade Runner 2049

Everything from the plot, sets, the classic Vangelis score and the meticulous level of detail was just sublime. This *cough* sequel *cough* is not even in the same ball park stylistically, story wise or in any other way. It felt cold and lacked the originals ambiance and magical tone,moved like molasses and the overly convoluted and sleep inducing story made me stare at the walls and other patrons to see if they were still awake.

The SFX & music are just too loud, it became painful to sit through. There is a specific scene (don't worry this is not a spoiler) that K walks from out of the street to his apartment, with this obnoxious drum ensemble to which one would expect something of an action scene to be accompanying. No, all it was, was K walking from the st to his apartment, weird and stupid. What I found I enjoyed in the original, given the story was just a detective/love story, the world had drawn me in, the visuals, the sonics, all breath taking, 2049 sees to want to show less of this and while trying to mimic the original, loses it's own identity. I will let you be the judge of how this is done, but the hint lies within the music.This story did not need Blade Runner to carry it, to me it is a cheap cash in and the original just did not need a sequel, that was the beauty of it, unanswered questions. This is 2010 all over again. There are nice touches to the movie, don't get me wrong but the length of this movie, plus over hang in certain scenes just makes this for a really really boring experience. You do not care for any of the characters, there truly is no life to this film, given the context is actual life.My score is an actual real score, I am not kidding on how bad this film is, there is no real true character development, sure K gets his fair share of screen time with some nice plot twists, but you truly never feel for him as he seems too wooden (fault of Gosling imo). The movie's sound is much to present and lacks subtlety, the visuals seem in context but lack of any real substance, ie cityscapes as the original where it was populated, more as set pieces seems a mystery to me. Watching Deckard interact with his dirty grimy world in the original was what drew me in, 2049 we see less outside world and have these expansive interior sets, which makes you wonder what was truly achieved in the sequel, because it isn't the story, trust me.The original is mesmerizing due to how the world is portrayed, 2049 doesn't convey this due to many factors.Go see the movie yourself, be the judge, don't let my review sway you but it's not the sequel that should have been made imoThe OST is horrible, the visuals are acceptable, the story is any other story we have seen before, so there is not much on offer...",Blade Runner 2049

Each element of this movie is just amazing and they work very well together.,10,14 October 2017,"Non-Spoiler ReviewThe cinematography is absolutely beautiful and stunning and it represented the world of Blade Runner very well which I liked most about the original. Alongside the visual effects, it also expanded the world and showed how it evolved over the 30 years gap.The story is very effective and unpredictable, each character has a compiling arc which all contributed to the main plot (main character's) and the later was very emotional and suspenseful which Ryan Gosling was perfect for. Other main cast members did great a performance as well from the famous ones; Ford, Leto and Wright, to the less known; Hokes, de Armas and Davis. Oh Dave Bautista did great as well.The Score was astonishing as expected from Zimmer and Wallfisch, it worked well with the movie and helped to build up the scenes.I would recommend watching the 3 shorts on WB YouTube channel before and the original Blade Runner.",Blade Runner 2049
1570,sanglap1,Art at its best,10,27 October 2017,"It is obvious that you will see unexplained scenes and the magic of CGI in a science fiction. But what is not obvious is the slow and dramatic pace, the retro style, the psychedelic effect, the artistic set and a surreal vision, a classic and heart pumping background score, a sudden rise in adrenaline followed by a cold silence and last but not the least remarkable performances by every single character in the movie. But I think Ford (Deckard) was much more intense in delivering his emotions in 1982 Blade runner. However, it is Ryan Gosling's best performance till date after Notebook.Some people felt that the movie is bit slow and some scenes could have been edited to engage the viewers. But for me I think that's where it has succeeded. It is the realness of a moment which is more engaging than the breakneck stupid CGI scenes without any soul.The soundtrack was the backbone of 1982 blade runner and Vangeli used a variety of classical compositions from different culture and society. But Zimmer and Wallfisch has done it again and you will hear and see some classics by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presely. This is also not something obvious in a sci-fi.Cinematography of this film is a visual treat. Any movie buff knows who Roger Deakins is and this time he has painted the sadness of this dystopian world with his artistic frames that it is so easy to lost in that world without 3d glass or VR gear. If you are a fan of Roy Betty and fan of art and fan of Dennis Villeneuve and his complex story telling, then go for it. But yes, this will haunt you and torture you and ask you several questions for which probably you do not have any answer today. It will surely trigger the philosophical quotient of your brain and you will start questioning the core purpose and value of being human. The last scene will remind you Roy Betty from 1982 Blade runner -""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.""",Blade Runner 2049

The fact that it ""didn't do so well"" at the box office should give you a great idea of how this film steered away from the usual dribble that has been coming out these past couple of years to appeal to the masses and didn't pull a Ghost in the Shell.The trailers gave so much of a wrong impression to how the film actually is, and honestly when I watched them I was severely disappointed and sceptical, boy I was wrong.The film should be exactly what Blade Runner fans have been looking for all these years!

Ryan Gosling was awesome as usual and Harrison Ford gave possibly the best performance of his career.

This was the beginning of bleakness in science fiction movies and back then it was new and exciting.Fast-forward thirty some years later and nothing about it seems new and exciting at all. This sequel feels like it came from the marketing department where if a little of something made money then certainly, let's add more and try to make even more money.Long, drawn-out scenes (like the robot love-making), meandering sequences which mean nothing (the senseless killing of the new born replicant), redundant plot turns (the orphanage - I mean, how are all these kids feed?), not to mention huge gaps in logic (how does Deckard manage to live in a Vegas high-rise complete with electricity and one would assume, water?)We knew something was up with the matching girl-boy DNA so when that plot twist came it wasn't really much of a shock. In fact, nothing was really that exciting, perhaps because the dull pacing, ""music"" and acting lulled me into a near comatose state way before I could even begin to care about who mighty be the actual child of the replicants.

(Yeah, I know, come at me)One of the only redeemable factors of the original was that it was visually aesthetic. An amazing and avant-garde sci-fi world on par of what we have previously witnessed in Star Wars. The other factor being that it had a good concept. The whole human and replicant dynamic. Besides all that, sadly for me, the movie was overly long and very boring.However, this new and unexpected sequel had my attention. Mainly because Denis Villeneuve was the director. I've been watching his movies ever since Prisoners and boy, he didn't disappoint with this one.
Denis Villeneuve delivered what in our age is the rarest of jewels. A proper freaking sequel. He took everything from the original movie and expanded it beautifully in 2049. Not only 2049 is relatable to the original but more importantly, it stands as its own movie. In itself, it's quite the feat. Think Terminator 2:Judgement Day and more recently Mad Max: Fury Road.The story is great. The Cinematography Oscar-winning. The characters had depth and compelling arcs. Speaking of characters, the casting is brilliant. Ryan Gosling, The beautiful Ana de Armas, the underrated Sylvia Hoeks and Harrison Ford all brought their A-game.Talking of negatives this new one suffers from the same problems as of its predecessor. It's equally long and despite all the on-screen actions, a slow-burn movie.However, this movie is quite the experience and I left the theater smiling.",Blade Runner 2049

I just realized there's 3 shorts for it out, but watching it after was interesting too, allowed me to fill a few gaps, such as who's the blind guy for instance. I went in with zero expectations, I've been so disappointed with Hollywood lately, with these trends of remakes and sequels, I went in borderline cynical about it. It didn't help that just before the movie they played a trailer for the DC ""avengers"" and another pacific rim??From the first frame and the first strings of music of Blade Runner 2049 my eye lids just opened wide, this is one visually amazing and striking movie, so many hidden meanings in the dialog, in the set pieces, in how they light the shots, in the emotion of the music, the nuances of the acting, it's a pretty masterful movie in nearly every regarded for me, apart from minor things. I didn't feel Blade Runner needed a sequel at all, quite the contrary, but you know what, I felt that every person that worked on this film had a huge respect for the original movie, i really felt they worked on this and knew they had to honor the artists that came before them, and it shows. I'm considering going to imax to watch it again if i find the time, some of the scenes here need to be experienced in a huge screen and with a killer sound system. My inner nerd is pretty damn satisfied tonight!

But then the movie ended and I wondered who would answer all those questions I still had.So either the movie didn't make sense, it didn't explain enough or I wasn't attentive enough – I surely don't have the time to watch the movie over and find out.I had a similar feeling after the first part of Blade Runner but expected this to be a bit more clear as nowadays movies seem to be better structured (well, almost all).",Blade Runner 2049
1584,info-34248,"good, but need to watch it a second time",9,8 January 2018,"In 1982 I was 18. Blade Runner was not a great succes. Many people said or wrote, that it was too complex. That is was typical science fiction no one likes to watch. It became a cult movie (which to be honest says nothing about the quality of the story). I have watched it many times since. Blade Runner 2049: I saw it for the first time last week. I looked forward to it, because of Ryan Gossling and Harrison Ford for one and because it is Blade Runner, 'the sequel'. I was not disappointed. In my opnion: the atmosphere you feel is sublime. Gossling, Hoeks, Leto and Ford are great. The story is complex and dark. I think Dennis Villeneuve made a worthy successor to 1982 Blade Runner. I rate this move a seven, now, because there are quite a few things I did not understand. This is why I am saying: I need to watch it again. I personally feel that discrediting this movie as a franchise is not fair. My guess is that Dennis Villeneuve is a big fan of the first Blade Runner and really wanted to make this movie. Not just to 'cash in'. Off course, some like sweet, some like sour. So, not everyone will love it (as not everyone loved the 1982 Blade Runner). Try to judge this movie more or less as a standalone movie, leaving aside your emotions about the first one. It doesn't have to become a cultmovie part 2. I don't think any sequel has ever become a cult movie, when the first one already was (okay, maybe the Star Wars movies in the 80's and Aliens after Alien.) Enjoy it !",Blade Runner 2049
1585,manuelortega-57740,"The first was correct, the danger's to forget",6,13 October 2017,"I use IMDb and am genuinely troubled by the high rating of this movie, which is the impetus for writing this.I was born 8 years before Blade Runner came out, and may have seen it in one of its forms 20 times, or maybe twice that many. It has by now become a part of the luminous, cyclical geometry of my spirit, or as close to sacred as I can define.The three golden threads of the original- identity, memory and mortality, have either inspired the themes of my introspective path, or the latter is the reason I keep coming back to the work of art.Before watching the sequel I watched the original last night on my wall, and like always, it opened like a fractal. Revealing a new dimension in a familiar scape.So it turns out that Blade Runner was, besides anything else, a prophecy. At the dawn of the digital it saw the failure of memory to sustain our human flame. It proposed that machine or flesh are besides the point. It is remembering, in the face of our end, that saves us. We are real to the degree that our memory moves us (enter Vangelis). But memory itself was a delicate thing (enter Vangelis), and must be guarded. In other words, finding real emotion within, the artificial has found itself. This was done so subtly (enter Vangelis), and the film's magic was connecting the viewer with her own nostalgia as if it were Deckard's. When he finds the origami unicorn his reaction is, in so few words, ""so what"".Well into the digital now, propelled this way and that by cloud based identities, the new film makes a different proposition. That machine or flesh are besides the point. Emotions, when they arise, are deviations whether you are android or man. Were there any humans in the movie? I can confidently say barely. This is art in the age of digital identity, not memory. Certainly not Memories of Green. If identity exists at all, it is by selection. When K thinks the horse is his, he breaks down not cathartically but in seeming vexation. When he realizes it isn't his reaction is, in so few words, ""what now"".Less abstractly, and in the vein of several other grounded reviews, the film is boring. It really starts when Deckard beautifully says ""Rachel"" and ends with her actual image from the original a few moments later. A few moments after that in proper Transformer fashion a drone departs a flying car.. A good two hours or more into the film. It is 2017, so add a healthy pinch of martial arts and guns, and guns. There is a story, I think. K is searching for... Wallace is attempting to... Deckard is hiding from...Nothing really. They've mostly forgotten.The music is painfully bad. Sorry Hans. You are one of the greats, but there are no electric sheep without Vangelis.There is some beautiful art direction and cinematography, but towards the end it is absurdly overdone in an apocalyptic design that throws everything into the hat, looking like the Vegas Luxor on mushrooms.The acting is a mixed bag, with a lot of potential brought low by mediocre writing. He failed, but I still think Gosling was a perfect choice. His psychopath nemesis, whatever her appearance signifies about how we see us and technology, was an interesting performance.I've exceeded my allotted portion of attention. I was afraid, I think, of loving the new one as much as these reviews suggest I should. I can now forget it and go back to loving 1982. To remembering. Has this film jumped to the 51st best within less than a week because of an army of bots? Or because we have forgotten something? Either would be appropriately cyberpunk.",Blade Runner 2049

It took me till 2021 to finally watch it and only now am I kicking myself for not seeing it in the theatre. I was filled with relief that it didn't disappoint.
This movie excels in every way. The story, the special effects, and the acting are top notch. Yes, the slow pace and long running time can be a turnoff to most movie goers especially if they've never seen the original but those two factors only allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the film's beauty and be pulled deeper into the characters.
I've seen a lot of terrible reviews for this film and it makes me think of how many terrible reviews the original Blade Runner received after its release. Perhaps years from now this movie will eventually get the praise it deserves This movie is a welcome surprise and a worthy addition to the original.",Blade Runner 2049

I do see mixed reviews from diverse groups of people who expected a lot from this movie and got what they wanted and vice versa.It had potential to live up to the high bar that was set...and I wanted it to be amazing...but when you put all the components together of this drawn-out movie, you get a solid six. The visuals were fantastic (in fact, every single shot was masterfully done), but the story line, to my surprise, seemed almost endless and going nowhere at times. If you stick it through though, it isn't the worst movie you've seen, neither the best. It's very exhilarating in the dystopian future portrayal of technology, but the movie as a whole wasn't done well enough to make it absolutely breathtaking as a sequel. This film's plot is nothing but lengthy, filled with little to no substance. Some scenes are heavily unnecessary. And though there were gorgeous visuals, they were bogged down by the excessive screen time they had. There was plenty of time to develop a solid story line (almost three hours), but maybe that was the point. Frame by frame it was beautiful, but line by line it was exhausting.However, it is a film that makes you feel like you're living in a dream. Take that how you will.""Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real."" - the only piece of insight that I hold on to from this film, as said by Jared Leto's character, Niander Wallace",Blade Runner 2049
1590,filipaven,"Really slow, boring and quiet",1,25 November 2017,"I saw the movie in the cinema tonight. The movie is really slow-moving, with long scenes with limited story and much reflection. Often the scenes are without any music/dialogue. The movie is way too long based on the actual story and should be shortened by minimum 75 %. I was personally very bored by this movie, and from my perspective this is the worst movie I have seen this year. Some sporadic music without any logic to the story development; the music could indicate something happening, and then nothing happens.

1594,lemket-74887,"Good looking, but weak plot",7,27 October 2017,"So about two weeks ago I watched bladerunner 2049. I really wanted to like this movie. I liked Denis Villeneuve's Sicario and Arrival, I think Roger Deakons is a great cinematographer, I like Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford doesn't annoy me. However I was a little disheartened because Ridley Scott was involved with the script, and while I appreciate Ridley Scotts great achievements in science fiction Cinema (namely the first Alien movie and the original blade runner), the Alien Prequels made me mistrust Ridley Scott's ability to actually recognize a good Story. So here are the Spoilers:The first blade runner movie was very simple. Some Replicants want a longer life, Bladerunner Deckard is ordered to ""retire"" them and finally is saved by one of them, so that said Replicant (Rudger Hauer) can share his final memories with him. Very simple, very human, very touching and thought provoking. Very old philosophical questions were raised: what does it mean to be human and so on. Now, the premise of the new bladerunner movie is: Rachael from the first blade runner movie actually had a child. Our Protagonist K (Gosling) thinks he might be this child, but finds out he isn't. Obviously Weyland found a way to make a Replicant that can procreate. Fine. For some Reason the Weyland follow up, played by Jared Leto, can't figure out how to do this. Don't ask the ""why"" question, because if you do, you might ask: what is a replicant? Obviously a genetically engineered being, a little more complicated than a cloned human being. So a replicant in order not to be human has to be modified, so that no replicant can live longer than a set number of years, he/she can't disobey his master, he/she can't bear children. To make a replicant who can have children should actually be more simple than creating one that can't. But Jared Leto can't figure it out. This wouldn't be a Problem, if the movie actually gave intriguing answers and theories about Replicants having children. However, this is not the case. So the answer to the supposed riddle that Rachael had a child is: well, the father should have the right to finally meet her. And this is basically the message of the movie. While the original movie asked questions about human nature, this one is Content with solving Basic Family issues.Jared Leto's incompetence as a creator of Replicants who can procreate is merely a plot device, because we must have a villain, but it actually doesn't make sense. The first movies plot moved logically and naturally, this one is filled with artificial conflict and questions, which aren't very interesting.But it looks great. The Music is fine, though not on par with the original score. Acting is good. Dialogue is fine, but the Story as a whole is pointless.So as a cinematic experience it's an 8/10, storywise a 5/10 at best.",Blade Runner 2049

1596,graysevennames,A Classic Netheless,10,10 September 2018,"Denis Villeneuve and Rodger Deakins make the best tag team in film today. Starting with the cinematography, it was nothing short of groundbreaking, I won't say much considering it's an experience all on it's own. All I'll say is that I'm almost certain will be talked about and revered for years to come. I must mention, this film felt distractingly white, but considering that one of the people who was fronting millions of dollars is a black man I take it as more of them choosing the best person for the role. That does put Ryan Gosling in a very simmilar role he's been known for, which will definitely bother some, but only as much as they let it. The visual effects were astounding, this film had a budget of 150 million dollars, nothing in the movie look fake. the way Deakins utilizes the set and lighting is genius. This isn't a new observation in the least, but you could take any frame from the movie and use it as a desktop screensaver. The story was fantastic, notably it didn't depend on the previous movie at all, it used it as a reference point but never jabbed at your shoulder and said ""Hey, remember when the last movie was great and this scene happened, now we did it"", it's truly it's own movie and it did it flawlessly. Unlike the original the pacing was never an issue, which is very impressive considering this is 43 minutes longer. Despite being nearly three hours it felt like an hour and a half. However the screenplay is not without it's flaws, the dialog can be extremely cheesy at times and there was an amazingly convenient moment at what could be considered the beginning of what I would say is the climax, that would normally set it back a point. However it happens I'm talking about Blade Runner 2049. If I'm being honest, I sincerely doubt you will have an honest conversation about cinematography, visual effects, set design, or pacing without mentioning this movie. It's the kind of movie born out of the influence and surpassed it by miles, perfecting the concepts brought about, reinventing them, and evolving into something completely different that will influence so many down the road. For that, I think it more than deserves a perfect score.",Blade Runner 2049

I think what this movie was really trying to do was set up for more sequels. That said, seeing the old Deckard see the remade replicant of Rachel brought a mist to my eyes. I guess I liked this movie because I loved the first one. I wanted more. More info on Jared Ledo's character and Luv for example. Why did she cry every time she killed for one.

The imagery was breathtakingly beautiful and I thought the sound design and music were incredibly impressive. Ryan Gosling fit the main part perfectly and I loved the aura Villeneuve managed to create around him. The only two little criticisms I had was 1) the Jared Leto character was a tad boring and 2) as a young woman, I found the hologram scenes hard to watch at times (but this is possibly just my taste and not necessarily a fault of the film itself).

It was quite the experience watching this movie in the cinema, along with breathtaking visuals the audience is treated to a kickass soundtrack. The acting is top notch; Ryan Gosling imbues Det. K with so much vulnerability that he is ""more human than human"" - he definitely feels more alive than Wallace (Leto playing a cold, ruthless corporate master of the world) and/or Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright playing Det K's badass LAPD boss). Ana de Armas is brilliant as Joi and Harrison Ford briefly reprises his role as Deckard for the last act of the movie.I was quite pleasantly surprised watching this, was expecting it to be an action-packed reboot/sequel but it turned out to be more introspective, dystopian and heartfelt than the final cut of the original. The only reason I am not giving this film a 10/10 is because I would have liked the pace to have picked up once Deckard showed up and maybe have him do more as the film's promotion implied. Also, would definitely recommend watching the original before, there is a lot that happens in the movie that is related. A particularly standout scene is the one with Joi, Mariette and K - the interaction between these three is melancholy, mesmerizing and so heartfelt - you really start to hope that Joi and K will make it.

But when compared to the first film it was mediocre, I'm afraid. The cinematography was bland. Too much light in the interiors. The original was very dark, which is extremely difficult to film but fascinating to watch. Whereas here you see everything and the actors are put in these silly little rooms. Why would you flood those rooms in light if there's an energy crisis? Too many American shots -- not surprising as you have no options in these tiny rooms. It's like they were filming it to be watched on mobile devices. I also found Wallace pure comic book nonsense, spouting cod philosophy. Why make the inventor of replicants a replicant? We don't learn anything about his motivation, other than he's mad or fanatical. Why? What's driving him? The first film was in mode of classical Greek tragedy. Sacrifice and redemption. This film is rather too Hollywood, about a father who loses contact with his child and wants to see her again. The replicant becomes the conduit or plot device for a family reunion. It's not a story that moves me. But overall it had some touching moments.",Blade Runner 2049

Well written script, excelsior photography, awesome soundtrack (although i missed Vangelis, he really missed it). Watch this movie! I recommend it! But attention: watch it quiet, unhurried, unworried, healthy and rested. Don't expect a movie full of twists and action all the time. Blade Runner requires ATTENTION, reflection, immersion, and philosophy about existentialism.*SPOILERS FINAL'S SCENE EXPLAIN*When Roy cries in the rain we can realize this: we don't see his tears, because the rain hides it. However we KNOW he is crying (a masterpiece subliminal scene). This scene reveals Roy's frustration and reveals that Time (or Death) actually destroyed all the experiences he lived (real or not), but importants for him by losting them, attributing insignificance to them.On another hand at the same scene the movie cut to the Deckard's face and what we see? Deckard's crying in the rain, but WE CAN SEE his tears highlighted. This time, the rain don't hide the tears. Why? Because this moment won't be lost in time, unlike Roy said. Because Deckard learned with Roy the meaning of what is be human, and what is the valor of life. In other words, Roy and his lesson won't be lost in time. He will be remembered forever, in one way or another.Now, when i saw the last Blade Runner 2049' scene, i've confirmed that theory (what made me cry): Joe (Agent K) laid down on the stairs, ""Crying in the Snow"". The snow represents the peace and calm with himself, but once more the movie show us his frustrate tears highlighted. WE CAN SEE his tears. Why? Joe, despite sadness and frustration, DIES KNOWING HE WILL BE REMEMBERED, unlike Roy, because he did (willingly, free of chains) the right (and relevant) thing by saving Deckard's life and providing the meeting with his daughter. In other words, these tears won't be lost in time, like tears in snow.So, both Roy and Joe, died doing the right thing that has eternalized in the world, unleashing important events, so that they will never be lost. The difference is that Roy died thinking that he and his actions (and memories) would be forgotten, while Joe don't.﻿",Blade Runner 2049

It's like ""The Hitcher"" and it's sequel all over again....I must be getting old.",Blade Runner 2049
1608,reagan_mccoy,Sequels Are Like Any Other Machine; They're Either A Benefit Or A Hazard,9,28 October 2017,"Upon the announcement that this film was in production, I seriously had to question what story was there left to tell. Nonetheless, I was cautiously optimistic to return to Ridley Scott's universe after nearly 35 years (though I myself did not wait that long). The film tells the story of Officer K, a replicant police officer who stumbles upon the corpse of a replicant who had died during child birth. Tasked to find the child and save the world from a potential replicant uprising, Ryan Gosling takes the audience on a wild ride. The investigative work, the desperate search for answers all resonate to the original film while telling its own story. The film adds new elements and technologies that really deepen the universe and add a certain flare (hologram Elvis, anyone?). The shots and scenery are just as breathtaking as they were in 1982. Despite clocking in at nearly 3 hours, there is hardly a dull moment in this film. Throughout that duration, an incredible story is presented and resolved, no sequels needed - and I pray it stays that way.",Blade Runner 2049

Dragging Harisson Ford back as an old man wasn't very creative, although, it does add to the impact of the movie.Please don't do another sequel; not even 100 years later.

1614,Algnosis,"Powerful, honors the original",8,28 December 2017,"Let me get this out of the way: the film is simply stunning visually. They did a masterful job of bringing the mystique of the first film to life in full HD without sacrificing the integrity of the original's look and feel. Strong performances from the main actors leave the viewer engrossed in the film from start to finish. Subtle yet powerful twists take place that leave you questioning your emotions about character throughout the film. Once of the things that this film gets a lot of credit for in my book is successfully creating a story that the viewer can care about as a sequel to the original Blade Runner. There was a lot to manage here and I feel that they did a near masterful job of pulling it off. This film is absolutely worth seeing and is one of the more underrated movies of the year in my opinion. The film is even more impressive when watched directly after a viewing of the original Blade Runner as you get to appreciate just how successfully they recreated this world. It's newer and shinier than the original but it feel just as gritty, hopeless and bleak. This is a must watch for all Sci Fi fans and fans of the original film.",Blade Runner 2049
1615,manganoid,Replicants of the replicants,2,29 December 2017,"This movie should have never been made, at least not under the Blade Runner franchise. The original, even tough veeeery loosely based on a short story by F K Dick, was actually quite original and groundbreaking for the cinematography of the time. This one, ""the sequel"", has a very shallow and predictable story / plot, trying to mimic some of the atmosphere of the Blade Runner of 1982 and make it ""genuine"" by using state-of-the art CGI and some artsy-like design have instead made the entire movie look and feel like a cheap Canadian (no offense intended) Sci-Fi TV series from the 90s. Also, very ambiguous at best, the viewers are forced to believe that Decard was actually a human falling in love with a replicant (facepalm). Did Ridley actually make this film at all O_o 
If some people of the younger generation believe this to be a masterpiece it's simply because they haven't witnessed anything genuine and raw from Hollywood in the last 20 years or so and have nothing to compare it with. IMHO, if the movie was made as a single, out-of-franchise flick, then it would deserve a solid 5* and would unavoidably be compared to Blade Runner as being influenced by. However, this is a solid 2* kino :/",Blade Runner 2049

Midway through, I considered leaving the theater and getting something to eat. It's not that I was hating it or anything. But I stayed just because, well, I had bought a ticket. That doesn't happen to me a lot. I've never left a movie, save one, in my life. On the positive side, this is the first time I've ever needed to go to the bathroom during the movie, and just did that, without speeding up my walking pace at all. It was during an underwater fight scene or something. How you make a scene like that boring, I don't know, unless you're a filmmaker really concerned about your Art n' Technique and left the fun, and suspense, and wonder of just going to the movies for your audience behind a long time ago. It's not that I don't like movies like this. The original Blade Runner is one of my favorites, I've seen it many times.I just saw one review that mentioned 'pretentious and infantile'.

The original Blade Runner had tension, mood, live-or-die action, a great score by Tangerine Dream, and a story that could be followed. I have tried four times to watch this 2049 sequel and the plot still escapes me. Worse, I find I am getting very bored with computer effects.There was gratuitous nudity to try and capture some attention, but even that didn't add to the plot (if there is one). The acting was positively wooden and the scrpt was whispered and mumbled. Even an aging Harrison Ford couldn't save this movie.

1621,SjaakadeliC,"Opens up the universe, but no masterpiece.",8,9 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy sequel. 2049 opens up the universe, but for me felt like it just went from setpiece to setpiece. People that give the movie a 10/10 have rose colored glasses on. Maybe biased or nostalgia is clouding their judgment. The movie opens up the universe, but never feels as good as the original. Plus there is no awesome badguy like Roy in the original that was always looming from the dark(cat/mouse game).It's gorgeous to look at, has interesting characters and factions, but never fully fleshes out some characters.Pros: + Gorgeous visually, plus detailed scenery. + Music: even though Hans Zimmer made the music last minute, it worked. But sometimes sounded like a lackluster VanGelis remix, yet it works. + Feels like a living universe. You feel immersed in the world. You could feel the tension between Replicant and human Blade Runners(whenever K passes a human Blade Runner, he looks to the ground) and normal humans vs Replicants. + K and Joi's 'relationship'. + Deckard returns, but only the last 45 minutes. + Never gives us too much answers, and opens up new debate about Replicants + AI.Cons: - Story could have been more open. Not much room for debate about certain characters or actions. - No 'Blade Running' or interrogation by Blade Runners after first 10 minutes. - Sometimes felt like it went from setpiece to setpiece, with little information. Get information-X, go to location-Y, rinse repeat. - In said setpiece, characters pops up with information with a couple of lines and then vanishes for the rest of the movie. It felt like there was another sequel coming or a tie-in game in the making. - Lackluster bad guy(Wallace) + woman(Luv). While Luv's actress can act(as she has to kill people, be a killing machine whilst crying), her character never felt fully fleshed or even menacing. She was just bad because her maker told her to be, nothing more. Roy in the original felt menacing, but we felt for him, because we knew why he did what he did.Worthy sequel. 8/10.",Blade Runner 2049
1622,radialdrift,A Sequel that didn't need to be made,6,5 October 2017,"I loved the original film, it left me wondering what just happened and where did the story go after the credits rolled, and that was fine for me. The Sequel just never takes off, it spends a lot of time selling the idea of the previous film, before it tries to come up with something new. There are many, many scenes in this film that are pointless and drawn out. They attempt to create an underlying theme but all they do is extend out parts of the film needlessly. Jared Leto's performance, in particular, is over acted and drawn out. His entire story line could be left out and the movie would function exactly the same, and would actually be more enjoyable. One of the scenes later in the film really ruins the legacy of the original. It was a homage that was as awful as the Leia scene in Rouge One.The main story is mildly interesting to a point, but it gets watered down with all the auxiliary re-hashed ideas from the previous film. Where as the original was a believable piece of Sci-Fi, this has scene after scene that leaves you sitting there thinking, ""So that just happened how exactly?""

Not only did it honor the original music with a tribute to Rutger Hauer's final scene in BR, it presented outrageous volumes of synthesized leads and strings swelling from side to side in genuine majesty to the visuals most of the way through the film. I was mesmerized and in awe of the powerful support this gave to the plot. The audio montages and foley FX were right up there in quality leaving me in no doubt that I now have to admit that the original BR has been displaced as my all time Number 1 movie by this stunning, elegant production.

1630,TobyBedford,A Misunderstood Masterpiece,10,9 June 2020,"Honestly I believe this to be the best film I've ever seen, so many things to mention.(THE VISUALS)
Let's address the elephant in the room, the way the movie looks. Every second, every frame of this film is a spectacle to the eye. You could honestly pause this movie at any moment and have a picture that belongs in a gallery. Much like the first film, this movie uses colour and light to an extent I've never seen before. The way the pinks and blues of the city depict a neon eye-sore money hungry city deprived of it's sense of humanity to the intense orange saturation of Vegas creating a feeling of seclusion and isolation, all the colours come together in the most unrealistic way to create a world that feels alive and lived in.The film was shot by highly regarded cinematographer Roger Deakins and he has his magic touch all over this one, absolutely some of his best work. If you were to watch this movie without sound, the camera work alone would be enough to convey the mood of a scene and it's flow. To film they used the old technique of miniatures which make every environment look incredibly real.(THE SOUND)
The sound throughout ties in with the visuals like a ballroom dance on the edge of the end of the world, ie it's both beautiful and terrifying. The soundtrack consists of old synth music with hints of modern techno to create not only some of the most fitting music in every scene, but at times some of the scariest. The bass and rising tones are enough to bring tension without any visuals, but when working together come to bring a sensory experience unlike any other.(THE ACTING)
Gosling may get a lot of criticism for his straight-faced quiet style of acting, but I struggle to think of a better fit for this role. His character is almost void of emotion including happiness until he is forcibly put into a situation where he has no choice but to face himself, and Gosling is able to pull this off to the point where I don't even recognise him while watching the movie.Ford's oldman physique and gruffness matches exactly how I'd imagine Deckard would end up after years of seclusion, and he very well recaptures his original character from the first film while also changing it up enough to make it believable(THE THEMES)
In contrast with the first film's themes of losing identity and individuality, this film focuses on finding humanity and coming to terms with yourself. This is summed up perfectly by the still standing question; is Deckard a replicant? To which the best answer can only be; does it matter? He feels, he cares and he loves. It doesn't matter if he's a replicant or not because ultimately he is HUMAN.Another example is K's main drive in the film of finding out whether or not he is the child. Throughout his life he's come to believe that as a replicant he doesn't amount to anything, and the idea of being the child is the sense of meaning that is absent from his life. He desires to be human. Even after discovering he is not the child, he still achieves his humanity by rescuing Deckard. Being denied of something you wish for so dearly, and yet still going out of your way against the odds, putting your own safety at risk to save he who denied you simply because IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO is the greatest example of humanity.The final example is K's holographic companion Joi. Though she is little more than a program, K is able to find love for her and in the moment of her death she experiences real fear and we the audience feel TERRIBLE for K's loss.(THE RECEPTION)
Whenever I ask people about this movie I usually get similar results, something along the lines of 'It's boring and slow'. This is most likely due to the surface level interpretation. Judging this book by it's cover it looks like a Star Wars style sci-fi action movie with lots of quick cutting fighting and huge set-pieces. This really couldn't be further from the truth. The movie is a long and slow dramatic noir that follows an insignificant character as he finds a sense of greater meaning, and should be viewed as so for the best experience.(CONCLUSION/TLDR)
The way all of the elements of this film come together in a cocktail of colour and sound lead this film to be one of the best view experiences of the last century and is absolutely worth your time!",Blade Runner 2049
1631,crookedstump,Cinema goes up a notch,10,27 October 2018,"I've seen this movie in the theater and I've seen it at home and the more I see it the more I see. It grows on one. It has elements that continue questions from the original Blade Runner in my mind and Ryan Gosling does a brilliant job as an unemotional replicant Bladerunner who is caught in the cross hairs of manipulated existence to the extent that he learns that he may well have a soul after all. Humans that are so ""fragile"" they have to enlist replicants to do their dirty work but cannot abide any change to the order of things suppressing any hint of a biological ""miracle"" when a replicant became pregnant. Why I'm not certain because the head of the Tyrel Corporation is attempting to do just that. Overall I give this movie a 10 for it's story line, acting, scripting and sound effects.

I was bored stiff and slept through most of it. The second time was two years later. I had even forgotten that I had seen the movie before but remembered shortly after the early scenes. For me, the major difference the second time around was that i caught the early explanation about replicants so i watched the movie with greater context. With that clarity, I could follow the absorbing storyline while appreciating the fantastic set, the sci-fi effects, and the minimalism of the dialogue (sparse and slow but weighty). It is truly a phenomenal work; I'm not surprised it won an Oscar. If you were one of those disappointed, I would advise watching again from the very beginning and taking time to savor the movie as a cohesive artistic interpretation not a shallow action movie.

The colors were visually appealing and added to the mood of the story completely. Considering this is a sequel, it did not feel like a cash grab. The writers and director worked hard to add more to the dystopian world first seen in Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" The story had a noir/western feel to it, in a good way. If I'm being honest, I would love to see another film in this universe. There is so much to be told regarding this version of our world.My only complaint is that Jared Leto's character was underdeveloped and had little screen time. I was expecting a big battle between Wallace and K/Deckard at the end. At the same time, it ends on a good note with K peacefully dying and Deckard meeting his daughter. There is definitely room for a sequel, regarding what Deckard does next or if there will be a war between the replicants and the government.Overall, this is a great sequel to a great film.

1649,jefferson_rodrigues,Amazing,9,6 June 2021,"The year is 2049 and now the new replicants are being created by Wallace's company, they are more obedient than the first species and have helped to eradicate hunger in the world. Our main character ""K"" is a Blade Runner and one of them, he has a mission to ""retire"" his own kind, one day he gets a mission that if he fails could bring the whole world to collapse.One of the biggest discussions in this movie is what makes a human being a real human being. Are replicants also human? They have a conscience as anyone else, they have feelings like happiness and pain, so why are they treated as a sub-race? Could they find a way to fit into society?""K"" is always shown very passively, following orders without much questions and accepting his life as a creature created to serve humans, but throughout the film we see him become more independent and act on his own mind, in a way very slowly, he finds out more and more about himself and his kind.Some people might say the movie is too slow, maybe it didn't need to take nearly three hours, but I think it fit the atmosphere, I was totally fixated on the movie, in the end I didn't even realize I spent almost three hours watching it.Blade Runner is one of the biggest movies I've ever watched, there are some twists and scenes that got me very excited and emotional, everyone should watch.",Blade Runner 2049

1. The movie has a good story.2. The movie looks good, and it has a lot of special effects that look cool.3. The movie is sort of popular now.4. The movie has the first movie's protagonist.5. The movie has two protagonists, one is the main protagonist, the other is the secondary protagonist.6. The movie has a happy ending with the two protagonists all survive.Cons
1. The movie is sometimes kind of mind-bending and the audience does not understand.2. The movie is kind of old for a 2020s guy.3. The movie is not as popular as the first blade runner movie.What I learned
1. If there are bad guys destroying good guys, there will be good guys that destroying bad guys.2. Replicants are not the same as robots, replicants are robots that look like humans.3. Farms do not always farm plants. Maybe farm animals or bugs.4. Some people do not tell you they are saving you until they saved you, but after that, they still might not tell you they saved you.5. Replicant's name is not always a serial number, it can be an actual name.6. Replicants maybe can give birth to babies, so they maybe are own of their kind.",Blade Runner 2049

1656,aaronerb,Amazing (almost),7,17 October 2017,"This film gorgeous as everyone has noted. One of the most beautiful films I've seen in a while. It's not a breakthrough piece like the original but it's a good smart story all the same.I like sci fi and was enthralled for about three quarters of the film. There is a clever play on the question of how we would treat androids that reverses roles in the romantic life of the main protagonist 'K'. So much of the film revolves around the replicants that I felt something akin to culture shock. There's a grimly humorous reference to the anarchic bands of post apocalyptic humans found in so many other future dystopias. The return of Deckard is mostly well done. The interesting question of whether he is a replicant is almost answered but (again) thankfully not conclusively. The film is too long. I thought that was just the complaint of a younger generation brought up on thoughtless Marvel ""sci fi"". But some scenes added time without purpose. And for all that time taken the film ends without much of a conclusion. Maybe that's okay: not an archetypal storyline. But you can feel the producers wanting a sequel if the film does well. I'm not a fan of this contemporary trend that puts box office takings ahead of story structure. Despite its length I felt the film was well paced overall. Perhaps the biggest fumble is the character of Wallace. Unlike the original film this one contains an unambiguous ""bad guy"". He's a straightforward psychopath from central casting. And boring as a result. What's worse, they gave him some quirky robot doodads - a clear cover for the lack of depth in the character. His henchwoman replicant is better, she's got some personality and a more relatable motive. I'm particularly fond of dystopian film futures. And this is a very good one with a few notable flaws.",Blade Runner 2049

About 45 minutes into the movie I asked my husband if he understood what was going on and he did not either. Not only is it difficult to understand what is going on, but it is dark and slow. (many scenes of the characters holding their hand out into the fake snow, looking at their hands. or long shots of the characters staring off into space.) The only color in the movie occurred for about 30 seconds when green leaves were shown as a memory flashback. The gentleman next to us also agreed he was glad it was over.

1659,punkevr,This movie is such a conundrum.,5,6 March 2018,"The reason I say that is, after really thinking about the movie afterwards, I really don't think there is any one thing that could have done better. I truly believe that in all the segments, they made the right choices on how to film the scenes. The major problem is though, thats what the movie really feels like, A collection of Scenes. And no matter how perfect they are, just a string of scenes does not a great movie make. Then there is the story. I would say the movie is brutally honest to the topics it's trying to portray. And that point is all about lacking emotion. And thus, the entire movie, lacks emotion and feelings to it. Every time there is a glimmer of hope, you think he may have a ""breakthrough"" of feeling, they pulled it away. Making you just feel dis-heartened. Other Major issue is it's linearity; There is nothing unexpected, and no deviation to sub stories or sub plots to the movie. Its just dead ahead one scene to the next, following the single and only thread. Really kills any drama steals the life out of you, if you are hoping for just one thing unexpected to happen. Well, it doesn't. There is a reason no one likes Linear games, where there are no options, and movies are the same way. 
Even the ending is a giant let down I think. Throughout the movie, your rooting for the robots to overcome themselves, and evolve. And it never happens. Its just one giant disappointment.
So for visuals sake, and masterful work on the look of the scenes, I would say pretty flawless. The emotions the movie make you feel>? Are as empty as the emotions of the replicates. Either the Perfect job of making the audience feel heartless and emotionless, or a failure of a movie. Personally, i want to love a movie, not have something that makes me feel emotionally drained completely. Thanks.",Blade Runner 2049

1669,random301,Do Blade Runners Dream of Harrison Ford?,6,12 March 2018,"This is a good movie. It's not the best one, is not very good one. But is good enough that not feel regret for watching time. My judgment is based on two reasons: the meaning of the story, and form of storytelling.In case of discussing the message of 'Blade Runner 2049', it is necessary to divide the movie into 2 parts. The first one during 80 minutes from the beginning. This part tells us about a personal quest of the protagonist. K's dilemma is a mirror reflection of the central matter of original 'Blade Runner'. Both movies are rooted in Philip Dick's novel. Inevitably they share the one and same theme. Ridley Scott in 1982 concentrated on the conflict between rationality and sensuality in self-identity of as a person and a community alike. The movie of 2017 has focused on the problem of trust as to objective cognition on the one side, and to subjective beliefs and faith on the other. It's a great approach. At first, Denis Villeneuve and crew created unique work while retaining the key principles of 'Do Androids Dream...' and 'Blade Runner'. Secondly, the recourse to not used previously aspects of Dick's story makes the screenplay of 2017 actual front of challenges of contemporary technological and social progress. In result, we have the illusion that this movie looks like a sequel and screen adaptation in one and the same time.The stop here or keeping the same narrative way could be made 'Blade Runner 2049' one of ingenious pictures. But it couldn't. Mostly because of the last part. After appearances of Deckard, the movie transforms into fan-service product. Each attempt to acquit Ford's staying on the screen or using most popular characters of the original movie destroy meaning achievements of the seen part of 2017 movie. After self-destruction, the 'Blade Runner 2049' start to make clear all plot collisions of the 1982 movie and the novel.But it's not a sort of intelligent and more nuanced explanation of ambiguity and uncertainty inherent to primary sources. It's simple and a definite answer that doesn't permit viewers to see the central theme from multiple perspectives again. If step back from thinking about needs for ontological reflection on human nature, the plot in last part is becoming boring and predictable. It's just a story full of unnecessary repetition and cliche, that could be telling in any sci-fi movie with any others characters.In a storytelling aspect, I see the same duality. Actors are magnificent acting by the way they speak, they look, they gesture. Gosling, Wright, Bautista, de Armas, Hoeks, Leto, and others clearly demonstrate floating complicated emotions, internal conflicts, and heaviness of moral choices without help of its oral naming or explanation. It makes the film's telling very poetical. The tempo, rhythm, and structure of screen narrative allow recognizing the work of Denis Villeneuve.But in total looks that movie hasn't its own spirit. It is only proof Denis Villeneuve able to repeats the film of Ridley Scott. It looks like a story was told by one person was retold by another one later. With the same expression, same accents but by a different voice. During the watching movie can see the visual and sound identity is evolving into the parody. 'Blade Runner' of Ridley Scott had the influence on future cyberpunk movies. I sure that Denis Villeneuve's works will have the influence on the future sci-fi movies too. All of them except 'Blade Runner 2049'. Because of 'Blade Runner 2049' already was totally influenced by the aesthetic of Ridley Scott and by the manner of Denis Villeneuve. It's pure bi-product of both directors.So, in conclusion, I think 'Blade Runner 2049' is better than most part of 'Anything-what-you-want 2' films. It was very close to the success of Cameron's 'Terminator 2'. But didn't able to reach the heights of self-sufficient sequels. In the same time, 'Blade Runner 2049' worth seeing at least for understanding how much we lost. And how great this film could be in other circumstances",Blade Runner 2049
1670,loumizhu,balancing between amateur and acceptable,3,13 October 2017,"This is frustrating seeing audience lowered its expectations so much because of many sequels trying hard 'not to ruin' the original. This can only increase chances of ruining it.While this sequel did not ruin it, it just blade runner another watchable movie. Over-explaining is what you'll get watching the movie. The main character, his reactions, the plot, the philosophy behind the bad guy. Everything is over explained. You expect the characters to be more developed but they're cut down and become source of frustration. The bad guy could've been a faceless CEO it would've been better than raising expectations and failing flat (like his female agent).Spoiler:The blade runner boss is completely off. Idiot enough to get killed while she seen it coming or believe his agent saying: it's done. No need for more proof.The female chief of the revolutionaries (and the whole revolution plan is unnecessary) it's just there to make things like leveling up to the whole nation of replicants (followingthe perfect recipe for screen writing)The design: beautiful exteriors, empty interiors. Mixing clean and minimal design with dirty and cluttered look of the original blade runner. Pointless ! it breaks the movie and don't enhance the story since it has no logic. If they wanted to make the bad guy's company look minimalist , why make it all stone wall with empty furniture ?The good scenes are overlooked (like the final one) and some scene are completely unnecessary.Slow pace of the movie is way behind the original who wasn't that slowDirectors should experiment in their shorts not in big budget movies wasting the talent of their team",Blade Runner 2049

The visual style was early 21st century X box and editing consisted of long hold shots which revealed nothing of the character's motivations. The dialogue was execrable at times and the sound design and music too loud and badly over played. The plot was weak and the sets and overall tone of the work left a lot to be desired. Even the CGI was of a lower standard than I expected. My overall impression was that the director did a rush job and was hamstrung by the studio. Now we get to the worst things in the film. The acting. Ryan Gosling was badly miss-cast and could not transcend the limitations of the script. Jared Leto is not an actor and this again was shown in his exaggerated tics and pompous delivery. The other actors tried hard but had no inner motivation or arc. The story. Incomprehensible at times. Why did Wallace kill the replicant he had just complained of not having enough of. Why did Angel become this Terminator like monster. Why when they had captured Deckard and incapacitated K did they not kill him? Only so they could have a stupid fight scene a the end? What was all that about slavery? Why was Harrison Ford in the movie at all except as fan service? Why would a replicant fall in love with a hologram?

1673,cestey-998-355712,Brilliant Sci fi film is both gorgeous and relevant,10,11 October 2017,"Where Ridley Scott fell short in Prometheus and frankly became dull in Alien Covenant he comes back big with the help of director, Denis Villeneuve. Deep and dark, complex and beautiful, it does go a bit long but pays off with an intensely emotional film, not a mega-hit tent pole; although they are clearly leaving room for the franchise to grow. ) My take away is that after 30 years, this pure sequel and follow up to the original story really delivers while staying true to the original film. Also, it takes the Phillip K. Dick source novel seriously even if taking liberties with characters. Thematically it is pure PKD and that's a good thing. We could talk about the gnostic overtones of this film too, which was an obsession of Dick's. Blade Runner 2049 wraps this all up in one gorgeous package that expands upon the original and delivers a generous portion of sci-fi noir with a point or two to make as well. Will you like it? If you love popcorn thrillers this isn't one of those.

1675,neonate870-11-41888,"Blade Runner 2049, a sequel equal to the original and an instant classic.",10,3 February 2019,"Very few films actually qualify as genuine Science Fiction these days and in history. Blade Runner 2049 was a very welcome sequel and a film the was truly deserving of its merits. Directed by Denis Villeneuve ( Prisoners, Arrival, Sicario), produced by the original director Ridley Scott, and written Blade Runner writer Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, this film expands upon the original film and dives deeper in to the universe so brilliantly created in 1982. As a huge fan of the first, I had big expectations for this film. I had waited a long time for this film. I remember being student who had scene the original film in many college film and art classes, it was template of every one of my professors. I was blown away by the FINAL CUT of the original Blade Runner released in 2007, and I have always based my expectations on that final version.When i found out that the film was in the hands of Denis Villeneuve, and Scott was producing, my fears and anxiety were relaxed. I went to the first screening in my town on opening night. Something I would NOT do for a Star Wars film, which is not Science Fiction, but Space Opera Fantasy. This film dives deep into many of the philosophical aspects and thoughts brought on by the original brilliant story writer Phillip K Dick. Hampton Fancher and Michael Green gave the film its own ground to stand on. Thus making the first film not as necessary to see, but it is still recommended. The story is dark, deep, suspenseful, mysterious, moving, foretelling, and just draws you in and does not let go. You are never bored. Also never before had I been so invested in characters and a story in a film.This music was composed by the brilliant composer Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. The soundtrack is truly its own and was its own character of the film. Probably the best I had heard in a long time. It takes cues from the original and beautiful track created by Vangelis in the first film. However it created its own ground to stand on. It has nostalgia for fans, but its also unique. Combined with brilliant sound design and editing, it was top notch. I saw it in IMAX and had never been blown away by a film's sound as much as this one's. I highly recommend buying it on CD.In terms of design, visual effects, costume design, and production design, they give us back and dive deeper into a very realistic world. It was absolutely superior to many other similar films of this type. I was very glad to hear when it won for best visual effects at the Oscars. It BEAT OUT STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI! All these tools were combined with the brilliant and very handsome photography and cinematography of Roger Deakins who finally won an academy award/Oscar for Best Cinematography. Its look was like no other, and will be studied for a long time.The film's setting takes place 30 years after the first film in Los Angeles, California, the same location of the first film. Society is in decay. Its mirroring and foretelling of a California (and other portions of the world) that is now in decline/decay under the leftist Progressives and Democrats today. The ecosystems have collapsed and earth is now barely habitable. Populations huddle/survive in mega cities, and some smaller disposal site settlements scattered across the land. Those that can afford to live and settle off world.The mega corporation Tyrell Corp has gone bankrupt/defunct and taken over by The Wallace Corp. The company is a mega one as Tyrell was, but holds patents on space colonization, many consumer goods, military technologies, and others. But Due to the Nexus 6 Replicant uprisings and revolts of the previous film's time, Replicant manufacturing was banned. Thus Tyrell went defunct. But Wallace corp resurrected Replicant production once more.The new Nexus 9 models in the film are the current model, are programmed to obey, and have open ended lifespans. They have more realistic human traits thanks to memory implants. In this time, the new Replicant Nexus 9 models have many open/active roles next to humans in the economy/society. But as with other Replicant models, they are still treated with ill will and prejudice by humans. They are also used by the LAPD as Blade Runners. Just as Harrison Fords character Rick Deckard did, they hunt down and ""retire"" rogue Replicants.The cast of this film was absolutely brilliant. The acting was superb. I was very angry the Oscar's snubbed this film for its acting credit. First off is Ryan Gosling who stars as Nexus 9 LAPD Replicant Blade Runner Officer K. He plays excellent into his role. He presents a tough lone wolf Deckard like style detective, but is also a very vulnerable, emotionally deep, and sometimes a conflicted character. When the circumstances in the film present him with a life changing dilemma, his character adapts very much like most humans would. And in some cases, much better than most humans.Harrison Ford returns as the former Blade Runner Rick Deckard, now in hiding after he fled with Nexus 7 experimental Replicant Rachael. He is still none the less very important to the story. His performance was top notch and very deep. Probably the most emotional and genuine performance Ford has done in years.Next is Robin Wright as LAPD Police Lt Joshi. She plays her character very well. She is tough looking, yet still beautiful/sexy. However she is detailed, thorough, a no holds barred, and no excuses officer. She also does have a deep emotional side, and holds a sort of sympathy for Replicants serving under her. Especially for officer K who works for her on the Blade Runner cases she has to assign.The film also has great supporting cast members. The first I want to mention the newcomer, very beautiful, and talented Cuban actress Ana De Armas. She plays K's ultra sophisticated hologram/live in girlfriend Joi. Like K she is artificial but is very realistic. She presents a very human relationship with Ryan Gosling's character. Her performance was awesome and her chemistry with Gosling was solid. She is funny, somewhat child like in curiosity, very sympathetic, supportive, and very wife like in essence. I couldn't have seen any other actresses in this role. She is someone I would put on lists for future Oscar caliber films.Another is dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks. She plays the film's antagonist Luv. A Nexus 9 Replicant and an assistant/representative of the Wallace Corporation. But she is also trained and programmed as combat model/assassin. Her character is beautiful, tough, hollow, and volatile. But she is also VERY ruthless and determined. She gives off a Roy Batty, Zora, and Leon vibe. Their traits are all found in her. Like Zora, her character is beauty and the beast rolled into one. She obeys orders. She is always ready for a fight. And she has no hesitation to kill like Leon, Zora or Roy. She embodied her character very well and i hope she will be remembered for it.Next is the enormously talented Jared Leto. He plays Niander Wallace, the owner and entrepreneur of the Wallace Corporation. Although a blind man in the film, he can see items via implants. He is a very driven, sometimes cold, intelligent, and also a very detailed character. He may look weak, but his ego/intelligence is almost god like in complexion. Jared went to extensive lengths to prepare for this role by meeting with blind actors, and pulls off the most convincing performance of a blind person I have not seen in years.I will also bring up the new /really up and coming actress Mackenzie Davis. She plays Mariette. A Nexus 9 pleasure model, and member of the under ground Replicant Freedom Movement. Although her character has a small amount of screen time her role is no less important as well. She is crafty, smart, and savvy. She looks like she could be the little sister of Pris, the Replicant Nexus 6 pleasure model of the first film. Apparently stupid feminists didn't pay very close attention as to who she really was in the film, and were very wrong for condemning her role/character.Lastly I will bring up Dave Bautista's character Sapper Morton. Formerly a Nexus 8 Combat Medic, he is now a Replicant in hiding as a Wallace Corp protein farmer. His role is small but influential and a kick off to all the events of the film's story. Unlike his role in Guardians Of The Galaxy, his character is tough, big, and intimidating, but also has a soft, wise, and deeply emotional touch to him. And he also the look of a man hardened/humbled by being a soldier in war. He wants to live in peace and to be left alone. His face in the film embodies the look of soldiers I have seen hardened or brutalized by war. I was surprised he was cast, and sort of figured he'd cast as a Replicant. I was amazed by his performance.All in all I was very pleased and loved this film. It deserved to have more earnings, but this is not the Star Wars garbage type of film for money making. Although yes in terms of money it was a little disappointing, but it was NO BOX OFFICE or CRITICAL BOMB! You want to see the bomb of 2017? Look no further than Walt Disney's insulting film A Wrinkle in Time which was a critical, financial and cinematic DISASTER for that studio. It has made its earnings back via Blu Ray sales and has now circulated well throughout the world as post academy news and reviews have spread. I could watch this film again and again, like the first one (and the first two ALIEN films) and never get bored.My only disappointment was the film only won two academy awards. It was nominated for 5, but it deserved more. Much more! But it was snubbed due to Hollywood's and the Academy Awards pathetic/prejudiced leftist progressive political attitude, and stereotyping. It was truly one of the best films of all time, and it was the best of 2017. Also and most importantly, it was Denis Villeneuve's best film to date. He just keeps getting better as he makes more films.",Blade Runner 2049
1676,otis-16,I'm A Convert,8,27 March 2020,"I've tried to get into this film three times and finally succeeded. It was well worth the effort. Gosling plays against his natural charisma to be a convincing replicant, and it's difficult to follow him as a protagonist at first. Initially his performance seemed rather constipated to me but it pays off and you should take the whole ride before cursing this thing. Harrison Ford delivers the goods as usual and Ana de Armas is a lovely surprise. My initial problems: the pace, which is too slow for the material, Gosling's character, but that is a function of the script and it kicks in about 80 minutes into the film; and Jared Leto, a very good actor who unfortunately seems to have based his character on Ernst Stavro Blofeld - It's not fatal but it is disappointing. Give this one a good look and you won't be disappointed.",Blade Runner 2049
1677,DominikCrnjak,One of the best 2017 movies!,10,23 December 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is sequel to legendary Blade Runner (1982), but can stand as a compleitely standalone movie.
You can watch this movie even if you didn't see the first one, and you could still understand everything what's happening.
Pros:-It's visually stunning and if you are into cinematography you will be really pleased-Acting is great. Mostly Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford.-Soundtrack by Hans ZimmerCons: -Really slow paced-Main story lacks depth -Runtime (almost 3 hours)
 This isn't some action packed blockbuster (trailer could fool you), rather a thought provoking movie that makes you think after you see it.

1678,Jaketrevaskis,"Over-hyped, far from Villeneuve's best",7,4 October 2017,"I've been a big Blade Runner fan after the fifth time of watching the Directors Cut. It's not a film that you get first time round but it does leave you with that feeling of greatness that few films can do and only in my fifth viewing did it resonate.I'm also a big Denis Villeneuve fan. Personally I hold Sicario and Enemy to be his two best films but others such as Prisoners and Arrival are also very good.So I was disappointed when the credits rolled on Blade Runner 2049. It's a long slog, that is in need of more action, with certain scenes that feel a bit tacked on for very little reason. There's too much of a push to innovate certain cinematographic ideas that get in the way, which result in this being a bit of style over substance. On the whole, it's just a bit of an empty film.It's starts well enough but never really picks up to speed. The initial concept of Replicants reproducing is interesting however it fails to expand upon that idea or offer any real insight, or blow our minds. Instead it falls back on some hammy ideas that we've all heard before (, Pinochio, Slaves fighting back). I was hoping that this film would break through some of those interesting concepts and give us some real questions about existence, what it is to be human and what it is to create life. This is nothing we have seen before.The characters are interesting but also don't really evolve themselves except for Deckard. Most of them do what they are supposed and I didn't really feel any motivation that I could invest or relate to. I was really interested to see more of the character Luv, I came into it thinking she was this complicated replicant that serves Jared Letos character but also has somewhat of a superior complex herself. Possibly even one to challenge her maker. However this never happens, she simply goes from A to B before a small fight with Gosling before she is killed off in a very forgettable way. I wanted to get in the mind of this unique character, I only saw the outside.This is somewhat the pattern throughout this film, it had potential and it certainly looked the goods however it merely stands looking up at the highs it could've been rather than getting there itself. Hoping this isn't the downturn for Villeneuve as he is still one of the rare film makers Directing anything worth watching but I'm worried he might not do well when producers and others get in the way.",Blade Runner 2049
1679,sethus-180-840610,A visual treat,8,8 October 2017,"While it's a tad bit too long, this sequel is a modern cinematic tour de force. The special effects are visually stunning and the ""reverberating"" background score, although reminiscent of other popular science fiction movies, blends very well with the cinematic experience. All cast members have done an exceptional job. Ryan Gosling's performance was especially laudable, as he has literally carried the story through his glowing presence in almost every frame of the movie. The subtlety in emoting was very nicely laid out by the director and superbly handled by the actors. Overall, the movie very subtly, yet beautifully underscores the essence of ""being human"" and delivers a complete package.",Blade Runner 2049

1682,rc-acc_mvp,Best movie I have ever seen?,10,17 November 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 in a visually stimulating, thought-provoking masterpiece in movie making. Of the many questions it asks of its viewers, the one that kept repeating in my mind as I watched was, ""Is this the best movie I have ever seen?"" It is ""The Dark Knight"" good.As much as I would love to delve deep into the plot with you, it would be a crime to spoil any of ""2049"" for you. Let's just say that questions will get answered, questions will get asked, and things will get wrapped up at the end....tho more movies could follow. ;)Director Denis Villeneuve, along with Writers Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, and Executive Producer Ridley Scott, have constructed a world that presents Los Angeles as a dark, eternally raining, visually breath-taking fantasy land. In fact, the visuals are so beautiful you could watch all 164 minutes with the dialogue turned off. In fact, I hope the blu ray will feature a ""Music Only"" track option.As for their story........The two leads, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, have never been better. I have to confess that I have never been a fan of Gosling's as the first movie I ever saw him in was ""The Notebook"", and have - unfairly or not - held this against him for years. ; ) However, after his performance in ""2049"" and ""The Nice Guys"", he better be careful cos I'm starting to develop a strong man-crush on him. His muted performance as Blade Runner Officer K (think Philip K.) should gain him - at least - an Oscar nomination.I believe an Oscar win for Harrison Ford as Best Supporting Actor is all but locked up. His reprisal of the role of Rick Deckard: Blade Runner/Human/Replicant (?) is one of ""the last true larger-than-life Hollywood star's"" finest performances. Ever. Whether Deckard is a human/replicant/something else doesn't matter here - the humanity and emotion Ford brings to his multi-layered performance is one for the ages.Concerning the rest of the cast, Ana de Armas is terrific as K's virtual, live-in girlfriend, Joi (I always wondered what Siri looked like - she's pretty cute). She, as a hologram, ALSO asks the question of what is like to be a sentient being, and credit to de Armas for a performance that leads us to take this question seriously....so does Joi's and K's love scene; yes, you read that right. She also provides the answer to this: Do we spend too much time in our (quite inferior by comparison) virtual worlds today and miss out/ignore what is happening all around us? Uh, yes.Jared Leto is at his creepy best as Niander Wallace, the new maker of ""more human than human"" replicants. Along with his partner-in-crime Luv, (Sylvia Hoeks) they....well, I won't spoil anything for you, but the dude has a greater ""god complex"" than Tyrell ever imagined, and, well....you know....Finally, the score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer is a beautiful homage to Vangelis; and, Elvis and Frank also show up, proving once again that even in 2049, their music is timeless.So, where did Deckard and Rachael go at the end of Blade Runner? What does it mean to be human? Maybe ""sentinent"" is a better word. What IF replicants can do something (hint, hint) ONLY humans are supposed to be able to do? These questions are asked right from the beginning....as K is a replicant - or so he's been told. He, um, wants to be *more* than this....which leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard. As with Luke Skywalker these days, Deckard has vanished, but since he perhaps has the answers to all of K's questions, one in particular - K sets out looking for him....but at this point, K also has a lot of people after *him* so....when he meets up with Deckard - and Elvis and Frank and Marilyn ;) - it all hits the virtual fan.164 minutes never went by so fast. You won't get bored. Denis Villeneuve, along with Cinematographer Roger Deakins, should both get Oscar nods for their work on this film. I mean, talk about layering. On ONE hand, this is such a beautifully created world, one could - as I said - watch this with the dialogue turned OFF. OR....it a terrific Neo-Neo-Noir detective story. THIRD....it is all of the above with questions asked by all of the Philosophers throughout all the ages. It is amazing how just how much story and Easter Eggs can be packed into *only* 164 minutes. There are so many homages and nod/winks to (fans of) the first film: a pot boiling over on a stove, a massive Atari advertisement, (Philip) K driving a spinner made by Peugeot........but you get my point. So, go see this SEQUEL - NOT a REMAKE - to ""Blade Runner"". And, I cannot wait for the Blu Ray: just hope it comes out sooner rather than later.Thanks for reading.",Blade Runner 2049

1687,noms2000,An Insult to the Original,2,12 October 2017,"Although the original Blade Runner didn't do well at the Box Office, and became a cult classic later on, it is still remains a classic today. It is extremely watchable, a decent story line, and a chilling but totally realistic vision of the future. This sequel is completely the opposite. At a running time of 2hr 44mins, this movie is so slow to start off with, with Deckard not even appearing until after an hour. The story line is an insult to the original, with a long winded drawn out very basic story stretched out even further with a ridiculous sub-plot about a virtual girlfriend. All the virtual girlfriend scenes should have been cut, it would have made for much better viewing. Another annoying thing is that the original Blade Runner had no profanity in the movie, so why fill this one with such words? It's obvious this was a corporate money making venture with little respect for the original. For me, the original Blade Runner is best as a 'stand-alone'. My verdict: Avoid.",Blade Runner 2049

I think was a good movie but as good as Blade Runner? Oh hell no! I'm not a big Gosselin fan but he was good in it and Harrison Ford gave one of his best performances he has had in some time. Being scifi there of course had to have a gorgeous female character, Ana de Armas more that made up for any deficiencies in any other casting weaknesses. She was absolutely captivating as was Sean Young in the original. I believe it could have been much better with some editing that could have shortened the all too long film. Much of the film was visually stunning and the sound track was good. The sound track seemed as if it was more directed to older people like me (I'm 62) Would I spend the money again to see it?

1692,vadimsound,"A soulless, bland copy of the masterpiece that was the original",3,16 October 2017,"Blade Runner is one of my favorite films of all time for a number of reasons: 1) Amazing groundbreaking trailblazing visuals that spawned an entire genre (aka ""cyberpunk""). 2) Superb music by Vangelis that is integral to the film. 3) Great characters and amazing acting. 4) Underlying philosophical themes of corporate oppression (Blade Runner is just a small cog in a huge machine just carrying on with his life doing the job because otherwise he's reduced to nothing), existentialism (what it means to be human) coupled with Biblical references presented in a subtle way. 5) Amazing practical special effects that make the world around the characters feel lived-in. 6) Meticulous attention to detail, lighting in particular. While ""2049"" is nothing more than a mere attempt at recreating something in the style of the original by a studio committee ticking off the items in the checklist. The result is abysmal because it does not introduce something new in terms of visual design, interesting characters, music or story. On the contrary it tries so hard to tie itself to the original it's sickening. Call it fan-service or pandering, either way it leads to the movie being a highly derivative product that exists solely because of the original.1) Plot lines that go against the premise of the original (Nexus 6 being able to reproduce, new Nexus 8 being easily distinguishable from humans) are stupid. 2) Acting is horrendous. Ana ""Pouty lips"" De Armas couldn't hold a candle to Sean Young not to mention the pretentious for pretentiousness sake Jared Leto. Ford is here for a paycheck and Gosling is deliberately one-note. 3) The music is a lame attempt at copying Vangelis' beautiful score.4) Too varying visuals leave you with this feeling of an inconsistent world that doesn't follow the idea of polluted lifeless post-industrial world where the sun doesn't shine, it's constantly raining and the only light outside the building is that of the advertising that seems more real than anything else. 5) Running time. The original was purposefully slow while the overblown running time of the sequel comes off as director loving certain sets and trying to savor them far longer than he should've. 6) A myriad of logical mistakes and plot holes (kids with a 100% matching DNA are of different gender).7) The opening shot with the closeup of an eye is almost beat for beat with the original. 8) The zooming sequence is hammered home by the sheer repetition. 9) The characters are bland, unoriginal and politically correct female copies of the originals, namely Madam and Luv. 10) The opening sequence is the unused part of the Fancher's script (watch Dangerous Days documentary). Overall it seems that producers/writers have an erroneous idea of made the original film great. As if stuffing Biblical references into Neon- lit set pieces, inhabited by some pale copies of original characters and extending the awkward silences would amount to a great movie. To sum up ""Blade Runner 2049"" does not reinvent the wheel, does not offer anything one-of-a-kind or even slightly memorable. There is no reason (other than cash flow for the studio execs) for it to exist. Save the cash and rewatch the original that actually challenges your intelligence and leaves you with a lot to think about.",Blade Runner 2049

It sure felt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really made this!The first Blade Runner worked the pace of the film brilliantly up to the powerful ending. The story was a rather simple sci-fi noir detective story with a twist. It made some huge comments on humanity and what kind of future we want. It worked on so many levels. It could be viewed as a simple sci-fi detective story or as a great spiritual journey that asked all the big questions. ""And what can your maker do for you?"".The first Blade Runner had so many great lines but with 2049 I cannot remember a single quotable line. 2049 completely lacks all which made the original the best sci-fi movie ever.

And for God's sake, what's the point of the ending?? Is this all from the sequel of a masterpiece: to die for the good purpose? Really? It's so weak that it hurts. The only positive thing about the movie that it tries very hard to respect the first one, that's why I gave two stars.

Even so, the sound is so loud and the dialogue mumbled that the only character I could understand was Robin Wright. I'm not sure this is a spoiler, but it's impossible to tell whether there are only a handful of people or are they all robots (replicants)? If there are people, have they been moved to another planet? If so, why are any still here? If the new replicants are supposed to be so much more civil than the old ones, how do they get away with murder? For some unintelligible reason Tyrell (who is made up to look blind -- what's that all about???) kills a woman. Well, maybe he does say why, but he mumbles so much I couldn't say why he killed her. For some undeveloped and unexplained reason what the mystery is will ""kill society"", so it has to be completely obliterated.This is slightly better than ""Arrival"", though I did stay until the end of that bore.

Yeah yeah, questions of AI and debating what is and isn't life can be entertained, and were successfully in the first Blade Runner, but not this one. I just didn't find it engaging enough to care either way.And the fact that Sean Young's character could only be worked into it by making Sean appear young via CGI was just offensive. Why can only male actors, such as Ford, be allowed to age, but female actors like Young can only appear as young? An example of modern misogyny, in my opinion.

1700,Big_Jim_Rennie,A surprisingly excellent sequel -- I'm honestly shocked at how good this film is,8,29 April 2019,"Sadly, I did not see this film when it came out in theaters back in 2017. I rarely see films in theaters anymore, since half of them are garbage Marvel films or other comic books films that all essentially have the same plot and similar mind-numbingly dull action scenes. I did make the mistake of seeing Star Wars Force Awakens when it came out in theaters and was sorely disappointed. The Star Wars franchise is entirely dead to me. The prequels were like getting mugged and badly beaten, but Force Awakens was the coup de grace, a shotgun blast to the head!What I'm trying to say is that my expectations for science fiction, or really just films in general, has gone dramatically downhill. There has been a lack of good films in the past decade, which explains why my theater attendance is now a rare thing. I stick to watching films on amazon prime or netflix, and occassionaly buy a blu-ray.Last week, while ordering a book through amazon, I began browsing various movie titles and eventually came across Blade Runner 2049. I easily spent half an hour reading through reviews for the film, mostly positive, but with a significant negative minority as well.I made a gut purchase and bought the blu-ray for $13.00. Thirteen dollars is about the cost of a meal at a low price chain restaurant. If I didn't like the film, then it wouldn't be much of a loss.Finally last night I found the time to sit down and watch Blade Runner 2049. I was in for a pleasant surprise! The overall atmosphere and vibe of the film matched up perfectly with the original Blade Runner. The universe in 2049 still felt like the same universe that the original Blade Runner inhabited. The dystopian Los Angeles was as vibrant and futuristically abysmal as in the original film.The main thing that resonated with me was how this film manages to compliment the original Blade Runner so well. These two films are like long-departed twins, different, but identical somehow. That is an incredible feat considering 2049 was released 35 years after Blade Runner!The story in 2049 artfully connects us to the events from the previous film and expands upon it to a satisfying climax. The acting in the film was mostly excellent but I will admit that Harrison Ford's performance was a bit underwhelming and lackluster. The guy is really looking haggard and I felt like he was almost dragging himself though the second half of the film. But the acting from all the other characters was spot on.The visuals and cinematography were top-knotch, about as close to perfection as can be, and the same can be said for the gloomy & booming soundtrack. Maybe one or two uplifting musical pieces could have added more variety to the soundtrack, it almost felt too gloomy.The action scenes in 2049 were done very well and were definitely pleasing to the eye. The plot throughout the film remained consistent to the prior Blade Runner film, it doesn't contradict the original in anyways, thank god. The conclusion to the film, I won't give it away, was very satisfying. A nice humanistic touch at the very end.Overall I was delightfully satisfied with this film because it compliments the original almost perfectly. It was executed extremely well and flows along perfectly with the plot set by the original film. I'm now a little disappointed with myself that I didn't get to see this in the theater.This is definitely worth seeing and is a worthy sequel to Blade Runner.",Blade Runner 2049

After the film, the story and questions it ask sticks with you like glue. I haven't loved a movie this much in a very long time.

That being said, I have to tip my hat to Denis Villeneuve for having the courage to make a sequel and wondered if that could be done well. But, I decided to give it a try with reservations. So I my gathered popcorn, Rasinettes and my cynical mindset, reclined in the new Lazy Boy chairs the movies have installed and waited to pick it apart. I did not have time to form any critical opinion. The movie is so visually stunning you are blown back in your chair and watch the visuals with some detriment to listening to the dialogue. To that point I think I missed a lot of plot points because of the fantastic Oscar quality Cinematography. I believe to enjoy this movie you might want to rent and view the original first. I only began to ""get it"" some hours after I left the theater and had time to think about it. Having done that, I highly recommend it.",Blade Runner 2049

Blade Runner 2049 is no exception while using CGI for a lot of landscapes, the visuals look just as amazing as the first. The story of this film is engaging and keeps you in the story for the 160-minute runtime. I saw a few people around the internet complaining about the runtime, and why it is not doing well at the box office. I completely disagree, because the film Interstellar, for example, made $650 million with a slightly longer runtime. I believe the box office performance has to deal with the recent bad sequels that have come out of Hollywood the past few years. Terminator Genisys, Ghostbusters (2016), Independence Day: Resurgence, and Red Dawn have done poorly, which gave any good sequel or reboot a bad chance of making it at the box office.

The film retains the atmosphere of its predecessor, partly due to the magnificent score of Hans Zimmer, partly due to the excellent visuals and overall theme of hope. Jared Leto was mesmerizing as the villain(?) Niander Wallace, who is trying to create replicants who are happily subservient it's a shame he didn't get more screen time. Ryan Gosling proves he is a capable actor outside of rom-coms by carrying the film as K, and Harrison Ford, while old, still retains his old acting charm.+Jared Leto +The atmosphere +Excellent CGI, especially recreating Sean Young +Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford's scenes-Could have been half an hour shorter -Spends too much time with K's holographic girlfriend -A few plot holes when you take time to think about itOverall, Blade Runner 2049 is an excellent sci fi film, one of the best of the year",Blade Runner 2049
1717,Jake24-007,Blade Runner 2049 - A monumental feat of genius sci-fi filmmaking,10,8 October 2017,"Let me start by saying that I am fairly new to the Blade Runner universe. Prior to seeing 2049, I had only had the pleasure of seeing the original twice (both times being The Final Cut), and both viewings within the month leading up to the new installment, helmed by French-Canadian Denis Villeneuve, a man who has solidified himself as quite possibly my favorite working director at the moment. So, having been a massive (albeit brand new) Blade Runner fan, does this one live up to the hype? In short, abso-frickin-lutely.I need to see it again now, not because of how much I enjoyed it, but because 2049 requires a great deal of thinking. The plot, the story developments aren't conveyed via words, but rather mainly through visuals. I won't deny that there were several segments throughout the film where I felt about as intelligent as a can-opener, because as an audience member you're forced to sit back and think about what has happened and why. There were moments where I actually had to ask myself if I was an idiot for not understanding why something was happening upon initial viewing, or is this a film that asks you to think instead of explicitly displaying everything you need to know at the tip of your fingers? After some theorizing once the movie ended I realized that it was definitely the latter. 2049 is one of very few sci-fi films that actually forces you to think, not because of plot convolution or narrative inconsistencies, but because of its complex nature.Everything is on point here. The direction is superb, as is the writing. The cinematography is genuinely among the best I've seen from a mainstream film (as is Gassner's heavenly production design). And every actor brings out some of their best performances (with Ford deserving special praise, he truly is a powerhouse here). Blade Runner 2049 represents a monumental achievement in modern-day filming that meets and supersedes the expectations set by Blade Runner (1982), thanks to the undeniable efforts of everyone involved.",Blade Runner 2049
1718,gwarface,There is finally an unwitting explanation for why I chose my username.,10,25 November 2017,"I've haven't read other users' reviews, I may be repeating things others have already mentioned. There are spoilers throughout I think. I loved the original Blade Runner. But, I feel for this film the way people felt about the original Star Wars, even if I don't articulate that sentiment. It CAN BE a heady film. But it's not difficult.I should say I saw ""2049"" 13 times in theaters. 13 times. I am a slow learner. The double feature in RPX, IMAX 5x (2x in a row), 3D, Standard. I did fall asleep at two viewings. I also didn't really like it 2x. I might go see ""2049"" once more before they pull it from nearby theaters, else i'll be traveling 30-40 miles to see it. Really just unbelievable amounts of detail to sift through. The first time I watched it, I thought there was a pretense, a magic trick - the director trying to pull the wool over my eyes in light of non-existent story line. I did not ""get it"" until the third time, and by that point I saw it for the epic scope of what the story was trying to accomplish. And I saw something new on film every single time since.So we got some film about science, and the future, robot looking humans, and humans being stupid humans. And there's some guy looking for some kid, because it's important, and other people focused on world dominance, and freedom and stuff. There are cities, and poop cities, and ""Liquid Karma"" poop rivers, and deserts, and explosions(!), and rust, and lots of silence, and some cool looking technology. And it's all very organic.That's the movie in a nutshell. That being said, I loved the pace of the film - deliberate, methodical, and thoughtful - as such is the journey from the viewpoint of the main character, K. Beneath all that intense stoicism lay wrinkles, nonverbals and nuances of a condescending being on their way towards sentient enlightenment, like every other character - with intense strengths and weaknesses. Nobility, arrogance, cunning, wisdom, naivetyit's all here. It's mostly all subtlety and nuances we're looking at, and I think most characters get there window of opportunity to be important. I loved the metaphors, the symbolism, and all the small details: the Boi billboard, rainwater rolling off iron beams, whittled-off foreheads of wood carvings, where dirty despondent heads might rest contemplating existence after work, Harrison Ford being genuinely surprised by Ryan Gosling, and liberal snowflakes!To address the sexism and violence against women thing I've read on a couple sites (or poorly address) I don't really see it, I mean I do, but not really. What kind of female characters we got? A murdered ""New"" replicant. There's at least three females who are plotting sociopaths. Lt. Joshi, a strong-willed feminine character. Joi, an autonomous being, in a real relationship. She, along with K grow to transcend the limitations of somethingcommon about being human, and they truly become ""more human than human"" which many of us don't get to live. Oh then there's Dr Anna Stelline, I should mention her role. Eyes people.There is the ""nipple dilemma"". In terms of Joi's nipples, I'll admit they were distracting, but they weren't the point of the film. Most of all they weren't what K was paying attention to, which I thought that was the point. And furthermore, Vegas nipples. The statues of these women are ""objectified"" but at the same time not. I mean, we have lots of Egyptian Obelisks that represent ________, and we also have lots of broke-down statues of lustified women (immediately brought to mind the scene in ""Neverending Story"", and chess pieces too). We see honey bees. We make the correlation they make something sweet to suck on, like lust - it's not real nourishment, not love, not wisejust a woman's way to control ""powerful"" men that think with their little heads. It's Vegas! On that note, honey bees need to eat their own honey, so potentially, a women can give too much of her sex awayuhbut in the end ""powerful"" men and goldiggers can't withstand dirty bombs. That's the moral of the story. Semi-bad metaphor. Ah! Found another one, gatekeepers.Other things you might see:God, and the... DEVIL! Master plans and chess pieces. The Trinity. Fate, coincidence and free will. Power, manipulation, suggestion. Kindness, evil. False prophets. Eyes. Rebirth. Lust. Love. Maternity, paternity. The panopticon. What cities mean, who builds them, who owns them, and who profits from living in them. Neo-Egyptian architecture. Love, mercy, and hanging mean fish out of water.And last but not least, I have to say the character growth and continuity of both Gaff and Deckard was justly written.And I'm upset Wood Harris wasn't in the film more. And the writers in Antman should have rolled the stepfather and partner into one, and he shoulda played it.",Blade Runner 2049

So, my expectations were still lower than a lot other people who have seen part 1. Looking at the trailers and promos made me feel very positive about this movie. However, it turned out to be completely opposite. It was boring, stretched out, way too lengthy, and whatnot. I was yawning 30 minutes in the movie. It was quite complex at the same time! These days movies have just become all about the effects and animation. That's it! Oh, please please please understand that we want to see more than that.

1720,kuzu_sureyya-1,"A slow moving art film that has an engaging yet provocative concept, nonetheless an immersive experience with incredible atmosphere and ground-breaking visuals.",8,16 October 2017,"Only several criticisms that came to my mind in this futuristic mystery noir about a missing child, and the existential crisis that engulfs not only the officer investigating the case but the very nature of our very own existence. The story again revolves around several characters that were placed in a grand, epic environment, hence creating a small plot that implored more substance to other branches in the existing world. The unanswered question still clouded over as to why Tyrell Corporation intended to create near perfect replicants when they were only used as slave labour? The biggest concern probably is the existence of government/military supervision (and that's whether they will occur in future instalments/sequels remains to be seen) hasn't yet intervened after so many years? There is also no mention of pharmaceutical companies which may have also benefited in terms creating vaccines or genetically modified transplants which questions the very existence of A.I. and its purpose in a volatile environment in which humans incurred a famine, blackout, etc within the 30 year time period. Perhaps the film would have benefited by expanding the dystopian future, delving more into the co-existence/relationships between humans and the highly advanced versions of bio-engineered androids within each sector from education/technological advancements in health/rehabilitation to governing cities/countries. Why again is there only a single megalomaniacal industrialist seeking his own ambitions in order to fully utilise and strengthen the existing populace of replicants? A minor glitch is that there is no mention of contention from other corporations/factions that may seek supremacy or political gains. Most concerning, as mentioned before in the original film is why did Tyrell Corporation intended to create androids that were indistinguishable than the human counterparts? After all they were only intended to be used as slave labour/servants for elite corporations on earth, and on other planets presumably excavating various natural resources for exactly what purposes?Due to the long duration, the film may not have covered the many complex issues that will inevitably arise as technology progresses over the years and how it will affect the existence of humanity and future generations, I was still fascinated by the many other questions raised in the film surrounding our very own existence between humans and androids which will eventually over time lead to larger and more sinister plots/story lines in order to fully realise this long and perilous journey (A geisha taking a red pill to see how far the rabbit hole really goes in the real world, as seen in the original film). Regardless, a repeat viewing is still required to fully grasp the merits it's still one of those rare, visually spectacular, thought- provoking and profound experiences I've encountered on the big screen; highly recommend the IMAX version, preferably in 3D.",Blade Runner 2049

1726,maximbouts,"Visually stunning but lacks mystique, emotional depth & musicality",7,23 October 2017,"Being a hardcore Blade Runner and science fiction fanatic, I felt deeply compelled to write this review. I love Ridley Scott's original 1982 Sci-Fi classic. It is my all-time favorite movie. It had mystique and infused my imagination. It was a unique experience; hypnotic & surreal. The sequel, not so much! My initial reaction of BR 2049 was that it's a gorgeous film. I was mesmerized by the striking cinematography and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I will go as far saying that it's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The rich visuals are so glaring it's hard to take it all in and grasp what you are seeing. From the opening shot you know you're in Blade Runner world. The overall look is instantly relatable to the first film and it's an amazing continuation in that regard. Also, the acting was excellent. The entire cast did a great job. However, once I settled into the film I realized that it is mainly a self-indulgent visual feast containing a weak story that lacks clarity & wisdom. There are obvious cliché moments and in certain aspects the story is comical and naive. The movie delves into complex philosophical themes and asks important questions but seldom explores them. It's all over the place. You get the sense that the film is not sure what it wants to be? It's clearly style over substance. Lots of homage is paid to the original through awesome images but the plot is paper-thin with a few subplots & twists added to make it seem intelligent. But is it? Well, not really! I think the movie tries too hard to be smart but fails to engage due to its long running time & fuzzy story/script, which may end up confusing and distancing the viewer.BR 2049 has been most widely criticized for its length, and rightly so. It's overly long with some unnecessary scenes & dialogue whereas the first film was more subtle. BR1 was also slow-paced but in a different way. It had suspense and gradual progression to climax whereas BR2 is forced and even distracting at times. I love slow-paced films don't get me wrong! I can watch a film all day as long as it leads to a point and has tension. Certain films are deliberately made slow to establish a specific mood (e.g. Kubrick & Tarkovsky films). They draw you inside the film and make you feel like you're part of it. BR1 does this perfectly while the sequel is stretched out for the wrong reasons. It comes across as an excuse to showcase impressive visuals which is great if it moves the story along but not for the fun of it. BR1 had long takes and brief dialogue but it drove the story along smoothly and its characters behaved realistically. There was a seamless flow to it. It's humorous how BR2 tried to mimic this technique from BR1 yet failed because its characters talk & move super slowly unlike real life.Although it's a visually stunning film, I found it to be almost void of emotions and musicality. The characters were uninteresting and lacked emotional depth. In other words, I didn't care about them. I was not sure about any of the characters' motivations. In the first film, all the characters shined with charismatic personalities. They were unique in their own way and I truly cared about them. They embodied everything that makes us human. This was a vital element that made the original so special. BR2 on the other hand has sad and forgettable characters. It is a very sad film whereas the original had moments of happiness to mix up feelings and lighten the mood, which made it more realistic.The music in BR 2049 was the biggest let down for me. It just didn't make sense because there was no music. A strange mix of very loud noises with faint echoes of original Vangelis tones interlaced (I listened to the entire score to be sure!). The musical score by Vangelis in the first film was one of the key elements that made the original my favorite film of all-time. I love atmospheric films that are visually & musically driven to tell the story. The music creates different feelings that make you fantasize. It makes you feel the movie and think about it long after it's over. The music in BR1 was incredible. It set the tone of the film perfectly. There was a haunting eerie atmosphere that along with the images created a hypnotic feel. Vangelis mostly used an electronic sound but he also incorporated piano & saxophone for melancholic effect. Not so in BR2. They messed up enormously this time. I know it's not possible to recreate Vangelis but they could have at least tried to create similarly-styled music by using the original score as a foundation. Even better, they could have perhaps made a completely original soundtrack all together. Blade Runner is an atmospheric film that is about feel and therefore must have a perfect music to visual ratio. Sure, they brought back one Vangelis theme for nostalgia but it wasn't enough.To conclude, I enjoyed the film but unfortunately cannot say I loved it. I simply cannot fathom the enormous praise given by critics & moviegoers. I don't think they understood what made the first film brilliant. BR 2049 does contain the main elements required for a true Sci-Fi film but fell flat at further exploring its themes. The original film on the other hand is a masterpiece. It felt spiritual & spellbinding whilst the sequel did not. Should you go see it? Yes. I would still recommend fans and anyone curious to go see this film in theaters despite its evident flaws. But as a huge fan it left me disappointed. Maybe I had high expectations! I gave it a generous 7/10",Blade Runner 2049

1728,jsbgaarder,Powerful and majestic science fiction!,10,15 October 2017,"Just like the first movie, it discusses what it really means to be a human being and it comments on the state of humanity in a way that is uncomfortable near what is real and truthful.The Blade Runner 2049 is an adult sci-fi that caters for reflection while inviting us into a slightly foreseeable future universe that seems as perceptive and interesting as it is dark and dystopic.Stumbling over a dark secret Los Angeles anno 2049 is a chaotic, overpopulated and polluted monster of a city where Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) has bought the stumps of Tyrell Corporation and their technology and is king on the hill with its constructed androids, called ""replicants.""The LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is a ""blade runner"" looking for replicas on the run, stumbling over a dark secret while on a mission. To get a response, he is looking for Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former ""blade runner"" that disappeared 30 years ago.The story is much richer and comprehensive than a tiny record can convey. It is spoken through sparse, but precise dialogue, co- written by Hampton Fancher, who was also one of the authors of the original originals, based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.The movie's figures have different approaches to what it means to be human, such as Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), who is Wallace's right hand, Joi (Ana de Armas) who is K's companion, or the farmer Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista in one small but important role - be sure to bring you the Blade Runner card movie 2048: Nowhere to Run on YouTube, giving his figure a further depth).Everyone has their own ambitions, methods and instruments, but ultimately everyone is looking for a form of humanity and survival.Denis Villeneuve presents his own universe, full of visual ideas and magnificent views in Blade Runner 2049. Denis Villeneuve presents his own universe, full of visual ideas and magnificent views in the Blade Runner 2049. Villeneuve does not disappoint Denis Villeneuve has obviously studied the original Blade Runner because the new film's universe continues Ridley Scott's future vision and expands it on a scale that seems credible and probable, of course, with powerful instruments that Scott could only dream of in 1982.At the same time, he does not fall for the temptation to cultivate nostalgia to a significant extent. Just look at an explosive scene with Deckard's original Spinner vehicle and how K suspects the darkened ghost of Tyrell Corporation's former headquarters, now in the shadow of Niander Wallace's monstrous palace.But there are other and more subtle waves, such as the summons in Deckard's apartment, the whiskey he drinks, certain advertising signs in big city photos and some other reminder that you will experience yourself. Blade Runner 2049 has great respect for its predecessor, but presents its own universe, full of visual ideas and magnificent views, masterfully filmed by veteran Roger Deakins.Even the intense film music of Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer have their own identity, despite some moves that drag the lines back to Vangelis's moods from the first film.Ryan Gosling plays K with a restful calm, even in some extreme situations, and conveys the emotional range of the figure with small, precise eyes, signs and words. Harrisons Ford's role is a little less than one would expect from the trail, but he is good and efficient as a much older and distinguished Deckard.His continued destiny has been a mystery to Blade Runner fans for 35 years, and the answers you get in this movie are very satisfying. One also recognizes the outlines of a much larger universe, where there are clear opportunities for more stories, if it should be applicable. The potential is in any case present.Perhaps you should be glad that Ridley Scott did not have time to direct Blade Runner 2049, and to be one of the producers, because his legendary status is undeniable, Denis Villeneuve is one of the world's most sharpest filmmakers right now, with quality films such as Sicario and Arrival on the merit list.He does not disappoint now either, to say the least. This is dark, mysterious and thoughtful science fiction of the very highest quality!",Blade Runner 2049
1729,claudiu-48838,What does it mean to be human?,8,8 October 2017,"Or, how could we answer, like Descartes, to the question ""how do I know if I exists"" or ""what makes me an entity, a personality, a person?"" Blade Runner 2049 is not designed to throw bullets in all directions, it's not a film that will pop your popcorn on your neck between two explosions. It's a movie of dilemmas, of questions, of doubt, of uncertainty.What gives me the right to say that ""I exist""? What feature, what property or what adjective, what line must be passed for ""being""? Is love, or perhaps self-consciousness, an exclusive attribute of people that could not be touched, appropriated, approached by any elaborate software, code that burns any Turing test? Do I need a physical body, a humanoid form for ""being,"" or real skin, or an adventurous one from a primate, to be able to proclaim my existence? Which of these ""must-have social characters"", or how many of these events should be uncovered to have the right to proclaim ""I am""? Can Occam's Shirt also work here, finding the winner, the simplest answer?Probably I could not stop asking questions too soon, because BR 2049 deeply deepens the philosophical mind of the viewer with his philosophical questions. It takes us to the realm of self-suggestion when we want to ""dress"" the most ""synthetic"" ways of living. In trying to get our right to exist, to be important, we get stories that seem to be ours, but is not ours. The fact that we live in a ""simulated presence"" is no longer just a movie scenario. We live in a society that dictates us, in consumerism, living from inertia, job, family, responsibility, all the cultural conditioning that we are taught to learn from birth. But first of all we want to be special and we look with the fear of being just a software called ""adn"" that only has the ability to replicate itself. What makes us more than replicators?I do not want to make more of this movie that it is. I just want to invite you to watch this movie in an introspective way, making yourself the screenwriters of this movie.Actor play, innovative frames, some visual effects, make this long movie a pleasant and desirable one. Perhaps more music would have furthered some moments better. In conclusion, you are not guided by some reviews or by my way of understanding the movie.

We can emphatically ask for more - and if we do not receive more - can be content in knowing it can be ours. Because Blade Runner gives its audience a piece of ownership and we can take it with us.

1732,andymjay,No Magic,7,2 November 2017,"On the deepest level, Blade Runner (the original) magically reduced the most daunting questions of our existencewhat are we.who or what created uswhat is consciousness, memory, identity, empathy, love..to characters and relationships on screen, mainly Rachel and Deckard. Their moments together were beyond precious. The stars had to align for this to work. No such thing happened for this sequel. It is a good film and I will see it again but the two should not be confused.It's interesting that in 35 years the visual effects could not be appreciably improved..probably because we've passed the point of diminishing returns in hitek digital slambam. What is left is the story and acting and both did not overly impress. The death scene on the steps is an unoriginal mimicking of what is for me one of the greatest scenes ever.a soaked dying Rutger Hauer on the roof with the white dove. The music likewise was a poor wannabe of the original Vangelis.To have your heart, soul, and mind be touched deeply, powerfully and increasingly with each viewing by a film is an unforgettable experience, and when a film operates on 2 levels simultaneously, as a great action film (for most viewers)and as a spiritual experience for some, it becomes transcendent, a very rare thing for films. Such is Blade Runner for me. An example of another film of another genre which operates for me the same way is Somewhere in Time. For most, just a deceptively beautiful, schmaltzy love story. I've seen it countless times as I have Blade Runner. It triggers the same profound reflections on our being.",Blade Runner 2049

1734,masonbrewer,"""I have seen things you people wouldn't believe...""",10,6 October 2017,"Film is a medium that gets better with age. As a still picture is a form of reflection upon memory, a moving picture is a time capsule as well. While some shine only shortly within their moments of popularity, others grow in that popularity over the years even if they didn't have it upon first release. This circumstance is usually where the word ""classic"" tends to appear. While the term is usually revered in the filmmaking community, it often seems to scare critics. When age is usually a necessity in determining a classic it becomes difficult for a person who reviews the latest movies to use the term when describing something current. A fear of jumping the gun, and a fear I don't have. Blade Runner 2049 is a new classic. It will inspire countless young filmmakers as well as dazzle and delight fans of the original and those who have never seen it. I do not dare spoil this film. The plot is so well crafted and none of the points are forced upon the audience. It treats the viewer with respect and let's the audience put pieces together on their own. This is not to say that it is predictable. I think the biggest compliment I can give this film is that I didn't know where it was going. I was invested in the main characters struggles and that is mostly due to Ryan Gosling's superb performance. A performance that could not have been easy but because of that has now become my favorite of his. The amount of emotions he has to display through every scene is staggering and he pulls it off unbelievably. Aside from Gosling's performance we also have the star of the original Blade Runner; Harrison Ford returning as Rick Deckard. I have been a huge fan of Ford's career since I was a child and with that in mind I have to bring to light a fact that isn't easy to admit. Although he's great in the original as the disgruntled cop who learns to empathize with machines, he is very subtle with his emotions and doesn't often get into the really heavy, feely moments of a film. I am utterly amazed that this film brought out the sadness and pain in this character. Harrison Ford does things you never see him do here. I think it might be one of the best performances of his entire career. I often wonder where the new legends are. Spielberg, Kubrick, Scorsese, all the filmmaking giants that made their waves rise high above the heads of the industry and crash down with hit after hit and classic after classic. It appeared to me before I entered the theater that I had missed out on that era. Not to say that there aren't masters still out there today but they're just so hard to find. I now know that when the name ""Denis Villeneuve"" appears in the credits of a work, I will be blown away. Every film he has made thus far has been of exceptional quality and without a doubt, this is his finest work to date. I feel that he understood what made the original so revered, took it's DNA and crafted the finest specimen that he possibly could. There is another name that I must mention that I hope will soon become a household name just as the other legends that I mentioned previous. The man whose eye for angles and light have become legend to me. This man is Roger Deakins. Remember his name. This is just another passage in the great story that he's telling with his images. The world that has been created here feels so real, so lived in. The original gave us a glimpse into a future where machines were beginning to become more human than human, this film widens the keyhole and shows us the world where that is a full reality. And while I sat back in that IMAX theater, gazing at Deakins' vivid paintings, my ears were sucked in by the amazing soundtrack composed by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer. The synth sounds delighted and excited me. The most intense moments of the film were given that much more life by the music that drove them. What I find to be the greatest thing about this new masterpiece is that, I had so little expectations for it. I walked through those doors with an indifference inside me. Why make a sequel to a film that relied on thought provoking questions that were never answered? A sequel exists to expand on the first, so will it ruin all of the best aspects of the first? What could this film possibly bring? I was so wrong. The questions that existed before are still there as well as new ones that still have me thinking even as I write this now. I can analyze this film for years just as so many have the original. I know that this film won't be loved by all. The runtime will most likely be too long for the average blockbuster viewer, the complex ideals presented will annoy those who came for action, the pace will most likely completely bore them. But I feel those that do have these problems will come to realize something as well...that's exactly what people thought of the original when it was released. Now it is a classic. When I got in my car and proceeded along the dark road to my home, I sat in silence as my mind raced faster than my vehicle could take me. Of all the things that I didn't expect, I certainly didn't expect to see one of the greatest films I've ever viewed in the year 2017. Film truly is an amazing medium. And as I pulled into my driveway and killed the engine, I fretted over the biggest question that I had that evening, a question that still haunts me nowIs it better than the original?",Blade Runner 2049

It takes many hours to see, it doesn't end in the end. As you're going home you carried it on your head. Somehow it has a little of the Kubrick effect. It slow cooks.It is one of those to repeat in some time. The unsettled feeling grows with time and with the hands of Hans Zimmer. You just can't rest in your chair as he is always pushing you to the edge. The director of photography, Roger Deakins adds to that the perfect dystopian future. Ryan Gosling's act was the weakest point. But even there you get mixed feelings. His relationship with Ana de Armas reminded me a lot the movie 'Her' and Scarlet Johansson's erotic act (only with her voice).In a nutshell, it is a very strong sequel and we should keep in mind the legacy that Denis Villeneuve carried on his back.

1739,allaaliferis,"Very Dark, Strong film but nowhere near the caliber of the original",8,7 October 2017,"***Warning: Many spoilers ahead***I saw this movie in 3d and I m a x 2d. I have seen the original dozens of times and have studied the music and filmmaking literature on it extensively. Brief impressions:This is a very dark movie that builds on the original. On its own it several (acceptable) flaws that do not prevent it from being worth seeing and to be arguably one of the best sci-fi movies of recent years. However it is not on par with the original. Key observations:-Very dark in tone, thematically, stylistically and musically. There is no resolution of any new themes and the only resolution offered is a copy of the original down to the exact same musical cue (tears in rain) minus the beauty of the original. In some cases, the plot is vulgar (Rachel's skull used as a conversation prop or Rachel resurrected via cloning only to be killed because the eye color was not the same – ""what the heck"" moment). The AI love story was the best thing in the movie but was not resolved meaningfully. Deckard's android nature was ignored as if it never existed or not mattered. Also the body count in the sequel is 10 times that of the original. -Editing is kind of mechanical: 4 seconds (most cuts) or 2 (for the short ones). If you start counting it becomes distracting in its repetitiveness. -Direction/performances: tilted camera angles in many flying shots and not enough time to absorb the landscapes. All mega structures looming over in the background are too far away and no visual detail visible. Pace slow but appropriately so. Performances uneven. Major negative standout is the Leto performance which is a sore thumb (in his defense, his lines were very poor, and he and his organization has a habit of killing people left and right according to the plot). The rest of the cast is great.-Sound mixing/editing: often unintelligible dialogue. Music too loud. -Photography: there is the widespread meme that Mr Deakins (a great cinematographer no doubt) has created a visual masterpiece, surely deserves an Oscar etc. I believe that the people who put forward these claims for 2049 do not have a sufficiently educated eye for photography. Specifically, the overall visual impression of the totality of the movie is a bland ""dark gray"". In addition, some shots consist solely of orange hues, and all flying scenes are a dreadful gray. Most other scenes have analogous color harmony in the earthy part of the spectrum and a few have a 4-color harmony (I am sorry I cannot use proper technical terms, the IMDb spell checker is set at 6 grade level it seems) mimicking the blue-red-orange-green of some scenes of the original. The movie is shot with spherical lenses in digital with strips cut off to simulate wide screen lenses. The dynamic range is limited in many scenes and the lighting is pretty bland. On exception is the mysterious switch from lighted to dark and back in some scenes that does have a great dramatic effect (unfortunately the script in these scenes is so weak that no cinematography can compensate). The composition is in most cases sparsely layered and with the minimalist set design create a feeling of unfinished work or inappropriately empty space. By comparison the original's photography uses strongly contrasted shadows and lights with huge dynamic range and striking visuals with strong allegorical results. In the original releases, black and gold dominated the first 2 acts and blue-dominating 4-color harmonies the third act (in the JF Sebastian building). In latter versions of the original, the whole palette shifted to blue and black-dominated color harmonies. The original was shot in anamorphic & film with dense photographic smoke on set and these created a whole range of desirable artistic effects. The lighting was not only used to create the half-in-shadow effect but constantly moving shafts created a ""living"" background by connecting the interiors with the world outside. The composition had many layers and combined with the detailed and luxurious set design created a feeling of a real world with many secrets. -Set design and costumes: sparse and minimalist in the sequel and deep, with many layers and reality-creating in the original. Especially annoying cheapness in the sets for K's apartment and the police headquarters. Compare to Sebastian's apartment in the Bradbury building or the police station in the original to see the difference.-Visual Effects: this is the only area that the sequel is immaculate. Joi's holographic effects in particular were a delight. -Music: in the sequel sometimes a ""wall of sound"", often a ""wall of noise"", with screeching strings in high registers and TOO DAMN LOUD. The original score -which is probably the finest score ever in a science fiction movie- had strong melodies, a variety of ethnic/multicultural structures and a variety of genres (cutting-edge synth orchestrations, blues, ragtime, ethnic, percussive), old (nostalgic) and new timbres (synthesized). It also had amazing ambiance that created sonic-ally the blade runner world as much as anything. It also fully integrated the sound effects into the music. Finally it had huge dynamic range going from silence to explosions and everything in between. Watch the beginning titles of the movie to appreciate the difference: in the original a single melody line with background explosions and reverb. In the sequel 100+ decibel note clusters (with a couple of chord thrown in, each lasting for ever). The new score is by comparison weak in melodic ideas, weak in harmony, lacks variety, is often migraine-triggering percussive, and is too damn loud all the time as I said earlier. CONCLUSIONS: Overall this is a fine movie, and well worth seeing, however on par with the original Blade Runner, it is not.",Blade Runner 2049

1744,amalcom,Nearly Perfect,8,15 October 2017,"For me personally, the first two hours were amazing, I was completely immersed within the world and the story. Being a fan of the first one made me love the first two acts, and cringe a little at the third act, although, it certainly didn't ruin the movie for me, there were just a few things that kept the film being an absolute sequel masterpiece (Godfather 2, Aliens, Terminator 2, Mad Max Fury Road, etc.), that said, it comes pretty close, and who knows, I could change my mind after a few more viewings.Beware if you want to blank slate the movie, but read on if you've read most other reviews and synopses, or even just watched the trailers. But I'll start off with my complaints, so pretty much once Deckard entered the story, things started to go sour for me. First of all, the magic nostalgia is kind of ruined by the fact that this is Harrison Ford's third role reprisal, and the other two, lovable as they are, are comparatively silly. Deckard is a very, serious and dark character, to put it lightly, he and Rachael do not have a Han and Leigha romantic relationship, it's a very hard boiled noir type affair, let's just say Rachael never seems to happy, or even consenting, about the whole thing most of the time. They both have a lot going on. But in 2049, Harrison Ford reminisces about love and such, and seems more like Han Solo or Indiana Jones than Deckard, maybe that's just from the overshadowing of those two other characters. But it's just kind of weird, yes, Deckard and Rachael do run off at the end of the original, but the film is so dark, I doubt too much sweetness occurred, but who knows? They could have had a passionate year or so after.Also, the last climatic scene does not have the emotional punch of the original, also the presence of Harison Ford does not help. And lastly, the last scene is powerful, but very Arrival, and just kind of out of place, sort of like Harrison Ford actually. It's like if Mel Gibson was haniging out in Fury Road.That said, the rest of the film is amazing! Visually it replicates and improves upon the the aesthetic of the original. I very much like the way the story mirrors the noir mystery story line and pacing of the first, perhaps that's why the nostalgic last emotional hour seems a little out of place. Also, it was extremely refreshing to watch shots that were longer than seven seconds, to just let the world, and even the interiors, immerse you. The connection to the first are actually very clever, and Gosling's K's involvement in the whole thing is a nice nod to the vagueness of the original film. Contrary to many reviews and general rumor, the mysteries of the first are preserved. K's holographic HER girlfriend is a nice element, and a welcomed contrast to the original. Ana DE Armas turns what could have been just another empty character into the most fleshed out character of the film. Robin Wright, in a similar role as in Wonder Woman, is fun to watch as a great sergeant character.In summary, all in all, two hours of an absolute masterpiece, with a final act that is, well, a movie, but still a good movie, despite the minor complaints, hence the 9 rating, it was almost there.

1746,highrock,"Ok movie, *horrible* sequel",4,31 January 2018,"First off, the movie itself is not 'bad' per se.
It's a cliche manhunt thriller that will keep you in your seat if you are a fan of sci-fi movies, with enough special effects and great cinematography to keep you salivating.Denis Villeneuve pulls off what he does best, he glues you to your seat.Does that make it a good movie however? And what about the whole point in it being a sequel? I'm rarely judge how good a movie is by if it kept me entertained. Cartoons keep me entertained, B-movies keep me entertained. A good movie, a truly good movie, by my standards will have me reflecting on it, thinking about it, want to watch it again, grow fond of it. There are so many great movies. 2049 is not one of them. It's a thriller. It's a 2.5 hour ride that the moment it arrives at the station you hop off and have already forgotten everything about. There is no great mystery in the movie, no great question, the visuals aren't revolutionary, and while some elements had so much potential, were barely there as complimentary to the director's oh-so-important plot (that really is not important at all). The movie makes it all about finding someone - but in the end, whether that person is found or not changes very little to the entire universe of that movie. Whether the person if found or not, doesn't actually do anything. And yet the movie is entirely built around that intrigue.If you take the original blade runner. What was it about? Was it about finding and hunting replicants? Or the dilemma of by what right are they hunted? What truly makes them any different? And as a byproduct delving deep into the question of what actually does make us human? Roy showing more humanity, conflict, despair than some actual humans will ever experience. The entire movie was built around this theme, the monologues, the simple scenes, and the atmosphere was built to make the work feel all the more isolated to better illustrate how very personal that question is. No one can tell you the answer to the question, its a very I-think-therefore-I-am type of reflection and viewers are more or left on their own trying to figure what the hell is going on beneath the seemingly simple story of a blade runner rounding up replicants.None of that in 2049. They even basically answer the original's dilemna straight out. Human, Replicant, whatever, its all the same. Hunt 'x' because its super dangerous if 'x' is revealed to the world. (Even though the world seems to know anyway, and no one would care because Humans or Replicants, its all the same). Not to mention mostly squashing any possibility of the many unanswered theories the original had (i.e. is Deckard a replicant). 2049 did not have to even involve Deckard. At all. They could've done the same movie without him which simply pushes me to believe they needed Harrison Ford to cash in on the cult following. The movie ponders no existential question, no moral dilemna. Its just an action manhunt in a sci-fi setting. *spoilers*
Where the movie really disgruntled me is in the scenes between the new blade runner and his home AI. Everything begs to be delved deeper in. The concept of Love for 'machines'. If androids can dream of electric sheep, does it make it any less of a dream? And if androids can love and desire, does it make that love any less pure? This is where the movie hooked me in and got me hoping. But it barely even vehiculates the plot and is discarded as soon as it starts. Much to my dissapointment. It's as if it was in the movie only for eye-candy-sci-fi-ness.
*end spoiler*They could have built the entire movie around this, complete with intrigue etc... and it wouldve made an incredible sci-fi noir (which is what the first is). They would'nt have had to use any pretense. But nope. You don't get any memorable monologue from this one. You don't end up more and more puzzled every time you watch it (quite the opposite). The movie is barely dystopian with all its super high-tech cleanliness and apart from a few scenes that remind you that somewhere in the city some people are poor and life is crap and its a Blade Runner movie, you're mostly left thinking life is pretty good for almost anyone and that you are watching a longer, more action packed lackluster Black Mirror episode.

I was excited to see Blade Runner: 2049 as it is so well-rated so far. I didn't read the novel nor saw the first movie, maybe I should do that before judging this one, but I'm gonna do it either way: Is this movie bad? No, it's not. The conveyed moods are a good fit, the graphics are really good and the topic is intriguing. I haven't seen too much of Ryan Goslings acting before and I liked him, a disillusioned, melancholic figure searching for love and purpose in this f**ked-up world. The cons: The music (I know it is supposed to mirror this technocratic dystopia, but please, God, kill me now!); the length is ridiculous, why would it take 2:45 hours to paint this picture?; the story is, as I said, intriguing, but it does not offer anything innovative. I don't know what else to add and maybe that's the worst thing about the film: there is nothing out of the ordinary.

1758,olsondan,Well I loved it!,10,26 December 2017,"I am old enough to have seen the original Blade Runner and to tell the truth I didn't quite understand what it was about, until I read the book. Still, this Blade Runner was far smoother. I understood what was happening and, most importantly, I cared about what happened to the characters. I also fully understood and identified the villain(s). 
Ryan Gosling, well, I never really cared for him as an actor, but the wretched humanity of his Android(?) character, broke my heart. You know you are enjoying a movie when you start crying, without realizing it. 
What can you say about Harrison Ford? He has become a part of our cultural identity. Yet, although I'm of a similar age to him, I found myself asking, ""How did he get so old?"" An evident reality in the movie, that contributed to your caring about his character. 
The visual pallet isn't jarring or too edgy. It was smooth, richly stark(acknowledged oxymoron), elegant. It didn't become a separate entity in the show, but a complimenting background bringing the characters to the forefront. 
This was a story that I could get behind. The agony of the identification of the navel point of the 'I Am"" which we all struggle with at one point in our lives.",Blade Runner 2049

1760,ronandero,An amazing unwanted sequel...,10,10 November 2017,"Let's be serious, the day they announced a Blade Runner sequel I thought it would never work. The original is a film that I wanted to stay on it's own. It's a film that inspired me to love movies and see details on how they're made artistically instead of being made just for entertainment value and money. Therefore knowing Denis Villenueve direction towards this movie I knew it was in good hands but I was still sceptical. He's one of my favourite directors working today just from his work on Prisoners,Sicario,Enemy, Incendies, and Arrival. Then here we are he has done it again making another Sci-Fi masterpiece since Arrival with Blade Runner 2049. I went into this movie thinking I would hate it since it is a sequel to a movie that I felt didn't need one. Nothing in my mind could ever top the original so I went in with low expectations. However This movie floored me and I couldn't believe how amazing it was. It's one of those sequels that's actually amazing in its own way and extends the story from the original. It doesn't feel like a remake or a soft reboot. The visuals are amazing and are faithful to the original while maintaining a different mood and tone, it felt like I was experiencing another expansion of the Blade Runner universe. I don't want to get too far saying this but this felt like a modern Space Odyssey only saying visually as a Sci-Fi film, it's a beautiful film that I do hope will influence future filmmakers. My only flaws for this movie is that there are some missing elements like the smokey L.A. streets and jazz music we all know in love from the original, but that's OK this movie was trying to have it's own identity and be different. Regardless of the amazing sequences at Las Vegas and San Diego, I wish I got to see more of Los Angeles don't get me wrong there is a good amount of time of seeing it and its beautiful I just wanted a bit more and that's not a bad thing just small nitpicking. Therefore that being said I also think it's one of the best sequels I have experienced in a long time. I wasn't born at the time of release of the original so it felt fresh to experience the Blade Runner world again in 2049. I haven't seen a film that impacted me or felt like an experience since The Dark Knight or Mad Max Fury Road.I definitely group 2049 along with sequels like The Dark Knight, The Empire Strikes Back,Terminator 2, Godfather 2,and Aliens. Just from the jaw dropping imagery Cinematographer Roger Deakins has shot his best if not one of the most beautiful looking shot films of his career and for the modern Sci- Fi Era considering that this is his first Sci-Fi film. I also appreciate Ridley Scott and Hampton Fancher who directed and scripted the original returned to produce, pen, and re-imagine this movie 30 years after the original from 2019 to 2049. The Vangelis score from the original still melts my heart till this day nothing could ever top it. However Collaboration from both composers Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfish did an outstanding job maintaining the synthetic sounds while having a different mood and tone for the brutality of this movie, so yes the score is fantastic. Harrison Ford has surprisingly committed returning to the role of Rick Deckard and does an amazing job, unlike his cash grab do it for the fans performance as Han Solo from The Force Awakens. Ryan Gosling does wonderful playing Officer K and hasn't been this awesome and charismatic since his movie Drive. Outstanding performances from everyone including Jared Leto who I thought at first would ruin the tone of the movie but did a good performance than his joker from suicide squad. Although I love this movie it's not perfect, it's a film that might not be for everyone. Some people may find it boring, maybe even fans of the original might hate it or love it. That could be just because of the pacing since it is a slow paced film. Anyway it's OK not even the original had that kind of view but has stood the test of time and has had a cult following. The run time is also long clocking in at 2 hours and 43 minutes (163 minutes) and that might be a problem for the average moviegoer. So make sure you go to the restroom and be ready before watching the movie. Personally I was not bothered by it's slow pace I had relief that this movie had a long run time to tell it's story because I feel if it was shortened down it would have felt rushed. So as said if you want to see this movie make sure you go in knowing what you're expecting. Don't go in expecting an action movie, this is a Sci-Fi Thriller Mystery film. It doesn't have fight sequences or explosions every five minutes. Go in with low expectations and maybe you will love or hate this movie that's all I can say as a fan of the original. If you haven't seen the original I highly recommend you watch it first so that you can appreciate this film even more. We don't get movies that have this kind of pace or run time anymore so it felt fresh like watching a movie made from the 70's or 80's. I do hope this movie gets recognition in the nearby future like the original. I highly recommend you to watch this movie if you love eye dropping cinematography, slow paced tone, and want an amazing experience. Please go support and see this flawed masterpiece... 10/10",Blade Runner 2049

It has nearly the same argument, Blade Runner chasing a special replicant, the same end, Replicant dies being more human than most humans and Deckard goes away with the girl, and thousand of copied winks from the original 1982 movie.But we're not in 1982, and what then was fresh and new, today are abused clichés, and technical improvements could not fill the gap between a master piece of cinema, and a ""cheap"" remake",Blade Runner 2049

1765,tijnenzerink,"Yeah, I rate it 10/10, but let me explain why",10,6 August 2019,"I have to say, I think the reviews here are a bit passive aggressive. Some are screaming at Hollywood, others at people that rate this movie 10/10 and some scream about the screaming reviewers. So here is just my take on the movie.I loved it. The movie isn't perfect, but to me there wasn't anything that I didn't like. I rate the movie based on my own experience and I'm certainly not unbiased. I liked the original, but I always felt that it was a bit overrated. The story never matched the beautiful visuals. Blade Runner 2049 has improved a lot on the story front, but without losing the philosophical aspects of the original.The visuals are what make this movie amazing. It's beautiful. I don't think better than the original, because they are very different and technically they can do very different things now than they could before. But the cinematography was especially remarkable, it made every scene beautiful. Even in the most mondaine locations.The soundtrack, it fits the movie, but it's trying to copy the original and it fails a bit. Yes, it works in the movie, but no, it isn't great on it's own like the original.Ryan Gosling is great, but the role isn't that tough most of the time. Harrison Ford is great, which was a surprise seeing his work over the last years. Jared Leto was good, nothing amazing, not bad, I would call it serviceable.If you read all of this, it doesn't sound like I should rate this 10/10, but all of these critisms only came to me after I got out of the cinema. While watching the movie, I loved every single second of it. It was one of the best experiences for me at the cinema, I never wanted it to end, and I think that that's the feeling a 10/10 movie should give you.",Blade Runner 2049
1766,karsun-28819,Wow! Loved it!

This is a slow, introspective, highly engrossing SF masterpiece. I watched in one sitting which I hardly do with any other movie. BTW, I fall asleep with almost all super-hero movies.

1767,assssnking,Blade Runner 2049 Review,6,6 October 2017,"I'm going to keep it simple. This film has spectacular visuals, some of the best I've ever seen, maybe even the best I've ever seen. The sound design is equally as engaging. Though I'm disappointed to say that every other aspect of this film is painfully mediocre. You're not going to find any unique story telling in this film, it isn't anything a casual movie goer hasn't seen before. There is one decent twist in the whole two hour and forty three minute run time, but it wasn't good enough to excuse the dreadful pacing. There are a great many scenes where we watch a character quite literally do nothing for a good couple of minutes. A lot of time is wasted. I get exactly what the film is trying to do though unfortunately it's just not very entertaining and these scenes do not justify the lengthy run time. Everything besides the sound and visuals are underwhelming to say the least, even the action scenes are underwhelming, and there isn't very many of them. Ultimately Blade Runner 2049 is a stunning visual experience that is aided by equally great sound design that immerses you into its world. Unfortunately, in terms of story telling and characters, despite the actors doing a phenomenal job, everything else about this movie is average.",Blade Runner 2049
1768,djgoutsmart,Pale shadow of the original,6,6 October 2017,"Great opening, beautiful imagery, powerful and emotive soundtrack. What could go wrong? Well...Pedestrian script. None of the truly existential and thought provoking story from the original. The characters were mostly one- dimensional, never surprising (none like Roy Batty, mass-murderer who in his final moments saves the life of the man who hunted and killed all the people he cared about). To be fair there were some interesting interactions, but they were few and far between.Where the beautiful scenes of the original were poignant and well paced, the sequel dragged them out to the point of being ponderous. I actually started shuffling in my seat through a couple of the particularly drawn-out ones (note: I NEVER shuffle).A lot of ""huh?"" moments - like when Ryan Gosling's replicant runs through a 6-inch thick concrete wall. While they are tough they are still flesh, blood and bone - not the Terminator (for reference Roy Batty stuck his head through a plaster wall that was tiled - still tough, but physically possible). There were a number of other scenes that were not believable or where actions seemed unnecessary (sorry I didn't want to include spoilers).In a nutshell, it's an ""ok"" movie that could be drastically improved with some vigorous editing. Unfortunately the mediocre script and story will ultimately stop it from ever becoming a classic like the original.",Blade Runner 2049

Blade Runner 2049 is unnecessary long, with a thin plot, neither tension or mystic atmosphere and most of all lacks any proper soundtrack since abstract sounds here and there is not a proper or worthy soundtrack for a brand of this calibre and history, i mean Vangelis must be somewhere holding his head in shame or his belly laughing. Its about time people in Hollywood understand that the visuals alone are not enough, just because a movie is beautiful to the eye it doesnt mean that this movie is good.

1774,pranaysingh_,A very engaging and humane film of the year!,10,11 October 2017,"Anybody who has watched Blade Runner (1982) is aware of the cinematic impact it had on their lives. I was amazed by its visual treatment and themes of creation and mortality in a atmospherically degraded earth where Humans have exploited every natural resource to survive. The dystopic world is bleak and dark sometimes showing us what 'we' as humans are capable of doing. Watching it felt like feeling art. It is definitely the most artistic film made by Ridley Scott. Tonight I had the opportunity to watch Blade Runner 2049, which is set 30 years after the first film. This film is the best sequel I've come across since The Dark Knight (2008). I wouldn't even call it a film, I'll call it art. Roger Deakin's breathtaking cinematography should get him his first Oscar (especially since he has been nominated for 13 times!). Denis Villeneuve is currently my favourite film maker. After watching all the films that he has made, I can assure you that he is the master of thriller in the 21st century. I'm not going to talk about the movie's theme or what I interpreted from it because this film is an event and one must enjoy watching it in theatres than on a freaking laptop. Probably the most visually striking film of the decade, people who enjoy watching films with a strong visual emphasis MUST watch it on the large screen. I have such a strong feeling about this film. When I compare it to the first film, I felt that the ideas evolved exponentially and took it to a large scale, a more deeply layered film that is very engaging and thrilling. Apart from the direction point of view, the screenplay and the story along with intense dialogues made the film very atmospheric. Loved the performances by each and every cast member. It felt realistic and substantial. So if any of y'all plan on watching this masterpiece, please watch Blade Runner: The Final Cut, which is the last version released by Ridley Scott on Blu-Ray in 2007. The Final Cut is his truest vision of the film that he had made back in 1982.",Blade Runner 2049

1779,allenmeece,Disappointment for Intellectuals,3,13 October 2017,"The original movie is on my top 5 list. I bought the DVD and play it once a year so i was sad to see the substandard achievement on this so-called ""sequel."" It's not a sequel, it's a noir thriller in the style of Blade Runner but without the creativity factor.I detest any movie with a gratuitous scene of cold-blooded murder for our perverse enjoyment and this mishmash has half a dozen.The writer made serious errors of technology which obliterated the movie's believability. It's main point was that Rachel the android gave birth to a baby!!! That's not a ""miracle"" as stated, that is a pure Hollywood silliness dreamed up inside drunken plot parties!Decker, which the movie supposes is a replicant, is supposed to be the father but if he were a replicant he would have automatically self-destructed by 2049 when the movie takes place. If he were a replicant, a lab-created machine, he wouldn't have had reproductive powers, duhhh. (If machines could make babies, Tyrell Corp couldn't have made money by producing them in the factory.)Another plot problem is that Rachel died during childbirth. She was a replicant and would self-destruct anyway so why add that trite event? That birth led to a mix-up of records and the movie proves to us that the new blade runner guy is Deckard's kid but at the end the runner tells Deckard that a woman who is confined to a habitation cell because of immune deficiency is really Rachels ""miraculous"" offspring. Boom. Sure fooled the audience. That's the trick ending. sadddd.The movie had no ""score"" just booming synth sounds thundering at the wrong places. With a hundred and fifty million dollar budget (mostly spent on CGI which is never the heart of a movie), they couldn't hire a great composer? I will be very cautious before I'll pay to see another Ridley Scott movie. He feels like a Hollywood sellout after screwing up his own classic movie legacy.",Blade Runner 2049

The rendition of a futuristic and doomed world is absolutely stunning, troubling, credible, aesthetic. This is in my opinion reason number one to go watch this movie. All along the film, one wonders ""Is he/she a replicant?"" There is a thin line between artificial/natural intelligence, a very fine boundary impossible to be crossed. These are in my opinion, the two main assets of this visually stunning movie. However, keep in mind this movie is all about artificial life. Therefore, there is no artifices.

I usually don't notice, but it's just so obvious. It is loud and screechy and over-dramatic. In general, someone thought that adding lot's of rain over a window at night, plus dramatic music, plus actors making mysterious faces is going to be enough as a movie. Basically, that's how you make a soap opera, and that's what we ended up having. The Story itself is downright ridiculous.

1788,hyfrehyfre,Too short for a 30 years wait. Love is on its way...,8,8 October 2017,"How much have we mature as an audience in the last years?, or even as a society?. Blade Runner is a testament of what art originally is, a backbone to carve your own dreams and ideas, differently enough from the simple ""visit & praise"" to some artist/director ""vistion"" or what is more common today, a direct ""in rails"" dreams of a sort without a personal should of its own. This movie accomplished to bring such a dream from 1982 to our day, we can only dream that kids today would fell what we felt back then.Blade Runner always was, and thanks to god, it is today also a Movie that helps you dream your own facts behind the main plot, Blade Runner should never have a complete plot and is by no mean a coherent ""human"" world, which should at least ring a bell or two. This ""lingering between logic and whats real"" is what Blade Runner is for the cinema art history: ""The chance of giving you new hopes to dream beyond what you can see, and whats most important, even bigger that what the director waned you to see. Blade Runner should make you free"".I was searching for this over the years, as the original Blade Runner marked that young heart with questions of logic from very simple sources like: ""How can a city be so big in such a small time"", ""how can the dates not match reality""... to those that are really complicated ""What is the lore on nexus 1?"", ""What about real humans, are there any remaining, how can we know?"", ""how come no one ever speaks about AI?, did people in said reality jumped from AI directly to sential cyborgs?"", ""is deckar love for Rachael something of batch of code being returned from sentient AI?""...As a kid this kind of questions made me obsessed of a deeper meaning behind Blade Runner, and so the real door to good quality Sci Fi opened for the rest of my life. I would certainly not be half of the man i am today without the gift of Blade Runner in my life.Blade Runner 2049 is driven by this consciousness of something ""else"" behind the world it represents, not touching the facts, but letting them float above your head, reminding me of the best child dreamer in me, it is still very much inside. Otherwise whats the point?, if ideas like Blade Runner universe being a complete sentient society of robots, as humans uploaded their brains on Nexus 1, without those ideas, probably our real world would be sincerely less complete, and things like Matrix might never got developed in the first place. Real art is a revolution of the sense that bring new art, real art is a soul with sentient capabilities.In other words, i cant thank enough for the makers of this movie for not touching the ""fiber"" that is the mystery of Blade Runner, i strongly think that they understand what real nerds of Blade Runner think & fell about this universe, what is beyond apparent, what is a dream, how everything moved and felt, like they where all machines after all, aren't we all machines anyway?. Read the book.Humans building their way in sentient bodies generation after generation, deckar and Rachael being how GOD or ""we Nexus 1 humans"" are trying to get back to earth, as all our consciousness is trapped without a correct resolve. NO, whoever that went to the movie and lacked the feeling of there being something else, missed the whole point, Blade Runner 2049 was the real deal, the only reason i am giving it an 8 is that i am not 100% sure they understand the implications or just replicated what ridley scott did with much luck, anyways, copy art can be as good as real art if it helps keeping the should much intact, which is better thank changing something perfect.Blade Runner should make you dream, and pick your own backstory beyond what is apparent. Never trust somebody that reviews Blade Runner 2049 without touching the facts of ""dreams"" and ""sentient cyber punk"", just think for yourself inside, is Matrix compared to Balde Runner a middle step in making people think what was once only accessible for smart people in 1982?. what is next a movie about how god created the universe? ain't that just real life?.Art that respects art is good art, art that tried to add something out of love is best art and new art, there is no new art without love, there is no respect in ignorance and hate. Only love will make us survive, humans are coming to earth again, are you ready replicants?, that is how to life ""forver""",Blade Runner 2049

NO! Too much racket and forced sound effects. And we needed Vangelis.It's a great movie and I can't wait to see it again, but the theater where I saw it the volume was ear splitting loud and I wanted to leave because of the sound effects. Lighten up guys! The scene where the replicant ""newborn"" was dropped on the floor and struggled with the shock of it was remarkable, but many didn't like that she was killed. I know the goal was to make the Wallace character seem more like a Baron Harkonen if you will, but something was missing from it, and I don't think it was the acting that was the problem. There should have been better development and back story to how evil Wallace was. A scene for that was missing.",Blade Runner 2049
1791,bleepon,I've... seen things you people wouldn't believe...,2,12 October 2017,"...I've seen an amazing story removed of all subtlety and replaced with religious drivel wrapped up in a series of mindless, pointless action scenes with no explanation or point. Do you think that how in futuristic films there's often ecological ruin as a cautionary aspect, that the new Blade Runner is so bad to serve as a warning about the decline of cinematic values? If so then it's a masterpiece. If not, well...I am a huge fan of the original, usually mentioning it as one of my all time favourite films. I watched 2049 with some trepidation and yet was still massively disappointed and even a bit insulted. The plot was ridiculous and had religious tones, with the replicants referring to a 'miracle' and 'souls' over and over with what is honestly quite an impossible occurrence of one of them giving birth. I decided to just allow myself to believe this could happen but the film only got worse from there on. By the end I was so disinterested in what happened that I didn't even care about the death of K, arguably the only ambiguous part of the whole film. The original had masterful subtlety and ambiguity and left you seriously pondering the issues around AI. The original 'villains' had motives and depth, whereas in this the villains are mindless inhuman sadists with no substance whatsoever. This is a load of tarted up trash. You can slap a load of slick (yet uninventive) special effects on a bad story but it is still a bad story. Forgettable, insipid, insulting trash. I'd even recommend that there's more to be gotten from simply rewatching the original, especially since the new film brings no new ideas whatsoever. I wish I had.",Blade Runner 2049

1793,kraanjoss,Blade Runner 2049,8,24 October 2017,"Thoroughly satisfying film, and succeeds at what it meant to be - a visually striking and though provoking sequel to legendary science-fiction epic. I guess, at the moment, there aren't anyone who doesn't expect visual extravaganza with coherent story telling from Denis Velleneuve. 'Blade Runner 2049' doesn't disappoint in that department. The story is well developed, and every detail is at its right place with an intention to move the story forward and not just for the show. Not everything is overly elaborated and some stuff is given with only subtle glimpses and hunches which only purpose seems to make the movie seem more pretentious and deeper than it actually is (not that is a bad thing), but behind the sleek visuals, well written story and cool characters, there aren't much to rattle your brains about that hasn't been said before hundred times (including the first 'Blade Runner'). But that's not the most important anyway, as I didn't expect to see some great deep message, but rather well written science-fiction film, and that I got plenty of. Although the film is quite slow burning, the overall pacing is done so well that the running time feels much less than 160 minutes. Oh yes, and one can't forget that ominous technoir music by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer.New 'Blade Runner' can be seen as a stand alone film, and it is very good continuation to the first. This is the second time when Ridley Scott's movie gets sequel that is on a quite equal level with the first one, so lets hope they don't intend to make more, because we all remember what happened to the previous franchise R. Scott started.Well written, well acted and masterfully directed science-fiction move that treats your mind and eyes. It might never become as legendary as its predecessor, but definitely one of the finest pieces of the genre in recent years.",Blade Runner 2049

One in particular with the guy running the orphanage is his coat which looks like it might have been a prop in the Oliver Twist movie, quietly giving this film a timeless quality. If it is intended, it is a little piece of genius and I find it hard to believe with Ridley Scott involved that it's an accident. I like the way Jared Letos voice echoes that of Tyrell in the first movie. Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss. It's bleak beyond description with none of the characters having too much to savour about life in 2049 including the mega rich Wallace who probably won't be happy with anything he can achieve. No doubt it will find cult status like the original because it takes concepts from the first and uses them extremely well with minor adjustments.

1798,ryanmccourt,Visually Spectacular and Artfully done,9,13 December 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 is a Sci-Fi thriller directed by Dennis Villeneuve. The movie is set in a dystopian Los Angeles in the year 2049 succeeding the events of the original Blade Runner (1982). The film features Ryan Gosling as ""Officer K"" a police officer and ""Blade Runner"" who's job is to find and destroy replicants (artificial humans). In his journey he discovers things about the world he lives in and himself that he could have never imagined. The film features a short spoken yet badass protagonist, spectacular visuals, and a compelling story that remains true to the original while being its own standalone film.I have seen the original Blade Runner only once in my life, and I didn't know what to expect coming into this movie. After watching it two times it has made me feel some type of way emotionally. i really like this film. Ryan Gosling kills it as ""Officer K"" a blade runner who is also a replicant himself. His main job as a blade runner is to kill off all remaining older model replicants who are dangerous and disobedient. Officer K does not talk much, and he does as hes told (at first). K has an artificial companion that goes by the name of ""Joi."" Joi interacts with K as if shes a completely sentient being. I think some of the most poignant moments in this film are the scenes where Officer K and Joi interact with each other. Even though they are not human they still possess the capability to act human and ""love"" so to say. Whenever Officer K is with Joi is really the only time he shows any human like emotion. The relationship between K and Joi really made me root for them, and care about them as characters. When it comes to danger Officer K is no stranger. In every altercation he gets in he appears to be very skilled in martial arts, and using a gun. He also appears to be very skilled in taking a beating as he is severely beaten many times throughout this movie. Officer K isn't just a brute though; even if he is a replicant programmed to do certain things he has the ability to think for himself, and put others before him. Unfortunately Officer K's intelligence and ability to question reality becomes his tragic flaw.The visuals...where do I even start? Amazing! Growing up CGI has always been a technology that has been widely used, and It's just something i'm used to seeing in virtually every movie. Having visual effects really wow me is very rare since it is so common. The visual effects in Blade Runner 2049 are beautiful! Every shot, and every sequence just seems so authentic. The visual perfection of this movie will engross you in whats going on for the entirety of this movie. From the opening shot, to the flight to LAPD, we as the audience can tell that Officer K is living in a dark and oppressive future. The common people live in close proximity in housing that looks reminiscent of the favelas in present day Brazil. The sun is never seen in the movie and it is always cloudy during the day, and pouring rain at night. The dark imagery combined with the neon lighting, and the cyberpunk soundtrack really evoked strong emotions in me. I was disgusted by the beauty of this terrible world.The visuals are great, and I believe the plot is great too. The main conflict of the movie is when Officer K and the LAPD find the remains of a deceased replicant that died by giving birth to a child. In the Blade Runner universe this is seemingly impossible since replicants are essentially just machines that have no ability to procreate. Officer K is sent on the mission to find this child before the main Antagonist ""Niander Wallace"" finds it. I like the mystery aspect of the plot it had me questioning who the child was. Was it Officer K? or was it somebody else? I can't go into much detail about it without spoiling it but I liked that Villeneuve didn't try to make it a big epic spectacle with a giant battle of replicants vs humans at the end. He kept it simple and thought provoking which I think is the route to go with this film without completely crapping on the original.I think Blade Runner 2049 in many ways is better than the original. It has all the right ingredients to make for an entertaining and beautiful film, and Villenueve uses those ingredients correctly. I never thought I would leave this movie in love with what I had just experienced. Blade Runner 2049 will make you reflect on your own self and the world you're living in, and what your world could be. This movie is not just for your average movie goer looking to get a little entertainment for the night, it is a long movie that requires a lot of thought and patience to understand. Overall I think this movie can be appreciated by those who love great cinema.",Blade Runner 2049

If it wasn't for the talented Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, I would give this movie the lowest rating possible. I tried desperately to be intrigued by the world of Blade Runner and the questions it posed, but the movie could not hold my interest. Blade Runner 2049 had the opportunity expand the fanbase for this genre of film, but unfortunately it fell way short. Too slow paced, too many elephant screams, not enough dialogue, and too long.

1800,stephen-12107,Watch this if you like to think,10,12 February 2021,"I just watched this again in 4K, after seeing the original in cinemas upon release. Blade Runner 2049 is simply one of the best films I have seen, from any genre. The story and script are fantastic, with acting performances to match, and the cinematography is simply stunning.A lot of people won't like this film because not everything is resolved nicely and ambiguity remains. It resists the urge of infantilisation that so many films, especially American it must be said, succumb. This disease infects the story, acting, action theatrics of so many films, that I wonder whether it is a symptom of larger societal ills.Gosling's performance is perfectly reserved because K is never at ease in his own 'skin' and is aware of his precarious position in human society. In this character, the film is saying something deeper about the place of minorities in society. The plight of the orphans left to scramble to survive in the scrap metal wastelands is another reminder. The hellish dystopia of LA life in a world living with the after effects of some ecological disaster is another visage that hits home.Anyway, there is no neat resolution in this film. Could there be another? Certainly there are enough threads on which to pull. I would love to see it, if we could find a script with sufficient depth and nuance, and of course a match for the incredible vision and direction of Denis Villeneuve.This is a complex film in which you must immerse yourself. It is not a film that offers vicarious and simplistic righting of wrongs. Captain America and Ironman don't shake hands at the end, no hard feelings.

The movie dragged on and on.The movie presented viewer with 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story, and not one memorable line. I felt like actors intentionally spoke very slow because they were paid by the minute. Gosling was good, but Harrison Ford was there for a paycheck. I doubt he put any effort. Do not know much about a soundtrack, other than it was booming in my head for another three hours ... i just wished to god ... please make it stop. This movie made the ""Suicide Squad"" look like a masterpiece. In my opinion they were just trying to ensure there is a material for the sequel/franchise, rather than telling the story.

1810,pjmontford,A great sequel,9,3 March 2018,"35 years on from it's predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 was never still a thought on anyone's mind. Well, okay, maybe die hard fans of the original but other than that pretty much nobody. It was a big risk for a project such as Blade Runner 2049 to happen, especially considering the audience and landscape of the film industry have changed a lot. I had never seen the original Blade runner before this was announced, but I was also instantly intrigued. It looked totally amazing. About 1 to half a year on and having seen the original film (What? You think I'm a scrub?) I went and saw the film. It was enthralling, great characters looked beautiful, and had a great story. It was a standout and maverick in the endless list of superhero movies (Which are still great) and the very safe, family friendly Star Wars films. I thought it would explode at the box office. How could no one not go and see this film? It had great critical reviews, great first opinions, and appealed to a large audience. But then, the box office figures were released. 33.8 million worldwide. To put that into comparison, Star Wars Rogue One made 1.056 billion worldwide not including toys and merchandise. That it a HUGE flop when a film has makes only about 17% back of its budget. But now, in retrospect, it makes sense. It was a film targeted at adults (and not something you could go see as a date-type of film like Deadpool or any comedy), it was risky, and it was too complicated for any normal human being. Sadly we live in a world where people do not want to think. They will take the nearest comedy or superhero movie that they can just enjoy themselves at. The films nominated for the Oscars are literally never even heard about till they get a nomination. It's sad to see a film so intricate and says something about humanity go to waste like that. That said, the cultural impact was significant and in the end, the best thing to have as a filmmaker is fans.So in conclusion. Go see Blade Runner 2049, watch the first film first of course.

It's exiting to see that there are still filmmakers that have both a unique style and the bravery to do something different. While Dennis Villeneuve doesn't have the most distinctive style, he still is one of the best directors working right now, making unique and interesting films that are pushed forward by stellar performances, and 2049 is no different. What Villeneuve does with the world of Blade Runner is expand the scope, and this pays off amazingly. The original Blade Runner (based on Philip K. Dick's book) is a movie that is flawed but still good, having an amazing production value and a world that feels realistic yet is brought down by a mediocre story and a bland main character. 2049 takes this elements and makes the better in almost every way, introducing a new main character that is both complex and interesting. Yet 2049 still has a pretty mediocre story, having a sub-plot at the end that has no real pay-off and some voice over that is there to spell things out for viewers even though it's pretty clear to begin with.
The movie has some cool symbolism with the character of Luv.
The movie also has what I consider to be, Harrison Ford's best performance yet, considering how mediocre he was in The force awakens.

Further, there are times where there is a french horn fanfare (synthesized) and it suggests some grand cinematic sequence. Instead we just get blared with french horn (synthesized). I had to turn down the volume to not annoyed.

1817,joshuagreenlanternbell,Dreamlike,10,7 December 2019,"This movie is essentially a big budget arthouse film. It is not a big budget 12-rated action film that is trying to set up a huge franchise with 38 sequels and spin-offs, with a vast dependence on visual effects, explosions and loud sound effects, stuff we've seen a gazillion times. This is a single film, rated 15, with one story and an awful lot of intelligence and creativity put into making it.
Denis Villeneuve might be one of my all time favourite directors. Before this he also directed Prisoners (one of my favourite films of the decade), Sicario and Arrival (both of which I love). His talent shines through in this masterfully crafted film where the editing is slow paced enough to allow us to soak up the beautiful cinematography from Roger Deakins (this guy has been nominated for thirteen Oscars without a SINGLE WIN, somebody give him one! Where are his memes???) and incredible production design and at same time enabling us to get invested in the suspense and drama of the various scenes that are shown. This slow pacing may turn some viewers off, but I honestly can't imagine this film without it. There were quite alot of scenes that felt very uncomfortable to look at but they were so beautifully shot that it was impossible to look away (as I said, don't go into this expecting a dumb fun film). The action sequences felt very well choreographed and a joy to watch.
The acting is really good. Ryan Gosling pulls off probably the best performance of his career in my opinion. His character is just one that is lacking in emotion but at the same you can decipher every single emotion his character is repressing. He even has one freak out scene that feels very genuine and intense in the levels of panic that he is displaying. Harrison Ford is also great, some of his line delivery is not Oscar worthy but I still like his performance because you can feel the pain that his character has experienced since the last film and his presence was called for. Jared Leto makes an interesting villain. He's not in the film for that long but I thought he left quite an impact.
The story and writing were also great. I was genuinely invested in the mystery that K had to go through and was curious as to where it would lead to with alot of drama and suspense occuring along the way. The story did a crazily good thing of making you believe that it is going to go down a cliched path but instead doing a complete 180 on that by adding an interesting twist. There was also a relationship that was shown between K and another character that I thought was excellently written and was helped brought to life with incredible visual effects.
Blade Runner 2049 is an incredible sequel that I am convinced is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It has perfect directing, writing, acting, visual effects, cinematography and production design. Do yourself a favour and give it a watch, I know that I am going to see it again..

1820,adamcarew,Dissappointing,1,29 July 2018,"For those who were spellbound the iconic Ridley Scott original with Harrison Ford about the distopean future set in ChinaTown and the monolthic headquaters of the Tyrell Corporation. Donot watch this film .... it has nothing of the originality, atmosphere or beauty of Blade Runner. The characterisation is weak compared to the amazing performances of the original with Ford as leading protagonist - Dekker...a blade runner forced back into work hunting down replicants (synthetic humans) with Rutger Heyer, Daryl Hannah and Sean Young as the key androids. The film also lacks the mesmerising and iconic 80s electronica score by Sakamoto ""Do androids dream of electric sheep?"" There is none of the Promethean like ending of the original between Hueyer and Tyrell .... between android and creator a metaphor perhaps borrowed from and explored by Mary Shelly's Frankenstein ....for Man's relationship with God.Disappointing Hollywood Remakes of successful films that cannot be improved are a colossal waste of money and usually end-up going pretty much straight to DVD, this is no remake and like the recent Star Wars sequals even contain Harrison Ford but films that attempt to add sequals or prequels to try and make successful movies into a franchise decades after the success of the original often suffer the same fate ......as the dreadful Star Wars prequels demonstrate. (One possible exception may be Mad Max Fury Road which although lacks the now aging Mel Gibson was always intended for release and is very much in the same vain as the original 80s trilogy, the Star Wars sequelswith their original (ageing) cast are also better than the prequals. If you have never seen either Blade Runner film watch the original then the sequel. The difference in quality is apparent.

1823,luanbum,Thank you for not screwing this up,10,1 March 2019,"At the time this movie was made there was so much pressure to conform to appease the PC mob. However it was made with little regard to the politics of the time.with that out of the way. I am not going to gush with fancy words but cut to the chase of what i wanted for this film.I wanted to experience the cold and harsh reality of what it would be like to be a slave among the so called creators that were extremely prejudiced of how insignificant i was. Ryan Gosling played that part so well. He was made out to be the killer of slaves and yet was also dead himself. If you look at his character you will see the apathy to his situation and just a glimmer of hope, but not enough to convince himself that the outcome for himself would be any different to that of his victims.In the end he makes the ultimate sacrifice to save (Harrison Ford) Deckard who also sacrificed everything to save his hybrid daughter, of whom is also not cleared of this sad state of affairs not least of which also contributes to creating memories for those of her kind in order to give them some small comfort in their misery.If you look at her situation, she is woman in a bubble, one that will most likely die from disease if she is exposed to the outside world, let alone produce offspring that will propagate the replicant species. the whole exercise is that of tragedy of visiting human beings darkest desires on a creation that only wishes to have what their creators take for granted, which is life, regardless of how short it may be.In all, a great experience and an extension to the original film.

The cinematography, colours, sound and theme grabbed you instantly. The movie had an abstract vibe throughout and never really calmed. In my opinion Ryan Gosling and sylvia hoeks performances were outstanding and were a joy to watch. There aren't many downsides to this film but there were some personal things I disagreed on. The film went for almost 3 hours long and for me it was just a tad to long. I understand the need for it to go for this long but I feel like 2:20 mins would have suited it better. The story line was sprawling and long and this is good in some cases but I was continually thinking about what was happening throughout the movie and getting a little lost. However a second watch of a once in 30 odd year movie like this won't go a miss. To wrap up my personal downsides and some people won't like me saying this but Harrison Ford really didn't do it for me this time round. It might be because he was just a little to commercial in a cast like this but however he needed to be in the film. Overall it was a fantastic movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.

I feel like I'm gonna be preaching to the choir a lot in this review because there isn't a lot I can say about this film that I haven't heard anyone else say about it already.The best thing about this film is it's director. Denis Villenueve has already proven himself, but he has made another visually breathtaking spectacle that has further reinforced my opinion of him as not only a director who can faithfully adapt a screenplay, but someone who can more-than-competently direct a film in general. Cinematographer Roger Deakins also deserves credit for every meticulously framed and shot sequence, as just about every location and set is beautiful and blends seamlessly with CGI. I also appreciated even the smallest visual details like the User Interfaces and the flying car technology in the world.The characters were fantastic and Ryan Gosling delivers such a complex and facinating performance. From a storytelling perspective, there is just so much to unpack in terms of the very real yet science-fiction future that is depicted, along with the very apparent but nonetheless compelling themes of replicants and what it means to be human.It is truly one of the best science-fiction films and sequels ever made that faithfully builds upon and thematically exapnds on it's predecessor.

1843,mgarcia-00100,An Astounding Sequel That I'm Reviewing A Few Years Later,10,4 November 2019,"Alright well I'll try not to babble on for too long and get to the point. The original Blade Runner film is important as well as iconic. It created a whole new genre and style for film. The movie, however, didn't receive much praise from critics and audience and performed poorly. I guess everyone thought it was going to be some epic space adventure flick instead of the slow paced, detective noir, and thought provoking film we received. Now of course I'm not saying that's a bad thing because those three things are reasons I absolutely enjoy the original Blade Runner. It's just that those three reasons and a few others are a reason it bombed at the box office only then gaining a cult following many years later. Now moving onto 2049, this film is close to perfect and extremely faithful to the original. The story, characters, dialogue, production design, visual effects, and especially cinematography all work so well and with eachother in this marvelous film. It's slow paced but had me hooked and takes its time telling the story. The idea of the future was dark, gritty, and realistic. It brings more to the table about what makes us human from the original. There were no characters that I felt were weak with each person playing them bringing their ""A"" game including Harrison Ford unexpectedly. The dialogue was very well written along with some memorable lines that stick with me. Roger Deakin's cinematography along with the production design and visual effects were just completely jawdropping and flawless. I could not explain on how it made me feel but it was probably the most immersive experience I've had ever since the original Blade Runner. This whole movie is therapy to me. Whenever I feel stressed or anxious, I just turn 2049 on and get sucked into the dark but calming universe. This film is probably the reason I'm more interested in filmmaking more than ever. Now I know I didn't explain and delve deep into the film but I wanted you to be surprised and experience it yourself. This entire movie inspires me to create something I'm passionate about. The director, Denis Villeneuve is extremely talented and obviously puts a lot of effort, passion, and care into the movies he creates and I can't wait to see more from him including his adaption of Dune. As we reach the conclusion, Blade Runner 2049 is nothing short of a masterpiece and I highly recommend it if you're into slow paced movies that require you to think.",Blade Runner 2049

1848,jwalkerharrison,A deep introspection on the state of humanity,9,13 April 2020,"Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of cinema. A rare film that brings together all the uncertain elements of filmmaking into a cohesive whole, that leaves you in wonder of the artistry, satisfied by the story and deeply reflective on questions that we ask ourselves in the dead of night; what is it to be human?FYI, there will be spoilers, so if you want to watch the film, I'd recommend you do that before reading further.Set in a dystopian future where humanity is at its lowest depravity, the environment is destroyed and a rich few seem to have it all (not relatable at all), it follows the story of a synthetic Blade Runner - an assassin who specifically targets rogue robots - who uncovers a miracle: a robot who was born and not made. K, the Blade Runner, is put on a mission to find and destroy (or 'retire') this child to avert a possible uprising from robots around the world who are led to believe that they are soulless and lesser than humans. Everything that K discovers leads him to believe that he is this miraculous child, a discovery that seems to frighten him but also confirm something that he's always felt. This is until he is told that the child was female. The revelation that he is not 'the one' or the miracle crushes him. He had started to believe that he was equal to humanity, that he was real, that possibly, he had a soul. To compound his state of desolation, at this point in the story he had lost everything; his job, his place in society and the woman he loved. He had every excuse to fall into despair and anger, but he chose something that demonstrated his humanity in a way that being 'the one' never could: he chose to act on what he felt was true. He chose. The most significant ability granted to humanity, the ability of free-will.The movie brilliantly exposes how we measure and judge who we are 'humane' with, what love is and how someone who is seemingly an average 'Joe', the name he adopted once he thought he was a real person, can make grand choices that align to what you feel rather that what you're told you are. This film is a beautiful philosophical and scientific exploration of the human condition and I give it full credit for what it achieves. However, there is an aspect to humanity that the filmmakers flirted with, but didn't quite have the courage to explore: soul.There are a few brief lines in the movie that referenced the main difference between machine and human as one having a soul while the other doesn't. They are throwaway lines however, dismissing this connection to something greater. Which isn't a critique. This is reflective of humanity. We do dismiss this connection to something greater. However, what the film fails to achieve is to impart a sense of what this aspect of our being really is and how it's impulse supports us to choose what is truly good in our world. Instead, you are imparted with the same emotional attachments that are always delivered through an artistic medium. That we all fight and crave for something real and we'll do whatever it takes to satisfy that need. That what we can feel emotionally is the greatest expression of being human, whereas the soul, the true embodiment of who we are, will deliver love and only love to everyone equally. It doesn't need any of that, for it is complete already and will only ever move for the purpose of all and never for itself.Despite this, the actions that K, or Joe, decides to make at the end is quite inspirational, and perhaps what is needed in our current paradigm. He doesn't align with the synthetic resistance, nor does he align to being less than human, but he aligns to what he feels is right because nothing else in his world does feel right. This is an important step in being human because by claiming what you know, feel and trust is true you start to build a greater foundation and strength in who you are and what you value. And if you don't do that, then what are you? A person programmed to be a robot.You won't leave the film feeling a fiery connection to yourself and to everyone in the world, in fact you feel a sort of masochistic indulgence in the consciousness of self sacrifice and the terrible state humanity is in. There is also a pervasive sexuality that I feel lowers it's quality and one scene is so viscerally horrifying towards women and their sacredness that I had to stop the movie for a moment. But despite that, it is a worthwhile film with glimmering impresses of wisdom speckled throughout, that a discerning viewer may start questioning the way things are and whether or not they have to be that way.",Blade Runner 2049
1849,benjamin-pierce,"Fine use of spectacle to tell a moving, powerful tale",8,21 October 2017,"Blown away on the level of spectacle and archetype..for perspective, at the previews featured the Last Jedi, Pacific Rim, Thor: Ragnarok, Justice League, and Only The Brave....this is different. Dennis Villenueve understands panorama, and is willing to use it for grim realism and urban-blight engulfment rather than just flash and overwhelm--he has that too...he is very often slow where others are fast--and he still understands wonder. Yet there is more--he has wedded spectacle to narrative and theme as no-one has in decades. I have always counted Lucas something of a failure in that regard. The story and dialogue? he knows how to use pauses, replies that only partly nine up, scraps of information as opposed to extensive speeches by the villain/boss/key witness---he works with fragments and they add up as gears could not have done--and that is critical in this story. He has preserved the sense of shell-shock that Ridley Scott brought to the original Blade-Runner with such effect. He doesn't just bring you along as the story advances: he brings you deeper-in. Then, the ending is a perfect result, a sudden integration of what has been put together from the pieces of a broken world. Also, see if you can catch the few but useful literary references-- just enough, applied like table-salt, not a main ingredient...",Blade Runner 2049

1852,N6MAA10816,SciFi Channel movie - not a Blade Runner sequel,1,6 July 2020,"This movie was painful. Blade Runner was brilliantly directed and beautifully produced. It was groundbreaking in it's visuals that still hold up even today, which says a lot. There was something amazingly immerse about it, but this sequel could not capture that at all, not even a little. The sequel is poorly directed, editing is terrible and acting subpar. Everyone was horribly miscast. The script was also terrible. It felt like a SCI FI channel movie.
I won't even get into how wrong the main storyline even was as a follow up to original. But I will say some things here and try to edit myself. The CG with Rachel was unnecessary. It seemed they only did it because technically they wanted to. It felt awkward and forced. They tried way too hard to make those Jared Leto scenes profound and it fell embarrassingly flat.
The whole side story about Joi the ""girlfriend"" sidekick was ridiculous and was absolutely superfluous to the story. It was also simply obnoxious. I think this one element alone ruins it. Way too much time went into this. It could have been cut down to a quarter of what it turned out to be, and shortened the movie time. That said, had this movie not been a sequel to Blade Runner and simply explored a similar world with replicants and AR and left Blade Runner legacy out of it, fine. I might have given the movie a slightly higher score. But it messed with an already wonderful story and movie that now feels a bit sullied.",Blade Runner 2049

But with a fantastic and proven director attached and with the original director producing I decided to give it a shot. Of course the trailer blew my friends and I away with its stunning visuals but I remained hesitant. Once I saw the movie I went in expecting disappointment. Fortunately I was terribly wrong to be so worried! The movie was perfect. It had a compelling plot, creative story-telling, and beautiful sets and CGI.

1868,xzx_black,This movie dropped me on the floor,6,5 October 2017,"Everybody loves it. It got top ratings everywhere. Man was I disappointed. I fully blame the director for destroying what could've been a worthy sequel to the original Blade Runner, which is a piece of art. The movie is pretentious and tries so hard to be deeper than it is. It sounds like I'm just gonna trash this movie and I'm not. It has a lot going for it, especially in catching up from the original, since its been 30 years. The visuals and the sound design is amazing, the cinematography is top notch. But the storytelling... falls flat. For 97 percent of the movie you stare at Ryan Goslings face. I get it, chicks dig him, but I think his face burned into my eyes and not in a good way. He has the same acting skill as a milk carton and brought no emotion to the character. I guess you could argue, his acting fitted the bill but hey... no spoilers. The movie is extremely long and despite using the screen time it never has a climax. Like... a real one. Im such a huge fan of the original and it pains me to write this split review. I kinda wish this movie never saw the light of day, because once its seen it can never be unseen. Honestly I was just as disappointed when I saw ""The Arrival"" made by the same director, so I guess its his style. He certainly made this movie his own. I just wish he didn't have to take art and destroy it the way he does here. I guess people will praise him for this movie - cause now it can be seen by anyone... now Blade Runner finally became: mainstream.",Blade Runner 2049

Ryan Gosling's acting and the CGI was what made it this good.Only rating it so high for those two because they really made the movie worth watching considering how long it was. Ana de Armas also did a great job in portraying Joi.The plot could've been so much better, and the ending was absolutely atrocious. Like we follow a decently written character the whole time, only to make the child a character we barely saw anything of before? Excuse me?That was really a dick move. In all honesty, everyone could've been a better match for that. Even Luv in my view. Although ideally K should've been Rachael's kid, in my opinion. You can't give us a good main character then just throw him into trash for another character that we barely know anything about. That was really a poorly written ""plot twist"" whatever they wanna call it.",Blade Runner 2049
1877,peter-tillert,"hollow perfection, but still a lot of style",7,21 November 2017,"I could not agree more with the review of user ""stamboulopoulos"", who explains so aptly why the original ""Blade Runner"" is a rare jewel and why this sequel is ""a pleasant and perfectly constructed piece of nothing"". In spite of the truckload of 10-out-of-10-reviews that has been dumped on this film, neither does it's cluttered plot have any philosophical depth, nor was it a smart idea to cast Mr. ""La-La- Land"" as a tough guy. The only reason I am writing yet another review is that I believe ""stamboulopoulos"" has been way to harsh with this movie nevertheless: As a stylish piece of popcorn amusement, it works pretty well! Take the scene where a defective Elvis appears on stage while Gosling and Ford are fighting in the empty theater - completely useless for the story, but still really funny. In a way, this is typical for the whole movie: most of the time, what you see does not make much sense (however hard it pretends to do so!!), but it's still quite imaginative and visually impressive. At least they have blown up all that CGI money in a very aesthetic way, haven't they? 7/10 for an entertaining evening.",Blade Runner 2049
1878,kurtz182,Blade Runiner 2049 - Not what I expected,2,10 October 2017,"I'd call it ""Blade Ruiner 2049"" because the sequel ruins the mystique of the original movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high. In my opinion, the story-line of the original ""Blade Runner"" conceived by Philip B. Dick was far more compelling than the screenplay from which the sequel is based. Any attempt to build upon the original movie should have been considered sacred ground. And though the sequel did capture the original movie's cinematic ethos, the movie lacked substance and it all seemed too Hollywood. Maybe it was the numbingly slow development of an uninteresting story-line, too preoccupied on showcasing the juxtaposition of a decaying society supported by technological advancements. Maybe it was Ryan Gosling's lackluster and soulless performance. Or maybe it was the marketing ploy to unnecessarily include Deckard, Harrison Ford's character, when the movie could have gone in other much more compelling directions. All in all, I found myself hoping the movie would end halfway through it. So, if stunning visual effects is enough to keep you entertained for 2.75 hours, then see this movie. Otherwise, before you waste 2.75 hours in a theater, I suggest reading more reviews, and not just the ""dummy"" reviews the studio has managed to enter, but the authentic reviews of unbiased folks hoping to see a sequel worthy of its original.",Blade Runner 2049

1882,ignatiev-2,Slow is good,9,9 October 2017,I am impressed that they managed to get the feel of the original Blade Runner so well. Pros: - Took time to tell the story and get you feel the story. - There is no right or wrong just like in the original. Only questions placed and choices made - There is no real ending. Yes someone dies someone does not but there is no real ending left to it. It is more about the future endings it allows to happen. - Unbelievable cinematography and sense of pace. Plain beautiful Cons: - Not really clear why all is happening in the first place. I like the moral question in the original movie but find somewhat difficult understand what is the question here. Is it about androids being real people? Is it about them becoming human or actually not wanting to become human? - Honestly - should have killed Harrison Ford :-) Although he did play very well.,Blade Runner 2049

1892,griffin-842-821089,The Sci-Fi Movie We Deserve (But it's not for everyone),10,26 December 2017,"If you're worried about this being another Hollywood rehash of old material that ends up being a bad movie, this isn't; it's better than the original. It takes what made the original great, and improves on them. The visuals, atmosphere, effects and music is all stunning. Denis Villenueve is one of the best directors in Hollywood rn (Prisoners, Arrival). Ryan Gosling does a great job in his role; it may come off as stiff but after the very first scene you find out that the stiff performance makes sense. Harrison Ford comes into the movie after you get a lot of substance out of the story, so he only adds to the movie rather than being distracting because you've spent some time with the new story and characters. HOWEVER, this movie is not for everyone. If you're someone who likes a lot of schlock action movies and you expect a lot of action scenes, then you won't like this movie. The run time doesn't help either; I could imagine someone who wasn't as into the atmosphere of the movie as I was would have been very bored if they saw the movie. It's a sci-fi movie more like 2001 than Star Wars.This is a movie where the atmosphere, visuals, and music are what you need to focus on here; the plot is a fairly straightforward detective story.
 
Unlike the original, there isn't an awkward love plot between the detective and a robot, and Ryan Gosling actually does some investigating as a detective. The supporting cast around the two plays to the actors strengths; Robin Wright does her House of cards thing, Jared Leto plays the overly dramatic/full of himself inventor of the robots. The ones that really shine are the female leads; Ana de Armas plays Ryan Gosling's sweet companion, and Sylvia Hoeks honestly steals the show as the intense and determined worker for Jared Leto. The music fits the style of the famous score from the original, and after seeing it in the theater I would imagine it would sound great in a home theater. So if you wanna watch it l, I'd say keep in mind that the feel of the movie is the selling point.",Blade Runner 2049
1893,edwinknc,"Outstanding, long awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 original",10,26 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 - Arrival director Denis Villeneuve creates a lengthy,yet outstanding follow up to Ridley Scott's compelling sci- fi film noir.For those who have either never seen or, for a good while, haven't seen the original 1982 Blade Runner, it would behoove them to watch it and familiarize/ re-familiarize themselves with it. Sicario/Arrival helmer Denis Villeneuve has forged such a excellent, tightly connected sequel to Ridley Scott's enthralling, and futuristic sci-fi noir, that most elements will be foreign if you don't look back at what's happened before.Notwithstanding, after 35 years of near unbearable patience, the long awaited follow up to a film that has been called, the most compelling vision of the future ever created, has finally arrived. Blade Runner 2049 is thankfully, a direct sequel to it's illustrious predecessor, logically as well as creatively attached to the previous events of the early 80's innovative film.Thirty years following Rick Deckard's running off with Rachel, during the only hope filled, sunlit scene in the original Blade Runner, there obviously has been some considerable changes, in the City of Angels, and our world since then, whereas some have remained constant. Suitable title cards grant us a brief history so all can catch up with what has transpired, picking up in the 2020's up to the present year. This includes a devastating event called Blackout which completely paralyzes all of human society.Because of rebellious ""flaws"" in the Tyrell Corporations Nexus replicants, they eventually went bankrupt, and the company is taken over by blind industrialist Niandor Wallace (Jared Leto), riding in on a proverbial white horse to save the day. He is the brilliant creator of the new Nexus 9 model replicants who are remarkably more obedient than their dissident forebears - and still used for slave labor. His careful study of human history has reminded him that civilizations were built on the backs of slaves. Plus, as he soberly admits, he can only make so many.Naturally, some of the old Nexus 6, 7 and 8 skin jobs are still around, and as always, ""retired"" by Blade Runners like LAPD officer K (Ryan Gosling). During a retirement mission involving Guardians of the Galaxy's Dave Bautista as humble farmer Sapper Morton, he discovers a small metal box buried under the side of a tree by the replicant's house. Upon a thorough investigation he discovers information concerning a certain fellow Blade Runner and female Nexus 6 replicant from 30 years prior.The archaic data has such riveting implications, it eventually leads K to that certain fellow Blade Runner, namely Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard, to find concrete answers to something that could effect all of humanity- including replicants. Something no one, probably not even Dr. Tyrell, could have possibly conceived.Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (based on Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep), was definitely unlike any other film most, if not some, had ever seen, especially the opening fade in of a dark foreboding Los Angeles showcasing a stark array of austere buildings, and flames of fire literally shooting from the tops of incredibly tall skyscrapers. Cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner have perfect sc-fi noir chemistry in re- creating that same atmosphere,notwithstanding a few more hope filled, slightly subdued sunlit scenes to counterbalance the dark ones. Even Han Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's sterling score is evocative of Greek composer Vangelis's haunting music that perfectly melded with the film's disquieting resonance.While it's agreeable to see a fresh young, face, aggressively carrying out his duties of what is still called a Blade Runner, even after 30 years, the most provocative mainstay is definitely the return of Harrison Ford. 2049 simply could not have been done without him. It takes awhile within the 2 hour, 40 minute plus running time to finally re-introduce him to fans. But it's well worth the avid anticipation. Ford's Rick Deckard provides sufficient closure to a story fans have been waiting for since 1982.",Blade Runner 2049

The story-line toils to be consistent, the plot doesn't flow right and the original eerie atmosphere is lost to special effect grandiosity.

The human-like-cops- who-question-their- identity-theme was ingeniously conceived, matured to perfection and delivered at a six sigma standard by our Japanese friends in Ghost in the Shell movie, anime and manga (and a few other manga). Now in Blade Runner 2049, the Japanese characters of Katakana and Hiragana are seen throughout. The SIRI kinda computer talks back in Japanese. The billboards of LA are selling Japanese products.

I've been looking forward to Blade Runner 2049 since previews first came out. I in no way expected it to be comparable to the original, though, but I did expect it to be pretty good.The show had several interesting threads it was exploring but it didn't really go too deeply. The actors did a good job and the production value was great. I was quite disappointed with the pacing of the story, though. The movie was long! It had some pretty boring spots and just seemed to drag on and on at different points. I don't mind slower deliberate movies but this was excessive. It could have been edited down some to tighten up the pace. That is what I think was off - the pace.Beautiful visuals, though and I do recommend you see it. Just realize that it is very long and can be very slow moving.",Blade Runner 2049
1913,schorpitron,I've been waiting for scifi like this for so long,10,7 March 2018,"Honestly I love original movie. Cyberpunk with strong noir atmosphere, with existential questions and where the utopian future world is completely possible is for me like dream comes true. And this movie gives me the same feeling. Yeah It's a little bit different in atmosphere(which is still stunning and probably the most beautiful I have ever seen), but because it's throught perspective of different protagonist, I can take it. It's still the same world with overpopulation, poverty and where questions of who is and isn't alive being and what does it even mean to be alive go even further than in the original. For example the hologram Joi... I love that character. The story is completely new, touching and follows up perfectly previous movie. Only the ending somehow felt that there's gonna be sequel. And honestly when this movie came to the theatre I was skeptical and I didn't go to see it... God, I was foolish. This is Blade Runner!

1915,Fxdacosta-179-835659,It's not easy to create a masterpiece...,6,26 October 2017,"I just watched Blade Runner 2049, which left me a bit sad and disappointed. Yes it pales in comparison, even though in the surface, Denis Villeneuve did a reasonable job with the film.In the original Blade Runner, the story of Deckard is a mere decoy, a means to justify and support the tragedy of Roy Batty and his friends. The most powerful character is not Deckard but Roy Batty, the Nexus Replicant looking for his creator. Like a human being, he has unanswered questions (inception date, longevity, ) and is looking for meaning. He is a tragic hero. His identity is based on fake memories, and some real experiences, without which he has no way of understanding himself and the world. He fights not just for survival, but to grasp the why of his existence as a slave and to rejoin his creator, his ""father"". Like in the Oedipus myth, he ends up killing his father and while doing so, blinds him (whereas Oedipus blinds himself) - and there is a lot to be said about the eyes, and the giver of the light that comes through them... He knows then that his quest and desire of immortality is without hope, but during this process, he also becomes more human than Deckard (who himself might be a replicant - but that is left for interpretation). Roy is the real hero, the one with whom ultimately we can relate to. When he dies, the story is told. The dialogs are few, but meaningful, well written, and have a psycho-analytical reach (- ""I'll tell you about my mother""), a poetic tone ("" All those things will be gone, like tear drops in the rain""), and often serve to convey a philosophical meaning (-"" Is it a real owl?"" ).Most of the meaning is carried through the images, rich in allegories and symbolism: the diffuse lighting, the reflections on the walls, the giant images of virtual people on the streets, reminding one of Plato's cavern, and questioning the very essence of ""Reality"", (seen through our eyes, or remembered in our minds), and of our own nature. Yes Blade Runner 2049 steals from the first Blade Runner: the visual aspect, the characters, the symbols (horses, toys, unicorns, origamis, giant images in the streets, photos ). But what does it give in exchange or adds to it? Not much. A good Sci-Fi thriller I suppose, regretfully so far from the spirit of Philip K.Dick. Because what I really dislike the most, is that by adding to the original movie, Villeneuve diminishes it. By giving his own interpretation he steals what I had in my own mind, the many meanings and interpretations enabled by the questions intentionally left unanswered by its original creators. In the original and only Blade Runner, there is so much imagination, so much attention to detail, to the veracity of the characters and the depth of personal dilemmas, so many philosophical questions for the spectators to answer for themselves, acting like ""koans"" in their minds, so many symbols and literary references, that I consider Blade Runner a masterpiece. It is still my favourite movie, the one that left me a life lasting impression, and if anything, I suggest you watch it again to feel the difference.",Blade Runner 2049
1916,koukpan,Waste of time,1,17 October 2017,"Its completely waste of time. I can't believe who gives so good rating to this movie.

1918,divedarren,I want to love this so badly but it was painfully boring,5,6 October 2017,"To start off, this is a genuine review from a longtime fan of the original Blade Runner; Granted the original version (the Final Cut) had its slow moments, but by God, this made that 1982 version seem a lot faster. I will give you the bottomline first: It should NOT have been allowed to go on for 2hours and 45 mins, that killed it. Here are some thoughts after coming out of the cinema: 1. They forgot pacing, excitement and making a movie overall enjoyable. In fact it felt like a bunch of sci-fi hardcores made the movie for themselves without a care whether audiences would love it. And yes it runs almost 3 hours long (imagine the director's cut). I was struggling to stay awake within the first 30 minutes. 2. Yes it is filled with beautiful futuristic scenes and cutting edge special effects, but after the first hour of the same self-indulgent cinematography and no increase in the speed of suspense/excitement you'll be going ""for God's sake can you pick up the pace? Yes we know you love to show us your cyberpunk-whatever landscape, but enough already"" 3. This actually happened in the theatre: there were only 5 of us in the cinema. All five fell asleep! It became an impromptu slumber party. There was multiple snoring 4. Ryan Gosling is suitable for this role, because the bulk of the time he just stands or walks around veeeery slowly with a smug-sulk. In fact most of the characters seem to be either brooding for long periods at the camera or walking really slowly to fit the moody music. Must be difficult to walk fast in the future perhaps, gravity? The storyline is mildly decent, i won't reveal anything but it wont blow your mind either. Pity they had such a good thing but they got too self-carried away and let it drone endlessly like the barren landscapes in the movie. And this is coming from a Blade Runner die-hard",Blade Runner 2049

1920,hollabaughfilms,Excellent Film on its own and as a sequel,10,16 October 2017,"NO SPOILERS: As a stand alone film this film is exceptional, due to the fact that it does not rehash what we have seen or learned before, it is its own STORY yes in all caps. However that story includes characters from the original and themes, but what makes this work verses Star Wars 7 or The Last Jedi saga is that they retread the SAME story and THAT seems to be absent these days from good film; especially if you look at sequels in general, some are just so lazy they rehash the same storyline, characterization, plot points etc. in hopes to serve an agenda that would be better served by new characters and new heroes that are not retreads that destroy an original series characters arc, or story. SEE NEW Star Wars as an example of lazy storytelling. As a fan and person that loves science fiction, I appreciate what this film does, and it does it immaculately; It is an example of the power that science fiction can change, effect humans, and create a message that everyone can glean:What is that makes us all the same? Is it is our humanity? What does that mean anyway? See this film, reflect, and realize that a thousand lightsaber battles and prophecies, can never effect you like this.

1923,paul_allard,Half-hour too long and over loud music - even for a partially-deaf person,7,9 October 2017,"Just some criticisms Music far too loud, especially compared to the dialogue.

1925,psiidl-339-295159,Great artwork,10,11 October 2017,"Probably best serious movie of 2017.It has the tone of Mad Max: Fury Road with almost no sense of humor (until what Harrison said about vodka). The movie can be quite slow; in fact, I saw several people walked out of the theatre within first 30 minutes of the movie.But, the story line, cinematography, character explorations were just done superbly, and that's why I thought it was a great artwork. I only watched the original Blade Runner when I was a kid, and I didn't think it was that great. But, this Blade Runner was phenomenal; it really takes the viewers from day-to-day life to a future dystopian world (in a parallel universe where ATARI is still big, I guess there was a sense of humor in the movie beside Ford's remark after all) while asking a simple fundamental question; what is the meaning of being a human being.I wish the director toned down the music, however. It's too loud and it's the same familiar solemn tone music you hear in Arrival & Inception, and it's getting a bit boring. In fact, I think it did disservice to this amazing movie by overdoing it. (Yes, I get it that the theater has amazing speakers and sub-woofers)I guess theater owners may think you need this loud music to justify the high fees of IMAX, but the music was the only distraction for me.If you are a movie lover, I highly recommend this movie; but, be patient to really enjoy this one. At the end of the movie, I thought I was fortunate to experience this amazing human art. I would be surprised if the special effect guy does NOT get the academy award; it was amazing.",Blade Runner 2049
1926,markseeholzer,Blade Runner Review,10,6 October 2017,"To start this off honestly, when I first viewed the Blade Runner I was bored to death. I as also in high school and didn't really appreciate quality cinema/sci-fi. As I entered my mid 20's I revisited Blade Runner and fell in love with its Neon Noir and dystopian look.Blade Runner 2049 was breathtaking. The cast, the sets, the dialogue, the effects, the lighting, the cinematography - all of these elements were so meticulously crafted. The sequel stayed loyal to its predecessor. Denis Villeneuve is able to maintain the look, feel & tone of the original and builds upon the Blade Runner's central theme: what does it mean to be human. As far as Sci-Fi movies go, I really love that they didn't go overboard on the expositions - especially for a sequel. The movie utilizes brevity so elegantly. Every scene, every word of exchanged dialogue has a purpose.Great movie, even better film.",Blade Runner 2049
1927,mrcoftn,Easily in my top 5 favorite movies,10,24 October 2017,"My expectations for this movie were not all that high. I went to see a late showing in and empty, cheap, and rundown theater but instantly regretted it. Blade Runner 2049 deserves the best and I have already planned a second viewing in IMAX.The most outstanding work came from on the art direction. I fully expect this team of artists to earn Blade Runner 2049 a sizable collection of awards. The use of color is extraordinary and the sets are extremely well done. Much like how Mad Max: Fury Road gave the new generations a schema for the post apocalyptic landscape, Blade Runner 2049 defined what is Cyber punk. 2049 has all the advantages of 30 years of tech that gave the movie the ability to do things Ridley Scott could have only imagined in the 80s.The costume design was also spectacular. It's a tall order to try and portray the fashions of a retro-future, now-noir, and dystopian sci-fi film. Renée April stepped up to the challenge and delivered perfectly. Unlike most of the film the costumes had a muted palette but that didn't stop them from standing out in a film packed with exceptional aspects.Finally, the acting. There were no weak links in 2049. Everyone came out and delivered solid performances. The full cast did a great job of portraying the awkward and unsociable personalities of this dystopian world. While to me none of the performances stood above the rest I will note that Ryan Gosling was a perfect fit for the main character.In conclusion I would give this film a 9.8/10. Just to nitpick the sound effects at times felt a little overbearing and there was a single line I think didn't fit. Despite that it well earned the round up to 10/10. I can not recommend enough.",Blade Runner 2049
1928,jlljll,Truly a Masterpiece,9,2 July 2018,"I just saw this movie for the first time. I just want to encourage everyone who loved the accomplishment of the dark dystopian vision of Blade Runner, to experience this movie. I wasn't tuned in to the movie when it first came out and I'm sorry now. Part of my love of movies is too talk to like minded people who love the same genre as I do and experience it again and discover new things from those people. I think this movie is truly a Masterpiece of SciFi. It's so much darker even than the original. (It's literally so dark you need to shut off all your lights and close the shades to see a good portion of the movie. This will help to immerse you in this possible future World within the first few scenes.) It's even darker than the earlier movie with less hope than before. Humans seem fewer and the bright billboards and lit up cabs less. The lights in the apartment towers where people must live, are also fewer. Most of the frenetic activity of the underground where all sorts of transactions took place before seems muted. This World, at least for humans, seems to be winding down. The story of Earth has turned to the Replicants. I'm not going to repeat the plot, because if you haven't seen the movie and you are of a more ""realistic"", more melancholy bent than most of your friends, then you need to adopt this movie for your own and let it speak to you of loss, with perhaps, just a scintilla of hope.",Blade Runner 2049
1929,sergiumol,This was such a disappointment and disgust for me!,1,14 October 2017,"Standard disclaimer:I have not seen the original movie,so I comment based on the feelings and disgust,this movie provoked me.SPOILERS AHEADThis is the one most boring and stupid movies I have ever seen. Forget about the visuals, there is no substance to the plot and many of the scenes are so incredibly long and boring as hell.I literally felt like watching those Turkish soap operas that take an age just for a character to walk 10 meters and turn around.Why show so many static scenes that had too much drama for the emptiness of the plot that was unfolding.And the constant synthesizer blasting noise for every scene of f***g traveling in that city was plainly awful.You would expect some explosive actions in connection with those imposing sounds ,but no.It starts with the main character who kills in cold blood an ""android"" (who looks exactly like a human) that did nothing wrong and was minding his own business peacefully, just because he has to do it and I am supposed to feel for this serial killer for the rest of the movie, seriously?! In my opinion the normalization of murder,no matter the way it is disguised,present in these Hollywood movies,is one of the reasons of the mass crimes unfolding right now in USA.And you have no character development just some stupid revelations that take too long to happen and some gruesome scenes like when Wallace cuts the belly of that freshly born woman just so that she cannot procreate and leaves her bleeding on the floor.Don't even get me started on how they made Wallace look like Christ.This movie is just a satanic depiction of the director's evil imagination.Oh,and people say,""well the first movie was stellar and this is just a continuation of it"" .I get it but this does not make this movie any better and to show this kind of disgusting atrocities to fresh audience just to satisfy the old ""fans"" is just plainly wrong.I got out of the cinema cursing like hell.The ending is too abrupt, with the evil still being out there and the main character acting like nothing happened and that's it. There is no real revenge going on and no certain conclusion.I wish that after the self discovery of K ,he went after Wallace and reinstated order,with peace making between humans and androids,but instead he is just fine with killing Luv.I am not one of those action heads ,that dislikes everything else,but this movie is too much to bear in terms of pointless cruelty that does not go anywhere,for the whole 2.7 hours.I accentuate the fact that the visuals were amazing,even mind blowing ,but a film is more than that.There is nothing connecting you emotionally to the main character,so you would care about his faith,because he is just brainwashed evil to begin with.To sum it up, it was too much sterile gruesome violence and killings in cold blood, all shown in great landscapes and surroundings but nothing more.",Blade Runner 2049
1930,imdb-3720,"Visually pleasing, if you can stay awake",5,29 April 2018,"The visual scenes and CGI are by far the best thing this movie has to offer. Everything else falls short. It seems that 80% of the budget went into CGI, 19% into actor/actress salaries, and the remaining 1% went to music score (oh wait, did it even have any?) and script, logistics, licensing, and coffee and snacks combined.This creates two fundamental problems: 1) in order to enjoy the CGI and the visual scenes, you have to manage to stay awake and follow the dull, slow, and boring script. 2) The CGI at times seemed overly excessive and irrelevant and misguided use of the production budget.Perhaps it would have made sense to spent the money that was used to perfect some CGI bug that was on screen for less than 5 seconds into the script instead. While we are on the topic of budget, casting Gosling in the movie was a huge mistake. He plays the same exact super-awkward character he played in 'Drive (2011)' so much that initially I wondered whether this was a cross-over between 'Drive' and 'Blade Runner'.I would have given this movie 6 stars just because of the visuals and CGI, but I just had to take one star off to reflect just how dull and boring the movie was as a whole making the visuals not even worth it.",Blade Runner 2049

1936,irem-altan,The film by itself is beautiful but the story is unneeded,7,20 October 2017,"--- Contains spoilers about the prequel as well as the sequel ---I have always been a huge fan of the original Blade Runner movie, and how well it captures the themes of mortality, existence, (imperfect) human nature, etc. in such a concise and beautiful way. I also loved how differently the plot could be read. I'm not even getting into the ambiguity in whether Deckard was a replicant or not, but I really loved how difficult it was to read most characters' intentions and emotions. I feel that these ambiguities has been destroyed by the sequel. Other than being a very well directed and acted visual feast, this movie doesn't really add more to the philosophical discussion than the first one. It showcases Deckard to be some sort of a selfless visionary, which is in contrast with his questionable ethical choices in the prequel, and more so in the Philip K. Dick novel. I also didn't see the point of the scene where K talks to Gaff in a retirement home. Maybe they just wanted to honor Edward James Olmos.What I did love, however, was how that single piano note that was repeated all throughout the movie turned into the original Vangelis tune that accompanied Roy Batty's ""tears in rain"" monologue/poem at the very end, while K was dying. I also loved the visuals, despite the fact that the film certainly wasn't ""noir"" anymore. I love how Villeneuve builds up the tension in critical moments in the plot by having the character and/or the camera move very slowly into the point where something important is to be revealed. I also thought Ryan Gosling's delivery was on point -- he showed no emotion until the moment where he thought he realized he was the child who grew up in the orphanage and that the memory was originally his. As a long time fan of Harrison Ford, I was delighted to see once again so much emotion delivered without much dialogue but gestures and expressions.Overall, the movie by itself was really good, but I cannot help but wish that it was not a sequel, but an unrelated, standalone movie. But, if it *really* had to be done, I'm glad it was left in the hands of Denis Villeneuve.",Blade Runner 2049

Then, at the big dramatic moment, they learn they are robots. The man wants to know if he has a soul. His creator tells him to look inside himself and the man decides he does.

1938,springle-1,A Master Class if Film Making,10,10 September 2021,"Those of you who are expecting a space/science fiction action flick will likely be disappointed, but those that are interested in more of the hard core science fiction genre, those that can appreciate the quietness and build up of a slower pace, those that appreciate the multiple layered themes and character study, and what it means to be sentient or ""human"" will then appreciate this film.The execution of the film making is undeniably astonishing, even if you didn't particularly enjoy the film. You should be able to appreciate the effort and attention to detail that went into making this film. The production design, cinematography, soundtrack, acting, directing, costume design, CGI, ETC. Are pinnacles of film making. Unfortunately, many film audiences have become desensitized because of big budget, easily consumable block busters, and can't really tell the overly reliant CGI, by the numbers production, versus something that is truly a work of film art. Mad Max Fury Road is another film that comes to mind in this category.I am a huge fan of the original Blade Runner. The visuals and the world the film existing in, was just stunning and original. The movie itself suffered from some pacing and plot issues, but because it was so original, that could be overlooked. Now some movie-goers will have an issue with the slow pace of this sequel, but it does not have pacing issues. I don't think most even know what that means, but it is really the transition from scene to scene and how those scenes tells the story without it feeling the story has stalled. This movie is slower paced, but does not have any pacing issues. The movie is long, but if you are invested in the story, it doesn't feel long at all. I've seen plenty of 2 hour movies with pacing issues that makes the movie feel like 4 hours (like some Zach Snyder movies).I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but if you are so inclined to enjoy sci-fi movies like Arrival, Ex Machina, Ad Astra, ETC., then there is a very high chance you will greatly enjoy this movie.

The music and the attention played to the ambient noise was enough to make you cry. The story itself is fantastic. I just got done watching this and will watch it again later this week to see if I still feel the same. I walked away feeling engrossed in this world like a curious child looking up at the stars in amazement--it seemed obviously far away but somehow I felt like I was part of it.,Blade Runner 2049
1945,igor-lepcin,Everything. Happens. In. Half. A. Speed.,2,9 October 2017,"SPOILERS ALERT: The biggest difference between 1982 masterpiece and this one is that in the first film everything is happening at a normal speed. In original movie people talk like they talk in real life, their move at perfectly normal, every day, common speed, it doesn't take them forever to finish the sentence, or to shape out a thought, and yet... somehow it all works perfectly together.There's no way to know how will people (let alone robots) act or talk in thirty plus years, but if it is to be anything like in BR2049, I suspect it will be a pretty bleak and exhausting world.From the moment one, everybody talks, walks, plays, runs in some super-strange slow-mo: I'd say at 50% of the normal speed. It takes 10 seconds for poor Ryan Gosling only to take out something from his pocket. Not to say how long it takes him to walk through the scene - so much that half way through, let's say, the orphanage part, I have already forgotten what is he doing there in the first place.20 minutes into the movie, all I'm doing is wondering when this shot is going to end, when this scene is going to end, when the sequence will, and, ultimately, when the movie is going to end. This is not the way to pay a homage, to anybody or anything.There is a reason why the shots in ""2001 Odyssey..."" are that long, somebody should've warned the director about that. And there's also a reason why all shots in the original BR are that tight. And that's just one of the reasons to why both 2001 and BR are masterpieces. And for that same reason, BR2049 could that never be.You don't drag out every single aspect of the movie just to make it seem serious or pretend to be an artist, no. If you do, you get very expensive, anemic boredom. I have no idea why the director did it - he hasn't done it in that fairly fair movie with Hugh Jackman. What possessed him to do it here? Was it the importance of the first movie? Was it his fear to look like a schoolboy in front of the Master? Don't know, don't care.What a waste of great actors, class all - forcing them to engage in some sort of quasi elevated, quasi profound, but genuinely bizarre ballet that has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with the real life. The movie is three hours plus long only for the given reason - it would have been an hour shorter if had played out at normal pace.Oh - and to end here - the biggest dread of all: a hint of a possible franchise. Please, please, please people, for the love of all that's holly. Don't.",Blade Runner 2049
1946,r-godless,A true sequel so different but with the soul of the original,9,9 October 2017,"Unfortunately, there are enough people who really feel overwhelming joy that Blade Runner 2049 made a mediocre debut at the Box Office. It was almost a miracle that an R-Rates Sequel of one of the more niche Science- Fiction movies, with a run-time of over 160 minutes saw green-light from the Studio. Maybe it will be the last chance in many, many years to watch such an ambitious project again at the big screen. And Blade Runner 2049 is nothing but amazing when it comes to the visuals and the directing. Denis Villeneuve delivers one of his finest movies to date. Also, Blade Runner 2049 is his movie, his very own vision with his very own style of directing a movie. 2049 builds up on the Final Cut of the original movie from 1982, but please don't compare both movies with each other. Ridley Scott and Denis Villeneuve are two very different Directors. So, if you can shake off to compare every 2 minutes 2049 with the original, you will definitely enjoy a great Science-Fiction movie here.The long run-time may be a problem for the audience, maybe it's about 20- 30 minutes too long for modern cinema and it would have been better to save some of the scenes for a Director's Cut and trim a few scenes to made them a little shorter. A viewer who enjoyed the slow pacing of the original movie (like me) will probably absorb every minute of the sequel.The acting of Gossling and Ford was superb. It worked surprisingly well to include the character of Rick Deckard, which story I felt was always so complete, in the sequel. Ford wasn't bored like he was in Indiana Jones 4 and kinda lackluster in Episode VIII. In 2049, he enjoyed his part, which is ironic because the part of Rick Deckard was always the role which Ford had many problems with during the shoot of the original movie back in the 80's. Don't expect much screen time from neither Ford, Bautista or Leto. But they all played their parts so very well, I really enjoyed watching these guys. In the spotlight is Ryan Gossling who played the lonely and melancholic Blade Runner K. His part here is eerily similar to the nameless character he played in Drive. But don't judge his character in Blade Runner 2049 too early, there is a lot of development here.And yes, there is also a lot of Fanservice here for the folks who love the original. And it is indeed only Fanservice, not even once is Blade Runner 2049 copying stuff from the previous movie. Villeneuve made his homework not to do the same mistakes like Abrams did with Episode VIII.I could write a lot more here but let's face it, it would be too long and too boring to read. What you can enjoy here is a great Science-Fiction flick, maybe one of the best the past 20 years including Interstellar. It's not a movie made for a very wide audience, it is indeed hard to watch this without the knowledge of what happened in the original movie, and, yes, the run-time is a tad too long for the cinema. But if you let the movie do his job, you will be absorbed by it and I can guarantee, it is a journey, an odyssey you won't regret.",Blade Runner 2049
1947,nesoxy,pretentious or infantile!,2,11 January 2018,"The worst thing that can happen to a movie is to be pretentious or infantile. this movie is both. Scenario is such a garbage, There was a blackout and all the data was deleted but at once elvis dances. COMPLETE GARBAGE!",Blade Runner 2049
1948,tiinroof,A film to savour,9,8 June 2020,"When I first heard that a sequel to Blade Runner was being made, I kept my enthusiasm curbed. However as soon as Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director, I was cautiously excited as his previous work has shown him to be an intelligent film maker who doesn't talk down to his audience.
With Blade Runner 2049 he has delivered a thoughtful, brooding, immersive piece of cinema which treats its source material with reverence but isn't constrained by it. He gives the story and characters room to breathe which gives you time to take in this beautifully shot, sharply written and superbly acted film.
If you like your sci-fi to be intelligent and rich, you should enjoy this.",Blade Runner 2049
1949,Acerontis,A visual masterpiece that fails to engage,4,4 October 2017,"As a fan of Villeneuve, Deakins and most of the cast I was looking forward to this. Villeneuve repeats his style of slow-pan drawn-out tension, as he's accompanied by the majestic touches of Roger Deakins in completing the feel of each shot.We are drawn into the flawlessly created Blade Runner world, where we seek a story that will keep us on the edge of our seat, longing for more. Unfortunately, that just wasn't fulfilled. Any anticipation was lost in the pace.I cannot fault the world that was created, nor can I fault the plot which was solid enough. It's the pace of the film that loses some of the audience. In the cinema I was in the tension gave way to boredom for many viewers. A couple of people walked out about mid-way, whilst there was a restlessness about many who remained.For those who are determined to see this, strap in for a long, long ride. Try your very best to immerse yourself and enjoy the visual feast but don't expect the film to deliver on the hype of the trailer. It's a slow burn that isn't for everyone.",Blade Runner 2049
1950,nucomer,Gorgeous,9,18 October 2017,"Finally, it's something rare and unexpected. This slow-paced picture shows beautiful images all the way. It's marvelous even it's compared to the original. Cold / warm, light / shade... This is what movies and cinemas were created for. Acting is great. Sound design is exceptional too. Regarding the story - I'll make it short. It's subject is now more a disturbing reality than it was 25 years ago. Be prepared for a long journey that has it's flows yet still providing a shockingly fresh sequel. (Being an early 80's kid and seen every bit of big-budget stuff, I was looking for something similar when I went to see The Force Awakens).",Blade Runner 2049
1951,The_Blue_Spirit,The featured review does this amazing movie a disservice. This movie is the quintessential sci-fi film,10,13 November 2020,"This movie is rightfully considered a masterpiece; it does exactly what a sequel should do while still being unique. It builds upon the original without relying too heavily on the first installment of Blade Runner. Put aside the incredible aesthetics of the film for a moment: the award-winning visuals, the remarkable sound editing, and the stunning cinematography/directing. You still have the best science fiction film made this century.It is painful to see so many die-hard fans of the original have an idea built in their head of how their sequel should look and feel, so they ruin other viewer's perception of the film. This is one of the finest acted, most gripping and entertaining movies I have ever watched; and is the best movie I've seen in the last 20 years. The story is compelling yet haunting at the same time, it offers deeper philosophical questions than the original and explores them more thoroughly. This is not only how a sequel should be done, it sets the standard for how a movie should be done.Don't consider the negative reviews. Go into this with an open mind; even setting your expectations high this film will still blow you away if you understand and appreciate filmmaking.",Blade Runner 2049
1952,fnoyseth,A waste of time,2,9 October 2017,"Sorry, but I consider this movie a waste of time. Perhaps this says more about me than the movie, but what happens on the screen is not reachable for my logic to give the necessary meaning.

1954,verzet,"Unbelievable cinematography, incredible boring",7,23 October 2017,"Undoubtedly is Blade Runner (1982) my all time best movie, a real masterpiece which I gave a 10/10 score, the only movie I ever quoted that high at IMDb. What a disappointment to watch this sequel. Even Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets was less boring. Why for G'd s sake, the 75-year old Harrison Ford, who's career already ended about 20 years ago, had to play such a big sequence in this movie. Mainly for commercial reasons I guess. I don't get this one. With his role he probably damaged the concept of this movie more then any one else could do. Anyway, the cinematography, the music and the sound were excellent. I really love the sound of this movie. But never compare it with the music of Blade Runner (1982) made by Vangelis. Maybe, when I watch this movie a few times more, it will be better. But I am afraid that it won't change my first impression.Lucky me that Ridley Scott gave me so much more p.e. Prometheus, The Martian, American Gangster, Hannibal and the Alien movies. Thanks for that Ridley, you are my master of suspense, quality and entertainment.",Blade Runner 2049
1955,salsamancruz94,Still Controversial,10,11 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner was always a controversial film. Some saw it as a cinematic masterpiece while others didn't see the point of the film. Many years later, the original still brings in new fans whether it was because of hearing that there are 7 versions of the film, out of pure interest, or because of this new masterpiece.Blade Runner 2049 captures the same controversy as the original. Some people love and appreciate the dialogue, every pause, and the cinematography. Others feel the film drags.Blade Runner 2049 is not meant for everyone. It is a film that was made for people to think about, just as the original. Most people leave the film wondering what they just witnessed, and for some this becomes a fascination which makes the film great. Every time the film is watched there are new details your eyes and ears capture. This tends to grow into conversations on forums and Youtube comment sections. Then there are others who don't care and move on. AND THAT'S OK.I thought the film was mesmerizing from start to finish. Just the curiosity of seeing the next shot is something I haven't felt while watching a film in recent years. While the film is obviously meant to be artistic visually, it is the deeper meaning of each scene that boggles my mind.Blade Runner has always been a film ahead of it's time. It attempts to truly capture both your senses. Your eyes and ears are filled with unique sounds and visions that when blended, create a dynamic atmosphere.Some of the themes in the film that seem futuristic and sci-fi like will most likely become more relevant as we head into our future. When you go and see this film for the first time, just go in there and take in the view. Then go back and watch the film again looking for the details within each scene.I do warn casual film-goers that this is not your typical action flick, adventure flick, nor sci-fi flick. If you want to see that, Star Wars is coming out at the end of this year.",Blade Runner 2049

It feels like we're 30 years later from the first one, in everything from sound design to aesthetics it's just on point. It should be seen in cinemas if at all possible, this deserves the Big Screen. Every performance is above and beyond expectations, and besides maybe one or two things plot- wise and in one place it really feels like a scene was cut, I have no complaints. None of what made it through the cutting room is unnecessary, the movie may be long, but it never feels slow or bloated.",Blade Runner 2049

Sometimes these long moments are cool but other times it just makes the movie boring and hard to sit through. Nothing wrong with slow scenes if they are done right (see The Naked Island).The movie's music is sometimes too loud. It reminds me of the movie Interstellar. It's hard to appreciate certain scenes when the music is too loud. The music overall is okay.I enjoyed the science fiction elements in the movie. Also, I liked how there are multiple languages in the movie.Finally, I didn't like Ryan Gosling in this movie or La La Land. I didn't mind him in The Notebook.",Blade Runner 2049

Science fiction is supposed to make you wonder about complex settings with emotions you can relate to, such as love, loneliness and ""wanting to do the right thing"" (oddly enough, the last one is not easily seen in every human, and in the movie we experience this in non-human characters).

1963,silbran,Surprisingly boring,1,17 October 2017,I was very much looking forward to see Blade Runner 2049. It's such a cult film for many people my age and I thought you really can't do wrong with a story as interesting as this one. I just came home deeply disappointed. This movie is plain and simple boring. The visual elegance can't cover hollow dialogues and dramatic sound effects are not a replacement for actual drama going on. Some people left early and those who stayed until the end made it clear in comments after the film that they did not enjoy it. In certain moments one got a glimpse of how this film could have worked out much better if only the focus would have been on the relationship of the protagonists. But every time a bit of tension and honest interaction between characters took place it was washed away by cliché and stylized ambiance. This is an excellent case study for generations of story writers and directors in how to ruin a film.,Blade Runner 2049
1964,cybersten,Such a shame,4,22 April 2018,As a fan of the original I was expecting a lot but this seems to be a very forlorn homage; it tries too hard to be a cinematic success and yet mopes through the storyline which could easily have been an hour shorter.. and in an era of questions being raised over directors and their desires portrayed on film their are a couple of scenes which may raise concern. Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling are the only redeeming factor of otherwise a boring meander through a bleak dystopia..,Blade Runner 2049

Production design is great. It has a brain teasing plot and leaves you asking questions. But it is way too long.

And now the original is hailed as the greatest sci-fi film of all time and I feel the same is going on here. No giant plot holes as some have said in fact I think it's a solid sequel and good job on building it up into a 3rd movie. If your a true fan and not a band wagon prententious fan of the original then you will appreciate this movie. I thought it was great and also I thought the casting was great. Hope we don't wait 35 years for the finale.,Blade Runner 2049
1967,linguisttgw,As good or better than original,9,21 August 2018,"It's a long movie with a cerebral dialogue, but I cannot stop watching. The visuals and archaic technology references provide a typical blade runner backdrop, which is intriguing. The characters are well developed, and the dystopic theme follows suit perfectly with the original movie. The philosophical questions the movie ask are very appealing to a techie world on the brink of AI and quantum technology. The movie had a poor showing in the box office, but somehow I strongly feel it will have and enduring cult following. Gaff returns dropping some Hungarian (nyugdijes - retired). The more times I watch this movie, the more I see, and catch. The soundtrack is honestly (if this is possible) better than the Vangis one in the original. I know I am a BR fanatic so some may poo-poo this review, but this movie delivers a slow but intense plot build up - and has a better, more intense climax, with an ending that leaves one asking many questions (again). A truly inspiring, if not disturbing and intense sequel that truly delivers.",Blade Runner 2049
1968,jonathon-glickman76,Sci-fi Noir Masterpiece?,10,7 October 2017,"After over 30 years, we are finally transcended back to the world of Blade Runner. This will most likely be just as popular as it's predecessor in the fact that audiences will be split in opinion for this instant classic. The combination of beautiful direction from Denis Villeneuve and stunning visuals by Roger Deakins ensure that you are paying attention from the mirroring (and what some might say as copying) that the opening shot that the original Sci-fi Noir began with. Although we don't get all of the answers that we so desperately crave, it's safe to say that Villeneuve knew how to keep the audience suspended and craving more. Revelations made through out that were hidden from audiences in the marketing left genuine suspense and jaw- dropping moments from beginning to end.The cast of the film controlled every second of screen time they had, from Gosling's Oscar worthy and convincing attitude as we follow his pain through discovery and his fear through love as ""K"". Ford's best performance in years hiding his torment of the past as ""Deckard"" and Sylvia Hoek's fearful performance as ""Luv"", the lost angel forever craving approval from her God, Niander Wallace (Jared Leto).Yes the film may suffer from some overbearing and convoluted moments that perhaps could have been left out of the final draft, however Blade Runner 2049 will go down as one of the most successful sequels in film history. As the credits hit the screen, the first thought that hits you is that It will certainly be widely discussed for a long time and I'm pretty sure that the life of this film won't be getting lost in time.Will this be the only installment of the universe we receive or will Sony continue with the Replicant Revolution? I'm sure the Box Office numbers will play a huge part in that.",Blade Runner 2049

It had great acting, great directing, great cinematography, great visual effects and a breath taking score by Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch. The movie stay true to the original Blade Runner but at the same time stand out for it self. If you haven't seen the first one, it won't affect you, as the movie explains everything so the audience doesn't wander around in the middle of the movie. Denis Villeneuve surely does it again and delivers another masterpiece. Sorry to all the Sicario and Prisoners fans but I honestly believe this is the best collaboration between Villeneuve and Deakins. Is true that the movie can be consider a little bit slow but it compensates it by delivering one of the best shots cinema has seen. My last words are dedicated to entire cast and crew of Blade Runner 2049. I just want to thank you for delivering a movie that show us that there are still people who fight to keep great cinema alive. This is what real cinema is about.

1975,m-devitt,I need to feel for the characters,7,7 February 2018,"Please, no more 10/10 or 5/5 reviews for films that deliver something incredibly visual but forget the human factor. Blade runner of all films should not forget this. 
Over the years, we have grappled with the idea that we could somehow evolve from the joining of man and woman to something else. Something made in a factory or on a computer. As technology evolves and life becomes quicker and smaller, so the lines blur between what is real and what is fake, and on this score, this film scores very high. The idea of a computer generated intelligent holographic image has been done before but not as well as in this film. In fact, Ana De Armas does such an amazing job that she was the only character I really cared about. Sure, I somehow liked K, but there was nothing to make me really root for him apart from being chased by boys.So, as a story, and knowing H Ford was going to be appearing I waited. Sure enough, the fugitive appeared, rugged, unshaven and with a whisky loving dog! But, as much as I admire Harrison I felt I could have been watching Han Solo from 'The Force Awakens'. The writers didn't give him much to work with and I felt his character was wasted.I want to commend the makers of the film for the pacing and the visual and audio effects. I really believe that there was an enormous amount of care taken to immerse the audience in a rain soaked Californian 2049. However, character arcs and plotting need to not be signposted. I wanted to be surprised, moved, and thrilled. 
I felt nothing. Really, I didn't, but I cannot deny the detail in this film. The plot? Suspect. The script? Meh. The filmmaking. 10/10. Now go and snaffle Weiss and Benihof before they begin Star Wars and see if they can do any better?",Blade Runner 2049

Approximately 60 minutes of this were scenes of grey city rubble in a grey mist. This was contrasted with some 30 minutes of colorful holograms, including a one-""woman"" fashion show, a gigantic 'coca-cola' can plus other adds, female ""billboards"", sumptuous dinners disguising unpalatable meals, etc. Harrison Ford gets top billing and we get to see him for about 15 minutes at the end. Most ""humans"" are depicted as drug addicts or something equivalent.

The story is OK and the outcome leads you to think there will be a follow-on but getting there is just so tedious. it begins with lots of promise but after the first half hour loses its way and just rambles. The soundtrack is loud and uninteresting and sometimes drowns out the dialogue. Even the special effects aren't that spectacular. As to the violence - much is totally unnecessary (Ryan Goslng and Harrison Ford's characters' first meeting for example). As a BIG fan of the original - which itself was a slow-burner- I can't tell you how disappointed I am.

1979,rebjaynes,"very bad movie...violent, sexist, plot less, humorless",2,17 October 2017,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. 2 disclaimers-1) science fiction of this type is not my thing, and 2) I like intelligent films, or at least acceptably so, or clever. This film had no plot, and what it had was stupid. ""Let's name him Joe!"" As in GIJoe? Twice we heard the line - ""to die for one's beliefs is the most human thing"" - so suicide bombers are the most human? Getting smashed in the face left the hero without a mark, and getting stabbed didn't slow him down.. or was that because he wasn't human after all. Oh dear.Violence was supposed to keep us awake when the roaring music and car crashes didn't. The female 'characters' and women's portrayals were sexist stereotypes. Between crashes was boring too. Finally Harrison Ford appears - only to play a bit part and the ending made no sense - since the big-shots would have known it was the one they were looking for.Waay too long. So bad it was funny.",Blade Runner 2049
1980,kinodiversant,Worst movie in ages,1,8 October 2017,"I'm not sure, if the creators of this 2,5 hours long movie made it so boring on purpose, but is just terrible.The main character should have been played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, because he is like a terminator or he can join Justice league. He can be shot, hit multiple times with the knife and still swim like a dolphin and to kill people with face like he doesn't care. Actually, it looks like nobody bothers to make a any kind of dynamic in the movie after they made a decent trailer. All characters looks doomed, like the have absolutely no idea what to do. The whole movie is long long journey to moment at the end when main characters just stand beside the stairs for 5 minutes in silence, with terrible music at the background. I hope CGI artists got paid well, because the visuals was only good thing about this movie, and it's not because of nudity.I watched it in the movie theater and half of viewers were gone after first hour. The movie does not worth watching at all.Did anybody checked the movie before showing it in movie theaters? Does Warner Bros. have good editors and movie directors? I guess, not any more. They just want to pay for ratings and do trailers to get you spent money and time for raw product.",Blade Runner 2049

(not the typical ""mainstream / hype"" trending / action-superhero blockbusters type of movie)! futuristic, sci-fi, dystopian, deep, smart/thoughtful, philosophical, speculative, artistic, imaginative,...with many deeper meaningful layers & metaphors/symbolism...with a very unique & peculiar 'irony' & 'emptiness' feels & tones! heavily reminds me of ""The Matrix"" trilogy, the recent ""Ghost In The Shell"" earlier this year, which -again- have always been my favorite movie genre! will definitely watch it again for the second time (or perhaps even more)...because, for me personally,.it's really WORTH IT,.!",Blade Runner 2049
1983,tchou-tchou93,Breathtaking visuals & semi-boring characters,5,5 October 2017,"My first IMDb review (English is not my mother tongue).The BR2049 movie looks great sometimes but large parts of the film are shot on a gray foggy background which is way less visually interesting as the neon colors that come back a few times during the film. The opening shots are an almost shot-for-shot remake of the original which was fine by me. Los Angeles while expanded on compared to the previous movie, seemed less ""alive"" as in the original Blade Runner (remember that bicycles shot that last 35 seconds in BR 1982, that's how you set the mood of your city). Still, some places like the ""House"" of Jared Leto simply looked fantastic.Characters: Dave Bautista ""character"" while advertised as a main part of the plot is just there for the beginning of the film and I think it is a shame. He could have been a nice antagonist (the brutal warrior) to Gosling.The holographic woman was an intriguing character that leaves us with many questions ""Was she really in love with Ryan?"", or ""was she just programmed to be in love?"", ""Is she capable of real emotions?"".Ryan gosling is extremely low-key in this film, no funny lines, almost no dialogue, he doesn't seem to feel any pain at all when stabbed or shot at, which basically removes a lot of potential tension. Because he is so alien to us, it hard to follow him on his journey or to care about what he is going to discover.Jared Leto was the worst. He looks fine but does a lot of monologues that are not that smart or interesting. Plus as a character, he is not very threatening because he does not leave his factory once in the film.Harrison Ford had almost nothing to work with, he is found by Gosling after 2 hours and 15 minutes of film, they have a small fight, then Ford is captured and Gosling must save him. That's about it.Robin Wright had almost nothing to work with, except interacting with Gosling who's a robot following her orders. I don't remember her leaving the LAPD office once in the film. She was not threatening or smarter than anyone else.Sylvia Hoeks character, working for Leto, did a little bit more than Robin. Still, I believe she was a weak antagonist because she had no goal for herself, she was just the ""I-work-for-my-boss-and-do-what-he-wants-me-to-do"" kind of bad girl. She had no deeper connection / rivalry with Gosling or Ford.The main problem of the film is that it expands on parts of the original that were already not that great to begin with: The love story between Rachel and Deckard was always ambiguous and sometimes not romantic at all (like the ""sex scene"" which resembles more a rape than anything else). Bringing this element back and playing it like it was a ""true love"" relationship instead of a semi-abusive one does not work in BR2049.BR2049 uses too many ""zoom and enhance"" scenes that were already boring and confusing in the original Blade Runner. This time, it happens more often and it slows the already slow-paced movie down.Rachel is brought back for one scene of 30 seconds, the CG in my opinion looked great but it was again, a pointless call back to the original done tastelessly.They go so far as to play dialogues from the original, this time it has a purpose plot wise but again, distracting and maybe a bit forced.The film itself, like its predecessor, is extremely slow-paced, even the actions scenes are shot and played kind of realistically, no big explosions or big shoot-out. Villeneuve did that already in ""Sicario"" and it worked back then because the character were easier to relate to or intriguing and stakes were high. In this one, I would have appreciated a little bit more action scenes to be honest. Moreover, in ""Sicario"" or ""Prisoners"", the people in danger are humans, which means, a simple bullet or a simple stabbing can kill them, whereas, in BR2049, Ryan is a Replicant that appears to be immune to pain. Therefore a non-impressive (or non-over-the-top) action-scene might not work as well as it did in the previous movies because the sense of threat and danger regarding the life of our protagonist is not remotely there.The music, similar to the Vangelis theme but left me a bit cold, the original theme makes a nice comeback at the end of this movie whereas, during the rest of the film, just bits of it are played and the parts are, have been reworked to sound more electronic which is a detriment to the movie.I had high hopes and fears about BR2049. Hopes because the guys working on it (Villeneuve & Deakins) always deliver the most beautiful movies you can imagine. Anxieties because Blade Runner does not need a sequel, no matter who's doing it. Its story is self-contained, leaves a lot to interpretation and its open ending is just the perfect way to end the story of this ambiguous film. After watching this film, I was both right to have hopes and right to be anxious. The film is a mixed bag of breathtaking visuals and boring characters, lofty dialogue and average scenario. You should not make a movie that asks ""what does it mean to have a soul?"", ""what does it mean to be human?"", ""Can machines have emotions?"" if every one of your character acts and feels robotic, or at least feels flat and not that interesting.",Blade Runner 2049

Makes me wonder how it got the 8.7 on IMDb.The plot of the movie flows very very slowly. Action scenes are short, rare and poorly executed. The story is boring and not engaging.

1985,adamsmahan,Great visuals & great acting with a weak story.,5,16 October 2018,"I found this movie to be lacking the punch it needed to be worthy of the previous work and the immense acting talent it contained.
There seemed to be ""filler with the addition of an unnecessary supporting character that seems to pull you from the story, rather than color it. It requires too much suspension of disbelief and is astoundingly demanding of your ""movie reasoning."" It leaves the story incomplete with its failure to answer how. Plausibility seemed crucial to the plot and nothing was mentioned. Even in the realm of distant future sci-fi, where far fetched possibilities are more acceptable to an audience, a theory wasn't even mentioned.

1986,neyony345,Blade Runner Strikes Back,8,12 October 2017,"This is perhaps one of the best sequels to a sci-fi movie I have seen. In my experience, sequels rarely exceed the original, but this film does just that. That combination of great visual by Charlie Villeneuve and the exceedingly great casting and acting by Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Jared Let, and Sylvia Hoeks makes this film a must-watch not only for fans of sci-fi movies, but fans that love movies in general. The film is visually stunning, with great effects and cinematography that bring a dystopian Los Angeles to life on the screen. The story is amazing, and the audience is kept guessing throughout the movie. However, this movie is not without its shortcomings. In my opinion, the pacing was a bit slow to my taste and certain scenes throughout the movie were dragged out for a bit too long. However, these two shortcomings do not do anything do dampen the whole experience of the movie. If you are looking for a great action flick, look elsewhere. This film is a thought-provoking sci-fi film, and is a great break from all the action sci-fi flicks that have been released in the summer.",Blade Runner 2049

The movie's length beats the Bollywood movies. if you had a forward button, your hand wouldn't move out of that. The visuals are good but what good does it make if the story is as slow that you have to watch now and it would end only at 2049.

1989,GamingTatertot,Blade Runner 2049 breaks out and looks great,9,8 November 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 will go down in history as one of the best sequels of all-time. The best part about BR 2049 as a sequel is that it doesn't fall into the same trap as other sequels, that trap meaning bigger means better. Blade Runner 2049 serves as a perfect continuation of its predecessor applying the same themes and ideas along the same scope to create a good story. The story never loses sight of its true purpose: Officer K's identity crisis. Throughout the movie, Ryan Gosling meticulously crafts a subtle performance exhibiting the struggles of a replicant who believes their life may be a lie and later morphs that performance to exhibit the disappointment of a replicant who realizes they are, in fact, still just a replicant. Every little motion he gives feels real and the writing really lends itself to the character by showing that even though physically K is a replicant, emotionally and mentally he is not. He is human. And I think that's beautiful.",Blade Runner 2049
1990,robin-52-71038,Another hollow movie hidden behind effects.,3,6 October 2017,"Is the new Bladerunner a beautiful move? Yes! Does it have great sound effects and music? Yes! Does the movie lean on Ryan Goslings performance instead of developing the story. Oh, yes!While the new Bladerunner move might share some of the aesthetics with its prequel, the new movie lack any story or smartness. It's a boring movie for the VX junkies, replacing any invention or creativity with boring drama and long closeups of Ryan Goslings face. It almost fells like some screening group said, lets add more Ryan Gosling and some more Sony logos and we have a movie. It feels awkward, since Ryan does an exact copy of his performance in Drive, only this time for about 2 hours straight.The movie never gets interesting, exiting or even spawns any feelings inside the viewer. The characters never struggle and you never find yourself intrigued about how the movie will end. It's a boring 3 hour wait for a super obvious plot to unravel. Watching some car fly over the same cloudy city for the 10:th time get boring quick. The only light in the dark is Harrison Fords excellent contribution, which only is a minor part of the movie at the very end.The movie ends happily without any surprises and director Villeneuve can fall asleep at night knowing that no toes were trampled on and no angry mobs awoken.

1993,rpdrdrs,I left the theater disappointed....,10,13 October 2017,"....but then something magical happened. I don't think any other movie in the past had left me with such a strong after taste. I don't know why, but the themes started jumping out at me the next day, and I couldn't keep my mind off of it. My mind just started to involuntarily unpack all the themes and motifs that this movie had to offer, and even though it has been a week since I saw the movie, it still hasn't finished unpacking.I am learning everyday; people have been posting their interpretations of the movie on Reddit, YouTube, and other social media, and I am just falling in love with this movie the more I hear other people's opinions.I don't know why, but this is one of those rare movies that don't have an immediate impact on you, but eerily grows on you. For all you Blade Runner fans that left the theater rather disappointed, thinking ""What the heck did I watch? Why are people liking this shitty, pretentious art movie?"", just watch the movie at least 5 more times, like me. And watch it in a true IMAX experience, before it gets thrown out the theaters, which it probably will considering its poor box office receptions.I don't have to praise Deakins, his work in this movie speaks for itself, and he has already won an Oscar in my heart. This movie will likely sweep the technical categories. As for the ""real"" categories, I do hope it at least garners a nod for each Picture, Direction, Screenplay, and maybe, just maybe, Supporting Actor for Harrison Ford, because that man has real emotions to express in this movie, that somehow involuntarily transits onto the audience's faces too. Ford has finally made a comeback, and I hope the Academy acknowledges that.I hope Hampton Fancher finally gets a nod. He had been robbed of a nod in '83. His colleagues (Ridley Scott and David Peoples) each has at least one nod under their belts, so it is perhaps time for him too. He, in my opinion, is the master of philosophical dialogue.All in all, Blade Runner 2049 is like reading a novel of high literary significance, and I LOVED this movie. It is unfortunate that not many people are seeing it. Maybe it will become something better than a box office success - a cult classic.",Blade Runner 2049

As a huge fan of the original, in my humble opinion, Denis Villeneuve showed tremendous restraint in not turning the sequel into a messy, over the top, action-packed version of the original. Instead, it is likely the most aesthetically pleasing films you will have seen in a long long time, as well as a complex meditation on what it means to be human. Again, I am still processing BR2049, as I should be. The themes touched upon in the film are worthy of contemplation. It is a long film to be sure, but I was willing to put in the work, so no complaints from me there. Frankly, the film could have last 5 hours and I still would have watched it.",Blade Runner 2049

1997,cacatman-191-580194,Magnificent. Simply Magnificent!!,10,10 October 2017,"I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's 1982 epic masterpiece, Blade Runner. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say that although I've watched hundreds of movies, without doubt, it's my favourite movie of all time.So when they announced that they were producing Blade Runner 2, I was a little apprehensive, to say the least!! Were they going to reuse Harrison Ford, as a geriatric Blade Runner with a remote controlled walking frame or try to make you believe he still had the strength of a 20 yo, like in Indiana Jones - the Crystal Skull?In the lead up to the release of the film, producer Ridley Scott said that Harrison Ford described it as the ""the best script I've ever read"". Yeah. Exactly what I thought. A pretty big call.Just saw it yesterday. At the IMAX. In 3D. In Jordan (of all places).Wow! Just Wow!It's a tad over 2 hours 40 minutes, so make sure you don't drink too much before stepping into the cinema, because you don't want to have to make the choice between peeing in your drink container or missing 3 minutes of this incredible movie! It really is a whopper of a movie!Ridley Scott toyed around with a sequel shortly after the (delayed) success of Blade Runner, but never got round to making it. It was always on his radar, apparently. This time round, he came back as a producer, commissioning Denis Villenue (who did Sicario, Prisoners and Arrival) to shoot the film.Denis said this about the making the film, ""I know that every single fan will walk into the theater with a baseball bat. I'm aware of that and I respect that, and it's okay with me because it's art. Art is risk, and I have to take risks. It's gonna be the biggest risk of my life but I'm okay with that. For me it's very exciting... It's just so inspiring, I'm so inspired. I've been dreaming to do sci-fi since I was 10 years old, and I said 'no' to a lot of sequels. I couldn't say 'no' to Blade Runner 2049. I love it too much, so I said, 'Alright, I will do it and give everything I have to make it great.'"".He was right. Any hardcore fan was going to be watching carefully. Very carefully.Not only does it feature Harrison Ford, but it stars brooding young Blade Runner cop ""K"" (presumably after the late Philip K. Dick, the author of the original sci-fi story, upon which the original Blade Runner film was based) is played by Ryan Gosling along with Ana de Armas (""Joi"") and Sylvia Hoeks (""Luv""). Incredibly, there are cameos by Edward James Olmos (""Gaff"") (with a sentence or two of ""Cityspeak"", which EJO actually created himself as a blend of English, German, Japanese, Hungarian and Japanese) and also ____________ (at the end of the movie).The movie is set 30 years after the original Blade Runner. Eldon Tyrell is, of course, dead, and main bad guy behind the scenes is Jared Leto's character, Niander Wallace. Blade Runners are still around, but this time, they're out to hunt Nexus 8 models who were created to have a longer than 4 year lifespan that the Nexus 6 replicants had (in Blade Runner).True to the original, the cinematography is breathtaking, but the scenes aren't as dark and broody as the original. The CGI is incredible. Every scene is different and it seems clear that they've spent a lot of time thinking how a scene will be shot to bring out the perspective of the seemingly massive sets. As in the original, it is actually quite immersive.There's also some subtle and not so subtle homages to the original which are well documented elsewhere.Hans Zimmer along with Benjamin Wallfisch composed the electronic music score in a similar vein to Vangelis, but Vangelis still has the edge. The music seemed a little too refined compared to the grand opera statement that Vangelis makes.In terms of the plot, it's fantastic. I won't give anything away here, but to say that the incredible special effects don't overshadow the story line. The penny may drop earlier in the movie for some acute watchers, but it's still thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. It really is a detective film which does keep you guessing how things will pan out, nearly to the end.Weirdly enough, there seem to be some visual cues to Ridley Scott's Aliens movies, too. I guess it's not surprising, given the fact that Ridley Scott is the producer.Ryan Gosling was absolutely custom made for this role. The guy just looks fantastic in the overcoat and reminds me of a James Dean type character, but with a more sensitive edge to him.Harrison Ford is incredible as well, particularly in the interview at the end! I knew it was coming, but it was great how they incorporated him into the story.Well, it doesn't beat the original. But that's not to say it's bad. It still kills 99% of the films out there. And that, even as a sequel.Hope you get to enjoy the film as much as I did.",Blade Runner 2049

OK, bad to good - the worst thing I could say is that sometimes the dramatic pauses are a little too long. It can be a little long winded. Then again, sometimes the pauses, tho too slow, allow you to see the full scope of the 'stage'. WOW!
 Now on to the good! The plot is poignant and deep. Would humans bicker and kill one another when there is no work to be done and everyone is well fed. Would we fight one another for power when there is nothing to gain but power itself?

2000,pjpurcell01,In one word... meh.,6,10 October 2017,"In more than one word, it's OK, but not even a tiny bit more than OK. And it's way too long. And way too loud. Loud would be OK if the soundtrack weren't so grating and so obviously trying to make the audience feel interest, excitement, and dramatic tension that just is not there. But after a while, it makes you want to confess, if only they'll stop it. Ryan Gosling's performance is flat. If he wants to be a real boy, it doesn't show here. Harrison Ford has nothing to work with and he predictably manages to make nothing of it. Jared Leto is . . . well, he's Jared Leto, and if we ignore him, maybe he'll go away. Perhaps Shia LaBeouf could have done justice to Leto's role. After all, when the part calls for crazy, you might as well go to the source. The three women in the movie far outshine the three men: Robin Wright is totally believable as Gosling's tough LAPD boss. Ana de Armas makes you want to buy stock in whatever company is trying to invent A.I. girlfriends, and Sylvia Hoeks is pretty awesome as Gosling's chief nemesis; but even here, it has to be said that no one can touch Rutger Hauer in the role of Angry Android, or Rebellious Replicant, or whatever. As far as special effects go, you'd think that 35 years and umpteen generations of silicon chips later, that Blade Runner 2049 would knock the socks off Blade Runner (1982). It doesn't. Not a single ""wow"" moment in 160 long, long minutes. As for the plot, which focuses mainly on whether Gosling is or is not a replicant, if you don't figure it out before he does, then you can be sure you aren't one. And if you do, then you probably have a better screenplay than this one in you.Overall: Blade Runner (the original) is possibly the best sci-fi movie ever made - certainly in the top 5. ""2049"" is . . . forgettable. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6.",Blade Runner 2049
2001,rollergrl-205-675182,People who rated this under 6 is clearly delusional,8,11 January 2018,"I don't understand the reviews and people who complain about the fact that a great movie deserves good reviews. Forget the fact that this is a sequel to Blade Runner and watch it for what it is. Does this really deserve 1/10 as a large number of people here on the forums claims to be? Its just as delusional and idiotic as giving it a perfect 10/10. Make no mistake, you're just as bad, if not worse than these people. Give yourself a slap in the face and wake up, because you take yourselves and your hipster-like opinions far too seriously. If you're actually a fan of the original Blade Runner then that means you're well above 30 years old, and you still act like a bigot having a temper-tantrum like a spoiled teenager. Grow the f- up.Now for the movie. I felt that yes, at times, the score was a bit too overpowering, but it fit well with the dark and definite depressing world surrounding our main character. Its obvious that the world has changed a lot since the first, and thus the overall mood changes as well. This movie isn't really about Deckard or his lost child, its about the underlying truth of what humans are becoming or what we have become, and Joe/K is the representation of humanity's struggle to survive by basically cannibalising on each-others misfortune to raise above. Joe/K is struggling to fit in, struggling to be human while doing inhumane acts. We can see the difference whence he realizes that, yes, he might be worthy of love and can make a difference in the world - only to find out that he isn't special at all. The change in him has already occured however, and in the end his humanity causes him to sacrifice himself for the greater good, to become human.The visual effects of this movie is simply stunning. It reminded me a lot of The Fountain and sometimes Moon, which to me, has the best visual effects and sceneries I've ever seen in any movie. The mood and character of this world captures the audience attention, displaying a future that is very well likely to be our own if we continue down the path of greed we're on. The score is powerful and menacing, depressing and dark. Yes, it was sometimes overpowering, and could use a few different tunes, especially in the red light district to allow a different kind of mood to enhance the more important darker parts of the movie. The character's personalities, and development, were perfectly displayed by the actors, and Ryan Gosling probably made his best work to date. I understand the difficulties he must have had, to act out a character as dark and moody as Joe/K was throughout the movie. He perfected what his character was meant to be and I can honestly not think of anyone doing a better job at it. I loved Ana de Armas as Joi, she was a stunning little bright gem in an otherwise gloomy atmosphere. She made the movie, the character development of Joe/K believable. If not for her, it wouldn't have had the same impact. As for the rest, I've never really liked Jared Leto, especially not as the Joker. Maybe I'm bias, but I really tried to take him seriously as Wallace and failed. The character itself had little to no scenes that actually made any huge impact on me throughout the movie.Sylvia Hoeks as Luv outperformed Jared Leto with ease, and without her, Wallace would have been an even greater shade paler.But my favorite in this movie was actually the character with least screen time, and yet the most impact of the plot. Dave Bautista. In those few minutes in the beginning, he set the mood for the entire film, and actually sadden me at his death - despite him only being on screen for such a short period. That says a lot for a character and actor. To have that effect is very impressive for his short career in the industry. He especially helped build my feelings towards Joe/K - and realize how much he hated himself for continuously killing his own people without question.One character I actually enjoyed, and one of the few that made me laugh, was Doc Badger played by Barkhad Abdi. I could actually watch a movie entirely based on him and his pawn shop in the Blade Runner universe.As for Deckard and Harrison Ford. I can understand some of the criticism. It felt like he was a smudge underwhelming, as a former Blade Runner, he should've been able to handle himself a little better - even if the scenes he was in didn't allow him much room to do so. I did love his scenes with Joe/K though, as they made me laugh in an otherwise depressing post-apocalyptic atmosphere. I also understand that after what he's been through during the first movie. and the time after, that there's no wonder why he is a mere shadow of his old self.The realization of the fact that Joe/K was just another Joe/K made me cry. The ending, and his sacrifice to allow Deckard to meet his daughter, made me cry. Even though I wished the ending was a bit longer and more conclusive - I still liked it. And it made me want more from this universe and definitely Denis Villeneuve. I'd love to see him take care of any of the movies of the Alien franchise, replacing Ridley Scott - because he has without a single doubt lost his touch within that franschise. The recent prequals have no doubt been disappointing, but they've also sparked an interest in learning more about its lore, and definitely check out the original script of Prometheus - which is by far superior to the actual movie, which Damon Lindelof and Ridley Scott scrapped and tried to improve and failed.In the end I really liked Blade Runner 2049, because I believe we need darkness and depression in our lives just as much as the opposite.",Blade Runner 2049
2002,vladimir-brasil,80's violence,10,29 October 2017,"Blade Runner, the original, was conceived in the 80's. We are in the middle of the return of violence decades, between 1960-1990. Bronx in flames, rapes at Central Park, crack, together with another rights revolution, along with rock'n roll, hip hop, Stones, Woodstock, Hendrix.But, I repeat, all these revolution not without violence.And then we inherited all these masterpieces for humanity on screen.It's not just Blade Runner. Mad Max. What else?This end of the world perspectives, from within the epicenter of a degraded society back then, without any hope, created the best ""end-of- the-civilization"" movies.If 1992 started a seven year old consecutive reduction in every major crime stats, and today we no longer see that graffiti painted NY trains, nor L.A neighborhoods in fire, we can enter Mad Max 4 or, now, Blade Runner 2049, and artistically dress that 80's uniform, that way to see the world, and the future, overwhelmed by the talent of the carefully chosen director and, specially at this kind of movie, director of photography.Let's fully dive into this the 80's tunnel, to watch how would be the world, still we've had graffiti trains, fire, rapes everywhere, fear, wish to escape, pursuit of a (utopic?) paradise.Put on your 80's glasses to (what would have been) the future!",Blade Runner 2049

Sometimes way too loud and heavy handed. At moments the soundtrack tended to dominate a scene rather than enhance the experience.The movie is long but interestingly, not too long. The story moves apace and has enough twists to keep me from getting too comfortable. It left me with questions that i thought would be answered and answered some that I didn't know I had.

I also developed huge respect for Denis Villeneuve after seeing Sicario and Arrival. I wanted to max out the experience so I went straight for VIP seats in Dolby Atmos equipped cinema. I slept on my review.The bottom line for anyone eager to read the conclusion straight away is that 2049 is too-slow-too-artsy journey into a visually stunning, yet flat and inhuman Blade Runner-like world.The dynamics of all three reference movies (Blade Runner, Sicario and Arrival) is gone. You don't get bored, but on regular basis you keep thinking ""alright bro, just move it"". The sound is AMAZING, but as with the visuals, there are too many occasions when it becomes self-indulging and standing out of the overall experience.The plot - as I already mentioned, is rather flat. Not that it was dull or anything, just somehow uninteresting. The problem might be, there's not enough human (or rather humanly behaving) characters along the way. Maybe it's intentional, but the result is alienation and indifference to pretty much anything that happens along the way.Would I recommend seeing the movie in the cinema? I guess.

The transition from the original is seamless and unprecedented; despite the time that's passed both in and out of the movie it feels as if you're stepping in to their reality, something that feels both magical and close enough to our own to feel tangible. Really such a beautiful movie in every way. The soundtrack, cinematography, dialogue, direction, I literally couldn't criticize a single thing. I can't say enough, especially without eluding to the plot, but I wholeheartedly recommend this film; not just as an adequate sequel, but in my honest opinion, a movie that has surpassed the original. If you can, please go see it in the theater; it really amplifies the beautifully done atmosphere of this astounding movie.That said, fair warning to those with seizure disorders, you may want to consider waiting to view this at home. There is a scene in the movie that lasts... maybe five to ten minutes(?) that caused me to have two seizures.

There isn't enough space available for a more detailed look at this movie, so in short; awesome. Visually astounding. Art direction without equal. Immediate identifying with the lead protagonist Officer K (Ryan Gosling). I left the theater feeling like I just woke from a very intense emotional dream and needed a minute to clear my head. A day later, I have questions about certain realities (within the confines of the story) that I didn't have after seeing the first one. The soundtrack is re- worked Vangelis and used so much more effectively to help emphasize key moments throughout.

2010,georgecreese,An instant sci-fi classic!,7,23 October 2017,"This should be the standard for all big budget sequels. It impresses on every level - acting, cinematography, etc.I give this an 8 out of 10 because Denis Villeneuve has built upon, perfectly, what Ridley Scott originally had laid out. Ryan Gosling was a great choice to play 'K', he nails all aspects of the character. He is the archetypal hero during the film's action scenes, and he is also believable in the film's serious, more emotion based, scenes. This cinematography and colours of the film is nothing short of a spectacle. It's beautiful, despite some of the locations having a grimy, desolate feel, it looks great. Also, the film's story and writing is good too. They are nods, subtle and explicit, to the film's predecessor. Which, in the cinema, made me smile because I knew the film was in the right hands!Whilst seeing Blade Runner (1982) is an essential watch for any cinephile, it isn't imperative for a casual audience member, watching this film, but it certainly does help when it comes to the viewer's overall impact of the film on them.In the end, this film is great!

Maybe there would be a glow in the dust I don't know maybe not, was I asleep or awake right there - hard to tell. The film was terrorized by the myth of its predecessor and dared not do anything aside from throwing some shade with a shed load of dust and a thousand thousand yards of staring.They forgot the colour, not just in itself, not just in the monochrome vistas, but in terms of vivacity of the scenes, of peoples actions, and of their expressions which would have been a great counterbalance to many, many very slow scenes.",Blade Runner 2049

It was like a throwback to the worst of the 70's .Secondly ; Scott's original featured a meticulously constructed world / society where everything felt ""real"" because it had a reason for being that way . This movie , however , just seems to throw stuff in there to fill ( some ) of the plot holes or to reference the original and provide a feeling of familiarity .Thirdly ; a wiser person than I said "" a good film can't be too long and a bad film can never be too short "" . This film needs a much tighter edit . The original ( all versions ) came in at under 2 hours and still had plenty of time for lingering shots of owls , old photos , cities etc . Watching this movie felt like a chore at times.Finally ; Because I didn't want to write a review with spoilers I've not mentioned plot . I will say that the story is slight , as was the original's but it just feels as though the whole thing's there to provide an excuse for the movie to exist rather than having something profound to say about the nature of humanity .This movie left me feeling angry at a wasted opportunity , and then sad because I got angry and then sad because i was angry and sad etc",Blade Runner 2049

2019,ngwhengjhun,"An absolute spectacle to behold, and a monument for movies as a whole.",10,1 November 2018,"*Minor spoilers for Blade Runner 2049*From the cinematography and score, to the setting and subject matter - director Denis Villeneuve has crafted a masterpiece of cinema that has everything you could want perfectly fitted into a feature film, all converged and fused into fantastic cohesion. It is a brilliant marriage of existential themes and a hard-boiled detective story, strung along an uncompressed and provocative plot with nothing short of phenomenal production design (but honestly - just overall design).As a sequel, 2049 honours its predecessor with its preserved aesthetics, reminiscent score, and familiar themes. But not the point of over-saturation or excessive fan service that manifests into a larger and renamed Death Star. Instead it nurtures its retro-future environment to fruition that results in a gorgeous, complimentary, and immensely immersive work of art. Seriously, just thinking about it - the poetic divide between man, machine, and AI could not be better portrayed.The film enhances the franchise in every aspect imaginable and from every conceivable angle (like the leap from Nexus-6 to Nexus-9 models). Dampening the 35-year gap with the help of short prequels that don't necessarily spoil the film as much as build to it. Rolling out the carpet for Villeneuve's vision while bridging the story to newer horizons. Posing new ideas from classic notions left by the open-ended conclusion of the original (regardless of the many versions released for it).Nothing is wasted in the 163-minute runtime (though intimidating to consider). The plot absolutely blossoms without compromise, unfolding as though programmed and designed to serve a purpose as opposed to mere, convenient satisfaction. It's as though the film was produced after a graphic novel, yet paced like an engrossing book. Defining the anatomy of every scene with words in great detail, depth, and dynamism - while painting every sequence with careful contrasts of colour and composition.And when it comes to illustrating the hyper-concentrated world of Blade Runner 2049...(*exhales in awe)You just can't say enough to describe the genius of the film's visual storytelling. Utilised to accentuate - through the senses - a plot that investigates all that makes us 'human'. Pair that, with a contemporary score that reinvigorates the classic (and established) neo-noir tone of the original - and you're in for a palpable, tangible, and incredible viewing experience.A trait that I'm beginning to notice and appreciate from Villeneuve, is how he writes his characters as conduits to engage audiences. On top of the carefully crafted cast that brings the glowing, breathing world of 2049 to life, Ryan Gosling - like Emily Blunt's Kate Macer in Sicario (2015) - drives the narrative and places you right in the boots of Officer K. Achieving degrees of empathy and immersion beyond the recommended IMAX experience, while bringing together the pieces of the larger puzzle of 'what makes us human?'.In all honesty and all things considered - a film of this calibre only comes around as frequent as total solar eclipses (which average about once in a lifetime). And it is equally and truly as absolute.Just like the Voight Kampff test - you'll certainly have to ask the right questions regarding expectations on Blade Runner 2049.
If you won't catch the film for the absorbing and refreshing continuity, then indulge in the fantastic cyberpunk design that fills and encapsulates the world. If not for that, then marvel at the stimulating cinematic monument of every scene on display. Or go for a ride with Ryan Gosling in one of the best hard-boiled dystopian detective story cinema has to offer the generation.And if none of that entices you, then you may very well be a replicant

THAT movie, would have been it. With Messianic overtones, visuals so stunning, and volume so LOUD I had to put plugs in my ears, because it shook. THAT movie...was the closing chapter on it. AND!!! AND!!! The fact they had a minor visual reference to the movie ""Soldier"", and referenced plots from that movie? Beautifully done. And Robin Wright?

The original has become a cult classic and for good reason, it's intriguing and original. 2049 is not unlike its predecessor. That's not to say that it is a copy of the 1982 movie though. Many sequels simply rehash the first one (Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, etc), which isn't necessarily bad, just nothing new. Blade Runner 2049 ties-in to the original while giving us a new story.The score is transcending and the visuals are astonishing. Watch it at the theatre, you won't regret it.However, it is a slow movie. Well over 2 hours long, it's paced as was the original. So, if you're one for action, minimal talking and don't care too much for deeper meanings this might not be your kind of Sci-Fi film.The acting is superb and Gosling does a great job at portraying his character. I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything, but through facial expressions you know exactly what he's feeling, even if it's not exactly relatable. Harrison Ford is awesome as usual and all other supporting actors do a fine job as well.The movie had quite a few twists and I left feeling quite drained. It was inspiring.Just like the original, this one leaves you with a lot of questions and the androids are always a mystery. Do they have a soul? Are they really just machines? And do they dream of electric sheep? In a world where technology is becoming more and more advanced every day, and AI has already arrived, it makes you wonder about how close to reality it all is. The scary thing is that it could all be possible one day, in 30 years? Or in 100? No one really knows, but it won't fail to instil just a little technophobia in you.Watch it!",Blade Runner 2049

If the lead character K is a 'good' robot, designed to be 'nice,' then 'out' are the terse dialogues between Deckard, Gaff and Bryant. The lack of quality support actors that carried the original (Batty, Tyrell, JF Sebastian), makes Deckart's 2049 dog look like a hero.Many irrelevant echos and references to the original movie. Borderline cheesy. I appreciate 'Atari' as pun...A real story line is absent. Nor does the story get anywhere close to being thought provoking: 'artificial lifeforms shouldn't replicate'...really?Music: Vangelis' synthesizer music was 'state of the art' in 1982. Hans Zimmer's music, by contrast is dull...and loud....Summary: I wanted to like this movie. But instead, i found it bad, boring, uninspiring. IMDb's score for the original movie is 8.2.

From Harrison Ford to Ryan Gosling and from Rutger Hauer to Dave Bautista (!?!) is a long and disappointing way down. Ryan Gosling needs to learn his craft and pick up some acting skills; there's a huge difference between appearing in a movie and acting in a movie.

2030,ben-21631,"A long, confusing mess from a great, visionary director",5,8 October 2017,"Being a huge fan of Denis Villenueve's The Arrival, I was looking forward to Blade Runner 2049. It looked like it had all the makings for an amazing movie. That said, I feel like Villenueve was consumed by his gargantuan vision for the blade runner world. The heaviness of the atmosphere (from a combination of slow, dramatic dialogue and blaring Inception-esque music) prevented the pace from accelerating at any point during the movie, instead maintaining a constant trudge throughout and leaving the audience mired in perpetual confusion rather than a sense of immersion and discovery. This is in stark contrast to what he did in The Arrival where the audience is initially thrown clueless into the movie but learns things alongside the protagonist, constantly and actively piecing the plot together. The settings, though aesthetically beautiful and meticulously crafted, failed to meld into a singular, cohesive world. The characters were more or less thrust into visually jarring locations to exchange dialogue only to be quickly move to the next location as a means of progressing the complicated plot.",Blade Runner 2049

It was not a remake, nor was it trying to copy the darkness of the original. Instead a smoggy 2049 appeared, reminiscent of the feel of the original in a way that only paid homage, with music, sets, effects, costumes...I did not feel the length of the film. I was immersed in the story, and I feel that this movie can also stand on its own due to that story. The acting was superb - restrained, refined, and full of depth. This is not a superhero or action film, it is a thriller and mystery wrapped around a miracle. This will not appeal to everyone, whether fan of the original film or not.

The movie was a visual and audible spectacle despite its sharp and harsh tones and dreary dark settings. The plot was thick and rich, required real attention, and even a second look to really understand the depth of the story, largely due to jumps in chapter without the filler explanation material we normally receive. I loved the story so much, I bought and read the book, and then other Phillip K. Dick stories.Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel I have been hoping for since the end of the first story, this movie is unique as sequels go because it not only does justice to the original film, but to the book as well. The expansion on the story line is perfect, just unusual enough to fit the style of the original author, but not so much that it tries too hard. The plot is deep and follows the same style of the original, still offering plenty of surprises. The characters are true successors to the originals and the return of appropriately aged characters from the original film are on point and an integral part of the story line. There are a lot of negative comments about Ryan Gosling's performance, lacking emotion and style, but I believe that his character is exactly as dry and stoic as he is supposed to be in the dystopian future where he resides. The performance of all the actors and actresses was excellent and left nothing to be desired. This movie adequately answers many (but not all) questions that arose after the first, and effectively puts the story line to bed. There is not much of an opening for another sequel, so I genuinely hope that no one attempts it.To the naysayers of the film, the Blade Runner story is more than just a film, it travels much deeper into the writings of the original author, and to find films that truly project the style and vision of the author onto the screen is rare, but it happens here. I urge everyone to look at the film from a greater and more global view, with the book and two movies being equal parts of a whole experience. I for one, was thoroughly satisfied with the experience.",Blade Runner 2049
2033,trecarichi,Fantastic film. On par with and in many ways exceeds the original,9,5 October 2021,"Unlike many of the reviews on here this is a genuine review. This is a fantastic film for fans of sci fi and the original film. It clearly isn't for everyone as the original wasn't. The world building , visuals and music are all very well done. It carries the feeling of the original but takes character ideas in new direction and is very much a thinking persons film. It has some excellent action but isnt an action film.

You need to see this someplace where you can crank the sound with big sub woofers, along with a screen that does well with low light situations. The film is lit very darkly and the outdoor shots are often in rain or overcast skies. The director uses musical base notes to create a constant droning thunder that continues throughout the entire movie. This movie is worth seeing just for the cinematography alone. The story is great, but the movie is like a constantly changing work of art. It really is in a class of its own. I highly recommend it.",Blade Runner 2049

For those who are willing to let the film breathe, take in each moment and feel the perspective of each of these characters, you're in for something truly special.There are countless aspects I could praise, such as the legendary visuals and score. But what makes this film so important is the deep dive into asking what makes us human, and what that ultimately means. It tackles this critical issue while also warning us where we may end up: a cold, corporate dystopia where our dignity is stripped for profit and everyone yearns for something real.",Blade Runner 2049

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!1) The inciting incident of the whole story is agent K finding a date carved on a tree in a replicant's backyard. The same date appears in K's memory carved in a wooden horse. Basically, in order to mislead the police and hide Deckard's daughter, someone (WHO?) implanted her memory in a random replicant brain. That random replicant came to be agent K who, by coincidence, is ALSO a Blade Runner and is ALSO the guy that finds the carved tree. A bit of a stretch for anyone, innit? 2) The covenant of rebel replicants. Really? Is there anything more generic than a Matrix-like secret society that appears in one scene only with the only purpose of exposure? 3) What exactly is Mr. Wallace after? Isn't it just the same thing the Replicant Covenant *SIGH* and agent K want? Can't they team up instead kicking each other's ass for no reason?What I really, really loved is K, Joi and Luv. Beautiful characters built on very soft story grounds. And, naturally, when Villeneuve, Deakins and 300mil are put together, the eye is treated right.

It's great eye candy and true to the original in both look and feel but the lack of pace in the way the story is told is a let down. Not to mention the recent trend of trotting out the big star from the previous film towards the end to keep the audience in their seats.I've seen recently that a few films are tending towards this style, it almost reminds me of some manga type movies (casshern springs to mind) which had scenes loaded with hidden meaning and expected the audience know what was going on at the expense of pace and plot and spent over 2 hours to basically tell us war is hell. I wonder if it's a deliberate move to make sure it's appeals to the Asian market more to cover the budgets",Blade Runner 2049
2048,Andja014,"Visually and audibly superb, point missed",8,24 January 2018,"It really reminds you at times. Sounds, landscape, the whole concept of interrupting the dynamic with passive scene and well known music, the view of futuristic Los Angeles, holographic advertisement, japanese letters, millions of lights and reflectors on a giant building, vibrations and, of course, slowly floating flying car and the sight of a driver. Then you really feel it. And it's good that there are similarities and parallels: Mariette and Pris, that are almost the same person (almost), the eye opening at the beginning, telling the machine to zoom in the picture, the bizarre kiss of a creature and the creator et cetera - without all this this movie really shouldn't be called the sequel of the masterpiece from 1982.
However, although it's visually and audibly superb, it misses the point. Blade Runner is a story about humanity, dark and bizarre and beautiful. It poses so many questions. Stays unsolved. Unexplained. Abiguous. Blade Runner 2049 simplifies that whole concept. It states one problem and bases the whole fabula on it. The difference between humans and replicants in 2049 is biological, while the accent in the original is on empathy, on soul (read humanity). Give machine the ability to conclude, feel, the desire to live and it won't essentially be any different from a human being. Technology is the one that improves, replicant bodies are the ones that get perfected. Virus particles created by men reproduce by themselves. It's just the matter of time and technological progress when replicants will be albe to reproduce too. 
Biological predispositions are what makes us human beings. But savvy, emotions, empathy, soul - are what make us men and women, humane.
Blade Runner states that. Today, robot looks like a metal device, composed of cables and chips. Robot in Blade Runner looks like a human, made of organs and is identical in physical sense, but it has expiration date and doesn't sympathise. Robot in Blade Runner 2049 is brought to perfection, identical to a human, sympathetic, emotional, with normal lifespan and on it's way to be able to reproduce, although being made. Birth isn't something that would suddenly make it different from a human and change the whole concept. In that case, we are no loger talking about robots - but humans. Made, build, created, whatever, humans that, as such, will be able to give birth. And the only reason we aren't accepting that is because it means we are returning to chattel slavery system. Man want's a slave, a slave that's aware of its position and that's able to develop an opinion and feelings about it. Human slave. But man doesn't want to admit it.
This movie, techically, is fantastically done, but it lacks depth in fabula that the orignial one had. It also lacks complex and impressible characters whit whom the watcher can make an emotional bond.",Blade Runner 2049

OST is not as good as the first but still very good.The reproduction theme is extrapulated from myths of mesopotamia about The origins of human beings according to ancient Sumerian texts.Humans were created by gods, Initially human beings were unable to reproduce on their own, but were later modified with the help of Enki and Ninki. Thus, Adapa was created as a fully functional and independent human being. This 'modification' was done without the approval of Enki's brother, Enlil, and a conflict between the gods began. Enlil became the adversary of man, and the Sumerian tablet mentions that men served gods and went through much hardship and suffering.Adapa, with the help of Enki, ascended to Anu where he failed to answer a question about 'the bread and water of life'. Opinions vary on the similarities between this creation story and the biblical story of Adam and Eve in Eden.Similar to the first Blade Runner that features some conspiracy theorist elements like the masonic symbolism - Also containing Biblical (mythology) background, more precisely the man trying to reach the heavens with the Tower of Babel - This one story also features some conspiracy theorist elements of illuminati secret society.

There are scenes in the film that are so ambitious that you we need a director like velneuve and if someone else did it just wouldn't work but these scenes are all pulled off flawlessly. The score by Hans Zimmer as usual is fantastic but he really out does himself with a beautiful score.

A question that popped up in my head after viewing Blade Runner 2049 was, What does it mean to be human?William Shakespeare once said that ""The eyes are a window to your soul"", the movie's opening shot is of a blue eye with dead looking white eyelashes, which goes with the theme of living on without a soul. The main character K, played by Ryan Gosling, is an android who has no soul. Thus the two scenes where K, after a mission, is interrogated by a computer that performs a ""Post-Trauma Baseline Test"" where K has to respond to certain words. In around the 20 minute mark of the film, Lt. Joshi tells K that he has been getting on fine without a soul, finally K fails a ""Post-Trauma Baseline Test"" which is a turning point in the main character's quest for humanity.Another character named Joi, played by Ana de Armas, is a holographic partner to K. The audience sees their chemistry grow throughout the film, even leading to Joi's last words of ""I love you"" right before her untimely death. Afterwards in the film, K sees an advertisement for Joi and wonders if their love and emotion towards each other was ever real at all.Last but not least, Blade Runner 2049 was definitely worth the 35 year long wait. It explores themes such as quest for humanity and true love within the character development of K and Joi. Once you leave the theater, Blade Runner 2049 leaves the question in your head, What does it really mean to be human?",Blade Runner 2049

I've watched the classic 1982 version of Blade Runner countless times and it never fails to intrigue and excite, but Blade Runner 2049 is just awful in its completely scattered approach to making some kind of point, which is......? I'm still wondering. Quite a huge let down after all the hype, although Harrison and Ryan did fine, as always. If it were not for those two actors and the excellent visuals, I'd generously give it 4/10. Story-wise, doesn't even compare with the original.",Blade Runner 2049

If it matters, I haven't seen any of the original Blade Runner movies but I know the premise so I don't think it should affect my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of this movie. The movie just feels like it goes by a checklist of things to check off (formulaic) and lacks any real sense of dramatic tension or surprise. The pacing also feels needlessly slow and any tension or drama that was built up just fizzes away. I know Ryan Gosling is a replicant/robot but it's boring to watch someone who never changes his expression even once during the whole movie.

2067,Xalabarde,"Outstanding all around, except for the story.",7,15 October 2017,"The film does a great job in taking what made the original so iconic, expanding on it, reinventing it for the modern area and delivering a fresh new take on the universe. This is true for the production design and cinematography, which, although faithful to the original, it brings astonishing imagery. The directing and pacing was also refreshing, yet still very much in the same spirit as the original.It is therefore a bit disappointing that the script did not live up to the original and did not bring anything new to the table.A good place to start is actually the ending. The original delivers a powerful message in the last few minutes, with Hauer's character saving Ford's. It sums up very well what the movie is about. However, in 2049, the ending is somewhat meaningless, and Goslin's sacrifice seems unnecessary.The film in general seems to bring up a lot of ideas, but doesn't delve deeper into any of them. Leto's character presents a few interesting ideas about slavery, but they are never referenced again. In that same very first scene, Luv promises to be a deeper character, with a torn identity, but ends up falling into all the flat villainous tropes. It would have been extremely interesting to explore K's character as the real Child. Does he feel different to the others? Does he realize there is nothing special about him? What does he expect his duty to be? Instead all these questions are thrown away in exchange for a cheap plot twist, where the child is a secondary character with no heavy consequences.Furthermore, the film suffers from a thin blockbuster structure. How many times have we seen the ""Inglorious Bastards"" start? How many times have we seen the villain step on some object to kill the protagonist's love interest? How many times have we seen the villain leave the protagonist alive, assuming he'll die? Another clear example is when Rachel is shown. Instead of hiding her face in shadows and camera angles, which would have built tension and anxiety in the audience, instead Hollywood decides to show off their CGI technology, killing all drama with it. It lacks the complex story and innovative narration the first one had.Back in the day, I gave Mad Max: Fury Road a better rating than Blade Runner 2049, although the film probably suffers from an even faultier script. However, when watching the old Mad Max films, the story was never the outstanding bit - it was the action scenes, and Fury Road delivered. However, in the old Blade Runner, the story had a lot more significance, and although the new did a masterful job in the visual side (which is also one of the original film's strengths), it failed in the narrative.I hope Hollywood becomes a little braver with their storytelling so that it can match the daring of their groundbreaking visuals.",Blade Runner 2049
2068,mmarshman,"Absolutely stunning, this is cinema at its best!",10,28 October 2017,"There will be no spoilers in this review. The film is very easy to spoil so I will not mention the plot in any way. I came into 2049 obviously loving the original, like most people I wanted to see more of that amazing dystopian world created in the original. Story-wise I went in blind which I recommend everyone doing. I have now seen it three times in the cinema, so I feel like I can now give my thoughts on it.The world building is on a much larger scale in 2049, the original having small glimpses in comparison. There is much more detail on the state of the world and technological advancements.The plot is extremely engrossing from the start and it evolves in surprising ways throughout the film. If you like when a director treats the audience with respect and expects you to follow his narrative, you'll like the way Denis Villeneuve presents the story.I have to mention the cinematography, Roger Deakins has done something very special here. It's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen and there's no other cinematographer I would've rather had working on it. A true legend of cinematography!The soundtrack is very well done and suits the film very well. It isn't exactly the same as the originals soundtrack, some similarities but still very much it's own thing. Hans Zimmer is involved so expect some very epic music that makes your heart pump, but there is also some very beautiful quiet tracks. Another thing I like is that the movie has quiet moments, without the need for any music. In other words it doesn't overuse its music for every moment, which can be said for a lot of other soundtracks lately. I absolutely love the fact this movie was given a runtime of 2h 44m, oppose to a more ""audience friendly"" length. It shows that Denis doesn't care if the length puts off average moviegoers who are looking for a quick mindless action flick. The best directors of past and present (Nolan, Tarantino, Fincher, Coppola, Scorsese & Spielberg to name a few) all made their movies as long as they needed to be (usually well over the 2hr mark). This gives the movie time to show you the world, develop character and not have it feel rushed. Some average moviegoers might find this too long, a drag or slow paced though.If my overall thoughts aren't already clear by my rating, I think this film is as close to a masterpiece as you can get. No film is perfect but the real question is what is it to you? This is now one of my favourite films of all time, if not my favourite. I'm glad it's getting the recognition it deserves in its reviews. It's one of those films that I feel will be looked back as a Sci Fi/Cyberpunk classic, just like the original is.It is a amazing companion to the original (IMO a better overall film than the original), and it deserves a A+ or 10/10 from me.",Blade Runner 2049
2069,julesevangeline,I so don't care!!,2,28 January 2018,"What a waste of time! The original is a work of art, filled with rich and profound characters who you are emotionally invested in as opposed to characters who are trungent, boring and downright annoying. The storyline is messy and unsatisfying and loses the original Bladerunners potent analysis of what it is to be human. It is far too long and disappointingly dull. What a shame!

2070,jtkach,Villanueve sets a new standard,10,18 January 2018,"Before I say the things that I'm going to say, let me preface this with a SPOILER WARNING, and the fact that a 10 out of 10 legendary-class film is not necessarily perfect by any means. There is no perfect film, not even Citizen Kane or the recent Lady Bird. But in my personal opinion, with Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villanueve sets a new standard for modern film-making that MUST be seen to be believed.2049 follows the story of Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a Replicant (synthetic human bred for labor and obedience by the Wallace Corporation) who works for the LAPD as a Blade Runner, or Replicant hunter. The film opens with him tracking down a Replicant (Dave Bautista) which sets about a chain of events that shows that the predecessor to Wallace, Tyrell Corp, defied science and created a Replicant that could procreate with a human. The opening shots are some of the best cinematography of the decade, and it just improves from there. Ryan Gosling absolutely kills it in the lead role, even outshining veteran actors like Harrison Ford, who reprises his role from the original Blade Runner as Deckard. Deckard is disgruntled and in hiding, following the events of the first film and the death of his Replicant wife, Rachel, who gave birth to a human child. The writing in 2049 is truly impressive, relying heavily on Villanueve's style from Arrival of show-don't-tell. The story doesn't spoon-feed the plot, and has a twist that, although is more predictable than it would seem, is still fantastic and really drives the plot to an impressive and tense conclusion. The supporting cast is still incredibly strong, even with Gosling stealing the show. Jared Leto in the role of Wallace is a good villain, although cliche in some aspects. His method acting really shines through here, making him as believable as Gosling. Now, slight warning: most people will find this movie incredibly boring due to its slow pacing and complex storytelling. Unfortunately, the mass market appeal is not there for this film. The noir style film subgenre is one that is difficult for most people to follow attentively. I watched at least four or five people walk out of the theater out of boredom when I saw this on opening night. The movie's excessive use of nudity also can be a major turn-off to the conservative crowd. However, if you can approach the film with an objective mindset, keen on watching a complex story that will make you think, as well as see the best visuals in years, then see this film. 2049 has become my favorite film of all time, because of its impressive visuals, engaging story, fantastic actors, and master-class director, who has truly solidified himself as one of the greats. Between this and Arrival, Villanueve has brought back a style of storytelling that most won't understand, but those that do or make an effort to understand will find this film as legendary as I have.",Blade Runner 2049

The fact that it happens to be a sequel makes the achievement even sweeter. The film is stunningly beautiful, and the score left a mark on me I cannot shake. The film speaks to the power of the human spirit in a way I've never before experienced. It reminds us how special it is to be human, to have a conscience, and to love, even when these things are the source of so much pain and suffering.Hats off to the filmmakers.

The noir feeling, the dark and dirty city, the grey and black and dark colour scheme, and the beautiful cinematography all the way back in 1982 made me fall in love with the cyberpunk genre. Blade Runner kicked off this era in movies and led to many amazing dark Sci-Fi shows. Blade Runner 2049 took this even farther and was absolutely beautiful for a sequel. It compounded on the story, connected a whole lot of things in Blade Runner, and let us know what happened in this dark and dreary world. All of this movie was perfect. Every actor and actress performed flawlessly. The settings were believable and visually pleasing, and the themes and motifs were handled well without being heavy handed. There is a twist that I was entirely not expecting that threw me for a loop.If you listen to our podcast, you know we care mostly about the science. This movie actually had very good science in it.

A lot is at stake.So to say that ""Blade Runner 2049"" is very, very good, without quite being a masterpiece, is not faint praise.It certainly might have been a masterpiece, coming from the Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose ""Enemy"" deserves to be a cult classic, and whose ""Sicario"" and ""Arrival"" were among the very best movies of the last few years.Review Credit: http://wrestlingculture.com/2017/10/07/wwe-network- launching-new-documentary-series/",Blade Runner 2049

2091,skogsfaktor,A replicant of the first Blade Runner,6,6 October 2017,"After seeing the the sequel to the amazing and amazing first Blade Runner, i am not disappointed. But i am not impressed either. In summary, 2049 plays it's cards too close to the chest, but without the element of surprise or good main characters to back it up. So lets break this movie down shall we? Sound: 3/10 The sound is perfectly mixed.... and that's that. Otherwise it's like the new Doom soundtrack, just a bunch of bass rumbling around on top of old Vangelis lines(but probably without the vintage hardware). A few of the tracks are Psybient/Solar Fields like, which really fit into the scenes. But overall, its pretty uninspiring. Visuals: 7/10 The sets are amazing, but there is definitely something off. The first movie had some sets that were really realistic, which is what i think made the movie believable. There was dirt, glass, patches of color, mats, live candles. It is the same as the visual difference between Alien/Aliens and Prometheus, if that makes any sense. It is obvious that they tried to replicate the set pieces of the original, but it comes off as way, way to grandiose and large-scale. Pacing: 2/10 Horrible. Every scene is dragged out so long that you could walk out, cook some food and come back without missing a single important thing in the story. Sure, the first Blade Runner was slow, but it wasn't moving like a drugged sloth. To sum it up, they could have easily pushed the story into an hour long movie instead of three. Story: 4/10 This is really where they dropped the ball. The characters are so boring they might as well be extras, especially Deckers girlfriend. I didn't care about her at the start, and i didn't care about her when she died. Also, the main villain. I mean, really? What were they thinking? She is so one-dimensional, she might as well be played by Brian Thompson. And no, making her cry while she kills things does not make her more complex and believable. The villain in the first Blade Runner, played by Rutger Hauer, at least had a glowing personality. Also, some scenes and ideas are just there for shock value. You will know which ones they are. In summary: There is not one line or scene in the whole movie which is even close to the quality of the monologue at the end of the first movie.",Blade Runner 2049
2092,csimps-00065,The Best Sequel of all Time...,10,6 October 2017,"To call this the best sequel of all time may sound a bit too hasty. It is October 7th, and the movie came out yesterday. However, after viewing this movie TWICE within that time frame, I can safely say that Blade Runner: 2049 is my favorite sequel of all time. Is it my favorite movie of all time? We'll see.To avoid any spoilers, I really just want to talk about perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie, besides plot: the cinematography. Holy cow, does Roger Deakins deliver with his photographing skills. I couldn't name a single shot in the film that you wouldn't want to hang up on a wall. From filthy streets to smoggy skylines, audiences feel immediately in awe of Ridley Scott's dystopian hellscape. Not only are these features inspiring, but they are also incredibly immersive. Perhaps more than the first film, you feel like every bystander and every individual in the movie has some unique personality and history. Numerous long takes pan throughout, and viewers have plenty of time to soak in the admittedly emotional scenes throughout. Impatient viewers be warned: this film is slow and contemplative, just like the original. Those who readily watch the film, however, will surely be rewarded.I could go on and on about other aspects. The soundtrack. It's different. It's not Vangelis. Hans Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch deliver an original, emotional, and powerful score that coincides with much of the equally powerful ambiance. I could talk about editing too, though, the long takes reduce that tactics necessity a bit. This isn't an action film, at least a ""traditional"" one. With takes lasting upwards of what seems like ten seconds each (with exceptions, of course), scenes play out with limited cutting. You won't have trouble taking everything in setting and props. In fact, paying attention to these things is crucial to understanding the film. Villeneuve won't hold your hand, but he certainly won't make it difficult to follow, either.",Blade Runner 2049
2093,merealllison,So much yet so little.,7,8 October 2017,"I don't hate this movie, but it was definitely a letdown. For a movie that was as long as this was, I expected to get so much more out of it. First I want to start out with the setting. The graphics are wonderful and I credit everybody who worked on making it so. It's not the classic look from the 80's, but it definitely sucks you into a foreign world. Second, the whole android/replicant love thing was a bit overdone, but I understand why it was included. We are seeing Blade Runner from a replicant's point of view, and this shows how lonely replicants are, and their loneliness is actually touched on in the book a little, so not bad on that part. Third, animals were briefly referenced in the part where K gets his wooden horse analyzed by some black market dealer of some sort. After finding out it is real wood, the dealer offers K a real animal. This is definitely a reference to the book being that animals were very valuable in this universe. I liked how they explored K's journey to becoming more ""aware"" sort of, and discovering a humanity he didn't think he had. I loved the acting of Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Edward James Olmos. The rest, however, was lacking and didn't feel genuine at all. The bad guy in this movie was some strange guy that made replicants. Nothing like Tyrell, who actually felt legitimate and somewhat meaningful. His sidekick android was annoying and not needed. The whole android rebellion thing was a step farther than they should have gone and the whole replicants getting pregnant was kind of a weak plot to follow and wasn't very interesting. It blurred what was real and not real, which was cool, but that is all it did. I feel like if the movie focused more on K's journey to finding some sort of humanity, and left out a lot of the junk (replicant pregnancy, weak and lacking enemies) this could have been more profound and meaningful.",Blade Runner 2049
2094,bigdrax,Don't watch this film watch the original Blade runner,3,7 October 2017,"It seemed almost perfect with 3 actors reprising thier roles and Denis Villeneuve directing. I was more hyped for this film than any movie in 2017, and when I saw the reviews I thought it would be great, too bad I was wrong. In its overlong run time it doesn't even come close to capturing the experience of watching the original blade runner.The visuals aren't half bad but the thing is that you don't need to make a sequel to an already perfect film. The movie is a cinematic achievement on its own right with good casting and practical effects but as a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time it doesn't hold up. The score is not even near as good as the original either and on the philosophical side it doesn't present any new ideas that the first blade runner didn't have already. As a whole I would say don't watch it, if you're a blade runner fan you'll be disappointed, if not you'll wonder what the heck you just watched.",Blade Runner 2049

In general, a shallow attempt to replicate the original by reshuffling its elements and putting them into a cliché blockbuster frame. Adds no new meaning, except explaining what happened in the old movie (for those of us who did not get it i guess).Acting is average, dialogues are shallow and meaningless towards the end, long pauses are a torture.

With more than 60 watching of the first movie and countless hours of soundtrack studying I was very afraid of this sequel.The movie is absolute more than I expected to see. The atmosphere is identically deep, dark and wide as in the first movie. That was the main thing that i was afraid of being missing in this sequel. Even from the beginning you became aware that the movie is huge and deep. The real BR fans will know what am I talking about. Complete story is good shaped and slowly developed through entire length. It really gets you inside and overtakes your perception to the maximum. In moments I noticed that it got me as some sort of VR experience. Cant remember when for the last time I have watched every single frame of anything in cinema.From the technical aspect this is the most complex and most beautiful movie I have ever seen. As sound engineer I really must point onto most realistic surround i have heard in years. Everything, from vocals till sound effects is polished till the limits of present audio technologies.This movie will for sure reshape the actual SF community.

Could they replicate such a touchstone picture that meant so much to me? Would Sean Young appear and allow me to blush again in youthful splendor at desiring an android? Although I hugely enjoyed the experience, for mine it didn't quite have the depth of the first BR - probably in its characterisations more than anything.

The way the film showcases the beauty of the human body and our behaviors was fantastic. Changes in score and aggressive tones were perfectly placed and the cinematography was top-notch. For me though, the real masterpiece here was the story. I was engaged the entire time, and at no point felt any part was unnecessary. Ryan Gosling and Villeneuve are a dangerous combo. 5/5!

What I was NOT prepared for was a slow and methodical, well thought- out, brusquely dystopian, beautiful, masterpiece of a film. Best of all, it stood on its own weight and did not lean on the success of the first, and more importantly, did not succumb to the obligatory setting up of future installments that so many franchises bow down to today. Many have stated their issue with pacing and plot weaknesses, but for myself, I would rather a calculated, philosophical, noir epic that the first Blade Runner did so exceptionally well. Then again, I have never been a fan of the Big Brosnan Bonds that quench the short attention spans of the star conservative reviewers, who obviously hold an unparalleled and acute taste in filmmaking. Could the run time have been cut down? Sure, but for such a small quip, it firmly stays in the shadow of the gargantuan amount of positives that I believe put this sequel above even the original. 10/10 A+",Blade Runner 2049

The film starts off with a bang - fantastic visuals, great score, and the promise of an engaging plot. But then it splutters and starts to drag while still somehow failing to develop characters (Jared Leto's menacing corporate overlord, Niander Wallace for one). Major chunks of the plot were still being rush-unpackaged towards what should've been the end of the movie. And when they were finally arrived at, the payoff seemed cliché and hard to care for.

But, the film was a bit of a mess. Let's talk about the bad first shall we. I felt as if there was a lot in this movie that shouldn't be there, for example, the scene where he got attacked in San Diego. This scene felt unnecessary and out of place where instead we could of had more time developing the villain or the underground replicant army (I don't think they were actually given a name). Secondly there was not enough action. I went in expecting to see some decent action but I left feeling a little short changed. For a slow movie you need to support that slow pace with some decent action scenes. Okay now for the good stuff. This movie look AMAZING. Gosh damm this movie looks incredible because it captured that cyberpunk essence perfectly with these dashes of colour in a world that is mostly black and grey. Also the sound design was really good. I could hear footsteps when people walked and it sounded are you ready ... GOOD. Also every time there was a machine or a gun it sounded awesome.

Sequels are almost never as good as their originals, and this one is a sequel/revisit by another director. Sci-fi can have a bit of everything. This one will have you questioning everything through its artistic imagery both in scenery and cinematography, twists, and excellent performances. This movie does a lot without getting pulled in a million directions. It is a detective movie, so there is a mystery... no surprise there. But, you may not even notice it's a mystery. I'm sure people could watch it many times and find different aspects to focus on. 2 and a half hours felt right to me. Any less would take away from the atmosphere, any more and my bladder would have burst... I nearly thought it would half-way through, so stay away from the large caffeinated beverages while watching it in a theater.This one is missing the element of near psychedelic rage that Rutger Hower's character portrayed. This movie is a bit more refined, the sides are not clear. The madness of some of the characters is subtle. If Blade Runner explored psychosis through the replicatants. This one explores where sanity and humanity takes root after enduring trauma. It may redefine who and what you think can be sane.My only gripe is the ambient sound track music was too similar to the original, and not quite as well done. It was still done better then most movies, and though it was noticeable, it was not a distraction.Any movie that is worth holding my pee for an hour and a half, and on my own has got to be really good.

Heavy reliance on background soundtrack is often an indicator of thin plot or weak screenplay - in this case the screenplay was pathetic, even garbled at times, and the film dragged tortuously along, almost in real-time, at least an hour and a half too long. I began rooting for the demise of the hero just to end my own misery, but remained in my seat hoping something interesting would happen.

Instead they went with the boring tried and tested route. I've seen the first blade runner, give me something different. Despite caring a little about the main character it felt like a shallow connection and thus the film suffered because of it.

His scenes were short & sweet and probably cut. Jared is not in it long at all. Such a shame he was really good whilst on screen & i wanted Niander to have more of a story. The nexus dawn prequel i watched prior on YouTube lures you in & having liked the original from a young age, i just had to see it. However i wouldn't say i was blown away by it and in all honesty i expected more.

Music over the top Acting nonexistent Length, felt like 6 hours,and not in a good wayAs people left the theater I saw shaking heads.Don't understand people raving about it.

2118,shahbangct,"Good, but not great",7,7 October 2017,"Okay first of all before l get started about my review on this, l want to say that the first Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie, it's fantastic in my eyes and a real work of art in the Sci Fi genre. As for Blade Runner 2049...I was a little disappointed. Lets go over the positives first. This movie is stunning and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is brilliant! It's truthfully mind blowing and almost worth the price of admission alone. This movie also had a lot of interesting Sci Fi elements that are new and innovative, like Ryan Gosling's holographic girlfriend. I've never seen anything quite like it, it was pretty cool. The actors were all very strong in their performances, so much so that it left me wanting more from certain characters. I really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance, he's pulls off an especially creepy and mysterious character. I wanted more Leto to be honest. Negatives This film is slow and too long! And I love slow movies usually! They unnecessarily stretch scenes out to the point where you're bored....and as a BIG Blade Runner fan it pains me to say that! I'm upset actually that l felt this way about this movie. The movie has pacing issues for sure. I also found the main plot of the story a little thin, it wasn't hard to get lost in this movie and wonder where are they going with this? They tried to throw a twist in, but truthfully when the twist is unraveled or revealed I didn't care, it was underwhelming. For a movie being 2 hrs 40 minutes l actually expected more out of it. Certain scenes were too long and drawn out, and other parts were sorrily lacking depth. The original Blade Runner story is way better in my opinion. Also Harrison Ford doesn't even show up until the last 40 minutes and by the end of movie I thought to myself, ""did they even really need him?"" Overall the movie is OK, which again sucks for me to say, because if the pacing and story was a little bit stronger and things flowed a bit better this movie could have easily been a 10/10 for Sci Fi. To sum it all up it's a good movie with some extraordinary visuals and very cool Sci Fi technology/elements and the acting is strong, but has serious pacing problems, it's too long and the story is average. LOL the first Blade Runner has a faster pace! So to all those people who thought the first one was slow, don't even bother with this one. I would definitely watch Blade Runner 2049 again as I feel I could definitely learn new things and l want to see if my opinion changes to a more positive one. Overall my rating is a 7/10.....barely.",Blade Runner 2049

Last 3 hours (yes, this title is 3 hours long) was spent in vain.Mr. Denis Villeneuve, it takes more to create atmosphere than killing the lights and shooting most of the scenes in the dark.Mr. Hanz Zimmer, it takes more to create the soundtrack than just hitting some random synth notes here and there.

2124,jakebeck-18833,Blade Runner 2049: a review,9,7 October 2017,"This film is brilliant and is one of the best film experiences I've ever had at the theater. I am a fan of Denis Villeneuve's work, specifically Arrival. He can so expertly craft a film world's tone, atmosphere, and mood that the film demands your attention. This film makes me excited to see what he'll do with Dune. I loved this film and will see it several more times before it comes to blu- ray. I will get more in depth if you wish to say around, but I give this a 9/10 for being a science fiction that demands your attention, patience and your focus, and that is what is turning a lot of people off to it.There are a few things I want to address, specifically the sound design, the cinematography, and the ""legacy"" of Blade Runner.First, the sound design. Most negative reviews point out that there was just ""random loud noises,"" but this is far from the case. There is often an absence of music in dialogue scenes so all of the weight is carried by the actors and the framing of the scene. Whenever there is music it is all very carefully added. For example, the first shots of L.A. are full of dark, bombastic droning that is very staccato and reminiscent of an industrial factory. These loud moments are juxtaposed to the almost silent interior scenes between characters. The movie is clearly showing a delineation between different parts of the world. Yes, it is jarring, but not without purpose. The music is unfamiliar and robotic causing us to feel alienated from the world; we are asked not to be absorbed and let the world wash over, but to focus and pay attention to the sound and visual design of the film.This brings me to the cinematography and framing of Blade Runner 2049. Every shot of the film is a carefully laid out and composed shot, from the eye opening immediately after the opening title card to the final, brightly lit shot of K (Ryan Gosling) laying on the stone steps. Color and framing is considered so meticulously throughout the film. This movie is composed in a manner similar to a film noir, as was the first Blade Runner. The interweaving of deep, long landscape shots to the carefully crafted interior sets make every moment a spectacle to the eyes, if you are focusing and giving your attention over to this film. This brings me to my final point; the legacy of Blade Runner. The two times I watched this film in the theater I was enraptured, but I'd often notice other people around me zoning out, talking, taking out cell phones, or straight up falling asleep. I feel like people forgot what happened in the first Blade Runner. It wasn't a sci-fi movie like Star Wars or Star Trek, but a film noir set in the future. Most of the original Blade Runner has Deckard (Harrison Ford) performing the role of a detective more than the role of a bounty hunter. I contend that Harrison Ford isn't the best actor of the Blade Runner, but Rutger Hauer who carries the emotional weight for someone who is not suppose to be technically human. If people are put off by Ryan Gosling appearing dead-eyed or lacking, they forget he's playing a replicant who has to keep emotions in check unless he wants to lose his job and life. It is only during the third act of the film that K (Ryan Gosling) beings to find his own humanity in a mirrored way that Deckard found his at the end of the first Blade Runner. This film demands, and deserves your attentions and care. Actors in this film don't feel like big stars, but as characters. Even Jared Leto, who I can't stand, puts in a solid performance all because you have a director who understands film and how the visual communication of film and reach and audience, but only if we give it our care and attention and trust it. Because that first shot of the eye opening in the beginning is meant to be a call to the audience; open your eyes and trust in a movie that doesn't take it's audience for granted both intellectually and emotionally.",Blade Runner 2049
2125,wesleyt-87183,Definitely one of the best Sci-Fi films of 2017!,9,9 October 2017,"Although some have said that the film is too lengthy or too boring, I, on the other hand, say otherwise. It bay be a painstakingly long movie to some but its stunning visuals and excellent acting keeps you enticed throughout. What I love about Blade Runner 2049 is that it is it's own movie, you don't need to see the OG Blade Runner to understand and enjoy the complexity of this film, it doesn't try to replicate the original but it harnesses some key themes and visuals of the original to make this a true Blade Runner film. Many of the visuals in the film made my favorite scenes, especially in the contrast of the oranges and reds in when he meets Deckard, and the dark grays and blacks in the city of LA. The film has something to offer for everyone. I thought this was an excellent film and is definitely end up as one of my favorite films of 2017. Though if I was to give a few gripes about the movie, I would say that it doesn't necessarily portray women in the best way, and that it also introduces some plot points that could be important and leaves them without explanation or a conclusion.",Blade Runner 2049

The story wasn't as deep and thought provoking as the first movie by a longshot, but the characters were interesting and the story was engaging.

2128,scaryari-59800,Very disappointed...,3,8 October 2017,"Disappointing. The cinematography was excellent and it was a beautiful film to watch in terms of visuals... but everything else was very disappointing. Firstly, it's 2017 and I found that this film could do with a MUCH more diverse cast... LA in 2049 seems much less multicultural than it actually is 2017. Seeing as this movie was meant to be ""ahead of it's time"" I was upset it still employed the typical Hollywood framework of two caucasian men discovering their destiny~ and although there were a few important female characters, they still fit into typical female archetypes. For example Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks as ""the strong, but cold women"" and with K's girlfriend as the ""dutiful and very 2 dimensional girlfriend"". It seems that Hollywood has not evolved as women were still seen as objects and the cast was very white. I felt that I had seen these characters in millions of other Hollywood films... I also found that the acting was not it's best. The plot was also extremely flat, boring and difficult to follow. There was a sigh of relief from the audience once the movie was over. ALL IN ALL- I think if you are someone who enjoys watching many common Hollywood films that are present in our current media than I think you will really enjoy this film as it is slightly more exciting than the others because of the good cinematography. However, if you are a female who is aware of underlying misogyny in films and you are tired of it, or if you are simply tired of seeing poorly thought out plots with little depth or imagination than this is not the movie for you.",Blade Runner 2049

2130,bestrevieweddeals,A simple deep complex poetic masterpiece,10,8 October 2017,"Blade Runner 2049 does a perfect job of expanding on the brilliantly sewn seeds that were planted in the original 1982 Blade Runner. Before watching it we recommend you revisit the first and even read analysis online to get into the juicy juice. Blade Runner 2049 was made for those who are familiar with the story line and is a sci-fi monument and masterpiece. We predict it will win many Oscars — starting with best-adapted screenplay to Hampton Fancher. To supplement the original film Dennis Villeneuve had the following trio of short films to expand on the exposition. They are not necessary to view beforehand as we didn't see them until after.Blade Runner 2048: Nowhere to Run Blade Runner 2036: Nexus Dawn Blade Runner 2022: The Black OutThroughout the film there are numerous references to ""the black out"" — an event which saw the world live in darkness for 10 days and the destruction of any data which wasn't written down on paper. That means bank records, identification documents, even digital baby photos were all lost effectively resetting the world. The implications of such an event are obvious, but what I want to know is, what caused it? Was it an accident? Did somebody bring it about on purpose to hide something?The original Blade Runner ends with Deckard receiving an origami silver unicorn from Gaff with his voice-over ""too bad she wont live, but then again who does."". When Deckard mulled over the Rachel details he fantasized about a Unicorn. Keep in mind that a Unicorn is ""fake"" aka replicant. Moreover, keep in mind a unicorn without a horn would be a horse.Whatever you do — forget about the reviews! One of the ones to stay away from is written by looser want-to-be and failed actor RICHARD LAWSON From Variety magazine. The following was a headline from another article he wrote: ""Who Is America's Most Envied Kardashian-Jenner? We finally have an answer to this most serious of questions.""

There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed — his recent English-language features include ""Sicario,"" ""Prisoners"" and ""Arrival"" — are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high- end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility.",Blade Runner 2049

2136,distantsun-91631,Blade Runner 2049 more than I could have ever hoped for,10,9 October 2017,"1 of the most rewarding, intelligent and moving movies I have ever seen in my life. After last night's view I am still in shock and astounded by the masterpiece I had the privilege to witness. I am absolutely delighted how Hollywood allowed Deni Villeneuve to direct his work without inserting formulaic shallow mindless action clips to satisfy the new ADD generation. Firstly the cinematography alone is worth more than the admission price, if Deacons does not win an Oscar for this then he never will. The casting and performances are superb beyond words, K's brief moments of emotion explosive in intensity. This is an incredibly sad story with strong messages about racism, humanity and the pointless cycle of violence. As violent as 2049 is it is visually quite mild compared to Scott's BR, revealing Villeneuve's disdain for gratuitous such. Non the less it does not make the scenes of violence any less intense as he is a master at conveying atmospheres of terror without patently showing it. I don't even know were to begin at just how multi layered and complex the story is, even at the generously slow pacing I at many times struggled to keep up and process all the information. The scenes of death and conflict explode with such intensity it's heartbreakingly visceral. In many ways I can see in this work what Ridley Scott so wanted to film but was restricted due to technical and budgetary constraints, noticeably K's retirement of Sapper at the protein farm. No dialogue wasted in this script and each fragment of info revealed vital to understanding the story. This will be a frustrating movie for any casual viewer hoping for some spoon fed escapism, action and wit. Box office sales ratings mean nothing here, see Emoji movie, enough said.

(I am very big fan of the Blade Runner - it is my favorite movie - but when I heard that Denis will be the Director, I was sure that it is going to ""work"" again).Music is great, ...the masterpiece,...with clear reminiscence to the original, ...but simplified, with strong details which - in correspondence with certain parts of the screenplay - has blown me away.Congratulations, respect and appreciation to complete cast and crew.",Blade Runner 2049
2138,t_liggett,Probably too cerebral for many viewers,9,9 October 2017,"It's not the original movie, and I don't think its supposed to be. With that in mind, Villeneuve still does an excellent job of recreating the magic that captured so many sci-fi fans long ago in the original movie. A masterpiece of cinematography, visually stunning sets, intricate in detail, and vast. It's everything the original was but with a new twist, a slightly different flavor, new characters (and old), and with a soundtrack almost as haunting as Vangelis' original score. Even if you don't enjoy the film's plot you can't help but be astounded by it's beauty. So many of the scenes in this film are beyond words. I often wondered what was real and what was CGI and how in the Hell did they make it look so good. Eye candy! I'm sure there will be plenty of critics of this film (what piece of art doesn't have its critics?). And I suspect that like the original, this film will live on as a must see for true connoisseurs of dystopian noir sci-fi cinema. For me, the film works on so many levels. The casting was excellent, and I felt like everyone turned in solid performances. I can't recall a single scene in this movie that should have been cut. Some would complain that the movie is too long or moves to slow. Well, I submit that this is the same batch of folks that enjoy Micheal Bay films, fast food, facebook and texting. That's not meant to be an insult. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I prefer a director to take his/her time in telling me a story and so I felt the pace was perfectly adequate. For me the story line was interesting, plausible and had depth in layers. Consequently, I think this is where the movie may loose some of its audience. Some folks are not content to watch a film and be challenged with questions. They prefer to be entertained on a less cerebral level. It might well be that Blade Runner and now Blade Runner 2049 ask too much of some viewers. Too many questions that are too hard to answer? Yes, just like the original, this movie is bleak, and it doesn't paint a very pretty picture of humanity or the road we may well be taking. Issues that have and still do plague humanity abound in this film. Slavery, race, ethical dilemmas, societal woes, the environment and unrestrained industrialization are all characters in this film. They play an important part in telling an age old story: love. Love of mankind, love of a child, love of a parent, romantic love, and even how we define love. Interestingly, one of the most compassionate, empathetic, and loving characters in the story is a program/hologram. Maybe what this film is really asking us to do is to spread a little more love. I can't speak for others, but I can say that I don't mind having some important questions thrown at me in a film. I like a gimps of a beautiful yet disturbing future where the human spirit can claw its way from the depraved depths of bondage and suffering and triumph over greed and arrogance. Where AI can teach us a lesson in humanity and where good can overcome evil with love.",Blade Runner 2049
2139,teamonkey,Dull without suspense,1,10 October 2017,"The original Blade Runner is one of my favourite films so I was really looking forward to this one. What a disappointment. If I wasn't in the company of others I would of walked out early. I left the cinema feeling annoyed that I had to sit through this overlong monotonous film. The storyline is dragged out with the main character just going from place to place to investigate something like in a video game. At the beginning he is in a fight scene and you find out he is basically indestructible. The replicants are now terminators. This leaves out any suspense that he is in danger. The first film was kind of believable, the city was overcrowded and the building were decaying - it had atmosphere. This one looked like a more modern city with a lot of emptiness. The technology has advanced so much that he now has a solid light fully realistic AI holographic companion that operates from a small device he can keep in his pocket. If you think about it why are they so desperate to increase replicant slave labour production when they are capable of building AI robots that can be enveloped with holographic light to look human. They still have the blurry 1950 TV quality monitors to echo the first film but the supposed technology jump does not make sense. The music by Vangelis was one of the most important parts of the original. He conveyed through the use of synthesisers and traditional instruments a sense of awe and wonder, beauty and the sadness of a dystopian world. Johann Johannsson was originally commissioned to score the film and I think he would of done a great job but they decided for some reason it was not Hollywood sounding enough so they bought in Hans Zimmer. What a disaster. It might as well be the music from Batman VS Alien. Just lots of loud noise. The original was a box office failure that became a cult classic.

2141,frv-30269,My Views On Blade Runner 2049 and a dash of film industry commentary,6,10 October 2017,"Perusing the reviews one easily notices a verifiable pattern of love it or hate it emerging throughout the page.I was predisposed to the film given my admiration of the original. The original sits proudly on my DVD shelf while Dick's novel is not far away among my books.BR2049 is indeed awe-inspiring in its graphics and visuals. I can imagine seeing the original in the cinema back in 1982 would have done the same for those viewers. What is more, the women are beautiful and there I admit it attractive women draw me in. The music puts in a good attempt of being equal to Vangelis and his art. No one would be able to match that of course but the effort and artistic merit is there. The morale and message to the audience is lofty and worthwhile and it is not preached without a measure of subtlety, which is appreciated.With that said, and I was somewhat partial also because of the lead Canadian actor and Canadian director, the film is too long. I do not have statistics, but these films have lost the art of editing. Lights go down ten minutes after they are supposed to, a mobile game plays to garner loyalty to the cinema chain and debit card, fifteen minutes of trailers and unwanted commercials kick in for me to buy a car, a chocolate bar and get yet another credit card that will sell my information and lose it to NSA hackers and then we have the film itself. The film was good and immersive, but who authorizes the non-edits?I liked it but all in all this film reminds one why we should not pay to watch the next six Star Trek sequels and why it is very smart to boycott the next dozen Star Wars films and Marvel's weekly release schedule. Seriously.",Blade Runner 2049

Typical of Ridley Scott film. If you prefer wham, bam wallop Sci-fi films in the Marvel mode this may not be for you. Personally, I don't have a problem with either. Would probably put this in the style of Alien, but darker. Length of film is not a problem, went by quickly and would watch again.

I always check IMDb review and star rating for a new movie to decide to see it or not. The rating at the time I checked was 8.5. Boy I was wrong to trust the rating. This is one of the worst Sifi movies I have seen for a long time. The movie is long with little action. The plot is simple and boring. I was waiting for some excitement action scenes at the end.

2145,officialbengunn,Absolutely extraordinary - but severe lack of POC representation,9,11 October 2017,"As other reviews have stated, this film is nearly flawless. As a fan of the original, it delivered everything I could have wanted and more. My only nitpick is that, much like the original (and quite a lot of other Ridley Scott films excluding Idris Elba's doomed character in Prometheus), there are next to no black actors or actresses in the main cast. In fact the only black speaking role is that of a character called (and I really hope this name was not intended in the way I think it was intended) ""Mr Cotton"", a slave driver. Are we to infer that by 2049 in Scott's universe black people have become personae non grata again in a sort of post-Trump social regression? There don't even appear to be many Synthetics of colour. I see no reason why the aesthetic or narrative assets of this movie would be negatively impacted by the presence of some afro-ethnic talent. There is no shortage of it. Unconscious oversight on the producers' part, I'm sure.Moreover, did anyone else find the Female to Male nudity ratio a little gratuitous on the former's part (in that there is absolutely none of the latter)? Treatment of female characters in this franchise seems a little unfair - if grittily realistic I suppose. It is dystopian after all and the problematic universal acceptance of of the more unsavoury male appetites is a self-aware theme that runs through many of Scott's works. No doubt Blade Runner and its sequel are further remarking on this.Though I find it strange that a story so thematically rich with symbolism and plot pertaining to female fertility and its inherent power lacks characters of the fairer sex who are more than just simple plot devices or foils for the development of the central male characters. Perhaps Scott's earth truly has slumped into widespread racism and misogyny. Of course, there were some bad-ass female supporting cast members in Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks.It just seems a little odd that the obvious civil rights metaphors implied by the plight of the synthetics in this franchise are not executed alongside some (one would think appropriate) POC representation.Other than that, absolutely marvelous film. Enjoyed Jared Leto's Jeffrey Combs-esque antagonist. A suitably creepy role for a man who is (if the rumours are to be believed) quite a creep himself.I would highly recommend this 3-hour behemoth of delectable science-fiction to fans of both the original and the genre in general - though its running time doesn't register until one looks at one's watch, thanks to the film's masterful, unceasing use of tension. It's a visual and narrative masterpiece, crafted with all the care and skill one would expect from a sequel 30 years in the making. Probably one of the greatest sequels ever created in general - in the same league as The Godfather pt.2 and The Empire Strikes Back.",Blade Runner 2049

2147,dyyony,"Visually impressive, but a difficult watch",3,11 October 2017,"It was difficult to rate this film as it is visually very impressive and the story, though not particularly good, did keep my interest through the whole 2hrs 45mins. The low score is given for a total lack of character connection, me to them, or even them to each other. The first Bladerunner film has lots of interesting character relationships: Rachael & Deckard (love) Roy & Paris (friendship, mourning) Pris & JF Sebastian (friendship, pity, kindness) Leon & Roy (comrades, friendship, leadership) Tyrell & JF Sebastian (companionship) And of course the brief but evocative kinship between Deckard and Roy at the end of Roys life. This film is devoid of character relationships, most of the characters seem to exist as individual unconnected entities and that just does not work for a film. There is only one interesting relationship in Bladerunner 2049 - that between K and Joi, a genuinely interesting connection that makes their scenes together the best scenes in the film. Without character connections the film has no grasp on your emotions and is actually quite depressing to watch. The story though interesting, develops very slowly, I was expecting some big twist that never came. I can't blame the actors for this disappointing film as they have to try to act in a vacuum, apart from Jared Leto, who is just awful. I'd also have to say that the visual effects start to wear thin after a couple of hours, there's only so many dark shadows/ stripy shadows/ reflections of light from water/ more reflections of light on water / more reflections of light on water I can watch without it getting quite formulaic and repetitive. P.s. the film was criticised for not having strong female characters but this is not really true, I would say 3 of the 4 main characters are female.",Blade Runner 2049

2150,juanitalovesbootes,Do not watch,2,17 October 2017,"I like to consider myself to be an optimist. Everything I do, I can gain some benefit out of. This past Sunday I was bored, so I picked a movie in the theater nearby to watch; I happened to pick The Blade Runner. I did not have any preconceived expectations for this movie since the only time I had ever heard about it was during the trailers before the movie at the theater. Nonetheless, I was looking forward to watching it. Little did I know that I was going to waste three hours of my precious time watching a movie that did not deserve my money or my attention. In addition to the lack of a clear story line and misuse of some incredible movie stars, The Blade Runner's effect of sheer boredom on its audience warrants it as one of the most unnecessarily hyped up movies of the year. Despite being produced with a very large budget, this movie was incredibly difficult to watch because, without previous background, it did not make any sense. The movie lasted around two and a half hours, but to me and my dad, it felt like a few years. The story line was underdeveloped to the point where I felt that the director dragged on certain scenes for many minutes just to fill up time or to figure out what to do next. The Blade Runner did not have to be that long. I am not sure whether or not this is a book to movie adaptation, but if it is, they did a poor job of filling in the movie watchers in regards to the background. The only background provided was a page long of text attempting to explain how the world got to where it is during the first three minutes of the movie. In my opinion, none of it is necessary because the movie did not reference any part of that background until two hours into the movie, and, by that point, everyone had forgotten it. The director had a really great opportunity to utilize Oscar award winning movie stars like Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Jared Leto to his advantage. Unfortunately, the movie just turned out to be a waste of their talents. Ryan Gosling is not good at action scenes; Harrison Ford is. His talents are clearly presented in classic films such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. However, Ryan Gosling was the only one featured in the two action scenes, not Harrison Ford. Oscar award winner, Jared Leto, unfortunately, was not featured as much as he deserved to be in this movie, as well. Jared Leto showed up a total of three times throughout the whole movie, despite the fact that he was supposed to be the main antagonist.Aside from the frustration I was experiencing due to confusion and the lack of proper use of the actors, I was incredibly bored. There was a grand total of six people in that theater, including my dad and I, and two of them left in the middle of the movie because they were so bored. The only thing preventing me from following them was my dad who refused to leave because he did not want to waste his money. Its severe lack of background music played a big role in the overall impression of the movie. Normally, the soundtrack is a huge part of a movie, and the absence of it puts a responsibility on the audience to know exactly how they should be feeling at certain times during the movie. I did not feel any tension during the action scenes nor did I feel sad during the depressing scenes. I just felt frustrated. Considering everything moved so slowly, I was very aware of the fact that I was sitting in a movie theater for a prolonged period of time. I think it is safe to say that this movie ruined all other movies for me. I do not think I am being overly critical; I just think the director really missed the mark on this one. The confusing story line, lost acting opportunities, and overall impression of the movie did not make a very good movie watching experience. From now on, I will thoroughly research each and every movie I watch before going into the theater.",Blade Runner 2049

2152,yanliu-40390,Masterpiece,9,13 October 2017,"First of all, this film is well-made. The world-building effort really pays off, and the dystopian world it makes extends perfectly from original one's. Also, the cinematography is astonishingly exquisite. The silhouettes and color palettes are so stylish, that I think it deserves an Oscar. Besides, the score sounds breathtaking. Especially the symbiosis between musical sound and visual effect makes a wonderful combination. About the plot, at high level, it is carefully designed. It does not only tie everything together in this movie, but also levitates the original Blade Runner. Although the movie plot rolls out slowly, it can bring you a kind of cathartic joy during watching. The allegorical meaning is not that obvious in the movie, but it does hit the beat of some philosophical view point.Regarding shortcomings, my major concerns are related to the length and pacing of the film. Blade Runner 2049 lasts 2 hrs and 43 mins. Probably that is too long for those causal audiences. Also, the pacing of the film comes way slower than those nowadays. I understand it is intended to play out in such way so this movie has a similar pacing to those in 60s and 70s, and the pacing of original Blade Runner film. However, I really fear this can turn away a large number of audiences. Here I really admire filmmakers' confidence and bravery on sticking to their principles about film making without pandering to the tastes of masses, but it really undermines the possibility of making another such high budget art film in near future.Overall, if you are a hardcore sci-fi fan or interested in art films, I sincerely recommend Blade Runner to you. It is still not clear to me whether this is going to become another cult or legend yet, but I do believe you will not have another sci-fi movie with such high level of quality in years.",Blade Runner 2049

2154,confusedlabrador,"Worthy, daring, and able to stand on its own. This is how a sequel should be done.",10,15 October 2017,"***Contains Spoilers***First off, this is definitely a film that must be experienced at the cinema. The visuals (evidently great right from the trailer) literally took my breath away. There are some scenes where I audibly gasped simply because of how beautiful and surreal it looked. The colour palette is wonderful and is used effectively to evoke all kinds of emotions. No cheap rehash moments to cash in on nostalgia (which is a complaint often heard about SW: TFA). The film is in line with BR but is bold enough to create its own original moments and it does not seek to rely on the original protagonist either. I've been a big fan of Villeneuve ever since seeing Enemy and Prisoners in 2013. And his latest offering here further proves that he is on his way to becoming one of the legendary directors of this generation. His works have a fascinating amount of details and it takes a lot of skill to bring such intricate visions to life. I'm reading the trivia section right now and it's clear that he has a very deep love for sci-fi and was well aware of the weight he was bearing by taking charge of this sequel. Now, Rutger Hauer was my favourite part about the original film, so my bias may be showing here: But 2049 couldn't capture something close to the effortless depth of Roy Batty. This may really be my only ""criticism"". What I adored about the original BR is that the ""good vs. bad"" discourse between a blade runner and a replicant (respectively) is so wonderfully ambiguous. I remember even Hauer argued that one could present a great argument on why Roy is actually the good guy and Deckard is the true villain. But comparatively, there wasn't much to chew on with the 2049 antagonists. But Sylvia Hoeks did a brilliant job with Luv, and Leto produced a perfectly chilling vibe on screen even with his very limited screen time.",Blade Runner 2049
2155,andylee-12454,"Really beautiful visuals, pretty good movie, I just have one complaint",8,13 October 2017,"I'm not even close to the level of Blade Runner junkies out there; I was 15 when I saw the original and appreciated it, and it's always stuck with me like it has with so many other people. So I knew I'd take my 50-year-old self to the theater to see the sequel. Like a lot of people have noted, it's really beautiful to look at (strange how that can be, given that it depicts a world of such horror).My one complaint today is the same one I felt when I saw the original as a teenager: I feel that the violence and menace that the replicants project seriously undercuts the viewers' sympathy towards them and their plight. Yeah, it must suck to have a 4-year life span (the original replicants), but how sorry can you feel for a bunch of super-strong androids that (for example) crush people's skulls with their bare hands? How sorry can you feel for the Luv character after the various scenes of her violence? The only character who seemed to project real fear and vulnerability in the original was Joanna Cassidy, who played the exotic dancer and was chased down in the street and shot by Deckard; in the new film, perhaps Dave Bautista's brief part.That's my beef and I'm sticking to it!",Blade Runner 2049

This one left nothing unanswered that viewers could discuss 30 minutes later.It is a cool FX sci-fi entertainment, with superhero, ""kung-fu"" robots.Certainly are plenty of pretties in this. I could be wrong, but should Film Noir be populated exclusively by models? Certainly are plenty of ""female nudity"" in this: robot breasts, virtual breasts, statue breasts, small, medium and giant. I expected the credits to say, ""Dedicated to the memory of Hugh Hefner."" Perhaps this was an exploration into the difference between artificial breasts and the human breast. Perhaps it was pandering to the perceived interests of the stereotypical porn-surfing fan boy. ""I only watch this movie for the articles,"" is like what they used to claim about Hefner's magazine.It had very cool technologies from the future, especially flying cars with built-in drones.In the casino, it's too bad the actors were upstaged by lip-syncing Elvis and Sinatra impersonators.

2160,coolkid-56437,Blade Runner 2049 suffers from poor pacing and wasted character development,6,14 October 2017,"I believe that Blade Runner 2049, though visionary stunning, is an extremely flawed movie and pales in comparison to the original Blade Runner. To put it crudely, it is a visionary bore-fest, but as much as possible I want to like it. Personally, I respect all the efforts they placed in the script-writing, but if the general public doesn't like the film, it is completely justifiable. The characters lack development and proper motivation. We know that K wants to find out the mystery of his past and who his parents are, and we as audience are convinced at half-way point that he was the chosen child ""chosen one"". K himself does not care about the revolution nor his duty as a cop nor the corporate interest of Wallace. He just wants to find his real purpose, that's the entire plot. He believes he was the chosen child, but did nothing significant as "" the chosen one"". He seems to be acting on his own interest, but in truth he was being manipulated by everyone else. He was told by his boss to erase all evidence, even though he doesn't want to. He was used by Wallace to find Deckard, though that was never his intention. He was later told to kill Deckard for the greater good, though he himself does not believe in the revolution. In pursuing his own identity, he forgot someone who is a true mother to him, Lieutunant Joshi, who was conveniently killed off.K only ""realise"" his true calling at close to the end of the film. That plot twist revealing that he wasn't the chosen one destroyed K as a character in story-telling. He had basically gained no true knowledge of himself from the first 2 hours of the movie, despite his sacrifices. There is no reason as to why K felt compelled to save/kill Deckard in first place. He doesn't care about the revolution, and is only being told to do something by another higher authority figure. What is his true motivation behind saving Deckard? I like to believe that there is one, but it is not well- explained. That scene with the giant Joi reminded K that there is no turning back, and that he should see things through. But it would have been understandable, in fact much more human, for K to just walk it off and forget about Deckard. We as audience followed K with his beliefs that he was the one. When the plot twist came, it is already at the 2 hour mark and K is suddenly purposeless. The movie has lost its steam by then.K's death in the end, contributes absolutely nothing to the story or the development of its characters. In the original film, both Tyrell's and Roy's death signifies something. Tyrell's death shows God being overwhelmed by the power of his own creation, along with many other interpretations. Roy's death vastly affected Deckard, teaching him the fragility of life and the importance of ""living"".In comparison to Roy and Tyrell, Luv (the female replicant) and Wallace seemed more like one-dimensional villains. Tyrell sincerely believed that his product will bring the course of mankind to a new technological age, and he intentionally blurred the line between human and replicants. He challenged social and philosophical concepts, and was never portrayed as a villain, but a corporate genius. Wallace, on the other hand, just babbles on and on about his own ambitions. Wallace is a selfish artist, and all he does throughout the film can only be interpreted as ""villainous"". He killed a freshly born replicant, he killed the clone of Rachel, all just to get the child whom he would later dissect. He does things for his own interests only, and you can never empathize with him as a character. Tyrell is more human than Wallace, and hence more relatable. Luv's portrayal throughout the film is kinda just like that stereotypical assassin hired by the bad guys to chase after the main characters. She was hinted to be more than just a mindless robot following orders, but much of her character remains undeveloped despite great potential. What does she really feel about the implication of a replicant baby? Why was she crying for the new replicant model who was killed by Wallace ? There are certain romantic tension between her and K that was abruptly ended with her death in the last scene. She herself has no desire, no passion, no motivation to do the things she want to do. Unlike Roy, who was more human than human, she became a convenient plot device drone.The only character given much focus upon is Joi, the artificial intelligence. She reminded me much of Scarlet Johansson in the movie ""Her"", which explored similar concepts. But her role in the film is not extremely important, so is her death. She did convince K that to dig further into his past. That was her primary role. When that goal is fulfilled, she was conveniently killed off.The main issue of this movie is the script. I genuinely believe that the director and scriptwriters are heading in the right direction, but the pacing of the film and the motivations of the characters could be improved upon. Certain scenes lingered on for too long, and the soundtrack never. stops. playing. I love Vangelis, but in this film the atmosphere is sometimes a little suffocating and monotonic because of it. Anyway this is my opinions on Blade Runner 2049. I like the film, but it is definitely not great.﻿",Blade Runner 2049

Because even if there wasn't a story at all, the film should still get a 10 because of its visuals and the sound (can't judge the acting as I don't think I'm in the position to judge the acting).Again, the visuals and the sound are absolutely mesmerizing. Should be almost forbidden to watch such an epic movie at home on a little screen with some little sound boxes. It would be a completely different experience, like day & night. Again, do not watch this movie at home when you see it for the first time. This is really important. It almost shouldn't be allowed to leave a review if somebody didn't see it on the big screen ;).To me, the first Blade Runner was a little bit more mysterious, I guess most were very surprised that Deckard was a replicant too. 2049 puts you much more into the position of trying to find out what is happening and why. Matter of taste whether you prefer this style or the other of Blade Runner 1, where you were more in passive mode as a viewer.Blade Runner 1: far ahead of its time, great and surprising ending, great visuals and sound, left you thinking about what consciousness is..2049: unbelievable and absolutely unmatched visuals and sound, more active thinking about the whys during the movie..

Atmospheres, music and dialogue closely follow the modus operandi of the previous work, although in the sequel they are largely present endless open spaces and shades of brighter and varied colors, but not less disturbing.Character characterization is convincing and Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto, and Harrison Ford are able to convey a mix of different feelings, which are fear, the most total determination or disbelief in the face of shocking revelations.In essence, an excellent movie that has streaks and will fully satisfy the lovers of the first Blade Runner, which will be seen here in an exquisite way a great science fiction story, but not only.",Blade Runner 2049

2169,mike-15568,Horrible Director,1,17 October 2017,As a fan of the original Blade Runner movie I was looking forward to this very much. The movie started out very slow and then got slower and slower. Visual effects were fantastic and had great detail. But instead of having a great sound track much of the movie seemed to be set to screeching sounds and dissonant chords. The movie had beautiful women and a lot of nudity but even that could not mitigate the outright boredom I felt while waiting for the next tedious scene. Only after the appearance of Harrison Ford's character did the movie pick up the pace somewhat. Too little too late. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I will remember the directors name and NEVER see anything he directs in the future.,Blade Runner 2049
2170,jarrettroles,A magnum opus which shows mastery in every aspect of the film.,10,17 October 2017,"There are many mediums available for artists to express their ideas and thoughts to an audience. Film in itself is a compilation of multiple mediums such as the written , the visual, and the auditory. A truly ground breaking movie which seemed to hit a sweet spot is Blade Runner from 1982. It was a visual spectacle that I adored with an incredible soundtrack to boot. The world Ridley Scott built from the ground up takes on a role as a character in itself as it lives and breathes in the most graphically appealing way. However, just as any first work in a series, there was plenty room for improvement and addition. With the world and ideas established, Blade Runner 2049 truly took everything great about the original and made a masterpiece constructed out of a neon future. Starting off with spectacle, this movie has it all. Beautiful shots, choreographed action sequences, and some of the best special effects I've seen all year. But, as any self respecting piece does, each moment of spectacle is built up to and made that much sweeter by the great pacing of the film. Some may complain about the 163 minute runtime, but I see it as essential to creating the perfect timing for every event in the film. No scene of spectacle stands on its own; it has a deeper meaning to it and always serves the narrative. Senseless action and CGI seems to be commonplace in today's movies, so having rooted reasons to astonish the audience is a nice change. More on spectacle, the world itself is living and breathing. I feel the crowded streets, the great expanses, and everything in between in this hyper realistic future Los Angeles. Somehow everything became even more dilapidated and lived in compared to the original interpretation of the city. Things look bleak for the inhabitants who live in near poverty, and it is felt by the audience. Despite being a gritty depiction, instead of always being rainy and blue like the first film, 2049 exceeds all expectations in using highly contrasting colors and grading to make every scene pleasing yet grounded. The city's neon breaks through the darkness and the life that resides there seems to flourish instead of wallow. Color's role even tells a sub narrative in the characters and is used effectively to show the separate acts. Dark neo-noir films have a special place in my heart, but the compelling storyline in Blade Runner 2049 made it skyrocket to the top of my favorite movie list. The story follows a biologically engineered human (called replicants in the Blade Runner universe) named simply K. He is a blade runner who is tasked to hunt down other escaped replicants and retire them by murdering them. While replicants have hyper intelligence, super strength, and certain immunities, K lacks a free will and his physical advantages were used by humans to destroy any controversial replicants. The start of the movie also initiates the start of K's character arch when a routine retirement spirals into an unexpected exploration of the case and ultimately K's shady past. What both he and the audience thought of replicants prior to the movie's beginning is fundamentally challenged and so is his identity. The star role of K is played by actor Ryan Gosling, who as it seems cannot escape L.A. (see Drive, Nice Guys, and La La Land.) His performance is impeccable as he limits his emotional responses in the beginning of the movie, but develops more reactions as the movie continues. He is supported throughout the movie by his holographic girlfriend Joi, who is programmed to love him even though he is a replicant. Another replicant character with an interesting character arch is Luv. She starts out the same way Rachael does in the original, as a supporting secretary-like character. However, as the movie progresses she becomes more and more vicious in her attempt to intervene in K's actions and is his opponent in the end. We can't talk about the performances without talking about Harrison Ford's. His involvement is left unambiguous due to the promotion of the movie (which I wish wasn't the case as a surprise cameo turned into a stellar performance would've been incredible) but he does not appear until far later in the film. He plays his character from the first movie Rick Deckard. His performance is just as lively as it was in the first film and the possibility of him being a replicant is still left unanswered. Through and through, Blade Runner 2049 is a film masterpiece that simply must be enjoyed firsthand. It is captivating, beautiful, inspiring and deserves much more praise than I alone can give it. Denis Villeneuve has taken the building blocks from Ridley Scott and made the greatest sequel to a movie I have ever seen. Breaking down every aspect of the movie you can see the detail and work put into the minutiae, which isn't observed often today. This work has been topping the box office since its release and with every bit of passion put into it, it deserves it's golden throne.",Blade Runner 2049
2171,adampeerbaye,An exoskeleton of a different bug all together,2,17 October 2017,"This movie was so disappointing... I watched Blade Runner a few days before seeing this one. What I enjoyed most about the original film was how immersive the whole world was. I think the costume and set designs were beautifully crafted and varied. I especially remember Pris's outfit at the Bradbury, Zora's bloodied transparent coat and Rachel's outfits (her fur coat and square shouldered jacket). Overall, details like this made the movie visually chaotic and ultimately really unique (although some films like fifth element have a similar wonky aesthetic)Anyways, the acting of the original film is ultimately pretty cheesy and very dated, but I think it's obvious that art director and various designers were really trying hard to be creative and come up with a really unique look.(very mild spoiler ahead)This movie has bad acting with characters yelling in 2 second bursts to emphasize tense moments... and none of characters really stand out from one another. The main character and his virtual girlfriend are crazily bland... The antagonist's side kick, Love, is just bland. If someone asked me to sum up her character I'd just say she's mechanical and somewhat cold. Pris, on the other hand, had a manipulative, childish and daring personality that is much clearer and consistent. And of course, Roy Batty has the most developed personality out of both of the films. He is imposing, angry and ultimately very aware of what it means to be human. While Zora never got much character development, even she had this sort frantic and show-businessy personality... a much more tangible character than almost all the characters in 2049.On that note, 2049 had pretty good visuals at times. I especially liked the design of the orphanage furnace room. The location felt really layered and cluttered, and the low lighting and lack of music were good at building up the atmosphere. Some of the locations in the Wallace Corporation were really nice too.Finally, I felt let down by the music... It felt like a much less emotional version of the original soundtrack by Vangelis, which was has an eerie and foreboding quality to it.So, all in all, I'd say that this film suffered mostly because of the poor writing for the characters, poor acting, and an underwhelming story that attempted to be epic.And before someone says 'it's a slow film, and people just want it to have explosions and action every minute of the three hours', let me just say I'm a fan of slower paced films like Porco Rosso, Amarcord, 2001 Space Odyssey, Last Picture Show and so on... This is simply a half-hearted and uninspired film.",Blade Runner 2049
2172,berkshirelass,Advance technology only.,3,18 October 2017,"I much prefer the first one. I found this one is like an imposture. It pretends to be seriously good. The camera stopping for a long time on the eyes of the characters is an effort to look as intense as in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western but there, it bored me because the characters don't have any consistency; they are there, making considerable efforts to look in trouble, to suffer, etc... The violence is complaisant, like adding some salt to a bland dish. The tech with its special effect is, of course, prodigious. It is a film for young people who enjoy video games, but like video games, it doesn't leave a strong impression or questions. I'll remember it as a performance of an advance technology.It is certainly NOT a masterpiece! The masterpiece is Kubrick's Odyssey 2001: a film with everything,the technical prowess, the metaphysical questions that everybody can understand and, as a whole, unforgettable.I won't spoil this review by telling you the end, I don't remember it!!!",Blade Runner 2049

Most of the new films I have seen are average, a few of them are good and some of them are terrible. In regards to this movie, I cannot even find an adjective to describe how bad it was. It is my first IMDb review ever and I am full of rage for wasting 3 hours of my life on this crap. You are forced to watch a dull movie about postapocalyptic robotic Earth in 2049 with a senseless plot... The world is a creepy place with soulless robots and red sky. Every scene takes 5 years to finish and you can't wait for this movie to end. The thing that annoys me the most is the fact that IMDb gives this movie a 8.5 rating even though most reviews give if 1 or 2 out of 10 rating. How is this even possible? Another thing that annoyed me is my stupid friend who said he ""liked this movie"" even though he likes everything, even stupid transformers... So to sum this up, if you are reading my comment please avoid this movie at all costs, it is much more fun seeing two turtles race each other. Thank you.",Blade Runner 2049

However BR2049 bears no relation to the original. A very convoluted and uninteresting story arch, which did not maintain interest; the dystopian vision created originally was not recreated, nor advanced. If Philip K Dick had seen this, I'm not sure he would be impressed. Maybe we are just so used to CGI now, whereas in 1982 it was original. Cannot fault performances, although as talented he may be, there are only so many times you can tolerate seeing a close-up of a bloodied and troubled Ryan Gosling. The return of Harrison Ford as Deckard was welcome but as referenced all too brief and not sufficiently nuanced. As I say, wish it had not been made as does not do justice to the original, a very poor imitation, even down to the faux Vangelis soundtrack. Sorry.",Blade Runner 2049

This is absolutely one of the best sequels to hit the movie theater... not only in the capturing story-line, but in the creativity, artistry and unique depth that this film gifted its viewers with. I cannot understand why there are negative reviews on this film. One would almost have to be a true artist to truly appreciate the film, in acknowledging that it is an absolute, undeniable masterpiece. The cinematography is undeniably a creative achievement in the film industry to date. I have been disappointed with the lack of creativity in films since Mad Max in story-line and visual stimulation.

2179,iemmedibi,Standing in the shadow of giants.,3,22 October 2017,"I broke a taboo and went to see the Film Which Shouldn't Have Been Made, aka Blade Runner 2049. And regretted it.Not quite sure which bit was the worst, so I'll start from the good ones. CGI was the biggest player and reaching levels never seen before. Rachael gave me, indeed, the goose bumps. Photography was gorgeous but in many ways not comparable to the original. The 2049 version of Pris was as good as the original, and not because of CGI, which is nice. The BR1-way of nice, which had no CGI.Lots of juicy bits to take us for a wonderful trip down memory lane, but all these great bits seem to have been scripted to make a replica(-nt) of the original film. They are not hidden somewhere to let the audience spot them and delight with their discovery. Beside the cameos played by the original actors, the numerous references to the first film are a substantial part of the footage. They are not nuanced, they are slapped in the face of the public in inescapable order: car zooming over LA (check), Pris (check), origami (check), exotic animal dealer in seedy district (double check), PanAm (check), Coca-Cola billboards (check), Atari ads (check). And the list goes on.With that out of the way, let's face it, if it hadn't be for the CGI, the cameos and the plagiarism, the film had very little to offer. The soundtrack was horrid; bombastic, droning and uninspired much like Hans Zimmer's previous stuff. The repeating nods to the original soundtrack were coarse and, at the same time, they made his almost bearable. No stupid voice over of the very first BR theatrical version, but a big fat explanation right in the middle of the film, by a one-eyed replicant, in a scene that made me expect Tina Turner appear in leather clothes. Beside the gratuitous explanation, the plot is not as linear as one might expect, but it seems that all the ideas and influences have been, sort of, stitched in a hurry, cramming as much stuff as possible in a film that was already too long.The influence of ""Her"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709) is evident, but while Her had all the time to develop the psychological drama, in BR2049 the same ideas are badly developed, and CGI gets massively in the way, distracting from the drama.The first BR blurred the boundaries of good and evil, as much as human and artificial. In BR2049 we have the reappearance of the super villain, much like in a Marvel flick. All the good old stereotypes of Hollywood film making are back, and one is to wonder why the cavalry didn't make it for the gran finale.There are also good reasons to dislike the closing scene, which lets the audience leave the theatre with nothing to remember beside the special effects. The film should have ended right on that staircase and let us sink deep in K's existential agony. Which is amplified by its similarities to ours. But no, the scene, which is a bad copy of Roy's death (check), underlined by the same music (check), but not nearly the same pathos, is whisked aside in a hurry, and the happy ending cuts in. OK, Gosling is no Rutger Hauer, but his character had the same potential. Why did his death need to look so unimportant? BR1 led us to question what should be considered human and what is not; it shook our certainties. BR2049 seems to put that boundary firmly back in place: if you are not born, your feelings are just a delusional dream; you are a machine. Period.Given the profusion of prequels, trailers and whatnot, we had to endure, it is only to be expected a string of director's cuts. While the first Blade Runner had a history that unfolded throughout its several editions, due to its initial misunderstanding and its later rise to cult status, the repackaging of this one has probably been planned upfront, as a way to stand firmly in the shadow of the original film.While Blade Runner inspired generations, I won't be surprised if its sequel will soon be forgotten. As already written by someone else, Blade Runner 2049 looks like a flawed replicant and the only feeling you will be left with is a sense of regret for having wasted three hours of your life.",Blade Runner 2049

2183,hyloflix,Blade Runner 2049 is a Staggering Cinematic Achievement...,10,24 October 2017,"...and the only reason it's not a hit is because Millennials are either too stupid or not stoned enough to get it.Blade Runner 2049 is basically the greatest movie of all time, better than Citizen Kane, 2001, The Matrix, and 9 1/2 Weeks combined. Speaking of The Matrix, regardless of how poorly 2049 performs at the box office, it will soon be looked upon with the same reverence as that movie engenders. Except it's better. Way better. And you people who don't understand it or don't have the attention span or patience for it are complete idiots. I mean, to not appreciate the stunning photography and layered, philosophical storytelling means you likely have your heads so far up your ill-informed butts that you probably have crusty fecal matter covering your thick, rectal-dwelling craniums. To have anything less than a stunned wonder and mind-blown reaction to Director Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece of futuristic bleakness and post-apocalyptic beauty means you're probably a giant ignoramus or complete and total knob job.As worthy a sequel that's ever been committed to celluloid, the film stands alone as likely the greatest achievement in a medium and industry that doesn't even deserve to have it as a moving artwork to be judged, reviewed, or worse — casually dismissed as being (whine! whine!) almost three hours long. Waaaahhhhh! THIS is a fully realized vision of a near future so brilliantly complex and persuasively shot that you'll be crapping your pants in the theater, and holding your breath through every meticulously realized landscape and lovingly crafted set piece, you giant tools.And seriously, has anyone ever worn a cooler jacket than Ryan Gosling's Joe? It makes Steve McQueen's jacket from The Great Escape look like a preppy Member's Only circa 1983, it's like if Mad Max went to T.J. Maxx and found the most bad-ass jacket from 2020, got it all weathered and worn looking during the entire Black Out of 2022, and then waited.One of the main reasons this movie won't be a financial success is that audiences don't seem to like movies that are close to three hours long. You know what? Screw you! I know for a fact you've binge watched Netflix shows like, nine hours in a row. You can sit through two hours and forty-six minutes of sheer story brilliance, subtle pacing, and seamlessly integrated special effects portraying a terrifyingly prescient near future of such compelling intimacy and epic sci-fi scope that you're a giant festering d-bag for even thinking it's anything less than the best movie man ever created.Amazingly, it achieves all this with the handicap of presenting a leading actor that's so goddamned handsome it takes you out of the detailed world and thought-provoking story to make you question if you're actually gay. And if you already are gay, it makes you wonder if you're REALLY happy with your current partner and wouldn't rather spend every waking hour in the movie theater watching Blade Runner 2049 as much as possible before the theater chain owners decide to prematurely pull this masterpiece from the complex to make room for Daddy's Home 2. Are you kidding me? That's what's replacing Blade Runner 2049? I hate humanity. We will totally deserve what happens to us as portrayed in Blade Runner 2049.Alas, I could feel a sense of a certain fanboy surrounding me in the theater. An element of the crowd that saw congested, ethnically diverse future Los Angeles not as humanity's common will to survive man-made disasters and to use technology to counter the sheer hopelessness of a bleak existence, but as proof that, ""see — this is what happens when everyone doesn't speak American or we let in too many immigrants."" This dread only increased as it seemed a lot of the bad guys were black, or women,and when women were being hurt or killed I felt a strange sense of satisfaction wafting over the seats from the two guys behind me who I'm quite certain have never actually been laid. My suspicions were confirmed later, when the scenes of Gosling's virtual girlfriend Joi began to play out. Yes, she's very hot. So hot, that the definitely never-been-laid jack-hole sitting behind me laughed and uttered, ""Damn, I'd hit that."" And I wasn't quite sure if he meant in a gross, somewhat sexual way or just in a domestic violence, masking his deep-rooted hatred of women and acting out on feelings of inadequacy kind of way. I figured it was both, and not only did it creep me out, but it took me away from pondering the larger questions of what is real, what is human, and what is the meaning of existence? So much to unpack; I mean Harrison Ford's down but not out DECKARD! Jared Leto doing creepy Jared Leto things! Luv kicking ass! The return of Rachel! Edward James Olmos making more origami, standing and delivering as Gaff again! Although technically I think he may have been sitting and delivering-- still a great performance. A lot of other really amazing things happened, but honestly my mind was kind of wandering because of how awesome it all was and how stupid I realized the people who watched this and didn't like, understand, or tolerate the nearly three hour run time were. It made me so mad it almost ruined my high. That's also why I probably don't remember a lot of what happened.Anyhow, go see this movie in the theater now before it's too late. And remember, you heard it here first; Blade Runner 2049 will be remembered as the greatest movie ever made that didn't live up to somewhat rosy box office projections for a sequel to a thirty-year old movie that was shot and made with such craft, care, and technical precision that you insipid clowns totally don't appreciate or deserve.",Blade Runner 2049

This is the worst film I've seen in years. The only reason I did not leave the cinema in the middle of this movie is because I usually give film the benefit of the doubt, because you never know when the plot twist comes. And, oh, believe me, you don't know how I much I regret this decision. When the ""plot twist""came (which is pretty much at the end of this 3 hour movie), I have already decided what a waste of time it was to watch this movie, so I did not care one bit about it. The director Denis Villeneuve tries to make his films ""brainy"" and ""confusingly intelligent"" like those directed by the great director Christopher Nolan. The cinematography of the two directors's films are stunning, however Villeneuve's film can only be described as confusing, dull and stupid. They are so focused on the CGI, that they forgot to hire a screenwriter Cliché and boring storyline filled with unnecessary violence and disgusting bugs. Nowadays, CGI can no longer satisfy and fool us, you can't hide a horrible storyline behind specials effects, IT JUST WON'T WORK ANYMORE.

2189,mikly-78385,Simply another excrescent sequel,1,2 November 2017,"Once upon a time a splendid science fiction movie showed up in the theaters, based on the intelligent novel of the great writer Philipp K. Dick: Blade Runner! Although deservedly very successful, this unique masterpiece remained untroubled by any unnecessary sequel for 35 years.Meanwhile the science fiction genre has moved on. Very nice approaches showed up concerning AI, such as 'Ex Machina' and 'Her'. When the original 'Blade Runner' picked up the subject, long after the godfather of AI movies 'Metropolis' (1927) by Fritz Lang, it created an outstanding breathtaking cutting-edge vision of a future at stake, which needed not a single frame, a single word, a single tone more to have its role perfectly played. To show up with a sequel to a masterpiece is certainly a high risk. Almost all attempts have failed. This one failed completely as much as none of all sequels before have failed that I have seen. In fact it even has failed to be a mean movie at all when excluding the attempt of being a sequel: Reams of illogical settings and acting, poor dialogues, no pace, unimaginative landscapes, incoherent music, partly implausible roles, a dystopia where the questions of AI are odd an contrived. And, maybe the worst in case of a boring movie is: the length. To copy a great idea, to staple together some actors, frames and tones doesn't make a movie for a long time yet. This a failing movie as a movie and a disaster as a sequel. All in all I would recommend to everyone who loved the original and considers to go to cinema for this movie: Save your time! Rather get the original and watch that one, again and again, and you're much better off!

It boggles the mind that they released an expensive movie that has no point to make and no care to destroy the classicness of Blade Runner.There was a cool headquarters, cool hologram technology and advertising and sexy women. Those deserve points, but what is with the very corny and jaded dialogue? the script was bad and the lines were worse. Compare to the original Blade Runner!People, think twice before attending silly Marvel films, boring Star Wars films and the next 5 Ghostbusters. They are boring and insult your intelligence and their legacy. I am done with these thieving sequels.",Blade Runner 2049

Or maybe Schikaneder (his ""producer"") commissioned another composer to do it. If so, then it is forgotten and for a good reason, I suppose. You should do the same with ""Blade Runner 2049"". Like with another iconic science fiction movie that has been vandalized by a sequel - ""2001 - a Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick -, a respected director, a cast of capable actors and an eager effects department try and fail to rekindle the magic. They achieve interest, not more. Interest in the plot (""interesting twist""), the visual design (great)and the philosophical background (been there, done that).I saw the original (again) one week before watching the sequel.

It is a very long movie, and that sometimes makes works for movies (see films like Titanic). Perhaps that is more of a commentary on society, but I digress. The movie does seem to move at quite a slow pace, but it allows you time to think on the details and craft theories and most importantly appreciate the amazing cinematography. This is far and above the greatest part of the movie. It is hands down the most beautiful and visually stunning movie I have ever seen by a wide margin. The only movie I can think of that comes close is the first Sicario. The legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins topped all his previous work (Sicario,No Country for Old Men, Skyfall) with this. On top of this the acting is top notch. The dialogue and actors provide some of the best in recent history. Personally, I think Harrison Ford's was the worst in the film, so that should say something. In the end, not everyone will like the movie, and that's understandable with how it did at the box office. But if you want to see a real piece of cinema history and arguable the greatest looking film made to date, you won't be disappointed.

Director Denis Villeneuve respects the original film and avoids typical Hollywood cliché. This is not a film, it's an experience. An experience that is best to go in with no spoilers. Denos Villeneuve avoids giving away the plot in the traliers and this is one of those films where the promos and tralier doesn't give anything away.

level. The only reason I kept watching was the deliberated
cinematography and the soundtrack, both pastiches of the
original but still very much quality compared to most of
the last 15 years of holywood output. I did however expect 
the visuals and soundtrack to push the envelope and deliver
something fresh.Plot for this story when compared to the original, again

When I found out he was in Blade Runner 2049 I had a suspicion this wasn't going to go well. What a terrible boring actor. All of the actors are just picking up paychecks. The only decent actor is
Ana de Armas, the rest are boring, script is boring, visuals are boring, music is boring. Three hours of BORING, snoozeville. 
I loved the original Blade Runner, what a huge letdown. Don't waste your money, rent the original instead. 
Will Hollywood ever release another decent movie? Ninety percent of everything that comes out to theater is either rehash of rehash, or uninspired ripoff of something we've seen over and over again.

It is respectful and different while obviously a Bladerunner movie, and unlike Scott with his new Alien films, did not titilate to eventually disappoint.There is little dialogue early on, and the lead actor plays a fabulous brooding role that while nothing like Fords character, is still somehow familiar, slightly lost and tortured!Some of the actors chosen for other parts are spot on, and simply put if you liked the first film you will love this.The initial score that makes you feel at home, the environment, the fantasy, the billboards, everything will make you feel at home.Yes, it's long, but who cares, it is worth it.",Blade Runner 2049

There is no comparison to the original one which had a great story, great special effects and great performances by everyone, especially Harrison Ford.BR2 continues the fabulous, and classy, special effects, stunning scenaries and powerful music. Actor performances however are not up to par here. Only Gosling stands out, playing his role very convincingly. Leto does allright but should never have been cast in this type of role. It's not up his alley. But most surprisingly, Ford disappoints. His role is cliche and unconvincing and the way his part is weaved into the story is clumsy. I think in large part that Ford's performance is weak because his role is not well connected to the storyline which is terribly weak to begin with and which never climaxes in anything surprising or even sensible.The story starts great, but then looses momentum and never recovers. Had there been a great story, that could have saved the movie. But the bottom line is that, again, we have one of these ""Marvel"" like follow-up movies which persistently suffer from good screenplays and try to survive on special effects and visuals.

The movie never got better, it had no plot, the acting was horrible. I don't usually take the time to write reviews on anything but this movie sucked so bad that i felt compelled to go against all the great reviews this movie received. There are only two ways which i think this can be rated so high, first if the people watching it were on drugs, stoned, or drunk. There might be enough with the music and visual effects to make someone have a surreal moment of this movie being worth watching. The other way there is a way for this movie to considered good is if you are looking to see is a possible future of the world, there are good visual effects, a potential of how the world might turn out and the idea of AI becoming part of society and then gaining a conscience. This is worth 15 minutes of, wow that is cool or would be interesting but after 2 and half hours of this, it even gets ruined and is boring. There was potential for this to be a great movie but like too many movie productions it gets too artistic with no substance.

2230,mfox-55557,Disappointment for this Blade Runner fan,4,24 February 2018,"The original Blade Runner is an important film for me, so I understood that this sequel would have to do well to live up to my expectations.
I have therefore pondered a lot before arriving at my conclusions.The film is visually impressive and just about interesting enough to hold my attention for it's very long duration. That's all the good things I can say.Now for the bad....
The story is not that interesting and does not explore any new ideas - and let's not forget that Philip K Dick was all about the ideas.
The story hinges upon the motivations of characters that are poorly explained e.g. the ludicrously, comically evil Wallace who has taken over the replicant factory desperately needs to know how to make replicants breed because that will help humans conquer the galaxy. Really?
Meanwhile Ryan Gosling's police woman boss desperately wants all traces of such replicant breeding to be erased because if people find out the world will end. Really?Ryan Gosling's character was wooden. I think he wore one facial expression for the whole film - and this doesn't seem to justified by the fact that he's a replicant as we've seen many of those across the 2 films with a lot more life than him. This hampered my ability to sympathise with him as the lead character.The female character's in the film were weak or thinly written. The strongest character was Wallace's evil henchwoman - but her strength lay purely in her kick boxing abilities. No explanation was offered as to why she was so evil.Compounding all of this was the gratuitious female nudity - a lot which was of giant holographic proportions. Why oh why? Was this film made in 2017 or 1965?All in all a missed opportunity I think.",Blade Runner 2049

2232,austins_gone_wild,Went on an hour too long,5,8 March 2018,"I thought the film was pretty good and stayed true to the original bladerunner up until the point Ryan Gosling's character found ""the person he was looking for"", and then the film seemed to completely change in tonality, seemed rushed for the next hour, and was very amateurish and unoriginal/uncreative in tying together the plot and trying to add in unnecessary plot twists which were completely predictable and vanilla. The last hour of this film ruined the film. They should've ended it after 2 hours leaving us in suspense still wondering if they had to, but it would've been a much, much more respected sequel than the hollywood generic garbage that ensued for the last hour of this film. You give me ample time or put me in a room with creative heads and I could've thought of a much better ending to this that didn't require an extra hour of garbage.Until the last hour, the scenery stayed true to the original, the tone stayed true to the original with the slow, plodding pace (although it couldve used one more little action sequence at least, it was much slower than the original and needed one or two small action filled scenes to keep viewers alert..this was obvious) and Ryan Gosling was a good cast for the role. The characters weren't very well-developed, but i think most of the transient characters in the first bladerunner were only so well developed anyways. I will repeat for the final time, about the 2 hour point where ""he found the person he was looking for"" shouldve been the ending, and it shouldve been a whole different ending that didn't necessarily have to have this wanna-be super complex plot with these forced predictable twists, it couldve been something simple that left us in wonder, or something simple that lead to finality and conclusion, which the original mainly did with a hint of wonder. They got the end totally wrong and managed to take this film from a rare film that got a sequel right into a steaming pile of mediocrity, disappointment, and quite honestly, based on plot and conclusion, a film that was probably a 2/10 at best but is at least saved by the visuals and the similarity of the first 2 hours to the original bladerunner.",Blade Runner 2049

It had everything else, fantastic special effects, you did feel you were there, the acting was excellent albeit working with such a bad script. I honestly believe the script writers are replicants.

The direction and cinematography were perfect though they don't match the look and feel of the original in every way, which is a little off-putting if you've just seen the original before watching 2049. The acting is *much* better than what you see in the 1982 original. God knows Harrison Ford hasn't emoted so much in any role in the last 30 years. And Gosling was outstanding; I really don't get the reservations so many people seemed to have when it was announced he was going to be starring. Ana de Armas (Joi) was wonderful. Robin Wright played Robin Wright excellently as always. I felt Jared Leto was a weak link in the cast. And I say that as someone who really liked his Joker in Suicide Squad. And given how (over)used he was this is a real problem with the movie. Sadly, Sylvia Hoeks (Luv) is no Rutger Hauer (assuming she was intended to take that role, which isn't necessarily so and that also is a problem). There was, thankfully, no sexual assault/rape scene passed off as a seduction like there was in the original. -.- 2049 falls short of the original Blade Runner in several categories. But comparing it to the original is a really high bar. It's no shame that it falls a bit short. That still makes it one hell of a good movie.I give it a 9/10 and would absolutely recommend it. Go see it at the big screen. The bigger the better.Like I said I liked the movie. But...

2240,magnus-00193,So boring i almost fell asleep,1,3 August 2018,"Saw this movie when it came on viaplay and the first 15 min or so it seemed promising. I kept waiting for something to happen... some action, some mystery or just a small thrilling moment that made my pulse raise a little bit... that diddnt happen. I felt almost Zero connection to any of the characters with the exeption of the AI girlfriend who had a tiny bit of substance.
The visuals However was very impresive but the lack of anything happening in Said visuals made me realize i could Archive the same amount of visual excitement looking at photos on google. Because of the visuals i would give it Maybe 2-3 out of 10 but because everyone might not be put off by the lack of action the same way as me i could understand if the user rating was at a mixed/mediocre rating of 6. However this movie does definitly not deserve an 8.1 rating and to help pull that rating Down on a level that matches the quality of this movie i am going to give it 1 Star.",Blade Runner 2049

2243,jojowhats,Why?,1,23 June 2018,"I can't believe this movie got made, it was really horrible. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer in the original movie were fantastic and that movie was ground breaking but this movie is slow and dull, and not worthy to have the name Blade Runner in the title. The new lead playing opposite Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard is no Harrison Ford in his prime, nor did I care for the villain whose character is one dimensional, I laughed at one point because I thought is the actor going to twirl his mustache? In the original film the villain Roy Betty, is played by Rutger Hauer who is great actor and I will always remember his monologue on the roof at night in the pouring rain with Harrison Ford, but he was given a phenomenal script. Perhaps a better a script, a re-edit and a different cast and it might have been great film as well. But with what they have made here don't waste your time on this film. Watch the Original it is timeless and perfection it self.Jo",Blade Runner 2049
2244,jg-facebook,Pretty Vacant,2,5 July 2018,"Waited and purchased on 4k UHD.There's a rumor that there was a 4 hour cut of this film. Perhaps it would be better than this offering.
There were not enough people that K interacted with throughout the film that *could* be the person of interest. Zero obfuscation, zero respect for the audience IQ.My biggest beef though...
Humans are out to kill any nexus 8 or below because... Why?
Start of film, K arrives at a farm and ""Retires"" a Nexus 8.
Marvelous. What was accomplished?
A Nexus 8 was living out the remaining years of it's life, isolated, cultivating food for humans.
K had no clue anything else was going on, neither did the humans ordering him about.
K stumbles upon the possibility that a Nexus could reproduce. 
At this point, the only ""person"" who could possibly know would be Wallace, with his access to old records.The cartoon ""Blackout"", while pretty, is a trend that annoys me immensely.
Because it's proof of a mediocre director.What I see is:
""I can't make a movie that encompasses all the points that make it cohesive, so I relay on the expertise of others to convey the meaning that escapes my efforts to make a film"". But let's market it as something ""For the Fans!""There's a trend in art to deliver sub par dross. The ""artiest"" can't let the ""art"" to stand on it's own, because it would be seen as being no better than a two year old's crayon drawing stuck to the fridge. To justify the price, said crayon drawings justification comes with a 3000 word dissertation about what it represents, normally involving the current political trends.Like Big Bang Theory pointing out that Indy had zero effect on the outcome, this film feels like everything would be solved in 20 or 30 years because all the older Nexus models would have died and nobody would have been bothered.",Blade Runner 2049

Film-making is very similar to the original Blade Runner, and can be considered good, but for me should always be secondary to the plot. Wouldn't classify as sci-fi in my opinion, and not fantastic enough to be fantasy either.",Blade Runner 2049
2246,leo-07771,Deserved more recognition,10,31 July 2018,After years of no sequel and the idea of a sequel being announced with some love and hate towards it we finally got the sequel we deserved Blade Runner 2049 is how a sequel should be. With amazing visuals and cinematography & great performances from the cast with an intriguing story that really kept me watching. Denis vileneuve has shown in the past he's a competent director with prisoners and Sicario being his most well known but by far this is one of his best films. Hans Zimmer also composed for the film and even though it's spectacular this films need for music is not needed with it at times being so quiet and beautiful the bang from an explosion or step of a foot is just riveting to hear if I'm to be honest but when his music plays it's stunning working so well especially the third act with the final action scene and also the peacfullness of hearing tears in the rain once again in a cinema I highly recommend this film as it deserves more praise though it did from reviewers knowing not many people watched it saddened me to hear as if it got more attention we most definitely would've heard more about it.,Blade Runner 2049

2248,kylaregan,Did NOT get the hate for Blade Runner 2049. At all.,9,18 August 2018,"Blade Runner 2049 was gorgeous. That much, no one can deny. As someone who was only generally understanding of the first Blade Runner film, I have to admit that I had a lot of catching up to do. However, after some research (and a genuine pledge to finally watch the original in its entirety), I can thoroughly say that this movie does not deserve the hate it has gotten. I have honestly never written a movie review.From start to finish, the movie was beautiful in its essence, using many geometric shapes, and also overlaying environments with different elemental patterns. I was entranced by just about every scene. Usually, a film can handle doing this for a few consequential scenes, but the fact that Blade Runner 2049 seems to do it so artistically and seamlessly in every scene seems nothing less than magic.For all the viewers lambasting that the only true lure is the feminine form, and that they are likely to only think of the female characters as eye-candy for their later self-gratifications... Ew. Methinks most of the fault in this area lies in the fact that you view almost all women as objects in movies. The women in the movie (while very idealistic, but hey, they are REPLICANTS) serve very important roles, and do not merely fall to being props. I was happy with the roles they served.The story, while a bit drawn out, is nonetheless full of emotion and feeling, making it easy to stay with. It may not have been a very fast-pasted, easy-to-understand sci-if story, but it was extremely fleshed-out. The questions I was left with didn't seem to be pointing toward a sequel, but rather a need to re-watch. Plot-holes that some users have pointed to in the fact that 'K' COULDN'T have denied his programming and lied to his superiors because he's a replicant is completely moot because that is what Deckard in-fact did. And also why the whole idea that created beings cannot deviate. A central theme in the original as well.I could go on and on about the complaints that I've seen, but I honestly think it would fall on deaf ears. This movie was sooo soooo well worth the cost of renting. I hadn't expected much after the dismal reviews, but I was oh, so pleasantly surprised. It's rare that I find the reviews to be oh-so completely wrong. But I'm glad I took a chance. Everyone involved (especially Ana de Armas!) should be so proud of what they created. All the creepy weirdos who subscribe to the ""if I can't see myself having sex with it, it isn't valid!"" school of cinematography, no need to review this movie.",Blade Runner 2049

2250,SunshineSukie,Blade Runner 2049,8,26 October 2020,"This is a review I wrote in 2017 for Blade Runner 2049 - the much awaited sequel to the hauntingly spectacular original directed by Ridley Scott.Whilst Denis Villenueve has forged his own path with the second instalment of this futuristic tale of humans and replicants, there were certainly enough nods to the original to ensure that this was indeed a close relative if not 'brothers'. The cinematography was visually amazing - the USA of the not too distant future depicted awash with red dust, almost post-apocalyptic deserted cities and given recent political shenanigans in the real US., possibly not surprisingly, a great deal of Russian influence in the style and culture of the remaining social and architectural landscape.Gosling provides us with the dour yet stoic 'K/Joe', our titular character as the Blade Runner, tasked with rounding up remaining old-style replicants from an Earth which has pretty much been destroyed by humans, most of whom have since elected to live 'off world'. The few remaining humans carry out their day to day life amid a society which is largely occupied by modern replicants who seem to have found their own level or semblance of 'life'.The normally delectable Jared Leto could be criticised for his performance as blind creator of the replicant civilisation, Wallace, but I would disagree. His jarring, slightly wooden and emotionless depiction of one of the highest placed humans in terms of social and economic stature, cleverly illustrates that the most inhuman being in this dark world is in fact made of flesh and blood.The ever-present driving rain makes even the broadest vista seem strangely claustrophobic as our hero makes a life-changing discovery and invites the viewer to question their own life, it made me ask 'what kind of human am I?' 'Am I all that I can be?' Whether intended or not, I feel the message is that life, in whatever form it has been presented, is a gift and it is up to every single being to make sure that it isn't wasted.All in all a stunning film that although may never match the raw emotion of Rutger Hauer's final 'tears in the rain' soliloquy, it offers a simple yet age old message that is creatively delivered and stylishly told.",Blade Runner 2049
2251,tahsinatalay,Much appreciation after second watch,7,13 September 2019,After watching the movie a second time i was able to appreciate it more than the first time around. The choice of stylistic aesthetics for the visuals were pretty sweet and the Soundtrack let's you immerse into the slowly unfolding plot which i found pretty open until the end. One of those movies i regret not watching it in the cinema.,Blade Runner 2049
2252,jackanddrew,Fascinating,9,4 September 2018,Just as in the first movie this movie also touches on what it means to be human while also adding elements of what real love is and whether these machines can even have it.,Blade Runner 2049
2253,vikassunny,What did I watch.,1,9 September 2018,"Watched this movie, it was pathetically slow and hardly any storyline. 8.1 rating...must be done mistakenly...worst action movie so far, slowest in such a way that you can doze of and woke up to see story hardly have moved. Post movie I asked myself...what did I watch.",Blade Runner 2049
2254,frankbreitgoff,From Descartes to Kafka,8,26 September 2018,"Iwas very excited about BR2049, especially when I heard that Villeneuve is the director.
He created impressive scenes, full of bizarre and wonderful details like the ""basic test"", the dog and the holograms from the sixties/seventies in Deckards home, the threesome between replicants plus hologram, etc.But something is missing: A good story, not only intellectual and logical but also moving.
The searches and fights of Joe K. in BR2049 leads to nothing and nowhere, 
If Villenueve is brave enough to present us an artificial hero and let us walk mainly in his shoes for over 2 hours, then let him win, give the audience something to be happy about.
This doesnt necessarily need a flat happy ending. In Ridley Scotts BR the replicant Roy shows all his hero abilities in the last scenes: Saving Deckards life , showing empathy, overcomimg his melancholy and accepting his own death.Indeed more human than the humans.
Joe K's melancholy just ends in static depression. He is on a wrong path from the beginning. Maybe the story of Blade Runner was already told to the end in Ridley Scott's movie, Villeneuve needed all his artistic power to squeeze this respectable work out of the given storyline",Blade Runner 2049

The Visuals are stunning the world built in the movie is beautiful staying true to the original Blade Runner while adding a neon flair to most scenes in the movie creating an atmosphere that will stay with you far after your viewing, While not having quite the same emotional impact on the audience as the original had, this movie should be seen as an extension to Blade Runner not a sequel, an extension that serves the original much credit to its basis and atmosphere.",Blade Runner 2049

Every scene, every second, every frame and every square inch of the picture is pure cinematic perfection.
