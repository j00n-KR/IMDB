0,SnoopyStyle,trying to be another cool vampire movie,5,23 October 2021,"Vampires exist but they have kept their existence a secret except for a select group. They made an agreement with the human authorities. They agree not to kill and drink from only those who consent. They have become rich and powerful while living the high life during the nights. Benny (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) is reckless teen. His brother recruits him to take over his driving job for the night. He has sexy Blaire (Debby Ryan) and Zoe (Lucy Fry) as his clients. They are making several stops and intends to finish before sunrise. He has no idea that they are vampires.This movie tries to be cool like a nightclub that you can't get into. The funny thing about those nightclubs is that they look trashy in the full light of day. This movie tries to be another cool nightclub but closer examination leaves it wanting. First, I don't like Benny. He's a stereotypical bratty teen. It would work better for him to be roped into the job. He would gain more rooting interest if he's less brash. As for this world building, it's haphazard and half done. Apparently, there is vast conspiracy and nobody outside of it knows anything about it. The plot is a bit thin. This movie is a bit thin.",Night Teeth
1,nogodnomasters,Can I drive?,5,7 November 2021,"This is another vampires vs. Humans in LA film. Victor (Alfie Allen) breaks the truth by kidnapping Maria (Ash Santos) Jay's (Raúl Castillo) girlfriend. While Jay goes after Victor his brother Benny (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) chauffeurs two lovely vampires around the city as they kill for Victor.Nice looking women. Megan Fox has a minor role. But it is pretty much of the same stuff.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Night Teeth
2,kosmasp,Take a bite,8,8 November 2021,"Morally speaking you may have some issues with the movie. It does also not warrant for you to overthink the whole concept or certain actions or think things true (like the concept and construct of the world portrayed here). So in other words: do cut this some slack please - for your own sake.If you do that and don't have issues with a little (or a lot of) blood ... go ahead and watch this. It sort of treats both genders almost equally. Well if you can attest genders to vampires that is. And also it may more be the expectations of the viewers. I'd say there is a lot of respect for the viewers - which is quite a good thing.Very good cinematography and what a pool of actors involved. Even in smaller roles it's like ... I know him/her. Well at least that is true with me. Fast paced, after a bit of a slow start with quite a lot of exposition, the movie takes off and never stops ... and certainly does not take prisoners ... well maybe literally speaking. The cliches are hidden well and the movie works quite fine - again suspension of disbelief necessary as stated above.",Night Teeth
3,paul_haakonsen,But everything was essentially just pointless...,2,23 October 2021,"Wow, this movie was a swing and a miss. Now, vampire movies are sort of a mixed lot for me, but I opted to watch the 2021 Netflix movie ""Night Teeth"" on the odd chance that it might be an appealing and entertaining one.But as it turned out, then ""Night Teeth"" from writer Brent Dillon and director Adam Randall was not a movie that had much of any appeal to me whatsoever. There was just so very little worthwhile sinking your teeth into here.First of all, the storyline was insanely slow paced and devoid of anything interesting or exciting, so I gave up on the movie not even halfway through. Yeah, the movie was that boring for me, so I didn't even bother with sticking around to watch more of that pointless nonsense that was supposed to be a storyline.The character gallery in ""Night Teeth"" was every bit as devoid of anything interesting as the storyline was. So writer Brent Dillon didn't score any points here either. I am sure that the actors and actresses that participated in this Netflix movie were doing good jobs, but they just had nothing to work with in terms of script and characters.""Night Teeth"" failed entirely to entertain me, and this was a vampire movie that just lacked a bite.My rating of ""Night Teeth"" lands on a generous two out of ten stars, and that is mostly based on the production value alone. If you enjoy a good vampire movie, you might want to skip on this stinker.",Night Teeth
4,Calicodreamin,Aimless sexiness,6,21 October 2021,"Night teeth oozed with sexiness, which is always appreciated in Vampire Noir. However, when taking a deep dive into the plot, it was a bit aimless and lacked depth. Almost like arriving at a game already in progress and leaving before it finishes.",Night Teeth
5,ops-52535,its a l.a. story....,6,21 October 2021,"About two young aenemic vixens doing the strip in l.a., hunting for the source to increase and maintain their magnetical attraction, and stay healthy for a couple more years, but something didnt work out as planned. Their chauffour of the limo they hired had been skipped with a younger and inexperienced driver without iron ion ores as they urge for, and completely estranged in such a high level of social clubbing, and for him it all becomes a fight to survive to see next mornings daylight...its a hip hop scored movie, far better than id expected, acting are sincere and cruel, and except from not driving a deville, they love to blow the horns and neckkisses and fanging bullets with the tip of a tounge. Calm down ...its not a roadtrip movie, it stays at boleyn heights close to the skid row, and theodore roosevelt high so some familiar places you will find.Its neatly filmed, special effect qualifies, some small glitches on the editing, for the rest its fine. So if your in for a night with vlads cousines, then be my guest. Its a better film than much made of the genre over the last 10 years thinks the grumpy old man.",Night Teeth
6,UniqueParticle,I love how one of the top reviewers said Collateral without Tom Cruise but with vampires,8,31 October 2021,"(Debby Ryan) Blaire is worth watching in my opinion I'd love to see her anything else! I'm not fully sure why this is getting a bad rep except some of stale moments even those are very little. The music is excellent, mystery is quite intriguing, cinematography is great and the entertainment value is pretty solid. I'm glad I decided to watch this vampire thrill ride!",Night Teeth
7,Thanos_Alfie,Below average...,4,28 October 2021,"""Night Teeth"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a chauffeur picks up two mysterious women and soon figures out that they are not common women. He will find himself between some unbelievable truths about the world he lives in and he will have to fight for his life too.I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I was not disappointed by it. The plot was simple and there were some plot holes that were not explained. The interpretations of Jorge Lendeborg Jr. Who played as Benny, Lucy Fry who played as Zoe and Debby Ryan who played as Blaire were good but not good enough to save the movie. Since Alfie Allen (Victor) and Megan Fox (Grace) did not have much time in the movie there are not many things I can tell about them. To sum up, I have to say that ""Night Teeth"" is an average vampire movie to spend your time with if you have not any other movie to watch, do not have any expectations by it otherwise you will be disappointed.",Night Teeth
8,yusufpiskin,Megan Fox Covered In Blood Cinematic Universe,2,20 October 2021,"When was the last time you thought, 'I've seen very few things worse than this'? Well, this movie will make up for your lack of it.Thanks for the MFCiBCU fans.",Night Teeth
9,Pairic,Good bloodsucking fun,7,22 October 2021,"Night Teeth: An LA (and World) where a secret pact was sealed between humans and vampires 100 years ago, vampires would only take blood by consent. Now a rogue vampire Victor and his minions have broken that pact, slaying humans and the vampire lords. We see nightclubs where humans are strapped to tables, eager to be vampire groupies and give blood, suddenly their throats are torn out by Blaire (Debby Ryan) and Zoe (Lucy Fry). This dastardly duo proceed from club to club slaying the vampire leaders, they have hired Benny (Jorge Lendebourge Jr.) as their chauffeur, thinking he is his brother Jay (Raul Castillo) a human aware of the pact. Benny behaves like his namesake from Crossroads at first but his character develops as the plot unfolds. Vampire enforcers also get involved, clashing with the rogue vampires. Quite gory at times with the biting stabbing and crossbows; Victor literally has human prisoners on tap for blood. Most of the narrative proceeds relatively predictably but there are a few pleasant and disturbing plot turns. Good bloodsucking action and fun. Directed by Adam Randall, written by Brent Dillon. On Netflix. 7/10.",Night Teeth
10,gianmarcoronconi,Wonderful,10,22 October 2021,"Wonderful film of its kind, suitable for everyone and very entertaining. This film is to be seen without too many expectations because it is a light and well done film that does very well what it was created for. One thing this film excels in is making you feel the discomfort of the protagonist throughout the initial part and also manages to make the sexual tension between the protagonist and the vampire shine through well but perhaps too much.",Night Teeth
11,Sergiodave,Is there light at the end of the tunnel,6,10 November 2021,"Nothing original here folks, at least for 95% of the movie. Take style and ideas of vampire flicks from the last 40 years and combine, not necessarily using the best parts into one movie. Alfie Allen plays the big baddie, which doesn't work, playing a slave like in Game of Thrones, he can do; but menacing, don't make me laugh. There were 2 plusses, Jorge Lendeborge Jr. Who played Benny, he was believable and the ending, which gave me hope.",Night Teeth
12,legobuilderpro,Sucking blood,5,21 October 2021,"First I want to say that I like Vampires, meaning it sucks when Vampires are not portrayed correctly like how badly the Twilight movie series shows them. When they are portrayed right I enjoy the movie more.Night Teeth sounded promising when I read the plot, so I went on Netflix to check it out, now I have some things to say about it.I do like the acting of the main character and the 2 Vampires, it feels like effort was put into this which was nice seeing the time they spent on it was not put to waste.I actually did like the stuff Vampires do in this like sucking blood and fast healing, even keeping the simple weaknesses like the sun burning them. I like that they portrayed these Vampires as crime causing creatures that cause trouble.I liked the world they kind of set up and how there are certain rules in the truce between humans and Vampires, but there are some things that were small issues.The main evil Vampires or Vampire was a little over the top and I didn't feel like it fitted the situation of what was going on, also it can be slow at certain times but it wasn't that big a deal.This isn't a great movie but its not an awful movie, I think you should at least watch it because at least it got the idea of what Vampires are. I got to give it credit for that.",Night Teeth

This was one of those 'middle of the road' vampire films...I had my likes and dislikes. With a cast of former Disney or tean movie franchise stars, this felt more like Mean Girls than Lost Boys. I liked the fights a lot, but was dissappointed with the lack of gore and you want blood in a vampire film. The crappy story finalized things for me with it's predictable model. This is an ok watch, but keep your expectations low.",Night Teeth
14,apryla-58795,I'm looking around like...,5,4 November 2021,Anybody else sick of movies trying too hard? We get it already - vampire movies make money but that doesn't mean the industry gotta stop trying to make a good film. A bunch of people standing around looking like they are over everything with a bad attitude does not a good movie make.Having Megan Fox in this for 5 minutes tops just to get people to come to this is lame. Lucy Fry is just plain annoying AF throughout the whole film. The lead guy is not Hollywood material. They needed to clean him up more. He looked like a scuzzy drug dealer. When he had kissing scenes I wanted to throw up.The story doesn't really delve into much backstory. It just shows two girls driving around killing people in clubs. Lame storyline and lame characters.Nothing here to see...I guess you could say this movie sucks...but not in a good way.,Night Teeth
15,Stanlee107,This film bites but does not suck...,5,31 October 2021,"This film is essentially like Tom Cruise's Collateral (2004) but with vampires instead of a hitman... It is a decent enough ride & all in all had entertaining parts. This was stylised by The Blade Trilogy.It is not a bad way to spend 1 hour & 48 minutes of your time. It fortunately does not emulate the emo Twilight Saga & presents something that is decent enough for viewing. It is no Blade, From Dust to Dawn, but very few films are!",Night Teeth
16,kaefab,could have been a lot better,4,2 November 2021,This movie felt a lot like collateral with Tom Cruise and jamie foxx but with vampires.The story was really not that original and done like a zillion times.Its an okay way to pass a few hours but highly forgettable afterwards.,Night Teeth
17,destroyerwod,"Huge potential not fully achieved, yet fun to watch !",7,22 October 2021,"I was waiting a lot for this movie ever since i saw the first trailer. Its basically some of my favorite things mixed up, like vampires, love story, night of crazy things happening, it had all the ingredient for me to enjoy. Ultimately i did, but not as much as i wish i would have.The story between the 3 main characters is overall well developed, and it made a lot of sense what happens between them, but this come at the price of a lot of dialogue and parts of the movies where not much happen outside of that. The movie could had expend its mythology a lot more too and explain a few things like for instance why the 2 ladies are that strong compare to other vamps, or why Victor has the same tatoo as Benny's brother Jay. They definately seem to have a past together but its not really explained? Was Victor a former Vampire hunter? Or i totally missed it. Somehow i feel a series could had been better with this material at expending instead of a movie.I enjoyed the cameos of the more known actors altough ill admit Megan Fox as a vampire is something i wished lasted more than a few minutes.Ultimately its kind of weird, i enjoyed it, but i think i had set my expectations too high in the first place like it would be the ultimate vampire movie of the decade for me while it was just ""a fun time"". But its definately worth a watch. I also hope they make a sequel.",Night Teeth
18,Draysan-Jennings,Nothing special,5,20 October 2021,It started out ok but about halfway in it got a little boring. Some of long drawn out meaningless dialouge between Benny and Blaire almost put me to sleep. I wouldn't say it's the worst vampire movie out there and its definitely not the best. It's basically just another mediocre vampire film. 5 stars.,Night Teeth
19,gab-67599,Enjoyable,10,21 October 2021,"I loved the story and the cast was perfect. It was fun, reminded me of Fright Night and I loved that movie. As a vampire movie fan this was one for the books and very good. I will be honest through by then end it was nothing I had not seen before. But I understand it is hard to make new facts from old vampire movies . With the exception of Daybreakers. This one was good to pass the time with and I recommend if you enjoy vampire movie. I would have watch it just to see Debby Ryan's side grin. Everyone was eye candy in this movie, except Victor, just not my type.",Night Teeth
20,whitemanfromtowne,MTV popcorn,3,21 October 2021,The agenda of female masculinity is at the tipping point of utter nonsense and these films depicting white chicks only weighing a buck five being invincible has become real tiresome. This spin on vampires taking over is nothing more than MTV popcorn starring GOT Greyjoy and no talent having Megan Fox and her senseless cameo scene.,Night Teeth
21,draftdubya,Higher up on the Netflix scale of movies,8,26 October 2021,"If you look through my history then you'll know that I don't really like much of the turds on Netflix. This one was actually pretty good comparing to the other dreck on there. It was predictable that's why I couldn't give it a nine. It really a 5, but since I'm just judging this on Netflix made movies, I'll add 3 extra stars. Nothing is thrown in your face for political reasons.",Night Teeth
22,elliotte2,So much potential....wasted,3,24 October 2021,"This movie could have been an enjoyable horror or horror-comedy similar to The Babysitter. Except, nothing was funny or even remotely cute, there was no horror, most of the action scenes were off-camera and have not seen a protagonist so unlikeable since Tiger King. The main characters over-acted his part of playing stupid and naïve to the point of unwatchable. The plot which could have been simple enough was complicated by a completely unnecessary romance that caused the film to grind to a halt whenever there was dialogue. Also...you never fully know what is going on.Anyone over the age of 18(rephrase, anyone whose mental age is actually over 18) should take a pass.",Night Teeth

24,namob-43673,"Vampires, glamour, LA, sexy ladies, and great parties in an okay movie",6,24 October 2021,"A movie containing vampires, mansion parties with the rich in LA, two sexy girls on a rampage and also having Theon Greyjoy and the wonderful Megan Fox is of course a good watch no matter how bad the movie is in actuality.The negatives are few but notable. The main idea of Jay selling out his little brother to drive around vampires feels off and weird. That one of the ladies like the driver is okay, but not written good enough. A few further script misses also messes with the story. The worst though is that this movie do not really know what it want to be. Horror? Comedy? Vampire thriller? Action drama noir? The movie switches too often and have no clear direction and no clear goal which is what mainly reduce the score and the general feel of the movie. If this would have taken a more comedic road, or taken a more grim slasher road it would likely have made the movie better.The good stuff overweighs though with a great music score, high production value, great performances (all actors are great), and a decent story. Cinematography and directing is great. Although the ""love"" story between one vampire lady and the driver Benny is convoluted and off, it is still kinda fun. This could easily been cringe and cliche, and it sort of is but enough of the movie feel fresh and fun to make it decently enjoyable.I gave this a 6/10 which I think the movie deserves. The potential is higher, but sadly they did not nail it and the script is not great enough. As I said above they should have been clearer with intent, goal and script to really make this into a great movie or at least they could have made this into a classic. Also, as a final note, this could probably be a good game to play... or why not make this into a TV show? Been a while since we had a good vampire show playing out in Los Angeles.",Night Teeth
25,aprilsfriendorin,What even is this,3,5 November 2021,"Radio rebel turns into a vampire, wants to suck blood to fit in but also wants romance cause she's quirky and not like other vampires. That's it, that's the movie.",Night Teeth
26,royhectorkabanlit,Not as good as I had hoped for,6,21 October 2021,"Just not as good as I had hoped for. It is watchable, the Premise I think was decent, it tried to establish it's own Vampire Mythology like with the Underworld Series, and the Characterizations were pretty good.The Setting in glamorous Places were also nice to watch. However, there simply were too many loopholes, like how (Spoilers) come ""Victor"" and the other Vampire Families only had a few ""Soldiers""?What was so special about these 2 Girls that they were able to easily take down the other Vampires? I was hoping they answered that in the Movie, but they didn't.On a Side Note, Debby Ryan looks very much like a young Geena Davis to the point that I thought they were closely related, but they're not.",Night Teeth
27,isaacochoterena,Bad story,4,25 October 2021,"The script of this film constantly fails when we want to enter this universe.The film can be attractive in terms of performances, photography, well-executed action scenes, and by generating curiosity about this story. But it falls into familiar conveniences and cliches of the vampire genre, many things are not justified, there is no good character development, there are many script holes, the plot twist is predictable, and the ending is very convenient and unsatisfying.The development of this story fails and the universe it introduces, being one more vampire movie, ends up being forgettable and predictable.",Night Teeth
28,elenaphysics,netflix did it again,3,27 October 2021,"I am trying not to be biased against netflix productions.But this movie was ridiculous.The story is weak and the main protagonist is a loser.His brother who hunts vampires (without us knowing how he got to this point) is a complete idiot.His girlfriend gets abducted and he knows that the vampires are out to get him and what does he do?He gives his (more stupid) brother his professional ride and asks him to pretend it is him.The love story between the loser and the vampire is ridiculous and totally unconvincing.At the end he becomes a vampire and wants to lure the couple he does not like in to the car.The only reason I gave 3 stars is because I have watched even worse vampire movies.At least this one had decent cinematography.Megan Fox appeared for 3 minutes only to die without even showing in the camera.The movie follows the rule tell don't show. They were too lazy to show things and the vampires were shouting
exposition all the time, explaining everything we could have seen in the movie.As a plot, what they do is similar to the first Blade movie. A vampire tries to take out everyone else in power.And he does it by sending his two vampire girls. There was nothing establishing why this was even possible.How Victor was that strong and able to kill so many vampires on his own. How the two vampire girls were able to kill so many
vampires at the parties they were attending.What was so special about them anyway?And I am afraid that there will be a sequel. Since Maria was killed off camera and Victor was supposedly eating her at the diner.But I think she was turned into a vampire the way Blade's mother was turned into a vampire.I hope there won't be a sequel. All characters were unlikeable. The brother who hunts vampires has that stupid look on his face 24/7 , he looks sad all the time.The loser is a bad actor as well. He sees them killing people and he doesn't even react.I am sad because I haven't seen a decent vampire movie for a very long time.",Night Teeth

No, but it is a lot of fun. The characters feel like they're a mix of 'Fright Night (1984)' & 'The Lost Booys (1987)'. The movie fully embraceds it's B-Movie nature. A Perfect 10/10!",Night Teeth
31,DaegT,A Night less ordinary for a college boy,8,20 October 2021,"Admit that the story is nothing groundbreaking. A moonlighting college boy has an exceptionally ordinary night. But it's still a very entertaining story.I almost believe that it's in fact a love story. Baddies are not bad. All fighting scenes are not punchy. The boss fight is nothing compelling at all! Anyone who anticipates a Salene style Death Dealer would find out that it's a wishful thought. Car racing and pursuing at night? Forget about them. It's a love story. But still, a convincing one.For what it's worth, I think the movie is not an action/thriller one.

Now swap those binaries with vampires and vampire hunters, add some Romeo and Juliet sub-plot and a comical UberX driver and you've hit the pitch for this film.It moves along quite well, lagging only once, as it's filled with doof doof music, sexy scenery, and a whole lot of blood-soaked scenes. The dialogue matches its quirky themes, and plot runs predictably along until daybreak.Maybe the whole night walkers genre has been done to bits, or maybe I wanted more Megan Fox, whichever the case, I felt this film didn't quite hit its mark.

None of the performances stand out and it's all uninspired acting. Night teeth has barely any blood, no scares, boring action, humor that rarely hits, zero tension and I could go on. The only redeeming quality of the movie is some of the cinematography looks nice. The story is boring and nothing but exposition. Big ruthless vampire wants to break the truce and take out the other big mean vampires and it's dull as hell. The chemistry between the leads is non-existent.

38,Chris_Ego,29:42,2,21 October 2021,"...that is the duration time I endured this disappointing Netflix production until I was forced to stop it from stealing my precious time! I am sure it wouldn't get any better and here is what drove me nuts:
First off, it is way too stylish to be a noir vampire film. The interior of some mansions look extraordinary expensive in their designs. Even the streets look like a flashy set in Dubai. The young cast is unconvincing. The two sexy vampire vixens are trying too hard to be special snowflakes and the clumsy driver Ben (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) makes things worse. He looks like a black dude with lighter skin, wears an afro but is portrayed to be of Spanish/Mexican origin when we see him with is grandmother. The whole ethnic mashup is just confusing. Also he produces HipHop beats (which Jorge Lendeborg Jr. Actually does in real life) so it might be just self-promotion.If you haven't watched good vampire movies you probably like the stylish portrayal here, but as a fan of ""Blade"" and such the 2021 ""Night Teeth"" feels just off all the time. The dialogues with Bens brother Jay and the conversations with the girls in the car are ridiculous and full of pointless clichés. It wasn't fun at all. Finally at the scene with the bodybuilders talking BS in the sucking room showed a real low point in what they assume to be ""acting"". Sadly I missed the short appearance of Megan Fox but sorry, I wouln't want to take this mess any longer.",Night Teeth

But he didn't know until one moment that the women are vampires and they want with one other vampire Victor to rule the city, at least Zoe and Victor wanted to rule the city.Director of this movie was Adam Randall who is most known as the director for 'Night Teeth' and 'I See You'. He didn't already has directed many things, so is obvious that he don't have much experience with directing, and this is more surprising when you will make this research because the skills which he brought with him to this project were very surprising because it is directed quite well and there are not many problems with the directing at all. The first problem with the director was that when Benny was rummaging through the banknotes the blood splattered on his face for some reason when it was clearly visible that the blood was dry. When he wanted to take off the blood from his face he had to watch himself in the mirror because without the mirror he couldn't take it off. In the second scene after this, when he was in the hotel, he had blood taken from his face with some magic because they didn't show to us that he was taking it off. When Zoe took from Benny his phone, she destroyed it and when she destroyed it the phone shattered into pieces unrealistically. The phone when you destroy it with shoes it will not shatter into pieces, in real life she will be only able with shoes to destroy the display. Never you will not be able to shatter the phone into pieces as like in this movie. These were only two problems which were visible in this whole movie. The movie failed because of the average screenplay not by the director. The director was quite good here. The feeling of the whole movie was better because of the director.Writer of this movie was Brent Dillon who has made only one project and the project is 'Night Teeth'. For his first project it is quite a good start of his career but it could be better because the movie failed on the screenplay. He could have thought more while he was writing this movie because there are some logical problems which are made only for the effect, and when you think more about it you will come to the conclusion that the situation is very illogical and it could be done better. At the beginning the storyteller told us the story of how and why people made a deal with vampires which is very childish and cliché. When the woman knew that she was being followed by one vampire and suddenly heard knocking on the window and when she looked back and she saw nothing she must have been clear to her that it was a vampire. In real life a normal person with normal thinking would be afraid and the person would immediately drive quickly to somewhere else too, but in this movie she was paralyzed and suddenly kidnapped by the vampire. Last problem with this screenplay was a little detail that many of the viewers would not have to deal with and it is one logical problem. The last logical problem which would be good to mention is when the vampire women were hunted by the ""Night Legion"" with crossbows, the vampire women were standing in one place without moving for at least a few seconds and the ""Night Legions"" were not able to shoot the vampire women. This is a very cliché thing that the ""good"" people are not able to shoot or kill the ""bad"" people because the ""good"" people are not good enough etc. This is a very cliché thing that must disappear from the movies. I think that this is very important thing that must disappear because this affects the mind of people and there are disappearing the logical thinking from their minds. This is the reason why it must disappear. One thing which was very good in this movie was the idea with the vampire member stones, but if you think more about it you will come to the conclusion that it maybe wouldn't in the normal world be released these stones because it would be easy to infiltrate some events where you must prove yourself with this stone. It was quite good for the first screenplay of the writer's character development. Is very surprising that for the first screenplay the movie has very good dialogues and logical sequence of events. This wasn't any vampire movie with no brain, this was from some point of view a love story between a vampire woman and normal mortal man. If there would not be the problems with illogical situations this could be a good movie and if the screenplay was in the development phase more time and polished to the perfection it could be a much better movie than what came from it.Casting directors Jessica Kelly and Mary Vernieu did a very good job here because all actors fit their roles, fit together in the scenes and main actors were very sympathetic. The visage of every actor fits perfectly the lines of their characteristics in the screenplay and it completes the movie well. Every actor did very good here. Main actors did here a very good job with such a energy but not good job as DiCaprio or actor like him, for this kind of movie which is between A and B did a good job but if they will want to came with performance like this to A movie, they will must to improve the skills but the perfect feeling from it wasn't here in this movie.Director of cinematography Eben Bolter who is most known as cinematographer for 'The Last of Us' (2022), 'Night Teeth' (2021), 'Avenue 5' (2020-2021) and 'The Woman in White' (2018). In this movie it is very visible that he has very good experience as cinematographer but for this movie he could have chosen a better style of camera in some scenes because it didn't fit the situation which was happening in the scene and it wasn't too good for some scenes. Director of cinematography probably wanted to make this movie a little bit more action and interesting but this wasn't necessary for this movie because this movie was interesting and action before these scenes in which there were problems with the style of the camera. The style of the camera was very action and the camera was moving from side to side, from angle to angle and this wasn't ideal, but because this was in a very small amount of scenes this style of camera doesn't affect your experience from the movie. But if we will omit these little problems, the camera is very good and the style of it was very memorable.The VFX in this movie looks and feels very unnatural and from this side it worsens the feeling from the movie.Visuals in this movie are stunning and the whole color palette for this movie is good looking and gorgeous. Editor of this movie did a very good job here because this is a very wisely chosen color grading color palette. Thanks to the color grading looks at this movie nicely and without a good color palette like this, the movie would be killed and worse than it is now.Conclusion for this movie is that this movie is below average because of illogical situations which are written in the screenplay. The director did a very good job here and it is visible that he has potential to create better movies with better screenplay than this movie. Color grading is very good and from some point of view it is unique and for a movie like this it is perfect. From the style of director and writer it is visible that this movie wanted to be a good modern movie about vampires but it failed. As I said it failed from the side of the screenplay because the screenplay contains such an amount of illogical situations that it makes this movie worse. But if we will omit the illogical situations this movie is quite good but with the illogical situations it is such an average canapé.34%",Night Teeth

They must of got paid. You can kill 2 vampires at once? And he left one vampire alive? The whole movie didn't make any sense. A bullet in the head doesn't even affect the vampire? Yes you can heal but most of your functions would of stopped until it healed. Why bring guns when it can't kill vampires? Then you have these guys with cross bows? And they can barely hit anyone so why use them? The vampire is super fast so he could of dodged easily when he got pushed into the sunlight.

Wow - and not in a good way. Not the worst plot, really badly executed. They never explain why the two main vampire characters are so much stronger than the others (or why the main baddie is stronger than the vamps in charge) - it's usually due to age, but they weren't out of the ordinary old in this story. They don't show the fights, just the aftermath, and the effects are pretty awful. Not well acted, and the characters were not likeable. A redeeming feature?

63,TheBabayaga,Night Dentures,4,21 October 2021,"The ridiculously titled Night Teeth is all bark and no bite; it's oddly timid and lacks all the thrills and blood-soaked violence you'd normally come to expect from this genre.This is essentially Collateral with vampires. However, its thinly-veiled story stubbornly hints at something far more interesting to come, only it never happens. More time was definitely needed to create the lore in which humans and vampires have fought and coexisted for centuries. Annoyingly, any nibbles of tension you anticipate in becoming fully-fledged action curiously goes on to occur offscreen, which sucks any incentive to keep watching.Night Teeth is indeed very stylish and slickly directed by Adam Randall. The City of Angels comes alive at night with moody neon lights and sprawling views across the LA skyline. But it's nothing you haven't seen before in countless other better films. It's a shame this is all style and no substance because Night Teeth really did have potential to be decent.Sure, the cast is quite charming but Alfie Allen's Victor is about as menacing as a pink poodle, whilst Megan Fox and Sydney Sweeney are criminally underused, given only thankless cameos as two very sexy vampire overlords. In fact, when the only highlight of a film is a Megan Fox cameo you know you're in trouble...",Night Teeth

One thing that really made this stand out for me is the gorgeous cinematography.. It was a beauty to behold, and keeps you distracted from pulling the plot apart, or caring that you knew how the end would play out within the first 1/4. I'm not saying it was a spectacular film, but this kept me pretty glued to the visuals, audio, and wondering which actor would out-do the other. My winner is Alexander Ludwig.. he always surprises, since I typically type-cast him as a brutal viking, or amateur wrestler (Heels). The loser was Megan Fox.

I don't understand why Blair decides that the boy she just met less than 12 hours ago is worth killing her best friend over. Victor the ""villain"" is also comical because he's trying so hard to be something he is not, when i saw him for the first time I actually laughed aloud. I'm a little bit mad they left it on a cliffhanger but tbh I don't care what happens to any of these characters so I do not need a sequel. I found myself many a time saying how stupid I thought the movie was which I think was because the script was written very poorly. It's trying too hard to be badass and serious but lacked the depth to pull it off. This is also just a personal pet peeve but I absolutely hate it when writers try so hard to make the MCs super badass. The two lead girls (Blair and whatever the other one was) acted so cool and tough but were kinda lame because they had no character development and the toughness seemed very surface level.

Especially the blonde vampire b*tch is pathetically bad. I have absolutely no idea why she acted with so much arrogance? Lots of dark scenes to cover up low production value. And poor Alfie, after GoT Hollywood wil never cast him as good guy. I liked him here, although he had little screen time.One of the last scenes summarizes the arrogance of the writers/producers perfectly. A story told somewhere in L. A. suburbia, where we are to believe that the epic battle between vampires and men takes place. Has been taking place for centuries.

99,falakrokorakas,You just don't care.,3,23 October 2021,"I liked the directing and the lack of woke messages.Besides these traits the movie was just a pointless way to spend time. Two hot girls you don't care about just raise hell. And they tried to make them look cool with slow motion and backround music. I agree with some people about the sexiness part. It's pointless. All these necking for what? There is also no lore of some short, no traditional goth themes to make us connect the present with the past. The music was too much also.There was no depth of the script no character development, just Theon Greyjoy being tough for a change. Spend some time creating the lore of the theme.",Night Teeth
100,AngryBaneling,Beautiful,7,22 October 2021,"Night Teeth won't change the world. There's no mandatory message or social commentary included in the movie. But it's shot beautifully, and it's got character. There are a few questionable sub-plots in there, but those lead nowhere, and you won't spend too much time thinking about it either.I didn't expect a vampire movie to have a feel-good ending. I was pleasantly surprised. It might be a guilty pleasure for some, but I loved it. If they make a sequel, I'd watch it.7/10, worth watching.",Night Teeth
101,chizzls-21471,Literally sucks!,4,25 October 2021,The hype got me fooled. You watch a movie trailer and be like wow what an awesome movie this will be and then you see the movie and just think the person that compiled the trailer should win an award or something.,Night Teeth

More like this, please.",Night Teeth

105,jfagan-18958,Not what I was expecting.,8,23 October 2021,"Listen......Netflix has a history of putting wokeness in front of story. Now, I'm not against diversity but when it's thrown in your face it takes away from the story.......usually. This story had latino characters and never once was the focus on race. It was refreshing but also it was a really fun movie overall. If you're looking for animalistic vampires you're not gonna find it here. The characters are really likeable and overall I think this is a win from Netflix.",Night Teeth
106,wizzstick,Just awful C movie from Netflix,1,22 October 2021,"Remember being in a shop, waiting in the queue at the counter and seeing those cheap and awful looking DVDs nearby?Netflix is determined to keep those rubbish films alive except now they're just a click away.Awful script aimed at 13 year olds who won't even look up from TikTok to watch it.",Night Teeth
107,iamsagarcastic,Entertaining but lacking drive.,8,21 October 2021,"First and foremost, for an average watcher the movie is quite good, surely enjoyable and there's a vey slim chance that you'll get bored, so please give it a try. I wish they used a better title though.The casting is absolutely phenomenal, kudos to the team, Blaire played by Debby Ryan stands out and cameos by Megan Fox and Sydney Sweeney are short, yet impactful.Secondly, if you're looking for cliche vampire horror-flick, indulging only in the dark side of vampires you'd be disappointed.The only thing not going in the favor of this movie is the fact that they are trying to do too much in a short time, pacing could be better and we could have got more depth in the story. Rest is all good. Cheers!",Night Teeth

Some wet behind the ear school kid,who couldn't get laid in a morgue.Takes on a chauffeur job for his brother. Which you immediately know will go down hill.Turns out he gonna be driving two vampires around. Who are supposedly so bad ass, that they can kill everyone they come across .No matter the odds.And that is just what they do. They taking out the vampire version. Of the entire mob family.The previous mentioned. Wet behind the ear kid comes along for the ride, cause he just soo in love with one of the killers/vampires and, he hopes it will get him laid.Along follow a long string of bad decisions, on his part. But at this point you really don't care about him,or any of the other characters. Cause you have given up on the entire thing. The story is so boring ,you are lucky if you haven't fallen a sleep by this pointThe acting is horrible at best. The only thing worth watching is the two sexy vampire Assassins. And certainly not for their acting skills.As a vampire movie this is a train wreck.",Night Teeth

111,chrisdye-66411,Pretty good but middle drags,8,24 October 2021,Have you ever wondered what twilight would be like if Edward was a person of color and Bella was the vampire okay well that pretty much sums up this movie perfectly and no that's not technically a bad thing but on the other hand it's kinda the same formula aside from the fact that the female wants to give up her vampire life to live with the guy I say I recommend it nothing exactly special but really good.,Night Teeth

113,hrqgskms,Was this an asylum film?,1,30 October 2021,"Night teeth feels like the kind of movie that gets made by asylum films (the company behind Sharknado) it's dialogue is all exposition and feels like it was written by that kid we all went to school with who made their own comic books based off their role play game character (who totally wasn't some kind of self insert)
The actors are all wooden and deliver their lines with slightly better skill than porn actors.The cinematography is also very ""tv pilot""'ish.Give this one a miss unless you are maybe an angsty teen who's just discovered vampires.",Night Teeth
114,alesnucic,Magnificent,10,26 October 2021,Its very entertaining. There are not many expectations because it is a light and well done film that does very well what it was created for. You feel for the discomfort of the protagonist throughout the initial part and also manages to make the sexual tension between the protagonist and the vampire shine. Its just Magnificently Produsec and palyed. 10/10.,Night Teeth
115,Tom-Ashem,Virgin Teenage Boy Dream,4,24 October 2021,"This movie has everything a virgin teenage boy needs: a beautiful girl who likes you, fancy cars, vampires, ability to make your classmates jealous, bragging about your ""cool beats"" to a frigging vampire who's old enough to be your grandma, human juice-boxes.I'm just curious how this conversation happened:Hey, so starting now, you're a vampire, so stay away from the sunlight.Oh, so I should move to some dark place somewhere in Europe, or maybe Alaska?Meeeeh, California works, brah! Surfs up!I know vampires are supposed to be the unbelievable part of the movie, but I'm still stuck on that one omnipresent cop that happens to be everywhere and no other cops in the city of LA... I guess they all quit because they didn't want to get vaccinated or something?",Night Teeth
116,arod-99371,Something different,10,20 October 2021,"It's been awhile I have seen a horror that wasn't so weird with the director trying to be artistic and ruining the move.

Compared to all the crappy horror movies that come out now, this movie was a welcome change.",Night Teeth
117,raysheppy,Vampire diaries meets blade,6,21 October 2021,An okay film feel it needed a bit more bite pardon the pun would of liked to have seen a bit more action and gore but I guess we can't have it all our own way very transparent at times I knew a lot of things that were going to happen before they did but overall a very enjoyable film.,Night Teeth
118,prees-59653,Night teeth is really bad,2,27 October 2021,"I think a better name for this film could be night nurse as it's so slow and boring it could send people to sleep, the acting is bad the dialogue worse and the less said about the story the better. I think the entire budget might have been spent on hiring mansions to give the film a cool look rather than on any kind of decent writer. This is probably the worst vampire film I've ever seen (baring in mind I've watched a lot of hammer house of horror films). One thing in particular was really baffling is why the driver kept helping the 2 girls when they were going to kill him and his brother, maybe the possibility of getting it on with the vamp made him think death was worth it. Don't normally write reviews but after sitting through this crap, and to think Theon Greyjoy (GOT) and Bjorn ironside (The Vikings)
were in this all I can say is they must be skint.",Night Teeth
119,apriljuice,The worst vampire movie ever,2,1 November 2021,"Here is my additional one point because it never used the actual word ""vampire"" during the whole movie. I liked only that.

120,milkehog,Why such bad reviews?,9,20 October 2021,"I actually really enjoyed this movie from someone who loves vampire movies. Cinematography was good, visually great and had a nice story.

121,dmach-61247,Was looking forward to this...,1,22 October 2021,"I was really looking forward to this film after the trailer.When the time came and I pressed play, the first shock came: Right at the beginning someone tells and explains what kind of world it is and some of the rules. That was all over for me. When I see a film, I don't want a radio play where I'm initially taught how the world works! What the hell!?Then there are lifeless, boring characters, meaningless. You don't feel anything! After 50 minutes I turned it off because I did not care whether someone survived or died in this ""story"".What's wrong with today's scriptwriters?",Night Teeth
122,KumarjitDey,"Collateral, but with two female vampires instead of Tom Cruise",3,24 October 2021,"'Night Teeth' is writer/director Adam Randall's second movie after 'I See You', which was strong on drama and elevated by academy award winner Helen Hunt and the rest of it's casts' fitting performances. 'Night Teeth', on the other hand, is an unsuccessful mix of genres, wherein none of the ingredients will fulfil your desired taste buds. With a few forgettable bites and barely any action pieces, this highly unoriginal movie hardly has any thrills in store for you.The film follows a happy-go-lucky college student and part-time chauffeur, Benny, whose life turns upside down when he is taken hostage by two female vampires, disguised as party hoppers, who uses his service to stop at multiple locations in Los Angeles to kill all the vampire bosses in one night. The film could have been decent judging by its plot outline. Unfortunately though, the filmmakers focused more on use of colours and lighting than on the screenplay and editing.Jorge Lendeborg Jr., who plays Benny, attempts to be a lovable character, as the director wants him to be, but fails to establish that connection. Debby Ryan is hot as Blaire. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. And if you have seen Megan Fox in the trailer, you have seen her in the movie - its that short of a cameo.My final words. If you have no other movies in your watchlist and have run out of other ideas to escape from harsh reality, you could definitely give this a watch.",Night Teeth
123,aabucha,Loved it. Very entertaining. Wtf the negative reviews...,8,21 October 2021,"Loved the movie. Pretty entertaining. Would watch it again.Good acting from everyone. The Bumblebee-main-protagonist (Benny) has become a better actor (from good to better), Blair (I love you, Blair), toxic Zoe, and not to forget Alexander Ludwig's crazy hippie surfer vampire was phenomenal. Latino vampire slayer Jay, and Game of Thrones evil dude where amazing too.Editing was really good. Fights had right timing and slow pace had... slow paced cuts.Cinematography was very good. Loved the camera vertical to horizontal turns, lenses where sharp as they should be, and I personally like when the movie has a clear cinematographic identity - similar colors, the sets go with the movie, the night-cars-luxury-vampire ambiance in overall was very clear.There was a scene when the fight was in the background, while focusing on the foreground main character, which showed the lens guy was making art and not work.Script was to the point. Not Interstellar or Dark Knight, but hey it's a vampire night movie. The three act structure was shown.The ending lacked a big impact, but it was okay. Hope they make the sequel (please, Netflix?)See it, it's worth the watch. Or not, it's your life.",Night Teeth

It was was not to be taken as just every other vampire movie with blood and gore.It was a kick back and relax, while you enjoy a light hearted movie that has entertaining features.Spoiler-
Who does not want to see the nerdy guy get the pretty girl, when they come from such different worlds.Don't expect to get a Shawshank Redemption. This was not a epic drama or period piece. It was just a little bit of fun. Easy viewing.",Night Teeth
132,kelsiimontez,Cringe.,3,22 October 2021,"Honestly I had high hopes for this movie but it never took itself seriously.There were certain dialogues that made me pause and cringe.The movie literally had nothing new to offer. It was predictable but most of all, it was hard connecting with the characters, even the villain.It's just a waste of time.",Night Teeth
133,conorwil,Decent vampire horror movie,6,20 October 2021,"I watched this movie as soon as it came to Netflix hoping it would be a great movie and it was though I wouldnt say it's my favorite it's such a fun watch, it's a bit slow at times but you shouldn't read reviews to decide if you want to watch something you'll never know if you'd like it if you don't try it.",Night Teeth
134,abrahamfrescas,Bash at Vampirism!,1,23 October 2021,"The cinematography is the only good thing of the movie with good visuals and colors. But....the movie like most NETFLIX is
Poorly written, not even Game of Thrones actor Alfie Allen or Vikings star Alexander Ludwig can save everyone else's poor performance. Hey, Megan Fox is in it! Again, wtf cares! As always she's more preoccupied with looking good than actually showcasing acting skills. Why do movie producers keep casting her? Oh, because Hollywood is all about looks- hence, judgemental & they think they know what the majority of people want to see. Unfortunately, that is somewhat true- the majority of people are easily entertained and beguiled. However, for those few who do think for themselves and are critical- DONT waste your time with this movie which will leave you pulling your hair over Netflix's sham of modern Vampires. With Netflix backing it up, they couldn't even insert cool fight scenes or special effects. Nope. Obviously a movie aimed at brainless teens. I've only been around for a few decades, but I've learned a few things about myself and life outside myself, & I'm sure you have too, not to mention the wisdom we learn from experience. Now imagine a Vampire who's been around hundreds of years....yea, Hollywood or in this case Netflix doesn't even bother putting attention to their mannerisms, accents, in depth of a character which is harnessed over time. These are plainly young actors who actually seemingly act, or just there for their looks or connections, to portray what they think is cool while completely backlashing terror, mystery, & intrigue of what a Vampire or Thriller movie ought to be. Like any teen movie, expect some romance and plain disregard to real life situations, relating to any of the characters, and authenticity.",Night Teeth
135,robertonallier,WELL DONE MOVIE. Don't read the bad reviews.,7,21 October 2021,Good Latin representation. The first 30 minutes were good but then it becomes a film of irresponsible and immature young people. The only good performance Alexander Ludwig. It is fun to watch. I recommend seeing it.,Night Teeth
136,ppyzvkmpbs,Great entertainment,8,21 October 2021,There's a lot of low reviews that almost made me not watch it but I'm glad I did. This is is an entertaining movie and it has a simple plot nothing complicated. Enjoyed it from start to end and the soundtracks are awesome. Loved it.,Night Teeth

138,BigRobbyP,Had potential,6,23 October 2021,I write this not to trash the film. I didn't hate it. The pacing was just off for the world in which it is set. The trailer shows it as a quick action/horror that jumps to each location with the looming threat of Vampires and a human stuck in the middle driving them around with pure chaos in every direction. We got a film that to me felt like it was trying to have the Visuals of John Wick ( hotel that killing is prohibited??) spliced with Supernatural elements but failed to really have any action sequences that made Wick amazing and the pacing was too slow. Jorge and Debby did a great job. Lucy Fry (who I love btw) was not given much of a script and doesn't come off scary/ crazy but hangry teen girl pms irritating. Allie Allen was not in it enough to make the audience afraid of him. The whole idea is Victor wants Jay but he doesn't just grab him when he's alone with all the dead guys in the warehouse?? This movie had so much potential and it just felt like a weak script and bad pacing is gonna force this movie down. Interesting that they sprinkled in stuff to set up a sequel but we'll see if it has the legs to get made.,Night Teeth
139,sakinko,Dumbest vampire movie,1,4 November 2021,"I love vampire movies. And im used to the fact that you have to ignore a plothole here and there. But this movie is as stupid, irrational idiotic as they come. And the acting is so very bad!! Just.. NO!",Night Teeth

143,noyceyone,Lacking Bite,5,21 October 2021,Didn't really make sense as a movie. The protagonists motivations were too confusing and to that end it was hard to really get involved with any of the characters.

151,jonasmanuguerra,Loved the characters,8,21 October 2021,"In my opinion, the best thing this movie does is the chemistry between the characters, it felt real in a way you rarely see in this types of movie.Now I do feel that the story was a little bit rushed and it left me wanting a bit more, but I think that it's proof that this movie made something good or at least provided me with something fresh. I was never bored or lost.I liked that the movie doesn't take you for an idiot who's never seen a movie about vampire, it takes you instantly into the action. What you see is the story of Benny on that night, it doesn't forcefeed you every story that happened between humans and vampires and I think that it's clever and helps the audience focus and enjoy just one particular story.",Night Teeth
152,raulfranco-42897,Great vampire movie for new generations,10,21 October 2021,"The film brings a vampire plot from a youth point of view in the typical context of power struggle, in which a mediocre student without apparent leadership qualities, becomes the protagonist in a long night where he does not know the scope of the events that are happening. Highly recommended for those who like vampire plots, from a contemporary point of view, in a normalized hybrid world which follows the protagonist in his discovery of the true world he lives in.",Night Teeth

163,billtheodo,Review Of Movie,10,10 November 2021,"It was a very interesting movie, all the actors were very talented and especially the 3 actors.The end was a bit abrupt but I think it will have a second partI hope there is a second movie.",Night Teeth
164,shannongillespie-31263,It's.....ok.,6,6 November 2021,"Look, is this the worst movie I've seen...no. Is it the worst vampire movie I've seen... again no. But is it very good... I think we know where this is going. It was entertaining enough that I wanted to see how it ended, but there were many plot holes and I often had to try and piece together what was going on. If they could have toned down the mysterious factor or whatever they were going for and just added more context and dialogue, it would have been much better. The acting was fine for what it was. Idk... like I said, it's ok. If you want something you can mindlessly watch and still be somewhat entertained then this is the one for you.",Night Teeth
165,cullyrob,Blade Prequel: Deacon Frost,6,7 November 2021,'Night Teeth' (Netflix 2021)Blending of films 'Collateral' (2004) & 'Blade' (1998).The driver role is similar to the cab driver in 'Collateral' except they're a wacky student filling in as a chauffeur. Brought along for the ride against their will and better judgement.It seems heavily influenced by Deacon Frosts story arc in 'Blade' except with rival gangs of vampire hunters instead of Blade and a heap less violence.It's not 'Underworld' or 'Blade' so do lower your expectations.Worth a watch and not too long at 107mins.,Night Teeth
166,zimindaniyar,My opinions,10,9 November 2021,"I liked the movie, it is very light and interesting. The actors are very cool and beautiful. I'm really looking forward to the sequel, and I think that I'm not waiting for one.",Night Teeth
167,anentet,"Different, not bad.",8,20 October 2021,"I generally love the horror and vampire genre. This is not a scary vampire, or super gory vampire movie, however it was fine to relax and watch. Well filmed, and different.",Night Teeth
168,ax_vampire,Bad...,4,25 October 2021,"If you are a teenager and you liked Twilight, watch it. If you like Blade or Underworld, avoid!Bad actors, bad dialogs, same Romeo and Juliet presented in a bad, misleading knowledge about vampires.",Night Teeth
169,ds-mulholland,Contrived nothingness,3,21 October 2021,"More attention spent on cinematography (hence the 3 stars) than storyline. Another example of modernist, shallow film making, lacking in timeless appeal or anything more captivating than a one night stand.",Night Teeth
170,jhalim69-492-214805,Stupid Plot,3,22 October 2021,"It was interesting at the begining, despite the bad acting. But when the driver, either due to his hormonal horniness or what not, decided to bring the 2 vampires who has a plan to kill his brother, who he has seen carnage done by them, home to his grandmother.....theats when I quit the movie.",Night Teeth
171,phil_varik,Vampires done well,8,31 October 2021,"As vampire films go, this is pretty good. The vampire characters were strong and not overly cliche. Some nice touches. I'd rate this up there with Blade 2, when it comes to the lore. It's a great chill out and enjoy it film.",Night Teeth
172,losdiabolico,Garbage,1,24 October 2021,150? Charaters? To review? There is no review. For this thing. That you maybe could watch? When you don't have cable to change the channel. Are you a crumble? Let's not waste more time....,Night Teeth
173,mivascha,entertaining,10,9 November 2021,"Long after the Blade series, finally a good movie with a nice story.Too bad that critics today are very sad and wining about everything...lighten up people and just enjoy ;)",Night Teeth
174,stuart-00258,fascinating script &,10,22 October 2021,"Production value also fascinating. A feast for the eyes. The writing and lead character add a ton of new charm to this genre. This definitely will get a sequel and the character Benny is good for a series. The premise of 5 places to hit in one night gave me the sense of a road picture, condensed into a single night. Loved that.",Night Teeth
175,addalucre,Good movie,8,5 November 2021,I liked the movie. The actors were well chosen. I wish Megan Fox would have a bigger part but I'm looking forward for a part 3.It is a good vampire movie.,Night Teeth
176,vitormiguelfranco,"Please make a movie with just the 2 vampire girls, rest sucks, and not in a good way!",3,20 October 2021,"The main character is just so bad (a mix of poorly written and worse acting), would rate the movie higher if it attempted to be a dark comedy, as such it was just a waste of some good scarce points.",Night Teeth
177,bigdome-28464,Debby Ryan what a great watch,8,31 October 2021,"After watching the trailer for this,aye was a tiny bit sceptical...great flim,diffidently a movie for those who are in to vamper flims ..great ending,really is good to see,which never usely happens in these sort a flims ...big up to the writer 👌Only put down is the Arrows they were shooting ..really could of done better ..(my opinion)",Night Teeth
178,jasoneliot,Just Absolutely Dreadful,2,26 October 2021,"If I write more then one sentence about this movie I'd be wasting more of your precious time, but my review needs to contain at least 150 characters. So the plot, dialogue, and acting are absolutely DREADFUL. ALSO, WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP GIVING MEGAN FOX, ONE OF THE WORST ACTRESSES ALIVE, ROLES/CAMEOS.MEGAN FOX IS AS SHALLOW AS THIS MOVIE.",Night Teeth
179,malcolmfretz,Trying too hard,2,24 October 2021,"The most enjoyable part of this film was watching it using the Teleparty App with my friends, making fun of everything from the outfits, the terrible acting and angsty storyline. The dialogue is so awkward to listen to and seems so forced by the actors, I honestly feel for them. Lastly, if most of these vampires have been alive for centuries, wouldn't they have better sense of style?",Night Teeth
180,leksenkova,Corny story with a Netflix flavor,5,20 October 2021,"Feels 50/50.... Actors who can't act, stupid lines, useless dialogues, absolutely predictable plot full of clichés. But cool cars and mansions, music, outfits and cute faces.. neon saga about vampires. Romeo&Juliette vibe. Can watch once out of boredom. Don't expect much. Have nothing else to say actually.",Night Teeth
