0,kosmasp,Old school,9,3 November 2021,"Edgar Wright seems to polarize with this movie. Although generally speaking the majority seem to love this as much as I did. Or in similar fashion - no pun intended. And for a genre movie it starts off ... well off (weird). You don't get a shocker, quite the opposite it starts off with a music number/dancing. Which makes sense when you think about it in hindsight and still sets a tone for the viewer - even if not one that is as menacing as the movie becomes later on.Technically speaking the movie is impeccable. Anyone arguing differently surely has not seen far lesser movies produced than this and is probably blinded by the fact they don't like the movie. Which is more than fine, just don't let your dislike turn into a general bashing. One does not have to like a movie that is well made. We have different tastes and that is a good thing.There are things that depending on how you view things, may feel like flaws or things the movie did not get right. Like the moral ambiguity or the love interest. The latter may feel a bit one dimensional, but ask yourself this: how many female love interests have been played or rather written the exact same way? So this is nothing unusual - unless you count the gender swap for who is playing the gullible and way too nice person to be real ... having said that, again that may not be enough to sway you to like the movie or the characters.And the moral issues the movie displays including an ending that some may not be entirely left satisfied with (character choices and so much more) - with many unanswered questions ... on the other hand, some things are better left without an answer, so we as viewers can fill in the blanks.Stylish and probably with quite a few in-camera effects (I imagine certain tricks were used to avoid a higher special effects cost, but I may be wrong), this movie has a few exquisite jump scares and a really good story as a backbone. Oh and before I forget, a great cast. It has been ages since I last saw Terence Stamp on the big screen ... Covid aside of course.Anyway, really good genre movie by a director who knows what he wants - for an audience who mostly seems to appreciate it.",Last Night in Soho
1,CinemaSerf,"Gently bubbling, sophisticated, horror film...",7,7 November 2021,"The time-shift nature of the narrative, supported well by the changes in fashion styling, an excellent soundtrack of strong vocals and a really top-notch effort from Anya Taylor-Joy as ""Sandie"" really make this quite compelling at times. When ""Eloise"" (Thomasin McKenzie) takes an attic room in the house of Dame Diana Rigg, all goes well until she starts to become subsumed into the life of an alter-ego ""Sandie"" - a girl who came to London's Soho in the 1960s, full of pipe dreams to be a successful singer. She alighted on the sleazy ""Jack"" (Matt Smith) who promised her the world - but soon she was just another plaything for old men... Initially convinced these are just dreams, soon ""Eloise"" and her would-be-beau from fashion school ""John"" (Michael Ajao) are trying to get to the bottom of what really happened... As horror films go, it has plenty to keep it interesting. There are a few jump moments as the film progresses, but mostly it is the hugely creative style of the visuals that build the sense of menace. The twin-dimensional aspects of the plot gradually marrying together as their two environments begin to encroach more on each other. I can't say I liked the ending, it was all just a bit too convenient and for me, at any rate, predictable. The interventions from Terence Stamp were unnecessarily misleading, I felt - and not in an interestingly red-herring sort of fashion, which I thought was a little bit of a shame. Still, though, this is a great looking, well paced and engaging test for the nerves that showcased some good acting talent that I did rather enjoy.",Last Night in Soho
2,Calicodreamin,Enrapturing,8,3 November 2021,"This movie had me hooked from the beginning. The vibe of the neon, eerily upbeat 60s music, and intense cinematography, is unmatched. Acting was decent and the storyline unpredictable (at least to me). A well made movie that haunts, not scares.",Last Night in Soho
3,ferguson-6,where the neon signs are pretty,8,29 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every once in a while a movie captures that magic feeling of being swept away, and this wild film from writer-director Edgar Wright and co-writer Kristy Wilson-Cairns (1917) did just that for me. This is my kind of psychological-horror-thriller and with the exception of one sequence that went a bit too ""slasher"" for my tastes, I had a blast watching it. I'll admit that, while also acknowledging more people will probably not enjoy this, than will. But for those who do, I feel confident they will share my enthusiasm.Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie, JOJO RABBIT, 2019) opens the film by expressively dancing to Peter & Gordon's ""A World Without Love"" while sporting a self-designed dress made of perfectly creased newspaper. Her room is filled with 1960's colors and memorabilia and we soon learn she's an orphan raised by her grandmother (Rita Tushingham, A TASTE OF HONEY, 1961). Eloise, or Ellie as she's called, dreams of following her mother's path to London, and is thrilled beyond measure when her acceptance letter arrives from the London School of Fashion. Ellie does carry the burden (and visions) of her mother's mental illness, and her grandmother warns, ""London can be a lot.""
Small town (Cornwall) Ellie with her timidity and wide-eyed innocence arrives in London and is immediately the target of 'mean girl' and fellow student Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen). Rather than subject herself to the abuse, Ellie sublets an attic room from an old lady landlord named Mrs. Collins (the last screen appearance for the great Diana Rigg). Ellie loves the room and her independence, but her dreams act as a portal back to those swinging 60's of which she's so fond. But that's only the beginning. It's here where she follows/becomes Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), and the mirror effects are truly other-worldly. Sandie is everything that Ellie wishes she was herself - confident, radiant, ambitious, and beautiful. This dream state allows Ellie to live vicariously through Sandie. At least initially.The Ellie-Sandie sequences mess with your head in a wonderful way. Sandie seems to float across the club's dance floor, and Ellie is mesmerized at first, before turning protective. The tone shifts when Sandie meets sleazy Jack (Matt Smith), a would-be agent who promises to get Sandie the shot at stardom she desires. This leads to ATJ's amazing and breathy version of Petula Clark's ""Downtown"". It's a standalone highlight of the film, and a moment that shifts the story yet again. If you are struggling to keep pace, you're not alone.Soho's glamour is matched only by its grunge. The recurring dreams turn to nightmares, so that even Ellie's waking hours are surreal. A mysterious elderly gent played by Terence Stamp may be the key to the mystery Ellie's so busy trying to solve that she is oblivious to the romantic overtures by nice guy John (Michael Ajao). The nostalgia of the 60's provides a visual treat with the Café de Paris, a massive theater marquee advertising James Bond's THUNDERBALL, and Cilla Black's ""You're My World"".Filmmaker Wright gives us so much to discuss, but it's crucial that the best parts not be spoiled. Just know that Oscar winner Steven Price (GRAVITY, 2013) provides an incredible mix of music, while Chung-Hoon Chung's cinematography, Marcus Rowland's Production Design, and Odile Dicks-Mireaux's costumes all nearly steal the show. But of course, that can't possibly happen thanks to the stupendous performances from Anya Taylor-Joy and (especially) Thomasin McKenzie. These are two of the finest young actors working today, and we will be fortunate to watch their careers develop.Edgar Wright is having quite a year. He's already delivered the terrific documentary, THE SPARKS BROTHERS, and now comes what is his best work yet. You may know his work on BABY DRIVER (2017) or the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy that kicked off with SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004). Here, he playfully bounces between genres serving up time travel, a murder mystery, the Soho history, a memorable soundtrack, surreal dream and ghost sequences, a touch of romance, and that previously mentioned 'slasher' scene. A final tip of the cap to Diana Rigg, whose career spanned her role as Emma Peel in ""The Avengers"" (from the 60's), her time as a Bond girl in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969), and ultimately as Olenna Tyrell in ""Game of Thrones"".Opens in theaters on October 29, 2021.",Last Night in Soho
4,blanbrn,"A ghost haunting of the past, a little bit of reincarnation or living another life with twist!",6,31 October 2021,"Director Edgar Wright has made one interesting and tense glamour like suspense thriller horror like drama in ""Last Night in Soho"". Maybe he took from a page of old classic horror and he really blended the film well with 60's culture of clothes, music and hair styles. The acting and chemistry between the two leads Anya Taylor Joy and Thomasin Mckenzie is in top form.The story and setting is with Eloise a girl who's lost her mother and she is being raised by grandma and she's accepted to a fashion design school in London. So it's off to the big bright lights and city streets and she does not fit in the click with the current class of girls. So she rents an apartment and her landlady just doesn't seem right. Soon Eloise starts having strange dreams seeing a past time in nightclubs of the 60's seeing a lounge singer Sandie(Anya Taylor Joy) and she soon sees strange characters and a dark past. Many of these sightings and dreams lead to ghostly encounters. What is this picture trying to say is it to reveal a murder mystery or is it saying reincarnation or did Eloise live a past life. Only the film twist and reveals something about the past, murders, and trio of characters of Eloise, Sandie, and the old woman the renting landlady of Eloise's. May not be the best work still it's entertains and blends well with 60's times of fashion, and music as this is a mix of drama, horror, and suspense.",Last Night in Soho

Great performances, especially by thomasin mckenzie. Whatever schtick she was doing was so adorable, made it easy to get emotionally invested in her character.It's not perfect movie, but i really enjoyed it and look forward to watching it again.

6,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Striking, original horror fantasy from Edgar Wright",9,2 November 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEloise (Thomasin McKenzie) travels up from her home in Cornwall to London, to study fashion design. Obsessed with the 60's and wearing clothes she made herself, the introverted young woman becomes a target of rejection and ridicule by her new dorm mates, and isn't accepted by anybody except John (Michael Ajao), a fellow student. She finds herself a flat, rented out by the forthright Ms. Collins (Diana Rigg) where at night she is transported by forces unknown back to the 60's, where she enters the body of Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), a feisty aspiring singer, who is rescued one night by the seemingly friendly Jack (Matt Smith), who, after showing his true colours, plunges Eloise into a devastating, sinister nightmare.The 1960's could be said to be the first era to have an enduring timelessness about it. A time of sexual liberation and changing social attitudes, it was the first great 'rock n' roll' decade, with fashion and music that set the trends from then on, and a time ripe with potential to set stories against the backdrop to, such as this increasingly dark, unnerving tale from director Edgar Wright.It speaks to the enduring appeal of the 60's that the central protagonist was born so long after it, but still has such an obsession with it. From the outset, Eloise is clearly marked as a passive misfit, living in her own little world, dancing around in her room at home, making her the perfect fish out of water when she gets from her home in Cornwall to the big smoke that is London. The colourful visual assault when she first steps into the night out in 60's Soho, most notably the brightly lit poster advertising the new James Bond film Thunderball, is one of the film's deftest touches, along with the dazzling soundtrack, featuring the likes of Cilla Black and Petula Clark, that really bring the period setting to life. The central concept, while at first a little far fetched, does have a successful air of intrigue about it that draws you in and keeps you hooked.It all builds up to a big twist, the big reveal behind everything that's been going on, which takes a detour from the Sixth Sense style path it was going down to a different route, which despite having a certain predictability to it, still manages to come off in a way you weren't completely expecting. Mainly, it's kudos to Wright and a sparkling cast for pulling off an original and striking feature so gorgeously. ****",Last Night in Soho

Last Night at Soho is brilliant, has one of the best soundtracks ever, and really well made by genius Edgar Wright. I loved the story so much about a girl that wants to be a designer and famous that starts experiencing something very different that I won't spoil anything everything with Alexandria (Anya) is so good.

8,cruise01,Stylish and a love letter to 60s with a ghostly supernatural story.,7,31 October 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.Pros: Edgar Wrights stylish direction is entertaining. Its a psychological horror film that is about a girl moving to Soho. When visiting a rental room. She has visions of the 60s in Sandys perspective (Ana Taylor Joy).The film has a great soundtrack that works great with the film.It does have a few thrills that will keep you on the edge.Thomasin Mckenzie and Ana Taylor Joy did a great job with there characters.Cons: the plot becomes forgettable once everything comes together. Like any other ordinary supernatural thriller. A girl with a gift that can see visions of the dead and what happened in the past. Which someone was murdered. And she is trying to solve that mystery.The climax becomes dull once the twist is revealed which was not surprising or shocking. Which thw third act becomes weak compared to the rest of the film.,Last Night in Soho
9,zkonedog,A Supremely Entertaining Sensory Feast In Nearly Every Aspect,9,9 November 2021,"""Last Night in Soho"" is not a perfect film, to be sure. Some of the decisions it makes regarding plot and characters could very easily be considered suspect or sub-standard (especially in the oft-criticized third act). But in a larger sense, the movie is so extremely entertaining that such potential faults can largely be forgiven (even by plot/character fanatics like myself) in lieu of everything else director Edgar Wright brings to the table.For a very basic overview, ""Last Night in Soho"" tells the story of Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), a young adult from the English countryside who moves to the present-day big city to study fashion design. Elosie doesn't fit in with the traditional ""mean girl"" types, instead obsessed with the 1960s England aesthetic. She also possesses (as visions of her late mother establish) a sort of ""second sight"" that--while sleeping--transports her directly into the swinging London '60s body of Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy). What Eloise & Sandie simultaneously discover is a culture that preys on young women--potentially to dire consequences unless an intervention occurs.The biggest calling card of ""Last Night in Soho"" is that it's a visual and auditory feast of the highest order. The soundtrack sets every mood perfectly, and the visuals are colorful/flashy without ever being distracting or over-the-top. Truly one of the most impressive immersions into a film atmosphere I've ever experienced.The acting is also top-notch. Taylor-Joy (steadily climbing the ranks of most in-demand Hollywood actresses) is spot-on as both sexy/demure and vulnerable, while McKenzie brings an earnestness and relatable nature to the mysterious proceedings. Those two leads are then surrounded by perfectly-cast, old-school English stars like Diana Rigg & Terence Stamp.Plot-wise, the first half of the film is all about ""setting the mood"", and does so to near-perfection. It concocts a fairly standard mystery to go along with the glitz and glamour--and then turns it on its head in the final minutes, moving the proceedings towards thriller/horror. From a critical perspective, there may be some doubt as to the technical effectiveness of such a choice. But to be honest, by that point I was so engaged that I didn't feel let down in the slightest.I'd have to watch ""Last Night in Soho"" again to better gauge the ending tonality shift. But my initial reaction upon leaving the theater was that I was thoroughly entertained in nearly every aspect. This was an all-sensory stimulation like few others I've ever seen.",Last Night in Soho
10,paul-allaer,Stylish British horror-drama oozes with fabulous song placements,7,29 October 2021,"As ""Last Night in Soho"" (2021 release from the UK; 118 min.) opens, we are introduced to Eloise (a/k/a Ellie). Ellie learns she's been accepted at the London College of Fashion, and off she goes to London. She ends up renting a room on the top floor of an old house owned by an old lady. With stars in her eyes, Ellie falls asleep and when she wakes up, she's in Swingin' London with the new James Bond, Thunderball, playing in theaters... Is she dreaming? Or has she been transported back in time? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from British director Edgar Wright, who just earlier this year brought us the fantastic ""Sparks Brothers"" documentary, but he is better known for films like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Baby Driver"". Here he dives back into London of the mid-60s, a/k/a Swingin' London. Was it all that good? Or do we have a selective memory? Around that Wright builds a plot-heavy story with a horror undercurrent, and that's all I will say about it. The first hour of the movie is fabulous. The second hour not nearly as much. Still it is quite enjoyable, with several strong lead performances, none more so than Thomasin McKenzie (as Ellie), but look out as well for Anya Taylor-Joy as Sandie, and Diana Rigg (in her last film role, and the movie is dedicated to her) as the old landlady. But perhaps the biggest fun comes from the many, many song placements that are peppered throughout the film, starting with Peter & Gordon's ""A World Without Love"" in the film's opening sequence, James Ray's ""I've Got My Mind Set On You"" (alter a hit for George Harrison), and all the way through the very end, when the title song comes from Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich in the movie's last scene, followed by Steven Price's ""Neon"" playing over the end credits. Just fantastic all around and I will be sure to check out the movie's soundtrack.""Last Night in Soho"" was filmed in the first half of 2019, yes 2 1/2 years ago, and was scheduled for release in 2020. Then a little thing called COVID-10 had other ideas (and almost killed the movie theatre business). The film FINALLY opened in theaters this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening showing where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was not attended well (exactly 2 people including myself). If you are in the mood for a stylish horror-drama that oozes with fabulous song placements and has several strong lead performances, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), or eventually on VOD or DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Last Night in Soho
11,stevendbeard,Gimmick & Good Plot Twist,8,29 October 2021,"I saw ""Last Night in Soho"", starring Thomasin McKenzie-Old, Jojo Rabbit; Anya Taylor_Joy-The New Mutants, Split; Matt Smith-The Crown_tv, Doctor Who_tv; Terence Stamp-The Adjustment Bureau, the Superman movies and Diana Rigg-Game of Thrones_tv, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.This is a thriller with a gimmick and a good plot twist that is written & directed by Edgar Wright-Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead. The gimmick is a girl has dreams about the 1960's and can travel there in her dreams. Thomasin plays the aspiring fashion designer that has the visions/dreams. When she comes to London to pursue her career, she has dreams of Anya, an aspiring singer in the 1960's London Soho area. Matt plays the man that gives Anya a job in a club, but soon things turn dark for Anya. When Thomasin sees what is going on, she tries to help Anya-they inhabit the same body when Thomasin goes into the dream/past-and things get complicated when Thomasin meets Terence, whom she thinks is Matt in the present. Diana plays the landlady where Thomasin is staying in London. There is a lot of 60's music, a nice plot twist and Diana Rigg's last role-the film is dedicated to Diana.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language, drug use and sexual situations-a little nudity-has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.I would probably buy this one on DVD.",Last Night in Soho

Murdering 100 men for collecting thimbles would be a ludicrous, bizarre, implausible and counter-intuitive prospect, to say the least. Yet this is almost exactly what Sandy--the would-be tragic heroine of LAST NIGHT IN SOHO--confesses to doing. She seems to be living every Promising Young Woman's dream, with dozens of London's more experienced, Upper Crust, worldly, affluent, wiser professional men at her beck and call. Yet ingrate Sandy spits in her gift horses' mouths, cluelessly slashing out against each of her golden parachute eggs, beginning with Jack, the goose who founded her feast.

14,kevin_robbins,This is a frustrating film that had a lot going for it but felt like it didn't know where to go the last half of the movie,4,3 November 2021,"Last Night in Soho (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows a young lady raised by her grandmother in the country who heads off to fashion school in London. She struggles to adjust to the city and her classmates and decides to get a room of her own and away from people. She starts having visions and dreams once she moves about a young, naive woman like herself who tries to make it in London also and was badly taken advantage of. This movie is directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) and stars Thomasin McKenzie (Old), Anya Taylor-Joy (Queen's Gambit), Matt Smith (The Crown) and Terence Stamp (Superman). This movie had so much potential with a great premise and set-up, fantastic flashback sequences, a great cast and remarkable use of lighting, color and cinematography. The acting is also pretty good, though I'd say McKenzie's performance was a bit uneven, especially towards the end of the movie. This film after a good set-up falls apart and spins out of control to a messy and unorganized conclusion that gets painful to watch at times. The horror elements also don't align well with the premise and could have been executed so much better...I didn't love the use of CGI, especially when you discover the true plot and think back on where and when the horror elements took place. This is a frustrating film that had a lot going for it but felt like it didn't know where to go the last half of the movie. I'd score this a 3.5-4/10 and recommend skipping it.",Last Night in Soho

Fantasy and reality though start to mix and it seems clear to Eloise that Sandy was murdered and she starts to investigate.Strange mix of fantasy horror and Hitchcockian killer on the loose thriller set against a background of swinging London. Oddly it works rather well and seems destined for cult status. The 2 leads, particularly McKenzie do very well, and the supporting cast is also on top form with a special mention for Diana Rigg - whose last screen performance this was - who is terrific.

16,drownnnsoda,"A garish, ghoulish, mostly successful love letter to '60s psychological horror and Italian gialli",7,30 October 2021,"""Last Night in Soho"" follows Eloise, an introverted fashion design student who rents a room in an old building in Soho, London. Soon after, she finds herself having vivid dreams in which she experiences (and witnesses) the life of an aspiring singer, Sandie, who resided in the same room some fifty years prior. However, these dreams soon take a dark turn.This genre offering from Edgar Wright is a love letter to numerous horror films of the sixties, bearing shades of ""Repulsion"" and ""Persona"" alongside Italian gialli and outright supernatural horror. On a merely visual level, the film is a mind-bending odyssey through two women's lives in two starkly different time periods, drenched in neon lights. The cinematography is stunning, and there are numerous impressive optical effects (many of which appear practically done) in which Eloise appears as Sandie's mirrored double, witnessing/experiencing moments from her life as an observer who melts into the background. These are wonderfully orchestrated and a pure joy to watch.The performances here are uniformly strong, with Thomasin McKenzie leading as the quiet, nostalgic Eloise, and Anya Taylor-Joy playing the tragic swinging sixties counterpart. British veterans Terence Stamp and the late Diana Rigg have integral supporting roles here and are both effective in their parts. The only real complaint I have about the film is that, despite successfully blending its original ideas with classic genre elements, it does seem to sag a bit in the middle section, as the increasingly disturbing visions take on a hyper-supernatural nature that wears thin. Despite a few hokey sequences in the latter half, the film redeems itself with two unexpected plot twists that are legitimate surprises.Overall, ""Last Night in Soho"" is an audacious psychological horror effort that, despite some repetitiousness in its midsection, still stands up as a stylish film that sticks to the terms of its vision for better or for worse. When you think it's run out of tricks, it manages to throw enough curveballs in the finale to redeem itself. As far as over-the-top, garish horror goes, ""Last Night in Soho"" is one of the better contemporary efforts with a director and cast who remain fully committed to the material. 7/10.",Last Night in Soho
17,Pairic,"Dreams, Ghosts, Timeslips.",9,10 November 2021,"Last Night In Soho: A tale of timeslips, dreams, visions and ghosts. Ellie (Thomasin McKenzie) moves from Cornwall to London to study fashion design, she doesn't get on with her room mate Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen) and other female students who are basically Heathers. She gets a bedsit, her landlady is the aged Mrs Collins Diana Rigg). She soon slips back to 1965 where she becomes Sandy (Anya Taylor-Joy), who lived in the same flat. At first she see's herself as Sandy in mirrors, but she delays as Sandy moves on, she is a witness to Sandy's actions but then she switches back and forth, Sandy/Ellie dancing with the same person. Sandy is intent on becoming a singer but is naive and is tricked into believing that Jack (Matt Smith) manages singers. Her early love for him fades as he becomes her pimp. The world of 1960s London becomes all too real for Ellie as she brings back physical marks and it affects her studies as she seems to hallucinate. Ellie dyes her hair and dresses like Sandy. This is very much a horror film but most of that detail cannot be revealed without spoiling the film. Suffice to say that there are a few jump shocks and grey men act like Zombies in the most effective scenes. Much of the horror is psychological as a feeling of dread builds as the narrative unfolds. Terence Stamp plays Lindsay an enigmatic older man in the present day who seems to recognise Ellie after she changes her appearance. A story of abuse, exploitation and revenge with a few interesting plot turns. Great acting by McKenzie, Taylor-Joy, Diana Rigg (her final performance) and Stamp.

19,rgkarim,I Had SoHo Much Fun With This Film,8,29 October 2021,"LIKES:The Style:
Like the poster and trailers, this film was hinted at being a stylish take on the horror genre, and it delivers this in so many ways. Wright leads a wonderful charge into two different time periods of London and make them look so dang fun and stylish to live in. There is energy from two different periods cascading into one story, pulling you into the story of this little play, working you into the life of our main character Ellie. Setting wise, it's an engaging piece that is realistic, dynamic, and engaging to the tale, with almost every place used well int eh story.The Presentation:
The premise as you can see in the trailer is that Ellie is drawn into the past to see and experience the life of Sandy. While this may not be the most unique story we've seen, Wright's style is super intriguing in the transitions, especially in the beginning with how she wound up in the world. The fun aspects of life we see involve some fun use of mirrors and switching perspectives to really get you into the feel, only to then drop us back into the real world moments later. Sandy's impact on Ellie is then later explored and seeing the effects were super fun, and even more so how the later aspects of Sandy's life really start to spring on Ellie. These moments are placed well, and each scene has a life of its own, but yet is integrated into the whole picture to never fell too tangential or overwhelming form how smooth the piece was. I was very surprised by these transitions, and how well used they were given the potential to overdo the gimmick.The Acting:
It's good, a fantastic display of quality acting in the genre where many just kind of bring their B and C game in most movies. Soho's group is strong across multiple fronts, and given the direction, character development, and chemistry was able to bring both worlds to life for me. Thomasin McKenzie is a wonderful lead, innocent and naïve, but holding much beneath the meek mannered persona she starts out with. As the movie continues on, she is pulled into other elements that require drastically going through the spectrum of emotions and bringing the terror out in this role. Anya Taylor-Joy is not quite as vocal or dynamic as McKenzie's role, but dang does she play the past role extraordinarily well in what she was told to do. I can't reveal much, but let's just say that she has a combination of confidence, sex appeal, and artistic presentation to bring the emotions of the 60s era to life. She bounces well in the scenes shared with McKenzie, and the looks she gives speak volumes over the dialogue that other characters were given in this film. Matt Smith has the looks of his counterparts super well, executing the cocky arrogance of the times to an artful degree, and adding the dramatic flair that ties things well together. His looks in the suits, alongside the nonverbal acting, speak volumes and establish the atmosphere he holds, and I can't deny that he elevated a lot of scenes in the beginning to drive the pace and story.The Pace:
A movie like this can be slow given all they try to do, but Soho did not feel long to me at all. Because of the ever changing nature of the film, the smoother transitions, and continued evolution of the mystery continued to move to the end. With little tangential detours and not trying to force messages and politics in my face, Soho managed to keep us on the story and lives of the character helping to move the film to its conclusion with steady steps.The Characters:
So nice to find a horror movie where the characters are much deeper than the usual fodder we get. Like the acting, the characters have a lot of layers and quirks to deal with, never being perfect or overpowered, but rather strong and persistent to overcoming their problems. McKenzie's journey was relevant to me on several elements, and I loved the approaches she took to figure out a lot of the happenings in the two ""worlds."" This is true for so many of the characters, many of which are used well to progress the story and actually not just be there to be an overdramatized statement. This is definitely true with the character John, who has a lot of great moments in the film without stealing the show the show away from the group. It was great planning and attention to detail that this genre needed very much for me, and I was happy that Soho delivered this.The Music:
Those who like the classics and appreciate the use of music should really enjoy the styles of this film and how much the music moves the scene. What is used for a character development in one scene, suddenly gets turned into a jaunty number of fun and 60s dazzle before dropping into a simple montage piece to express the emotions of Ellie. Other sequences have the setting amplified to wonderful levels, sometimes being creepier than the visual elements presented. And do not worry, Soho has a combination of modern vibes and big band fun to get you into the moment and I had a blast with it.The Story/Genre:
Again, the story is not the most unique or artistic thing I've seen, but what surprises me is how many genres were crammed into this movie. Soho is not simply a horror/thriller as the categories painted, but instead manages to add layers of other components into film to mix things up and help it stand out from most other films in these categories. There are elements of a comedy that work in just seeing Ellie experience life in London, but then drama comes in to help complicate matters and add a realistic portrayal that is not buried in cheesy scares. The drama further elevates in a different manner at parts of the movie, and soon a mystery starts to develop that soon starts to fold into something else. Crime and Thriller elements start to resonate even further, and soon the horror creeps in only for the other elements to peak back in and allow the other genres to rest. You would think it would be convoluted, but instead it's balanced and meshes well to make a twist on life that again is fun to watch and again interesting to solve all the deceptions hiding in the two worlds.DISLIKES:Character Utilization:
While there are many characters used right, there are others that held more potential and sadly were cut from the final number. The past selves of a couple of the older characters held some potential to add to the mystery, but I can understand the reasons for their limited use. It's the mean girls that plague Emmie's life and I would have loved to see them integrated a little more in the push to get Emmie to continue diving into the world of the 60s London. It's a small complaint, and there are others I'd have liked to foster relationships with, but the stronger relationships work well for me.The Seedier Moments:
You can guess that Soho's neon lights are going to offer many a thrilling dazzle, and some of those moments are going to be portrayed to big details. While I don't suffer from this type of PTSD, I caution those who are sensitive to take heed at the detailed moments of abuse that will be present in this movie. I'm not big on these moments, and fortunately they are lighter, but it only takes one memorable scene to scar your mind so caution.The Violent Moments:
I can't say I really hated these moments, but a couple of the times that got intense crossed the border into savage territory. Again caution to the squeamish and the sensitive to noises because these moments are very loud and sort of hurt my ears as the chaos unfolded. Again, it's a minor dislike, but still one to watch for, alongside the flashing lights if prone to seizures/migraines from this aura.The Ending To A Degree:
When things finally come together, the ending act starts to fall and unravel, with the horror element sort of fizzing out for the dramatic part. I did not hate the ending at all, but after all the buildup, I feel the climactic moment took a direction I was hoping it wouldn't and gotten the true finish worthy of putting everything to a close It's got some symbolic finale with it, a nice job towards the style and character development, but it sort of trips at the end to stumble across the line. And yes, there is some predictability to it, which does lay the foundation for figuring out what will happen in that final moment. And even more so, the special connection Ellie has is left rather unexplained and convenient, and I would have liked that shock factor to have been that connection.The Verdict:
Soho was a stylish surprise for me, that tied back to the classic elements of the horror element and blends multiple genres to make an engaging story. With fun characters, intriguing premises, some realistic lifestyles, and two worlds to balance, Wright brings us a layered tale that should grab a lot of the attention for multiple audiences. Acting continues to shine and some of the characters allow our actors to spread their wings and take thing to deeper levels than the usual thriller/horror cast. A great moving piece with lots of visual and audio components to enjoy Soho has much to check out. True, the character utilization does require some work and tweaking, and there are some intense moments that could hit sensitive viewers, but the main weakness for me is the tripping of the final act to not deliver the full potential that was building up to it. Still, I had fun with this movie and encourage you to check it out if you get the chance in theaters.My scores are:

20,vengeance20,Mediocre,5,4 November 2021,"So it's been 4 years since Edgar Wright last made a film since the hit 2017 film, Baby Driver & now finally, after a year of being pushed back we get this film!The film follows a young girl Eloise, who goes off to London to study fashion design at university. But when she moves into a flat temporarily for somewhere to stay, she starts to have dream/visions of a young girl in the 1960's who seems to be having the time of her life until she is brutally murdered. It is then Eloise starts to be attacked by apparitions& ghosts as she tries to unravel the mystery surrounding this young girl & the room she's staying in.I found the film to be interesting, I didn't much into what the story was about despite seeing previews, so I sort of walked into this one blind, but knew it was a horror so that's why I went to see it (obviously). I was actually lead to believe this film was set in the 60's until 5 minutes in roughly. The story keeps you wondering as the film progresses & it's then you start to understand what's going on, but the dream sequences do drag somewhat & the hallucination scenes (while great the first time around) do get pretty annoying after a while.The characters were pretty flat & the female lead lacked charisma & believability. The twist, while surprising wasn't great & I have to say the films message felt like a snipe at men with the themes, undertones & implications, not to mention the treatment of most of the male characters in the film who were either looked upon a evil or potential red herrings. The film did drag at 1 hour & 51 minutes & had some pacing issues here & there.The eye candy for the actresses & the gore were however good & there was a great sinister undertone in the film also.The film overall, is mediocre & not as great as made out. The themes, undertones & implications don't help & I do hope if & when Baby Driver 2 gets released & made that Edgar Wright doesn't follows with these themes in the film.5/10.",Last Night in Soho
21,martimusross,Stylish Thriller With A Twist At The End,6,2 November 2021,"Last Night In SohoI liked it!On the whole this was a stylish and sophisticated thriller/horror set in the present day with recurring dream sequences taking us back to the ""flesh-pots"" of Soho in the 1960's.We had a stellar supporting cast led by Diana Rigg in her final role. The opening premise suggested Eloise had a fragile mentality following the early death of her mother, however it became clear as the movie progressed that she was, in reality, communing with ""dead people"" and the vibrations emanated from previous residents of her bedsit.The movie was not without its problems but these did not seriously effect my enjoyment, these were:The lead actress Thomasin McKenzie possessed the look but not the heft to take the lead. Her elfin looks and squeaky voice, delivering lines by a circuitous route, irritated and that combined with a choice of just two faces fell should of the requirements of the role.The script was more that clunky and ran out of ideas early on, this lead to dragged out repetitive sequences of running down streets in Soho merely to take in the sights and provide padding.The denouement, whilst refreshingly unexpected, was a fizzle rather than an effervesce.I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning a good Halloween horror worth a watch.",Last Night in Soho
22,aciessi,About Last Night..,8,29 October 2021,"Last Night in Soho really had me hypnotized. I feel like that's a comment that will be said by a lot of people, but that's exactly the kind of effect this film has. Edgar Wright brings us a dreamy, groovy ghost story that heavily pays tribute to Suspiria, along with other film classics from the 60s and 70s. Being Britain's top film junkie, Edgar Wright can get a hold of a camera and make it seem like you're walking into a video store at full blast. His love of this specific genre of horror is just gushing here. His love of music is also as romantic as ever. Music plays just as important of a role here as it did in Baby Driver, even if the songs aren't full-on characters of their own. Mackenzie and Taylor-Joy carry this film fully on their shoulders, and by God, do they rock it. I've been incredibly impressed with Thomasin Mackenzie since Jojo Rabbit, and if this film doesn't rocket her career all the way to the top, nothing will. There's so much to love about this movie. It's a trace. No, it's a trip.",Last Night in Soho
23,bankofmarquis,Unique,8,5 November 2021,"Writer/Director Edgar Wright has developed into one of the more unique film makers working today with a stylistic look, feel and sound to all of his films. Long known as the Director of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost comedies (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HOT FUZZ and AT WORLD'S EDGE), Wright started coming into his own with the under-rated SCOTT PILGRIM vs. THE WORLD and the marvelous BABY DRIVER and with his latest film, the trippy thriller LAST NIGHT IN SOHO, Wright has graduated - in my eyes - as a Director who's work is ""must watch"" whenever they come out.LAST NIGHT IN SOHO is unique, stylized, stunning - both visually and aurally - mind-bending, tense and satisfying. A truly unique film by a unique filmmaker.To tell the tale of LAST NIGHT IN SOHO is to spoil it. The less you know about it, the better. But, as the trailers suggest, a modern young fashion student is in London and is transported into the ""swinging '60's London and ends up living, vicariously, the life of another. That's all I'll say. I would recommend just going in and let the story wash all over you - both through the eyes and through the ears - which is why I would recommend this film been seen in a theater (or, at the very least, on a set-up with a killer sound system).Because of the highly stylized and ""go with it"" feel of this film, the performances have a tendency to move to the background, but they are very well done. Thomasin McKenzie (JOJO RABBIT) is a strong choice as the Fashion Student who has this ""adventure"" (to say more is to spoil), she brings the right amount of reality and ""unreality"" to her character. Anya Taylor-Joy (THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT) is superb as Sandie, the object of the ""adventure"". She isn't asked to do much more than be mysterious - and she does it well.Wright, wisely, fills the rest of the film with strong supporting players - Matt Smith (DR. WHO), the great Terence Stamp (THE LIMEY) and, most importantly, Dame Diana Rigg (Emma Peel in THE AVENGERS in the 1960's, in her final film role before her death in September 2020), all bring their ""A"" game to the festivities and fill their roles well.It's not a perfect film, the beginning drags on a bit before things start to get good (and weird) and their is a superfluous subplot involving some ""Mean Girls"" at the Fashion School that our heroine attends in today's world - a subplot that never really goes anywhere. The ending, also, does go ""over the top"", but by that time, I was swept up in the style of this film and forgave it it's flaws.I ended up having LAST NIGHT IN SOHO-type dreams, and indication that this film struck a chord with me and is going to stay with me for awhile - and is probably worth a re-watch (it certainly is one of those types of films that can be different upon a re-watch).Well worth the effort to check it out on the Big Screen - certainly the visuals and sound will make it worthwhile.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Last Night in Soho
24,abisio,"Great drama / horror film, great director and actresses, great visuals but lots of cheating",8,29 October 2021,"Edward Wright was trying to make his own Six Sense version; considering he is the guy after the CORNETTO TRILOGY it is obvious something you want to see. Wright can do outstanding visual tricks mostly without FX and his imagination and rhythm are almost impossible to match. He has a great taste with music and sometimes the movie feels like a musical.Anna Taylor Joy is an incredible charismatic strong actress; like a young Elizabeth Taylor . Thomasin McKenzie is really good in a more easy role. However in the last acts; when she is invaded by madness, her action soars to outstanding levelsThe story takes its time to start with typical clichés like the rural girl trying to adapt to the big city of London (adding some complicated family madness); but Wright uses those common places to play with the public; showing a safe zone that is far from safe. The game is really well played and it shows at the final acts when nothing is really what it seems.Eloise is a shy, rural British young girl that sometimes see dead people (or is very sensitive; her mother committed suicide). She moves to London to study fashion design.; but after meeting a bunch of archetypical IT girls/ room mates; leaves the campus and moves to room rented by an old lady.In her room she starts dreaming about Sandy; very vividly and become enchanted with her personality, her guts and joy of life. After a while she realizes that Sandy's life was not a fairy tale and the happy dreams become nightmares. Eventually the ""chic flic drama"" becomes an unexpected horror movie.There is nothing wrong with all the above; however there is some cheating that might disappoint. Specially the final scene.In any case, this and almost perfect exercise in cinema. With scenes staged in ways not seen in a long long time, outstanding 60s music and very intelligent switch by the end.",Last Night in Soho
25,bob-the-movie-man,Edgar Wright's Haunting Love Letter to the Swinging Sixties.,9,8 November 2021,"A young 21st-century teen walks in her nightclothes down a darkened alley emerging into a bustling 60's Soho street across from a theatre showing ""Thunderball"". She enters the Cafe de Paris with a reflection mimicking her actions but showing a very different girl. So it was that the trailer for Edgar Wright's ""Last Night in Soho"" hit earlier this year.The trailer grabbed me by the gut and firmly cemented it as a ""must see"" in my movie-watching schedule. Frustratingly, Covid got in my way. But now free of the wretched virus, this had just HAD be my first outing.Positives:
This is SUCH a tour de force of filmmaking. Honestly, there were moments in here, particularly in the first half of the movie, where I was beaming from ear to ear at the audacity of it all. That 'time travel' reveal is even better in 'the flesh' than it was in the trailer, enhanced by the vibrant cinematography of Chung-hoon Chung.Thomasin McKensie again impressed me immensely. She was of course the 'girl in the attic' from ""Jojo Rabbit"" and the best thing in the lacklustre M. Night Shyamalan feature ""Old"". Anya Taylor-Joy is as spectacular as you would expect and Matt Smith also delivers, although I wasn't completely convinced by Smith's cockney accent. And what a wonderful thing to watch veteran actors Terence Stamp and Diana RIgg strut their stuff on the big screen. (This was Rigg's final screen performance, and the film is dedicated to her: ""For Diana"". RIP Ms Rigg.)The combination of 'in camera' and special effects here are gob-smackingly effective. Some of the 'mirror' effects involving Eloise, Sandie and Jack in the club are gleeful. And I'm not sure how they were all done. And a dance sequence where Eloise switches to Sandie and back again is just so clever.The Production Design is just brilliant. It oozes a combination of 60's style and sleaze. Surely an Oscar nomination is due here.As with other Edgar Wright movies (like ""Baby Driver"") the choice of music is superb. The score is by Oscar winning composer Steven Price, but you can be sure that Wright was heavily involved in the track selections. These prominently feature a Cilla Black track - heralded by 15 string beats of total perfection - that is in my top 5 songs from the 60's. And Anya Taylor-Joy's haunting version of ""Downtown"" is just superb.Negatives:
The second half of the film just doesn't *quite* live up to the promise of the first half (which was running as a clear 5*s).While the inevitable twist in the tale is clever (and unexpected), I thought it was rather clumsily introduced. (I can't go into details without introducing spoilers, but an envelope is involved). Something more subliminal would have been my preference; something that you would have had to watch the film again to catch.Summary Thoughts on ""Last Night in Soho"": I loved this one. It lived up to my expectations, and came close to ""classic status"". I need to give this careful consideration as to where this sits in my ""Top 10 Films of the Year"", but it is undoubtedly up there in the list.Highly recommended, if you are content to stomach some violent (and quite disturbing) horror imagery.(For the full graphical review, please check out the full review at onemannsmovies on the web.

26,Movi3DO,Amazing but not too scary,8,1 November 2021,"Time to join the Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKenzie simp club.And it's the last movie of October for me. I was excited for this movie not only because of the trailer, but also because of Edgar Wright, who directed Baby Driver and Shaun of the Dead, two great movies. In fact, Soho was my second most hyped movie for this month, just behind Dune. So it's natural that I had big expectation for this movie.First of all, this movie looked great. Edgar Wright portrayed Soho with such an elusive mix of neon red and other colors that not only make the city looked beautiful but also disorienting and dangerous. The transitions between the present and the past were smooth. As from the trailer, we knew that McKenzie's and Joy's characters were in the same person. The I loved the nice switch between the two characters as well as how they looked through the mirror.The story was also pretty good. Although it wasn't as twisty and unpredictable as I expected, I still liked the descent into madness and blur between reality and dream. The runtime didn't feel too long and as the plot became more intense, I was more drawn into the story.Perhaps the best part of the movie was the two lead actresses. The chess queen Anya Taylor-Joy was mesmerizing as the confident running-up performer. It was easy for her to stand out in the crowd. Thomasin McKenzie was just as amazing with her voice and performance as a young aspiring fashion design student. Both actresses looked incredible and magnetic with their blond hairs and cool costumes. It was hard to look away from the movie because they were on the screen most of the time.My main problem with the movie was that it wasn't scary. Sure, the amazing editing did make many scenes disorienting and intense, but I didn't find myself terrified as the movie intended to.Overall, it was still a damn good movie. Sadly this movie isn't performing well at the box office, which was a shame. Go support and enjoy this mystery thriller. 8.5/10.",Last Night in Soho

Stunning cinematography and production design come together to create a visually jaw-dropping 1960s London, which becomes an even more entertaining place to visit due to Steve Price's addictive music.However, the last act feels a sudden hurry to tie every knot through overwhelming editing, hasty pacing, and careless transitions, which work against what the film had been until that point.I commend Wright's commitment and extreme dedication to his vision, but the restraint shown previously should have also been part of the conclusion.""Rating: B+",Last Night in Soho
28,jp_91,One word: Masterpiece!,10,29 October 2021,"""Last Night in Soho"" is the best horror movie of the year and possibly the best movie overall of 2021. A clever script written by Edgar Wright and Krysty Wilson-Cairns that revolves around the world of fashion, time travel to the great 1960's and back to 2021, although the main theme is broken dreams. In a world that has changed little in more than 50 years, where the dreams of many women are destroyed by men (I'm a man and I admit that it still happens, we cannot turn elsewhere and pretend that nothing happens, if you are the type of a man who is offended by the subject is because you are part of the problem), this dramatic and still current subject is handled with overtones of psychological horror resulting in a masterpiece. Edgar Wright himself, in addition to co-writing the script, directs the film masterfully and knows its story perfectly. Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy excel in their characters, delivering groundbreaking performances. The production design coupled with the costume design and the cinematography result in an eccentric and oppressive atmosphere with excellent visuals. The soundtrack is wonderful, the best in recent years. ""Last Night in Soho"" is a brilliant and powerful movie, everything in it is perfect, a plus if you are a fan of retro style as I am.

She exudes sexiness and has a real presence on film. The story is a bit predictable, but there are still some genuine surprises for audiences.

31,trinaboice,Lovely and creepy at the same time,8,31 October 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:In acclaimed director Edgar Wright's psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker. This film won the ""Most Anticipated Film for 2021"" from the Hollywood Critics Association and was nominated for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival.I absolutely adore both of the leading ladies, Thomas McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy, so I had to see this. What a powerhouse of talent these two beautiful women possess.THINGS I LIKED:
I've been a huge fan of Thomasin McKenzie ever since I first saw her doe-like performance in the movie LEAVE NO TRACE and JO JO RABBIT. There is something very special about her. She has a unique innocence that is so fresh and charming. Some are already saying she could easily play a future Disney princess. Agreed! Next to the polished and incredibly talented Anya Taylor-Joy, they both keep you mesmerized to the screen. They both showed great physicality and we also get to hear Anya Taylor-Joy sing in this film! Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic in every movie she does. I absolutely enjoyed their performances in this film.I love stylish transitions and there are plenty of them in this film.The fantastic Last Night In Soho (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) blends the stylish 60s with horror. It includes music from Cilla Black, Petula Clark, the Kinks, and other appearances by 1960s legends like Sandie Shaw whose song actually won first place in the 1967 Eurovision competition! The music really takes you back in time and oozes style.Speaking of music, director Edgar Wright has always done a great job incorporating music into his movies in creative ways. I was blown away with how he used music in his movie Baby Driver. I thought that movie was brilliant.I love twists.The use of mirrors in many scenes is clever and well done.Some of the characters go to a Halloween party, so the release of the movie this weekend during Halloween is perfect.If you've seen Italian Giallo horror movies, you'll recognize this film as an homage to that filmmaking style.The subtle and overt aggressions toward women are illustrated very well. Most women will be able to relate, which makes female audiences even more receptive to the actresses' stories in the movie.The production design is really great.The makeup and costume design is also very good. It was clever to darken Thomasin McKenzie's makeup as she fell deeper into her psychological journey.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie feels like it was made by two different directors. The tone of the film is dramatically different from the first half to the second half.The ending is problematic and even frustrating.Sadly, this was British actress Dame Diana Rigg's last film before she died from lung cancer last year. She had a very long career in stage and screen, winning many awards for her performances. In 1988, she was made a CBE in England and named a British Dame in 1994 for services to drama. Those not familiar with her earlier work might recognize her for her role in Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 & 4TIPS FOR PARENTS:

32,statuskuo,If Aileen Wournos Could Talk,7,29 October 2021,"It's pretty obvious director Edgar Wright had a really cool gimmick in his head loaded with music and decided to run with that. If you are a fan of 60's tunes, this will be a treat. Take most of that away and it is an extended ""Tales From The Crypt"" Not a bad way to go. BUT, something is just missing. A sense of the why makes one frustrated. Why is Eloise (Thomasin Mackenzie) getting these visions? Why would she be so deserving to share the past?The production itself is one to behold, centered on Sandi or Alex or Andi or whomever you want her to be. Played seductively by Anya Taylor-Joy, whose otherworldly beauty was perfect for this role. A sex kitten whose innocent eyes make men weak. But there is a more sinister way about her ambition. Parallel this with Eloise's entrance into the big city, and you can predict the outcome.This film leaves more questions than answers. One is just inundated with such nostalgia for great music and style it feels crushed by its own detail. Mackenzie, for her part is frustrating. You want to shake the hysterics from her. But somehow gains the sympathy of...more people than she deserves. I'm baffled by the message this entire film asks. If there is a question anywhere. Which leads me to wonder...why?Poor concept aside Anya Taylor Joy is just so watchable. Everytime she's on screen she radiates feminity. And that is worth the price. Aside from that, it follows the same melancholia which a movie like ""Bad Times At The El Royale"" oozes. They share the same DNA when it comes to the haunted 60's. I didn't believe once Eloise was enveloped by the 60's. A movie like ""Somewhere In Time"" nails the obsession perfectly. Here, it's all show which makes her seem more like a hipster than a true fan.The high rating alone is to see Anya's sultry Sandi.",Last Night in Soho
33,sbweightman,A great night out down town.,7,30 October 2021,"A ghost story with a great 60's atmosphere throughout filled with great music that really brings the film together.

I felt kind of let down with 'Baby Driver' (probably I am a weirdo), but this 'Last Night in Soho' exceeded my expectations. Thomasin McKenzie and Anya-Taylor Joy give their best and Matt Smith makes for a handsome and hideous character. Edgar Wright's direction is compelling, stylish and absorbing. The story may seem kind of predictable on its first half, but the second one and the twist ending caught me completely off guard. Just because of the visual spectacle it really deserves to be watched on the biggest screen in the most luxurious cinema. But its story and the execution is even better. A great, terrific and stiking surprise at the movies and one of the best films of the year. This may be Wright's best work to date. At least, in my opinion.",Last Night in Soho

Why was she seeing what she was seeing - did she have some special power like being able to see dead people? And why was she sometimes incorporated into the character she was seeing and other times a bystander? Don't want to go beyond that because it would involve 'spoilers', so you'll just have to see it for yourself. I'm neutral on recommending it.But be warned, my wife is not a fan of 'horror' movies, and she suggested this one thinking it was a suspense/thriller, then ended up plugging her ears and closing her eyes for much of it.

In the 60s.""In acclaimed director Edgar Wright's psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker. Last Night in Soho was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Edgar Wright has never made anything disappointing for me, and from comedy to thriller is something exciting to see for any director. Once you've mastered one genre, especially comedy, usually you can do others fairly well. Though the movie didn't live up to my expectations, Last Night in Soho is a pretty good movie. The movie was met with some mixed reviews upon fall festival circuits. The trailer (at least the teaser) doesn't give too much away, so it was up to our imaginations to figure out what the movie was about. Most people thought this to be an artistic, awards contender type of movie. Honestly, it's a little more generic than that. Wright takes inspiration from many movies and the 60s in general to craft this. With as much inspiration as he took, I think he found it hard to come up with something completely original. The whole modern day story needed some work. We have a classic girl moving to London to pursue her dreams, but she's different from the other girls who bully her. I found it hard to really get into the movie with that overkill of a trope. Eventually, it manages to diverge from that.The 60s is where all the excitement takes place. You can tell this is what Wright was most excited for. There's a cool use of sound where it's all mono, but as we go into the 60s it turns into full surround. The whole bustle and feel of the city changed into a dreamland. The production design is impressive. Throughout the movie, we have one of Wright's killer soundtracks to get us in the mood for a great time. The most amazing aspect comes from the lighting. The gaffer must've had so much fun because it's bursting with tons of vibrant colors which are effectively used. Aesthetically and technically speaking, this is amazing. The second best part(s) is Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy. Marvelous performances from both. McKenzie is the clear lead and she gives it her all with a deranged performance. And her counterpart is amazing as Sandi, embodying the token person with high hopes back in the day. It's a really fun time watching the two and exploring the two different worlds.Where the movie falters is in story. I mentioned the beginning had troubles but manages to pick up afterwards. There's so much world building that it almost forgets to come to the right conclusion. The third act is very messy. You can't tell where it's going or what it's trying to do. The big end twist is very predictable. You could tell from the very beginning so it didn't feel like much was gained from it. Also, there's a large use of visual effects and they look terrible. I mean, they get the point across, but they are really bad. When it wraps up in the end, it's kind of a half-assed ending. We have little information about this one aspect of McKenzie's character, and when brought back to it, it feels silly and hardly important. Had the third act not been as convoluted as it was, maybe this could've been to the level of greatness as we expected. Also, Wright tried to make this a Promising Young Woman sort of story where it discusses toxic masculinity and how women have to deal with these unfortunate things. He has the right idea, but it doesn't come across as well as it should've. In the end, I did like it. There's really cool ideas and aesthetics for everyone to enjoy. The mystery may not have been super compelling, but it's there for our entertainment. I'd love to see this again because general audiences are really liking this, at least the few that actually went to see this as it did bomb at the box office. I liked Last Night in Soho, but it could've been better in my opinion.",Last Night in Soho
37,ethanbresnett,"""Don't hang around and let your problems surround you there are movie shows, downtown...""",8,2 November 2021,"This movie has so much to enjoy it really is a triumph.It has two incredible leads in Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKensie who are both terrific. They each bring something so different and unique to the film and are magnetic when on screen. The two characters were very well written and developed and deserved great performances which they got. There's something in particular about Anya Taylor-Joy that is so captivating and engaging in her performances and she really shone in this film.The supporting cast are all spot on, with a particular nod to Diana Rigg and Terrence Stamp, as well as Matt Smith.The story is engaging, thrilling, scary, mysterious, funny in parts. A lot is crammed in but it still manages to bide its time before erupting in a mighty crescendo. I think the less said about the plot the better as there's lots to discover and much to be revealed and pondered over in this film before the final act. Suffice to say that it is a brilliant watch and unfolds before your eyes in shocking and dramatic fashion.Then there are all the other aspects of the film which are for the most part faultless. The soundtrack went straight into my Spotify library and has been on repeat. The set design and costume are Oscar worthy and I would be very surprised if they don't get a nod at the next awards. The direction, camera work, cinematography are all stunning. This film will be remembered for years to come for numerous iconic shots that will go down in movie history.A terrific piece of cinema that any fans of horror, Edgar Wright, or just good movies will be sure to enjoy.",Last Night in Soho

Incredible angles, using of the camera, mirror sequences and absolutely great soundtrack. I also like the main story in the past and the connections with the present story. Great acting overall, especially Anya.When it starts to be a horror film, it loses itself a bit and that is the most disappointing part of the film, as I was expecting much more as a horror film. However, contrary to some, I really liked the plot twist (don't come with the political bs that the ending made the good look bad and bla bla bla, life is like that) and I think that elevates the film to be more than just technically good.",Last Night in Soho

I don't think this movie is for everyone, it's more a psychological horror thriller, but mostly well done.

42,themadmovieman,A dazzling love letter to London at its best and at its worst,9,29 October 2021,"A dazzlingly vivid portrayal of London, an emotionally captivating and thought-provoking pscyhodrama, a visually magnificent production and yet another home run for director Edgar Wright, Last Night In Soho is an absolutely mesmerising watch, and easily one of the best films of 2021.I loved every minute of Last Night In Soho, a film that evolves and changes a lot over its 116-minute runtime, but always has a trick up its sleeve as it takes bold and thrilling turns at every step.There's so much that makes this film such a dazzling watch, but we'll start with the brilliant lead performances from Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy, whose fantastic energy makes this movie an enthralling watch from the first minute they arrive on screen.While Edgar Wright impressively directs a whole ensemble cast here, McKenzie and Taylor-Joy are the real standouts, each delivering genuine yet exciting and mysterious performances that bounce off and parallel one another brilliantly throughout.That plays into the film's captivating psychological element, as we see young Thomasin McKenzie in modern-day London become obsessed with Taylor-Joy, an aspiring singer whose dreams take a dark turn when she finds herself caught up in the underbelly of Soho in the swingin' sixties.Not only does Last Night In Soho brilliantly balance its focus on modern-day London and that of yesteryear, but it uses parallels in geography, style and essence to great effect, bringing that into the central character story at hand and pulling you ever deeper into what starts out as a dazzling whirlwind, but becomes something rather a lot more challenging.The first act of this film is exciting, vibrant and wonderfully imaginative, capturing the wide-eyed innocence of a country girl arriving in the big city for the first time. But beneath the superficial thrill of a lively London lies a dark reality, which Last Night In Soho handles in a uniquely lively way, but also with riveting, thought-provoking dramatic depth.While never ignoring the gritty, sobering and desperately depressing reality of the industry that underpinned Soho in the '60s, director Edgar Wright brilliantly keeps the energy and pizzazz that makes this movie so electrifying even through its darkest moments.That makes for an exhilarating blend of disturbing drama, eye-catching style and even some darkly funny moments that build and build and build as we see the psychological state of our main characters deteriorate.While Last Night In Soho may be all The Look Of Love on the surface, it's rather more similar to Roman Polanski's Repulsion, using its setting to brilliant effect as it turns from a dark love letter to London into a maddening psychological thriller that never lets up until the last minute.Bathed in spectacular colours, featuring gorgeous cinematography and a memorable soundtrack, Edgar Wright leaves no stone unturned when delivering yet another feast for the senses after the rocking rollercoaster that was Baby Driver.But with a bold combination of dark, sobering drama and high-octane, lively and dazzling thrills, Last Night In Soho offers up an entirely unique viewing experience, that's simultaneously huge fun to watch while being immensely insightful and thought-provoking in its subject matter.",Last Night in Soho
43,movieman6-413-929510,Edgar Wright knows how to mix appropriate film genres in his own way.,7,31 October 2021,"Last Night in Soho is a new psychological thriller directed in part written and produced by Edgar Wright, the director of Shaun of the Dead and Babydriver.The film follows the young Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) who moves to London to study fashion design. She expects to break through in the fashion world with this education, but the education and her life in London are more difficult than she expected. In her dreams, Eloise keeps seeing entertainer Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), whom she uses as inspiration for her fashion designs. She quickly becomes a successful student. In addition to fashion ideas, Eloise also learns about Sandie's life in the 1960s during her dreams. Eloise's dreams start to become the pinnacle of her days, but as the dreams begin to get darker, they become more and more like nightmares.Edgar Wright again conveys this new film well in his own way. He does this by mixing different genres in an appropriate way. Furthermore, he also has the audacity to bring out certain things in the film in a way without going too far. This is particularly evident in the film world that is trying to do things more safely and by the book these days, so as not to hurt the hypersensitive. The film also contains good twists, which you as a viewer try to get through before the film reveals it, but because of the writing of the screenplay, the film often manages to stay one step ahead and things are revealed at the right time. Unfortunately, the story lacks some small details that could have put the finishing touches on it if it had been worked out just a little better.Together with his editor Paul Machliss, Edgar Wright knows how to juxtapose the scenes where the main character goes from the real world to her dream world. These scenes are flawless to the secondtransferred. In these scenes they switch flawlessly from Thomasin McKenzie to Anya Taylor-Joy and back again.The switching of film sets makes the switching of these two different worlds seem credible. This is due to the switching of details on the film sets, clothing and music. They also know how to convey the different film genres well.Thomasin McKenzie comes across well as the lead of the film, as someone who tries to do as much as possible in the old-fashioned way in the modern world. Because of what her character experiences in the dreams, she often has to portray the role in other ways. Anya Taylor-Joy also has to play her character in a different way when the dreams get darker. What they do this in an appropriate way law. Terence Stamp also plays a mysterious older man, of whom you as a viewer don't know whether he can be trusted or not. Matt Smith also plays the same kind of role in the film. This film was the last role she played in a movie for Diana Rigg, because she unfortunately passed away last year. Despite having a small role in this film, she managed to end her acting career in a fitting way with this film.Many additional characters in the film unfortunately play weaker background roles in the film and can make the film come across as a bit less. If some of these extras had been left out of the movie, the movie would have been a little better.",Last Night in Soho
44,coombsstephen,Clever thriller with a good twist,7,1 November 2021,This is a different film with a novel plot and it worked well.

45,darkreignn,A generic story told in a unique way,6,29 October 2021,"Edgar Wright dips his toes into neon-drenched noir with ""Last Night in Soho."" Foregoing his biting comedy, Wright instead opts for relevant drama, weaving a story that combines past and present to warn of the dangers of selling one's soul for a shot at fame and fortune. Yes, ""Last Night in Soho"" aims high - and in some ways, misses the mark.Besides its gimmick, which I will not spoil on the off-chance that you've not seen the trailer, this film doesn't offer much that we haven't seen before here - and I'm speaking strictly about the plot. As much as I wanted to fall in love with this movie, the main drawback was the story that it decides to tell. Wright tells a tale of the corruption of innocence, the price people pay for pursuing their dreams. However, the price paid, in this film's case, is extremely predictable and has already been explored in a countless number of other movies. Yes, the content of the movie may be particularly relevant in today's day and age, especially as we live in a time when a new scandal seems to be hitting the mainstream every day. The problem is, in real-life, these scandals genuinely shock because of how unexpected they were (at least, at the time. Nowadays I find myself more surprised when a scandal doesn't happen). Because of this, in ""Last Night in Soho,"" you can already see the conflict coming from a mile away.While the film is somewhat unique in the way the story is told, the story itself is not too distinctive. Luckily, the visual flair and rocking soundtrack makes the viewing experience enjoyable. Wright knows style, and his skills are on full display here - there is barely a moment where the movie doesn't look incredible, full of depth and color. He also shares his fine musical taste, which makes for some seriously toe-tapping sequences; I honestly found myself dancing in my theatre seat frequently.Wright also manages to coax incredible performances out of his actors, with Thomasin McKenzie being the standout. Thomasin was brilliant here, proving herself as a leading actress. Her performance was genuinely riveting - she adds a sort of sympathetic tenderness that makes you care so much for her. Anya Taylor-Joy was also fantastic, as always, not only showing her acting chops, but also her musical prowess with her singing. Thomasin has more screen time than Anya, but whenever Taylor-Joy is on the screen, she'll have your full attention.While the film was somewhat generic in the story it chooses to tell, I have to give it props for, at least, telling the story in a unique way. I do think Wright could have pulled a few more tricks out of his sleeve to truly make this movie a daring, novel experience, but overall, ""Last Night in Soho"" is enjoyable. The style and flair is worth watching the movie for, but, in my opinion, if you go to see this film, go see it for Thomasin's stunning performance - you won't regret it.",Last Night in Soho
46,tccandler,It is a near miss.,5,3 November 2021,"Edgar Wright made the cult-classic, ""Shaun of the Dead""... but has never quite lived up to the success of that movie. All of his subsequent efforts have been mixed bags to say the least. The same is true of this film... a psychological horror with good performances, striking visuals and dazzling camerawork. However, it is more of an interesting, ambitious failure. It doesn't hold up to detailed scrutiny. It muddles tone. It feels more like an ode to a time and a place than an actual logical narrative. It is a near miss.",Last Night in Soho
47,TheCorniestLemur,Lahndan Tawn,8,6 November 2021,"I'm always intrigued when a director known for one genre tries their hand at another one, and christ almighty, I thought Baby Driver was Edgar Wright doing that, but nooooo. This is him doing that. Honestly, if I hadn't known he directed it, he would have been just about the last person I would have ever guessed made it.So don't watch this expecting more Cornetto trilogy or Scott Pilgrim-type stuff, and yes I do feel the need to say that seeing as no one's watching it anyway, and those that are were probably solely drawn by Edgar Wright's name being on it; this is a somewhat oldies-inspired psychological horror, and honestly? It's damn good at that.Not that it's scary all the way through or anything, but certain scenes...well, goddamn, it's been a looooooong time since I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable in a cinema. And holy crap this film achieved that. Which makes me realise that seeing as I'm a man who has never had any...unwanted sexual advances, let's say, and it still got to me quite a bit, if you're a woman who has dealt with things like that, then...I think you'd probably appreciate how this film deals with that, but maybe be a bit careful, yeah?Well I say I think you'd appreciate how it deals with these things based on what I know about trauma, and I certainly was...for a while anyway, and then the ending came. I'm coming around more on the positive end thinking about it now, but as it was happening I didn't quite know what to think. And I don't know what anyone else would think, but I'm willing to bet it's a divisive ending at the very least. Up until that at least, I was absolutely loving where it was going, and the more I think about it, the better I think the ending actually is.While this is the least noticeably ""Wright-ish"" film Edgar Wright's made up until now, that doesn't mean it's badly directed, because while it isn't the style you typically associate with his work...come on, that wouldn't work at all for a horror film, would it? Whatever style you want to call this, though, it works for the film. There's definitely a lot of shots I'm going to have stuck in my head for a while, and knowing Edgar Wright, I'm willing to bet there'll be a few things that make me go ""Oh yeahhhhhhhh"" when I rewatch it knowing what's coming.The production design and lighting really stand out to me as well, for reasons that'll be obvious to anyone who's seen it, and even if there's one or two little plot holes that really bugged me, and two of the characters' purpose in the film is somewhat questionable, the performances from everyone are so damn good all the way throughout that they still don't feel misplaced unless you really think about it. Like honestly, I am convinced that Anya Taylor-Joy is going to go down as one of the best actors of this generation, and Thomasin McKenzie carries the majority of the film really well too.So while I'm certainly happy that Dune is getting its second part, I'd be very unhappy if Edgar Wright starts getting restrained in what he's able to create, and if you're on this website, you probably would be too, so can we bring the same energy we had for Dune to this? Pretty please?",Last Night in Soho
48,TheVictoriousV,"Flawed but likely to be loved by the ""Good for Her"" crowd",5,3 November 2021,"Edgar Wright goes Argento in Last Night in Soho, and it makes some sense that he would delve into neon-bathed horror nostalgia after dipping his feet into neo-noir (a genre often associated with colorful, sometimes homoerotic lights breaking the noir darkness) with 2017's Baby Driver. It's a shame that it would fall a bit short.Indeed, even as love letters to Argento-era horror go (with a splash of the Swinging Sixties this time), this one's not as good as Beyond the Black Rainbow or even this year's Censor. I don't know if it's better or worse than The Neon Demon (the most Suspiria-esque of the films I've listed). As for the filmography of Edgar Wright, the man whose distinct visual flare is still the subject of every video essayist that's already covered Wes Anderson, this is pretty disappointing.The film might find some fandom in the ""Good for Her"" community, where people treat characters like Cassie Thomas, Cecilia Kass, and Amy Elliott Dunn the way those same people feared that school-shooter incels would do with Arthur Fleck when Joker came out. It's not likely that this film will face the same scrutiny; that it either glorifies violence or has the wrong implications about marginalized groups (abuse victims instead of mental patients, in this case). I guess that's somethin'!But is there anything in here for those of us who simply value quality content? Well, the imagery inevitably looks nice and atmospheric despite often lacking Wright's usual energy, the Swinging-London costumes and production design are often convincing, and as it turns out, Anya Taylor-Joy can really sing! A happy surprise on an already groovy soundtrack.I just don't find myself caring a great deal about the story, though I do enjoy its premise, where a young modern-day country girl (Thomasin McKenzie) moves to London and begins having dreams where she observes the same city, 60 years earlier, through the eyes of a singer named Sandie (Taylor-Joy), thus discovering secrets of latter's fate. There is a violent pimp played by Matt Smith (almost as deliciously nasty here as in the similarly neon-laden Lost River) and, in present day, a similar-looking mystery man played by Terence Stamp. We also see Diana Rigg in her final film role.If you think this sounds eerie and maybe a bit interesting, I would agree with you. Alas, this connection between two women separated by six decades never gets at anything deep, and as Robert Daniels pointed out ""Wright doesn't have anything to say about the sex industry, the casting couch, or mental health beyond a surface-level understanding"".I am not as bothered by this as Daniels - there is plenty of fun to be had with the gore and references - but it does reek of missed potential. And even the fun-but-dumb horror stuff is, once again, not as visually meticulous or purposeful as some of Wright's older imagery (the most obvious comparison is to his seminal Shaun of the Dead and one early sequence is, for what it's worth, nearly on par with Baby Driver). It can be downright disorienting at points.Last Night in Soho has its moments and Anya Taylor-Joy is Anya Taylor-Joy so of course this isn't a wholly worthless film. And as I've noted, some demographics are sure to outright adore it. Good for Sandie.",Last Night in Soho
49,Lewis_Heather787,Not mysterious nor frightening!!,5,31 October 2021,"When I first heard about Edgar Wright making a Thriller/mystery murder type of film, I have to admit I was curious to see how that would turn out. For me he is a complicated director that can either wow me with some quality memorable films and also drive me crazy with some awful decisions. I know I'm in the minority on that and 100% will be about this film too. Due to the fact that once again he has made a film that is more style over substance, I was pretty bored watching ""Last Night in Soho"".Before I start to complain, whine and moan about what I thought was wrong about this film, there are still thankful some good aspects to it. Firstly the three main leads are all absolutely stellar across the board. Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith and Thomasin Mckenzie are equally great in their roles. I have to say I'm especially happy for Smith because I've always thought he had the acting ability to be given a bigger chance in hollywood. I really hope this role helps him get more chances because he was great !!. Taylor-Joy we know by now she is already a star having given plenty of great performances over the years and this is no different!!! McKenzie yet again adding another performance to her very young career, no wonder people think she'll be even bigger name in the future.The other area I like about the film is the production design and the transformation of London is really really amazing to see on screen. Credit should go to Wright and the team behind it because they done some incredible work.However, *sigh*............. I'm starting to get the feeling that Edgar Wright likes to think he makes complicated pieces of film like Nolan, Villeneuve, Tarantino and PTA just to name a few. For me though he falls way way low of anywhere near that level of story telling with this new film especially. Just like with ""Baby Driver"" I heard a recently interview with Wright saying how he came up with the soundtrack of the film before even writing a single line of the script. To me it shows massively where he spends most of his creative energy and it is 100% not story which it should be.This film is lacking huge amounts of depth that it so desperately needs because sadly the story to this film is plain boring!! Even as the film progresses every turn it takes doesn't add anything of mystery or interest to me, it is all just so surface level. Plus then the obvious twist that comes at the end is so ridiculous it is almost laughable. Its a huge shame because the characters he had created were decent enough with great performances. Sadly he didn't give them the interesting, nail biting, complex, ambiguous and thrilling story they desperately needed.I am pretty sure I'll never see this film again, it gives me no feeling of re-watchability at all. Doesn't make my mind want to find all the small hidden details and meanings, not that there are any!!!........I could not care less !!!55% out of 100 a disappointment however more confusion given the bizarre positive reviews this film is getting. Maybe I watched a completely different film to everyone else. Three great performances however more style and less substance makes this attempt at a murder mystery go out with a whimper.",Last Night in Soho
50,mr_bickle_the_pickle,You can always go downtown....to the movies,9,3 November 2021,"I thought it was a very well done original story. I really liked the horror and mystery elements as well as the feminist approach to the story. It has a great soundtrack and definitely makes you want to get into the 60s vibes yourself. I think the third act does get a bit muddled. Even though a part of me suspected the ""twist"", I wouldn't say it was predictable. It was more so the reveal of it. And I felt it opened up more questions. Still though, overall it's a highly entertaining film and Thomason and Anya are equally great in this film and very captivating to watch on screen.

51,AdrenalinDragon,Edgar Wright's first misfire,8,29 October 2021,"Last Night in Soho proves Edgar Wright is best when he has a bit of fun with his films rather than taking them deadly seriously. In the end, the Horror direction he has taken here is pretty underwhelming and ticks off a lot of cliches and predictable writing. The movie thinks it's cleverer than it actually is and all it does is make it come off as a little pretentious. The characters didn't leave much of an impression here either by the end.There's some pretty good production values and stylish shots and performances, but it feels a little derivative. The dreamy sequences kind of get mildly repetitive and by the end the movie just doesn't know what it wants to be. There's lacking a bit of spark and fun that Wright usually brings to his films so this one ends up being a little forgettable. Overall, it came out feeling like a big letdown.5/10.",Last Night in Soho
52,isantistao,A Stunning Cinematic Spectacle,10,7 November 2021,"I was totally blown away by this movie. For starters the cinematography is just stunning. It is full of brilliant and beautiful colors. And the film is the perfect blend of light and dark imagery, and it can get a bit trippy at times too which I love. It also features two beautiful young actresses putting on a captivating, even hypnotic performance. Especially due to the singing and dancing of one of them. And the film combines multiple different genres and styles, primarily time travel and horror, which have never before been combined and create quite a fantastic story. And a few sub genre's, namely murder mystery, fantasy, and tragedy. It does of course have a few twists in it, along with a really big one at the end that will put your jaw on the floor. And I'd also like to mention that there's a lot of great music from the 60's in the film as well so if you like 60's music you will enjoy it as well. So all in all the film is a true masterpiece, a perfect 10. I highly recommend seeing it in the theater while you can, this kind of stunning cinematic spectacle really should be viewed on the big screen so that you can be fully immersed in the very colorful and entrancing work of art that it is.",Last Night in Soho
53,SamPamBam,"foolishness, utter foolishness",1,31 October 2021,"This is the sort of nonsense destroying young people's ability to deal with the world in a rational manner and make logical decisions...total rot.

54,hunter-friesen,"Wright's ""Soho"" is a flash in the pan",6,29 October 2021,"Zippy editing, deadpan comedy from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a killer soundtrack. These are the characteristics that have come to define the filmography of Edgar Wright. The world first got a glimpse of those three things in 2006 with Wright's feature debut, ""Shaun of the Dead."" Other features, such as the cult classics of ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" and ""Baby Driver"" followed, giving Wright a dedicated following of fans that will always be itching to see what the stylish British director does next.For his next trick, Wright has done away with two of those three trademarks. He's keeping the soundtrack, but trading away the duo of Pegg and Frost for Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as trading in humor for horror.The title of ""Last Night in Soho"" refers to the famous entertainment district located in London's West End. From nightclubs to pubs to other seedier establishments, there's always something to entice your interests.For Eloise Turner (McKenzie), that's the London College of Fashion. She has big dreams to be a designer like her late mother, but her outsider persona doesn't mesh well with her urban classmates. Eloise finds solace in her antique off-campus apartment, where she's free to play her 60s music and dream about a better time.Her dreams quickly become reality, as Eloise magically gets transported back to 60s London, where she is mysteriously linked to the life of up-and-coming singer, Sandy (Taylor-Joy). These nighttime adventures allow Eloise to live the life she's always wanted. But the honeymoon period doesn't last for long, as these dreams gradually devolve into nightmares. The question of what is reality and what is dream begins to get muddled, and the glamorous white lights begin to run red with blood.Coincidentally, 2021 has been the year of nostalgia for 1960s London as both this film and Disney's ""Cruella"" prominently feature the setting. But while the dalmatian-laced feature carried tacky set pieces and a soundtrack that felt like someone just pressed shuffle on a ""Best of the 1960s"" Spotify playlist, Wright's film has much more reverence for the era.The dream-like sections of the film reinvigorate your love for cinema, as Wright displays some inventive camerawork throughout his extended tracking shots that weave their way throughout some of London's historic establishments. The glittering lights and costumes are candy for eyes, and the hits of ""Downtown"" and ""Got My Mind Set on You"" serenade the ears. From a production standpoint, this is Wright's most accomplished work.Eloise and Wright seemed to be linked to the same fate, as the moment her fortune begins to darken also marks the same point where Wright begins to falter. Once you take away that swinging style, the film topples over as it doesn't have any legs to stand on in terms of substance. For some people, that may not be a bad thing as Wright's style goes a long way. But it often feels like empty calories that don't equal the sum of their parts.Wright - along with co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (""1917"") - makes a statement about sexism and toxic men. But specific ideas are scarce and it all plays as more of a generalized blanket observation on the unfair inequality of gender, something any woman learns at some point (hopefully not first-hand).There is no central villain to this story, with Sandy's pimp and abuser, Jack (played by the handsomely sinister Matt Smith), being too surface-level to be perceived as an actual person, just an idea. For a while, the villains are the ghoulish spirits of controlling men. But our fear of them diminishes each time they appear, which happens much more than it should, a common problem within this 115-minute film that feels every bit as long as it is. Eventually, there are so many twists and turns that you - as well as Wright - don't know how to feel about these characters, ending the film on a confounding question-mark rather than an exclamation point.""Last Night in Soho"" gloriously indulges in all the technical eccentricities that have come to define Edgar Wright. For fans of his work, it is quite a treat to see how far he has come as a craftsman. But all that glitter is not gold, as there's not much underneath the sheen to make this feel anything different than a mild disappointment.",Last Night in Soho
55,arabnikita,"When the style is this good, it is allowed to outshine the substance",8,30 October 2021,"Last Night in Soho (2021)Edgar Wright is full of surprises and this movie is unlike anything that he has done before. I heard that the trailer gives away half the story but luckily, I managed to avoid it and went into the film without reading a single word about the plot because I have faith in the director and Anya Taylor-Joy. Here he crafts a hypnotizing experience which is a pure visual and sensory feast that is supported by great acting and excellent music selection. The horror label might be misleading as it felt more like a psychological mystery thriller, so don't let that stop you from watching it.The story begins with a young girl named Ellie who moves from a small village to study fashion in London. After a rocky couple of days in the university dorms, she decides to rent a small, yet cozy room in the old part of the city. Ellie is obsessed with the 60s so as she settles down, she turns on some classic records and the moment she goes to sleep, she experiences an extremely vivid dream where she is transported to the 60s. The freaky part is that in the dream, she is turns into Sandy, a stylish singer who tries to make it in the big city. After a couple of similar nights, she begins to realize that her dreams might be a lot closer to reality than she has imagined.While I knew that Anya would be amazing in such a movie, Thomasin McKenzie proved to be an exceptional actress who got better as the film progressed. The story was thrilling and even though the last act did feel slightly messy, it didn't spoil the experience. The reason for that is the stylish cinematography with great lighting and costumes where everything and everyone looked good. The music, whether the soundtrack or the songs, set the right mood and supported both the atmosphere and the story itself. At times, it might seem like style over substance but when the style is that good, it deserves recognition. If you like Edgar Wright and want to see a stylish film with a good cast and enjoyable music, this is for you.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",Last Night in Soho

2) The way the opening 2 or 3 sequences with Sandie are shot was absolutely amazing. For example, the transitions between Sandie and Eloise during the dancing sequence was completely flawless
3) I certainly respected the film for being a lot more dark and horrific than I was expecting, it's certainly not a film that plays it safe
4) The late great Diana Rigg was brilliant in her final screen roleNEGATIVES:1) Terrence Stamp's character was completely pointless in my opinion. He does nothing useful at all and is just unnecessarily weird. The reveal at the end that he was the detective that appeared in one scene previously was very underwhelming
2) There were lots of elements that were cringeworthy to me because they felt like just the common stereotypes of London that aren't actually real. The student life Eloise experiences was also very stereotypical which made me cringe
3) Eloise being able to see dead people makes no sense and is not explained at all? Why is she so calm about it with her grandmother?? Also, why does it seem like Ms Collins can see the dead people too at the end???4) I thought the whole twist of the ending was that Sandie / Ms Collins was actually a villain; so when the film ends with Eloise seeing Sandie in the mirror and being friendly with her, I was very confused and I felt like the film was being contradictory. I was also confused about how Eloise is totally fine after Sandie / Ms Collins poisons her with the tea?",Last Night in Soho

59,bastille-852-731547,Ultimately misguided exercise in style over substance,5,30 October 2021,"With sleek, thrilling trailers filled with mystery and suspense, this genre film by Edgar Wright certainly looked like a strong and original venture into psychological horror. Wright's track record as a director is mostly pretty impressive, with the Cornetto trilogy and the kinetic ""Baby Driver"" standing out among his filmography. As a result, the concept of ""Last Night in Soho"" sounded very promising--but unfortunately, the execution doesn't really hold up. The film centers around a young woman studying fashion in present-day London who stays in an older woman's residence while she is taking her classes. She discovers that she can somehow travel through time to the 1960s and see the experiences of an aspiring singer. I won't say anything about what happens after that, but suffice it to say that things get bizarre and disturbing.The aesthetic qualities of ""Last Night in Soho"" are generally very strong. One can easily tell that Wright is fascinated by 1960s British pop culture and art, and his on-screen depiction of London is compelling. The film is able to compare and contrast differences between modern London and 1960s London, and there are all kinds of little details that heighten the viewing experience for seasoned cinephiles (a ""Thunderball"" banner, for example) and play homage to the time period. Edgar Wright's films always have great soundtracks, and suffice it to say that this movie--with a soundtrack mostly compiled of an eclectic mix of 60s-era British pop and rock tunes--is no exception. Unfortunately, the film is very much a victim of ""style over substance"" problems. Neither of the two main characters are particularly interesting, and most of the supporting characters are very underdeveloped. The film's plot is often surprisingly uninteresting as well. We see plenty of scenes in pubs and bars as well as some stylish cut-aways, but surprisingly little of sufficient narrative substance happens in the first half of the film. The second half of the film is a jarring tonal shift into all-out horror/suspense--which would be fine if the film was actually scary or suspenseful, or its third-act plot developments helped expand on the first two acts. Unfortunately, none of those aspirations really pan out. Instead of building genuine tension like the Hitchcockian thrillers Wright so deeply admires, the film unfortunately settles for a ridiculously high number of cheap jump-scares (and they get pretty tiring after the first two or three.) The conclusion isn't particularly satisfying either, as I don't feel that the film was ultimately able to further develop neither Thomasin Mackenzie nor Anya Taylor-Joy's characters in significant and/or creative ways. Ultimately, despite the fact that the film looks good and has a great soundtrack, its more dense qualities ring pretty hollow. Not recommended, unfortunately. 5/10.",Last Night in Soho
60,cdjh-81125,A Very Interesting Premise Let Down By A Bad Script,6,31 October 2021,"There has rarely been a more consistent director working in the last 15 years than Edgar Wright. He's routinely made entertaining and unique films that have a lot of heart to them. So it's unfortunate that I have to say Last Night In Soho is his first real misfire for me. I thought this film contained a lot of really interesting ideas but I just don't think the script was anywhere near as good as it needed to be to execute them in a satisfying way.All the great things Edgar Wright is known for are present in Last Night In Soho. This is a very well directed movie and much less quick cut than his previous work. There a quite a few long takes with lots of visual flair and camera tricky and I genuinely have no idea how they were able to pool it off. Visually this has to be Wright's best movie, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and I loved how he used colour to make the two time periods distinct from each other. The production design and costumes I also thought were excellent, on a technical level I think this film is nearly perfect. I really liked most of the central characters (with a few underwritten supporting players) and the performances were great all around.The core premise is undeniably very interesting and I was really excited to see what Wright would do with it and there are definitely moments of intrigue scattered throughout the first two acts. Unfortunately though, the answers to most of the questions the film was setting up I ultimately found to be extremely unsatisfying and in many cases frustrating. The explanation for how the main character has the ability to do what she's doing was thoroughly underwhelming and it gave me the first indication that the film wasn't going answer its own questions satisfyingly. There was very little consistency to the mechanics of the time shifts and I honestly felt that it lead to quite a few plot holes by the time the film concluded.The real problem behind this movie is the script. Wright and Co-Writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns clearly had a lot that they wanted to do here but the writing needed a lot more work. A big theme throughout the film is societies treatment towards women and while I think the attempt is extremely admirable and I think could have been done well I just ultimately felt it came across as very heavy handed. There are moments of effectiveness but the severe lack of subtlety made the attempt more distracting than anything and it didn't come across as authentic, however I may not be the one to ask about that. I also hated how the film concluded, there is a twist towards the end that I predicted at the half way point but I wasn't prepared for the radically different direction Wright was going to go with it. It only further makes the films execution of its own themes feel sloppy and confused me as to what Wright was trying to say with this ending.I cannot remember the last time I was so convinced a movie was going to be great only for it to leave me frustrated and disappointed. I think Last Night In Soho is a technically marvellous film with good intentions but the execution just wasn't there. I didn't find the answers to the questions to be satisfying and while I thought the film was flawed throughout, the ending solidified it as a true misfire for me. I still love Edgar Wright as a director and I hope he continues to try new styles and genres, I just hope the next attempt is more successful than this one.6.1/10 - C (Middling)",Last Night in Soho

63,patrickfilbeck,Half Masterpiece Half Selfdestruction,7,8 November 2021,"This new Edgar Wright film enticed the cinemas with a gripping and atmospheric trailer. I was lucky enough to see this film in a Senak preview in a cinema in Germany and for the first half I was captivated by the atmosphere, the design, the dialogues, the actors and simply everything that this film had presented up to then. The soundtrack in particular is impressive and fantastic. The student who tries to get close to the main actress the entire time is an unnecessary character from the start, whose lack of use for the storyline only bothers from the second half onwards. Likewise, the bullies develop from pretty well-written cliché characters to exclusively cliché characters in the much worse second half. The finale, or the dissolution, could have gone many different ways, but chose one of the worse variants. Apparently Wright was thinking, or his producers were pushing him in such a direction that the finale of the film should be diametrically opposed to the atmospheric staging of the first half. In an imposed blockbuster finale, story gaps and emotional loyalty gaps arise; one moves away from the characters and finds them less and less tolerable. The special effects finale was simply unnecessary and a slap in the face of the teased original idea of how this film actually wanted to affect the audience. The closing sequence is simply a useless and uncomfortable representation of the current wokeness, which is destroying modern pop culture more and more. Still: Great backdrops, an almost perfect first half, an Oscar-worthy soundtrack and great actors save the film from a total crash into the lower rating range. It is a pity, however, that the chance for a masterpiece has been missed here.",Last Night in Soho

This is the best film to watch in this Halloween and despite its not so unique plot it will entertain you from the beginning.Eloise (Thomsin McKenzie), is a reserved and aspiring fashion designer who is obsessed with the 1960s.

It doesn't really nearly fit into one movie genre, and each style seems to suit the overall story. The acting is solid. Some of the effects and cinematography is breathtaking in all of the right ways. And a lot of the music and score worked really well.What I didn't like: They seemed to overdo a lot of the crazy dream-like and enigmatic effects to the point where it stopped being special. Especially around the middle of the film it seemed to become boring and repetitive. I feel like this film would be better if its runtime was about 20 minutes shorter, or if that 20 minutes was devoted to something else in the story. Perhaps some extra information on her parents or more insight into how/why she has this extra sense would have been a better use of the time. I also didn't respect the idea of the villain being treated so much like a victim by the protagonist once she figures everything out. A little sympathy would be understandable, but we learn that the behavior wasn't a one-off evil moment. I have a lot of trouble being too sympathetic for a villain who did repeatedly harm to others.Still, overall it's an interesting and engaging film. Especially the first time through. I'd give it a 7.6/10.",Last Night in Soho
69,hfreinoso,Wright did a good job with this one,8,2 November 2021,"It's a very well-made and entertaining film. The two lead actresses, Anya Taylor Joy and Thomasin McKenzie are spectacular; their performances are the film's strength. I am so proud of the two girls to make this film great, with them in the lead role. The script is a little hard to follow, and it bogs down a bit in the middle of the film. However, that is slight. I like the way the director combined the horror genre with the man who did the storyline. I also enjoyed the twist ending, as it caught me a bit.The best way to describe this film is that it is essentially a modern-day Hitchcock thriller. This is a slow burn, intimate story that suddenly descends into mind games and terror. This film has some fantastic costume design, choreography that, combined with the killer groovy '60s soundtrack. The crème de la crème of this film, hands down, is the camera work, especially combined with visual effects and editing. The story takes place simultaneously in the '60s and the present day and is executed in a very energetic, stylish fashion. The camera draws you effortlessly into the world. Some scenes are jaw-dropping, leaving you wondering how they created this movie magic. Plus, the cinematography is all-around brilliant from Edgar Wright; he dishes up his usual witty, rapid-fire dialog with a menagerie of familiar characters.Nonetheless, there are at times, and the dialogue can be a little too rapid. The sound design is wild and crazy dizzying fun; however, at times, it is too busy when a lot of dialogue is also in the mix, making it difficult to catch everything they are saying, especially with the multiple accents. Anya Taylor-Joy once again is mesmerizing, you can't keep your eyes off of her, and you keep wanting more. Thomasin McKenzie does a fantastic job of going through the wide range of emotions that her character must evolve. The rest of the supporting cast are very natural and breathe life into the world. It may take a little patience at first but hang in there, and the ride is worth it. This is Quite an entertaining and exceptionally uniquely executed thriller.",Last Night in Soho

I mean how have they spent that? Do not understand at all, no big name a listers, trendy location no doubt but we're hardly effects or cgi that I could fathom that figure being spent on, I'd say given the world crisis is it time sport and entertainment became better at their jobs and cut down on endlessly burning money on things or people it shouldn't be? Anyway...Film is great, fast pace, never slows down, it obviously leads you in one direction but I feel it's pretty obvious the swerve ball they throw at you as appearance alone the casting wouldn't have made sense, it's fun, exciting, the music is beautiful, design is great, seeing mrs Doyle always a blast and enjoyed the friendship/romance, I'm unsure if it was the intention but I enjoyed when she first met him, she thought he couldn't be trusted with her bag but he was the nicest guy and I just love that subtle nod at ignorance.I have to admit one thing that boils my blood is bully's and people nasty for no logical or fair reason, I hate seeing it and hate that it exists, I genuinely don't understand why people are so nasty sometimes, it's no wonder so many struggle.I would put good money on Thomasin becoming a huge star, she's beautiful, has such an expressive face and is so good on so many levels of acting, she's just a joy, I fully thought she was English so was surprised she's from New Zealand, I watch a lot of films see a lot of overrated overhyped young actors but she has got IT, phenomenal job young lady.Real surprise, didn't think it'd be that fun, thought it'd be to artsy and cliched.

74,levybob,"A film about everything. And so, nothing.",3,8 November 2021,"Edgar Wright's latest, Last Night in Soho, is about realty versus fantasy. Dream-state versus wake-state. It is about personality traits passed from mother to daughter. It's about mean girls. Also mean men. It sympathizes with the innocent. It makes us rethink who or what is truly guilty. It is a mystery. A Who Done it. And, in fact, someone actually did do / done it. Or ... did they? Or are we simply confusing fantasy with dreaming, confusing current reality with time passage. Or ... what?An innocent young woman is accepted by a London Fashion Academy. Once in London her life takes her to a rooming house and once there, takes her back and forth between the dream state and reality, between the now and the then, between evil and good, the helpless and the not as helpless as you might think.

This could not be possible without the help of a director who knows what they're doing and Edgar Wright was the right choice.

Another part of this movie that blew me away was the editing in this movie. The editing in this movie could've easily been a mess with how complicated it is but thankfully this team rose to the challenge and made it seem seamless. You can see all of the efforts that had to go into making the scenes where Thomasin McKenzie is Anya Taylor-Joy possible. Even the transitions in this movie were amazing. The acting performances in this movie were just outstanding. There are no real scene stealers for me as you could tell everybody in this movie was bringing their everything to their roles and it worked. Thomasin McKenzie did a great job of playing this character that people can easily sympathize with. Usually, I have issues with pacing in movies but this movie goes at the right speed that keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end.

82,c-kelsall,Twisted love letter to the '60's,9,8 November 2021,"Last Night In Soho is without doubt the most mature and accomplished film writer/director Edgar Wright has come up with yet, and it also happens to be one of the best films of any year you care to mention, be it 2021 or 1965.This is an exceptionally well-crafted film; even if you're not sold on the topic or flavour of the story-telling, you might just be wowed sufficiently by the cinematography and in-camera effects, which are dazzling. The performances are universally solid to outstanding, especially the female leads Thomasin MacKenzie as aspiring fashion designer Eloise (Ellie to her friends), and Anya Taylor-Joy as 'Sandie'. Both of these actors are in my opinion among the very best young talents in the business; I haven't seen either of them do anything less than excellent work.Matt Smith is also very good as Sandie's manager, and the national treasure that is Diana Rigg in her final screen performance as Ellie's landlady.Last Night in Soho is a genre-bending delightful mystery of a film. It starts out with Eloise Turner from Redruth in Cornwall, wannabe fashion designer with a penchant for (nay, obsession with) 60's music and clothes, accepting an offer from the prestigious University of the Arts London to study fashion design. We find out very early on that Ellie lives with her gran, her mum having died. Ellie moves to London and settles into her student digs, only to discover that the company is awful, so she finds herself a room in an old house in Soho as quickly as possible. Her fateful choice pitches her headlong into a phantasmagorical otherworld. By day she is an increasingly lonely and unhappy student, by night she escapes into a newly discovered dream world at the heart of the Swinging 60's. However, the dream soon turns to nightmare from which she struggles to escape.As with Edgar Wright's previous film Baby Driver, the soundtrack drives this film too. Every hit from the 60's is perfectly chosen and carefully placed to propel the narrative. The sense of time and place in Ellie's dreams is vivid. I'm no goof-hound, but the fact that there isn't a goofs section for this film on IMDb tells me either it's flawless (unlikely) or it absorbs its audience to the extent that they forget to look out for mistakes. In these cynical times, I think that is as good a testament to successful film-making as anything.Perhaps the most important facet of the 60's setting from a narrative point of view is the portrayal of the mores of the time. Like many an other era, there were good people and bad people, users and the used, and while everything appears shiny and beautiful on the surface, just underneath the veneer is a cesspit of vice and ugliness.For much of this film you will inevitably be sitting there wondering why it was given an 18 certificate, but it does earn its stripes later on, as the vistas are bathed in blood, and serenity gives way to violence.There is a good twist at the end. I won't say great, because it is predictable before it arrives, but I view this in a positive light because it is more of a fateful inevitability, almost necessary for a full appreciation of the unfolding story.To conclude, this an artful and inventive film which transcends constraints of genre and effortlessly conducts shifts of mood from light-hearted and playful to dark and ever so slightly terrifying.",Last Night in Soho
83,PerryAtTheMovies,A must see and a top 5 movie of the year....,8,30 October 2021,"My Rating: 88/100 (8/10)I had medium to high expectations for this film and I wasn't disappointed. The acting was on point by both Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-joy. The cinematography and sound were perfect in grasping the desired emotions. I thought the story was engaging and it had me at the edge of my seat more than a few times. I found myself nearly holding my breath for a few scenes where I was caught by surprise and I actually wasn't sure what would happen next. The last detail I'd like to share in my experience to the film is the treatment of women. There were scenes where women were being taken advantage of, and although it was part of the story, they were intense in some regards that it made me feel uneasy.Overall, a great movie and it will probably end up in my top 5 movies of the year. If you get a chance to see it in theatres it's definitely worth it. Acting was great. Story worked well. The sounds and visuals painted the picture to bring about a happy conclusion.Enjoy the show!",Last Night in Soho

87,TakeUpReel,"I would have rated this movie higher, but...",7,30 October 2021,"...there are a few points that bothered me in this mostly likable movie.First, I really enjoy Edgar Wright and Anya Taylor Joy. In fact, most of the people in this movie did a great job.Here's what I didn't like:The landlord lady (Diana Rigg) said that she couldn't sell the building because it had too many memories. However, we don't find out until much later that the memories are horrible not happy ones. Why would she keep the building with so many bad memories?I doubt the landlady put the dead bodies underneath the floor or in the walls. The smell would have been overwhelming and someone would have noticed.Speaking of noticing, would someone have eventually connected all the missing men to Sandy (especially the vice cop)?As far as the vice cop, why didn't he tell Elly that he was an ex-cop? Maybe the two could have helped to track down the ""killer."" Maybe the vice cop loved Sandy and he helped her cover up the murders. I don't know, since it wasn't addressed in the movie.Didn't the ex-cop know that Sandy was still alive? It didn't seem like it when Sandy accused him of being Sandy's killer.Why was it necessary for the ex-cop to get hit by the car? It didn't seem to add anything to the plot (except explaining who the guy was...which would have been unnecessary if he would have told Ellie in the first @#$!ing place).What was the purpose of Ellie's roommate - other than a weak plot point to force Ellie to move into the apartment? The roommate was annoying, but the script didn't take it any further than her being jealous and b!tc#y toward Ellie. There should have been more of a confrontation between the two.Sometimes Ellie seemed to actually ""be"" Sandy in her visions and other times Ellie was simply observing Sandy. It would have been better if they would have stuck with one option.The point where Ellie was going to leave London, but had tea with the landlady really ruined the movie for me. It would have been better if Sandy had been killed and Ellie used her ""gift"" to bring her killer to justice. That's what I thought was going to happen from watching the trailers.What was the point of the letter that was delivered to the landlady by mistake...other than another weak plot device to tell us who the landlady really was. I don't remember if the contents of the letter was even revealed.The amount of fire that Ellie and John experienced after the tea drinking scene would have killed or permanently scarred the two. However, it didn't seem like the fire hurt them at all. Are they related to Michael Myers from Halloween?The accents seemed ""off"" with various characters.The audio was poor at certain times of the movie. I really needed closed caption to understand all the dialog (and it wasn't due to the poor accents from some of the actors). Maybe it was my theater.It was a good movie that was diminished by the ending ""twist.""",Last Night in Soho

While the ending of the film is not as solid as the beginning, the ending only pales in comparison to how exceptionally excellent the beginning of the film is.

91,huntersmithx,Edgar Wright's leap into Horror is a sight to behold.,9,2 November 2021,"It's indisputable fact that Hollywood and filmmakers from overseas release numerous movies built on original screenplays despite what certain people say otherwise. (Not everything in the 80's was original either). 2021 has treated us to a number of them that should be honored for many years, and some have been built at the hands of some of our finest auteurs. With that being said, Edgar Wright was a no-brainer for this Halloween season, and he stood and delivered with Last Night in Soho.Countless English directors have crossed over into America, and especially in the last 20+ years. Mr. Wright's seamless contributions to farce with his Cornetto Trilogy and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World lended themselves to crossing over into Action with Baby Driver, so Psychological Horror is a natural evolution. When I say Psychological, better believe it. Last Night in Soho contains some supernatural thrills in conjunction with its main genre, but jump scares and gore are not omnipresent. No parlor tricks, no conventional aesthetics; it's an Edgar Wright coaster through and through. Even with the editing of Baby Driver champion Paul Machliss and seamless pace of 116 minutes, Wright's direction also ensures tonal unity.Rising star Thomasin McKenzie makes for the essential template for Eloise Turner, an aspiring fashion designer who finds her fluctuating reality, in a city that threatens to swallow her, converging with her apartment's shady past and a famed 1960's entertainer. Scream queen and dramatic alum Anya-Taylor Joy is on her way to become one of the defining acts of this generation, and her presence as Sandie proves that further; like her breakthrough in Robert Eggers' The Witch, it borders on being a neo-silent film pastiche. Matt Smith, Diana Rigg and Terrence Stamp are effortlessly chilling; unknown star Michael Ajao summers in his onscreen chemistry as a classmate and love interest of Eloise.Having a female perspective on the writing in Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a major service to Wright, given the subject matter and entering a new genre. While Wright's style doesn't always translate to proper terror, the mystery at the core of the plot earns its fruits. It's one that thematically lends itself to the 1960's as much as it's relevant today. That's part of what makes Last Night in Soho more than just another struggling artist story, more than potential box-office fodder (ie. Halloween Kills). It's a daring and sincere leap forward for one of our most favored pulp directors in recent history.RATING: 3.5 out of 4 stars.",Last Night in Soho
92,paulmcuomo,"A lot of good fun here. Very glamourous horror movie, with plenty of tributes to the past.",8,5 November 2021,"Edgar Wright is a filmmaker I have a lot of time for to say the least. I loved his Cornetto trilogy, found Scott Pilgrim Versus The World to be a very underrated film that thankfully has found some cult appeal, and Baby Driver is one of my most frequently watched movies ever. I've heard of this project for around a year, because of his signing onto it, and several of the cast members I was very keen, in particular Thomasin McKenzie, Anya Taylor-Joy and Matt Smith in the three main roles. There's also additional parts by Terence Stamp, a Sam Claflin cameo, and a bit extra from Synnove Karlsen from the TV series Clique here in the UK, as well as the late Diana Riggs and Margaret Nolan (both of whom are remembered in the movie as their last performances). Overall, I was intrigued by the movie, its premise and its ideas, and thankfully, it did live up fully to that.The movie opens with country bumpkin Eloise, played by McKenzie, moving to London to begin a fashion designing course at the University of the Arts London - which is awesome because I used to work near there for about two years. Upon moving there, being sick of her flatmates and their behaviours and attitude, she rents a room from a landlady, Ms Collins, played by Riggs. After renting this room in the Soho district, specifically Goodge Street which I too have been down, she begins to have visions. In this visions, she sees the past events of a girl named Sandie, played by Taylor-Joy, and her dreams of becoming a successful singer in London's busy and bustling night life in the 60's...before a meeting with handsome but dangerous Jack, played by Smith, sends it all astray.The cast in this movie is solid. The main standouts are McKenzie, Taylor-Joy and Smith. Thomasin McKenzie does an excellent job in this movie of holding her Cornwell accent which is incredibly difficult, especially considering her natural New Zealand accent. I've always enjoyed McKenzie having seen her in Leave No Trace, Jojo Rabbit and Old before this, and in this movie, she holds the wonder and intrigue of moving to London, but is able to hold those whilst the fear of the seedier side of London sinks in. Her character displays clear morals and desires, but is also street smart enough to get out of danger when its presented to her. Taylor-Joy I too have enjoyed since I saw her in The Witch. Here as Sandie, she adopts the role of a skilful, elegant and eloquent young woman in the 60's very well, plus her singing and dance work is excellent as well. Matt Smith here is given a much more vicious character to work with, and he does a very good job at making Jack enticing to be around, but also making him a common sight of the era; in an era when women wanted the spotlight by any means necessary, Jack was the embodiment of men who would abuse that, and Matt Smith does a great job at making this character who could've easily been a moustache twirling villain very seductive and charismatic, in the same way his version of The Doctor may have appeared to be, or even his Charles Manson in Charlie Says.The camera work is the second biggest hero of the story. There's a lot of good work here, especially with light and framings at the bookends of the movie. There's also excellent work with mirrors; typically, when Eloise was interacting with the past, she was seeing herself as Sandie in mirrors and occasionally switching from Sandie to Eloise; there's a really excellent dance number between the three main players towards the beginning of the film, and the way it transitions between Eloise and Sandie around dancing with Jack is majestic. Also, there are plenty of little clues about the mystery of the story really well placed throughout.Now, the horror elements. This is where a bit of the movie falls apart because, despite having worked on a zombie horror film, an alien invasion horror film and now a psychological horror film, Wright isn't necessarily a horror director. The horror elements of this movie are very - and I mean VERY - reminiscent of Roman Polanski's ""apartment"" trilogy. From Repulsion, there's the images of men has faceless ghouls looking to molest the central characters, from Rosemary's Baby it's the institutional control that allows this abuse to happen, and from The Tennent, it's Elouise slowly turning herself into Sandie in appearance and even living in the same room; her breakdowns towards the end of the movie are similar to that too. Elouise being leached over by male figures, from an intrusive Taxi driver to horndog students, is effective at creating dread but doesn't quite follow through with it. It's certainly a very tense movie that uses Elouise and Sandie as desirable objects to keep the tension high, but it does get undone a bit by the film's ending; I won't spoil it here, but whilst the twist is good and I didn't see it coming, it's a bit undermining for what the film is trying to say. Also, the actual ending puts a bit too much in and, again, lessens the horror element a bit. Additionally with the writing, the character Jocasta played by Karlsen doesn't get too much to do and is a bit wasted by the end, Elouise's love interest John, played by Michael Ajao, is also a bit of an undermining element to the horror elements as well, even though his character was a welcome relief from the tension. Overall though, I had a great time with this film and will hopefully do it again while it's still out.In closing I do have to say one thing: NO WAY IN HELL IS THIS MOVIE AN 18. This movie, genuinely, is a 15 tops. I've seen may more violent movies than this that weren't even close to an 18, and it sucks because the Box Office for this movie is going to be severely impacted by it, and it doesn't deserve to be. So I'm pleading guys: see it in cinema if possible, or if not buy the DVD, least of all for the DVD commentary to explain stuff that Wright always does so well.",Last Night in Soho

As you feel for the characters in this movie deeply due to great character building in the time allowed. It has to be said that this is the type of movie that you really don't want to watch having read much about it. You have to be unaware as you can be of the plot in order to enjoy the movie fully, as it moves along at a very nice pace taking you on a type of journey that is rare for horror movies. The story sees Eloise , a young women who moves to London in order to Study at the school of fashion, however she brings with her several things. Her deep desire and almost innocent desire to succeed but also an abiltiy to see spirits or ghosts which is not explained at the beginning of the movie.

Last Night in Soho isn't as overtly flashy as his previous work but it makes up for that by being more cinematic. The lighting, sound design, and music are all utilized to even higher levels than his already lofty standards. This makes Last Night in Soho a symphony of sound and color that will satisfy viewers who have come to expect plenty of pizazz from Wright's films.On top of that, Last Night in Soho is surprisingly substantial, tackling the very serious topic of female exploitation. This is embodied by worthy performances throughout the cast (especially from Thomasin McKenzie). Edgar Wright movies are known for being humorous with accents of drama, but Last Night in Soho lands as a drama with dashes of humor. Throw in the trippy dream elements that are highlighted with potent cinematography and special effects, and we have an exciting new phase of Wright's career that holds on to his signature energy.

And themes that are completely abandoned in favor of ineffective jump scare sequences that add nothing to the story.Lastly, NONE of the horror elements work here.

102,JoelAlexanderr,"A classic example of great ideas, poor execution",6,5 November 2021,"Every time director/writer Edgar Wright releases a movie, every film nerd in existence will be interested at the very least. He always has a unique stamp on his movies that no other director could leave, the cast is always stellar, and the soundtrack is always a character of its own. All of this remains to be true for LAST NIGHT IN SOHO, which serves as Wright's first endeavor into the horror genre. Because of this, audiences receive an entirely different product than they usually do from Wright; the characteristic witty sense of humor is nowhere to be found here, instead traded for a more serious and nostalgic tone. Unfortunately, LAST NIGHT IN SOHO does not work anywhere near as much as every other Wright film does, mainly because he tries to make too many different movies at once. It has an amazing first hour, but from there the movie goes in too many directions at once and never reaches its destination with any of them.LAST NIGHT IN SOHO, among many other things, serves as a reminder that living in the past and ignoring the present can be dangerous. We follow Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), an inspiring fashion designer who has moved to London, the city of her dreams, in order to make her love of fashion into a career. After she learns the hard way that the city and the people in it are not what she expected, she leans into her love of music and culture from the 1960s. She still listens to vinyl records and wishes she was part of the old-school culture of London 50 years ago. She soon finds herself mysteriously slipping back in time and spending her nights with a beautiful aspiring singer (Anya Taylor-Joy) trying to make it big time in glitzy and glamorous 1960s London. However, the past is not the paradise Eloise thought, and she ends up desperately trying to escape the demons of that time from consuming her mind.The movie has a strong build, with McKenzie delivering yet another great performance that makes the character-building easy for Wright. Her loneliness and isolation are palpable during the first leg of the film, so when she slips into the land of her dreams it seems like a believable and necessary escape from the social hell of today's world. Sometimes Wright overplays this feeling by making certain female ""bully"" characters hyperbolic and exaggerated, but the point is nonetheless made. The direction in the first leg of the film is immaculate and on par for what I expected coming into an Edgar Wright production. The way McKenzie is cut into the scenes that center around Taylor-Joy is movie-making magic at its best, and creates some beautiful and enthralling sequences. The movie contains another star-affirming performance from Taylor-Joy and a standout swan song from Diana Rigg, who damn near steals the entire movie with her final performance.Once the horror starts, however, the motifs of the movie get a bit muddled and the plot starts clashing with the themes. Around the middle of the film, Wright takes the narrative in a promising direction that involves the exploitation and objectification of women in a patriarchal society. By the time the third act comes around, the movie turns into an aimless scare-fest that doesn't seem to know how to handle its own subject matter. Much of this period involves McKenzie's character Eloise running around the city for no particular reason and without any goals, with random events happening to her that do not feel scary or consequential. Wright lost me with his final twist, which not only feels tacked on in order to create unnecessary shock factor, but contradicts the most powerful themes of the rest of the narrative. In retrospect, his idea for this twist (and the whole movie, really) is great on paper, but in practice feels in poor taste and a distraction from the real interesting story that could have been told here.LAST NIGHT IN SOHO is by no means a bad movie, but it never sticks the landing in a meaningful way that will cause audiences to walk away from it in awe as they did with films such as Baby Driver or Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Wright still shows off his directing chops here, but his script could have used far more work, especially in the second half. Many story beats do not seem to stick as much as they should given the impact of the subject matter, and some major climactic scenes come across as rushed or packed instead of forceful or shocking. This movie will likely polarize many viewers with its ending, and while I didn't enjoy it as much as others might, I still appreciate any original story that will cause healthy debate among film fans. There are still a lot of great ideas packed in this movie, and for that alone it might be worth the watch.C+",Last Night in Soho

This rabbit hole, Eloise discovers, goes deep and dirty. At first, it's lovingly filmed, fiendishly clever and, natch, extremely well acted by the absolutely sterling cast, but as the plot (and Sandie's fate) unravels, things go ludicrously over the top, and Eloise is soon haunted by lurid dreams and shambling, zombie-like spectres and it all gets very, very silly and irritating, compounded by the monstrous, unforgiveable cop-out of an ending.

And the plot twist was really mind blowing and super shocking me. Some jump scare, but only one that make me shock. Anya was super beautiful in this movie and this movie is not like a horror movie like conjuring or real horror movie cause this movie was a Psychological horror movies so you don't have to be really scared.I really love the visual and the color of the scene like blue neon or red, like they give us red when it was nerve wracking scene. The storyline was super good and I didn't feel boring cause the story line was in present and past, everything will be explained in the ending and of course the Plot Twist I cannot believe that the old lady was Sandie , And I really love the song like I can't stop open Shazam app to know what song is that.

Which is a great shame as it doesn't do the otherwise inventive and imaginative story any good.The acting is really good (apart from the screaming part), the characters are vivid and well depicted. Also great portrayal of dream sequences and great costumes/design of 60s atmosphere, very lush and imaginative. The story took some awkward turns along the way but converged quite well in the end.Overall, it could've been a great movie if not for all the scares - those look so out of place and so utterly generic I couldn't wait till they were gone.",Last Night in Soho

Of course it would, it's an Edgar Wright film. In Soho, Wright goes for the horror route with ambiguous success. The good thing is that the pros of Soho outweigh the cons but the bad thing is that the cons have everything to do with the plot of this movie that it's full of inconsistencies, plot-holes and one dimensional characters. I won't get into details here because that would mean spoiling the movie. But at least for me, my main gripe is that the movie couldn't make me shut my brain and stop analyzing everything because the faults were that glaring.But it's Wright we are talking about here. Last Night in Soho has excellent directing and aesthetics, amazing lead performance by Thomasin McKenzie, amazing supporting performances by most of the supporting cast, excellent visual effects (some bad CGI), great soundtrack and although I'm skeptical by the ending, I was for sure engaged. It's one of those movies that I need to see again, it has the potential for an 8/10. But for sure the movie is worthy of your money.",Last Night in Soho
109,karlmartin-47352,"""You're my world, every move I make...""",9,30 October 2021,"First impressions are that although it starts out with a flowery 60's vibe, it escalates quite quickly to become much more sinister & quickly graduates & its escalation of terror is depicted brilliantly. Obviously there's lots of music which cements the majority of the scenes in the mid-60's, but these too become much more sinister as the film goes on. It does depict quite a specific vibe of London/Soho seedy gangster history & more specifically gentlemen's clubs which I can well imagine the Krays & the likes to frequent. Thomasin McKensie is absolutely brilliant as the modern character who has the visions which connects everything together & her depth as an actress continues to impress. There are certain elements which go beyond the idea of realistic actions, but considering that it is generally based on visions & fantasies can easily be forgiven.",Last Night in Soho
110,aboodakram-48692,Edgar Wright at his best.,8,5 November 2021,"Starting things off, this movie will be easily described as one of the best in 2021, because of a plenty reasons. The first one is obviously Edgar Wright's great directing style. Honestly, I cannot describe how many amazing shots I just witnessed in this picture, and how much they influence the story telling element of this movie. The second reason is Thomasin McKenzie and Anna Taylor-Joy, what a great performance from the couple of them. Both of them have the elements needed to become a great Hollywood superstar in the near or far future. The last reason is the beautiful, weird and that can make you confused sometimes theme of the movie that simply makes it unique and entertaining. On the other hand, with the all the things good in this movie, there is some negative aspects that we need to talk about. First, the predictable plot twists that are a joy to be experienced at the moment they were shown, but this feeling starts to quickly fades away when you realize that the reveal is hidden from the beginning, all you have to do is to pay attention to details. Second, the hidden agenda that affects the writing of any script nowadays in Hollywood. Seriously, how many times this will affect a movie and unconditionally affect the crew that are working at their best to achieve their dreams. THIS NEEDS TO STOP. And last but not least, the diversity of genres in this picture is confusing, I mean at the 1st act it was a horror movie, but in the 2nd it becomes a mystery one, I know that the purpose of the story is to solve a mystery in the past by a mentally ill girl, but I always prefer filmmakers to focus on one genre rather than making the viewer feel like he/she is watching two movies.",Last Night in Soho

116,nlsteven-attheMovies,A Headspinner,7,4 November 2021,"Blending style, 60s nostalgia, horror and gore, Edgar Wright delivers an artful psychological thriller in which the sum of the individual parts is better than the whole. The first half of the film, which brilliantly juxtaposes a mentally unstable Eloise with her more glamorous alter-ego Sandie - played masterfully by Queen's Gambit's Anya Taylor-Joy - has all the ingredients of an Oscar contender film. The last half hour of the film disappointedly morphs into a more generic slasher/horror movie that falls short on scares. Overally, Last Night In Soho is still an engaging watch, if only because of its fantastic set designs, cinematographic visuals, Edgar Wright's quirky directing, top cast performances (look out for Diana Rigg's excellent final screen appearance) and that 60s throwback touch.",Last Night in Soho

118,kstice-25195,Enjoyable movie that misses its full potential,6,29 October 2021,"I love the premise for Last Night in Soho. Edgar Wright creates an original plot and setting by connecting the glamor of the 1960s to modern day through a murder mystery and ghost tale. The movie does a wonderful job at bringing the 1960s alive and peaking the viewer's interest in the mystery. Anya Taylor-Joy steals the show as Sandie, and is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack. Unfortunately, there were enough faults with the movie to prevent it from reaching the level of quality in Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead or Anya Taylor-Joy's The Witch. The biggest problem is that the movie feels redundant towards the end, as the suspense and revelations of the past never reach a terrifying level. Another fault is that the climax of the film fails to reach its full potential due to poor character decisions and underutilized supernatural elements. But on the whole, Last Night in Soho is still an enjoyable film worth watching. 6/10Pros and Cons Summary+Anya Taylor-Joy+Amazing soundtrack+Original plot-Film gets repetitive towards the end-The movie should have been scarier and more suspenseful-Climax has its strong points, but also fails in some noticeable aspects.",Last Night in Soho

124,MilosH18,A colourful yet dark journey,7,6 November 2021,"Edgar Wright creates a decent psychological thriller that explores Eloise's life in the modern-day and her visions of the 1960s. Several things stood out for me: the enhanced colours brought London to its most beautiful, the choreography was astonishing, and the costume design was 10/10. The plot had its gripping twists, alongside some tumbles, which I still question myself after finishing the film. A minor issue I had was the character of Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen). I believe that her purpose is a rather old school portrayal, and in my opinion, her constant bullying and fakeness do not fit the modern-day representation they were seeking. In contrast, Thomasin McKenzie, from start to finish, performed outstandingly and I would not be surprised if she claims awards for her role in this film.

There are a few minor plotholes and at some point the movie was starting to lose me as a viewer. It became a bit too much of a psychological thriller. Luckily, things got turned around just in time to leave me satisfied in the end. It isn't easy to explain this without giving away spoilers, so I guess you'd have to watch it for yourself.This movie turned out to be a cinematographic marble and I wasn't expecting this at all. It's made by the same guy who directed Baby Driver and it shows. Both these movies have great acting and a killer soundtrack in common.Extra bonus points for Anya Taylor-Joy (that girl from the Queen's Gambit). She was amazing as a 60's persona.

132,josiahliljequist,Sparking psychological thriller that sputters at the end,7,30 October 2021,"So I came into this movie with seismic expectations, absolutely loving Baby Driver and having watched all of Edgar Wright's films (and a lot of his recommendations). And I was slightly disappointed, but only because he had a classic to follow up (Baby Driver).So the movie starts out wonderfully, with a silhouetted Eloise dancing to a 60s tune, as the camera follows her and pans into a 60s bonanza of posters and memorabilia. It reminded me of the opening of Adventures in Babysitting, in which the lead female character likewise starts the movie off by dancing to a 60s upbeat tune. It made Eloise instantly quirky and likable, and it established her love for the 60s, in just a couple of minutes or so. Classic Edgar Wright. Then she is accepted into a fashion college, and moves out to London. She finds that the big city is not all that it's cracked up to be, as she's hit on by a creepy taxi driver, and is gossiped about by her roommate. So far, great seeping psychological tension created by Edgar Wright.So then Eloise decides to move out and move into a Soho apartment to ""escape."" And that's when Wrightesque things get into full gear. An otherwise quiet beginning becomes loud with 60s music, bright with marquees and neon lights, and there is gorgeous cinematography, including a 360 panorama of 60s Soho, coordinated reflection shots of Eloise and Sandy, and impeccable transitions in the iconic dance scene. Beautiful, smooth, musical.And then the movie shifts to its ""message,"" and ghost story part which in it of itself isn't a bad thing. But when the ghost guys in tuxedos begin appearing around every corner, the message begins to become redundant, and the psychological aspect of the movie loses energy. Subtlety gives way to obvious symbols and even some questionable music choices (Always Something There to Remind me was a little on the nose). It's not that it ruins the film--it doesn't, as the two lead actresses do a fantastic job throughout the movie, and the soundtrack is consistently popping. It's just that the cgi ghosts drag the movie down, and undercut the otherwise disturbing tension that was created in the first third of the movie. And without spoiling it, the ending sort of cheats the audience, and reveals the plot to be more of a message and idea than a...well...a plot. But overall, Last Night in Soho is an immersive experience by Edgar Wright that crumbles a little bit when entering the ghost moral message segment of the movie.",Last Night in Soho
133,philipmagnier,Falls Short,6,8 November 2021,"Something of a disappointment. I went to the film because of Baby Driver, also directed by Edgar Wright.He's a director who can deliver okay: much of the exposition is classy but the material itself is not quite there.I enjoyed the depictions of London, today and in the past: the glamour mixed with the seediness. The scenes of the ingenue arriving in the city are well depicted and move the story along. The film however does lose groundedness and momentum in the last third.I kept wondering what Roman Polanski would have made of the material, and particularly how he would have strengthened the script. He has made a couple of films with similar themes. (Most people here have probably not heard of him). Even while realistically showing individuals descend into madness, his films always had a foot in believable reality.This film loses that as mentioned. I'm wondering whether Mr Wright is better at the entertainment end of the spectrum. Can't wait to see Baby Driver 2.",Last Night in Soho

No sooner does she arrive than--just as she's feeling overwhelmed by the vibrant London nightlife--she begins having troubling dreams about a hard-partying, 60s-era blonde named Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy, ""The Queen's Gambit""). Who is
Sandie? Is she Ellie's alter-ego, the ultra-confident swinger Ellie only wishes she could be? Or someone--

As layer upon layer of the mystery are peeled away, the truth is gradually revealed...and then, just when you're sure there can't be any more surprises, here comes another, and it's the most eye-opening and jaw-dropping one of them all. The climax features such horrifying imagery that you might want to sleep with the lights up--way up. Directed by Edgar Wright, aided and abetted by a nifty '60s soundtrack. With the late Diana Rigg (in her final screen appearance) as Ellie's no-nonsense landlady, and Terence Stamp as a strange old goat who won't leave Ellie alone.

I went in knowing very little about plot and character and that proved all the better for it.Last Night in Soho is visually and tonally majestic - beautifully and compellingly shot, switching from comedy and light heartedness one second to completely horrific and scary the next. The visuals and tone really are best friends here, playing off one another to create a mostly thrilling twisty-turny story.However, there are problems with said story - mainly, that it is muddled and somewhat confusing... I think the narrative style is the culprit, bouncing back and forth between past and present, mixing the 'reflections' in the movie with the real individuals in that particular section of the film which ultimately leads to what feels like a tacked on, unconvincing and disappointing ending.I would say that Last Night In Soho is a film that needs to be experienced...

I don't think he's made an average film yet. They've all been at least fantastic. So my expectations were incredibly high, and my interest peaked as Wright switched to the horror genre after primarily focusing on comedy. And once again, he succeeds in making an amazing, unique and stylish film that I have no doubt will become a classic.The film has Edgar Wright's fingerprints all over it in all the best ways. The film is brilliantly directed by him and the cinematographer (Chung-hoon Chung) does a great job. 1960s London feels like a completely different place to modern day London just from the colour pallet, let alone the incredible sets and costumes. So much effort and care clearly went into crafting an accurate depiction of the style and and general look of the time.I won't really go into any details about the characters or the story as I went in blind and definitely think that's the best way to experience this film. Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy steal the show here; McKenzie especially stands out and should potentially be considered come award season (the film in general should be considered for multiple awards). Matt Smith is also good here.The film deals a lot with themes of exploitation, anxiety and mental health specifically within certain fields of work and cultures.

150,Killerb44,Excellent Movie,10,1 November 2021,This was an excellent and well paced horror movie with a good twist at the end. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of the genre. The acting was great and the story kept me engaged.,Last Night in Soho
151,parksiet,Stylish and creative film from Edgar Wright,9,29 October 2021,"Right from the opening frame of ""Last Night in Soho"", I knew this was an Edgar Wright movie. It had clever and dynamic cinematography, intricate lighting, a fantastic soundtrack playing and a lively, instantly iconic performance from its lead actor. What I didn't expect was how different the rest of the movie would be from Wright's other works. And this isn't a bad thing at all, instead it made me love the movie even more as Edgar Wright brought his talents to the horror genre and created something so distinctly unique that I can't stop thinking about it. It's unlike anything he's ever done before, but filled with his creative flair and technical prowess. And I loved the journey he took me on! I don't want to say too much about the story, because it's best to go in cold and just experience the movie! It's thrilling, intense, very intriguing and explored some very interesting themes that used the horror aspects well! Wright also perfectly subverts expectations not only in the story (there's a lot of surprises and twists I did not see coming) but also with the genre and finds a way to almost make this a movie that doesn't fit into one clear genre. It's very much it's own thing, with elements of murder mystery, time travel, psychological thriller, slasher, surreal dream and ghost sequences and a touch of romance. I also loved how a lot of the horrific elements to the film have real-world connections, basically communicating the feeling women have getting undesired attention from men. The film does an excellent job at showing micro-aggressions against women, and did so in such a real way, it's amazing that Edgar Wright was able to get it so right, and any woman watching this movie would probably be blown away at how scarily real some of the scenes in this movie are, such as the taxi cab scene. I loved that he was able to use horror in such a smart way that it had a social commentary to it while also being really disturbing, frightening and entertaining! It leaves a lot to discuss after the movie! It definitely helped that he brought Krysty Wilson-Cairns on as a co-writer! Wright managed to create such an eerie atmosphere within the film, and used location to his advantage. The community of Soho is pretty much a character in the film, and the streets, pubs, clubs and especially neon lights really worked for the film! The fact they were also able to completely transform it into the 60s was also unbelievable and super detailed! I loved the costuming and hairstyling and makeup too, it was all crucial to the story of the movie and every creative choice regarding these elements really had such a strong impact on the film. The cinematography of course was stunning, as with all of Wright's work, and I loved a lot of the neon lighting and the dynamic movements, especially in how they would move between Sandy and Eloise in the ""vision"" sequences. The dance scene in the club early in the film was super impressive, the choreography, camera movement, acting and editing all worked in perfect unison to create a long continuous shot that kept switching out Sandy and Eloise dancing with Jack, and it was mind blowing to watch it play on screen. Many of the shots were impressive like that, there was so much creativity and detail put into them. The editing of course was fantastic too, and again was so creative in how it bounced between shots of the two lead characters and the two time periods, and especially when it all blended. The soundtrack perfectly complemented the film too, it really help set the 60s atmosphere, and I loved how the songs played into the story. But who surprised, Edgar Wright is great at infusing music into his films. The original score by Stephen Price was even great, and offered some unique and haunting mixes of the songs we hear in the soundtrack too! Anya Taylor-Joy's versions of ""Downtown"" and ""You're My World"" are also perfect! She's actually such a talented singer, and also gave such a wonderful performance here. I really loved Thomasin McKenzie most, she played a character with so much innocence and naïveté that had to navigate this complex story, and she was perfectly cast! Not only that, but she can really hold her own as the lead of a movie, which is especially impressive when you have all these other talents in the film! Matt Smith, Terrence Stamp and Diana Rigg were also fantastic! And of course, Edgar Wright's direction style and overall skill as a filmmaker is perfect for this, and he still managed to surprise me with this film! I was really impressed with the stylish, creative and eerily thrilling film I saw! The film really captured the magic feeling of being swept away by something so well, and honestly the film itself swept me away. It's not my favourite Edgar Wright film, but it's still a pretty perfect film storywise and stunning in technical execution, I loved it and cannot recommend it enough, it's a must see! Wright's signature style mixed with the clever and unique premise proved to make for quite the surreal, thrilling and impressive experience!",Last Night in Soho
152,artdumoi,A lovely eerie movie,9,27 October 2021,"Beautifully crafted with amazing performances and sceneries. The story keeps evolving crescendo but becomes at time convoluted yet it all made sense in the end. Somewhat gave me the vibe of a brainstorming session between Hitchcock, Darren Aronofsky and Agatha Christie and the result is nothing short of spectacular. Entertaining. Frightening.

It's a bit messy at times, and as a whole it didn't totally click for me, but I still had one hell of a fun time. Thomasin McKenzie, Anya Taylor-Joy, Diana Rigg, and Terrence Stamp are all superb, and throughout every passing minute of the film you can tell how much thought and detail Edgar Wright works into every frame. This is also a really good movie about leaving your small town to attend college in the big city, which is currently my life.",Last Night in Soho
154,Alec_Michael,Where Will Edgar Go From Here?,8,2 November 2021,"I'm hesitant to give this movie the 8/10 I gave it simply because it doesn't have that classic Edgar Wright ""charm"" and editing style that his movies usually have. This definitely threw me off but after thinking for a while I realized that this was the only criticism I really had besides minor things here and there. The story was enjoyable, the characters were fun, the horror aspect was more unsettling than scary (which suited this movie), and the twist was fun. Overall, it was a great movie and I know my opinion will only grow the more I watch it, the main reason I gave it a higher score than I initially would have. This does beg the question though, what will come of Edgar Wright in his future endeavors? Will his classic style come back or at least show through in other projects or has that taken a back seat for a more classic style? One thing I will say is I hope he doesn't lose his charm simply to be taken more seriously.",Last Night in Soho
155,klotzilla-1,Fresh take on horror genre,9,3 November 2021,"The last original take on horror seems like 1979's Alien, a movie that scared the bejeezus out of my 14 year old psyche.While this worthy entry by Edgar Wright is a horror movie, it's not one that keeps you on edge for an extended period, if at all. It has scary and gruesome images, especially in the second half, as the terror tableaux is revealed piece by piece.But this film is far more female-centric than all the slasher horror films combined. Men are menacing terrors everywhere, or perhaps nowhere, as the reality and fantasy elements overlap and stack in a way that ratchets the tension ever higher.I never would've seen this film if not for my wife, who loves 1960s Brit pop music and heard about it on Fresh Air with Terry Gross.I enjoyed it immensely and will see it again.",Last Night in Soho

158,taratree,Conflicted,7,10 November 2021,"This was a real tricky film to review for me. On the one hand, what beautiful set pieces and music. On the other, some frankly weird performances (although that may just be as a yank not getting what they were trying to accomplish). Loved the girl from Queen's Gambit, thought the main girl was great too, but it left me feeling unsatisfied as a movie. Although I have to say, I did like the Hammer House of Horror feeling, and some classic Wright lines came out too. I think maybe I need to rewatch this one to really 'get' what everyone loves about it.",Last Night in Soho

160,buke95,Suspenseful and Intriguing,9,31 October 2021,"This film is the proof that we can still come up with new ideas for movies in 2021. Last Night in Soho engages the viewer more and more as it progresses with its intriguing plot, while blessing our eyes with many beautiful shots of London. The acting by the whole cast was also wonderful, and definitely added up to the atmosphere that the movie creates.Spoilers after this.My boyfriend said that he got confused with the message that the movie is trying to convey after seeing that Sandy murdered basically everyone. However, I think it is the opposite. Let's say, if we saw Sandy dying and Eloise taking back her revenge by cooperating with the police etc., than all the characters would have been black and white. However, seeing that Sandy was able to not just defend herself but even attack back to her customers aggressively and violently adds depth to her character and the whole plot, making us question who was the victim. We can not fully blame Sandy, since she was put in many situations that she never wanted to be involved in. To me it feels even normal that a person at that position would have lost all her empathy. Yet, despite everything, did those men deserve to die? While we all saw them as horrifying ghosts trying to scare away Eloise throughout the movie, at the end we notice that they were actually just trying to ask for help. Although I would not be in favor of anything that they did, it is possible that they were doing what everyone thinks is normal back at the time- which was horrible to being with. This, in fact, I believe was another message that the movie is giving, that we should not fantasise about the past just because of the wonderful clothings.",Last Night in Soho

It takes you in so many different directions that you don't know what's hitting you. I'll easily be seeing this two or three more times in the theater, I can't recommend it enough.",Last Night in Soho

163,jbridge-1991,A Ferocious Melding of Various Film Genres That Actually Works,8,1 November 2021,"'Last Night In Soho' is director Edgar Wright's paean to a decade he reveres (the 1960's), yet he cautions the audience on the dangers of nostalgia while simultaneously carousing enthusiastically in an era he missed.A young fashion student obsessed by the 60's, Ellie (Thomasin McKenzie), travels from Cornwall to London to study fashion, but having fallen out with fellow roommates at her student digs, she moves to more homely accommodation via a bedsit owned by elderly landlady Miss Collins (Diana Rigg) in surroundings that recall that decade. Afflicted by the suicide of her mother when she was a child, she is transported back to Swinging London (namely Soho) in the 60's after experiencing a vivid dream, and merges into the personality of an aspiring singer, Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy) at a Soho nightclub. For a short while, all appears magical and inspirational to Ellie, but Jack (Matt Smith), a charming manager who Sandie starts dating, starts pimping the latter off to seedy older men, as Ellie's time travelling takes on a more sinister turn as she apparently begins to see visions of Sandie's death at Jack's hands, plus other ghostly apparitions, and is often accosted by an old man (Terence Stamp) who may or maybe not Jack. She goes to the authorities to try and explain, but is not believed. Are these events mere delusions of a troubled mind or not?Edgar Wright utilises so many different styles of filmmaking here it isn't true; Time Travel, Psychological Horror, Slasher Horror, Supernatural Hammer-style horror, a dash of Film Noir with additions of Italian-style giallo plotting and action, with nods of approval to directors such as Polanski (Repulsion), Romero (Zombies), Hitchcock (a bit of Psycho, but perhaps rather more Rebecca), Argento (Suspiria) among others. Throwing everything into this brew, Wright could have got himself into a lot of trouble, and his script (co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns) could have contained sharper dialogue, more detailed characterizations and less obvious far-fetched coincidences and complications that lead to occasional confusion when wavering from past to present.Yet technically, the film is extraordinary, with top-class production, a vivid colour-drenched mise-en-scene, (typical of Argento and his fellow Italian giallo/horror director Mario Bava, with praise going to cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung) , outstanding costume design, pin-point editing and perfectly pitched direction by Wright which really makes you believe you are back in that seminal decade , with occasional bravura, matched by fine performances all round, from the two young female leads (Taylor-Joy, McKenzie), the sleazy, hollow-eyed charmer Smith, and 60's legends Stamp and Rigg, the latter of whom gives the film's best performance, and of course, a sumptuous soundtrack of 60's classics, flawlessly woven into the narrative. Two other 60's legends also appear; Rita Tushingham as Ellie's grandmother, and Margaret Nolan, in a brief but still notable cameo as a barmaid. Sadly, both Dame Diana and Maggie Nolan passed away shortly after the movie's completion, but Wright graciously features tributes to them both at the movie's start and finish.As for the final revelation, it will probably disappoint and surprise equal numbers, but others like me will accept it as the kind of finale you would expect when watching any generic giallo or supernatural horror movie, from a decade that Wright still obviously adores despite his admonishments of delving into to the past, and despite the acres of cinematic references, his direction is still distinctive and produces a very entertaining and greatly enjoyable tribute-cum-harsh critique of an age gone by.Rating:8 and a half out of 10.",Last Night in Soho
164,annabelfwatts,Mental health warning may be needed,6,31 October 2021,"Came out of the cinema feeling deflated and somewhat conflicted?Edgar Wright is an outstanding director and writer, will always want to give his films 10/10.Physiological horror/thriller. Know not the intention but perhaps glamourised mental health issues. Perhaps just hit a bit close to home? The classic storyline of an issue that a character believes something and others don't, heart goes out to the protagonist.Edgar Wright is known for his excellent music taste, this film is no different. Beautiful soundtrack including Anya Taylor Joy singing a wonderful cover for Downtown. Micheal Ajao was an absolute hero and the supportive friend everyone needs.Was excited to watch with fresh eyes, avoided all trailers and spoilers. Overall conflicted know will enjoy more second time around!",Last Night in Soho
165,nizarsalim,One of the Best Horror Movies of this Year. But Nothing Comes Perfect,9,3 November 2021,"In Last Night in Soho, everything is literally excellent. The performances of Taylor-Joy and McKenzie, the story and its twist at the end, the storytelling, the 60s nostalgia, the production value and production design, the lighting, the direction, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the horror elements, and the atmosphere (although I found it neither too normal nor too attractive and tense) are all outstanding and amazing. I literally couldn't find any flaw at all in anyone of these elements.But when it comes to the flaws, at least from my own point of view, Last Night in Soho has only one little flaw, which is that when Ellie saw Sandie being stabbed by Jack in her dream, it would have been better if the truth (that Sandie was the one who stabbed Jack, not the contrary) was revealed at that time because the question in this case becomes like this: Ellie saw almost all the details of Sandie's life, and she didn't see any detail in a wrong way except for this one, why did she particularly see this detail wrongly? This makes some kind of a gap, especially if we know that Ellie was communicating with the spirits of the men whom Sandie killed. Why didn't they directly show her what exactly happened?But of course, this flaw doesn't mean that Last Night in Soho is a bad movie. On the contrary, it is one of the best horror-thriller movies that I watched in 2021. So when it comes to the score, I give it 9 out of 10.",Last Night in Soho

But it appears in the same fashion as his other films just not as much. Which is completely okay in fact I think it elevates it even more because Edgar wasn't attempting to follow the same style he had set in place with his prior movies he could just direct the way he wanted to, how he wanted to and that gave us great performances, fantastic framing and pacing, great editing and sound design. It also only further proved Edgar Wright is more than just a flashy music obsessed director. He's a true master of the art.

The whole music combined to those places where the sleazy side behaved in a way not deemed to be PC now.

172,Mr-Topshotta,"""LAST NIGHT IN SOHO' REVIEW",3,1 November 2021,"""LAST NIGHT IN SOHO"" REVIEWDirected by Edgar Wright. If you've seen any of his work, usually it's really good and he has an eye for film for sure. His movies are always amazingly shot. Starring Thomasin McKenzie as ""Eloise"" a English teen with a old soul from the country side of England. She just got accepted to a prestige fashion school in London. ""Eloise"" eats, breaths, and everything in between fashion. This is a dream come true but there is one problem she also has the power to see ghost. Tell me where you've heard that before?""Last Night in Soho"" takes you on a journey of ""Eloise"" connecting to a women named ""Sandie"" played by Anya Taylor-Joy who you may know from playing the lead in ""The Queen's Gambit"". ""Eloise"" falls victim of trying to juggle being a country girl with an old soul now in London, being a freshmen, and dealing with a constant cycle of her reality blending with past events of ""Sandie"". It's a world wind movie that makes you feel like your going nuts along with ""Eloise"" while she loses her self dealing with the past and present all at the same time.This movie is shot great. The fashion is Immaculate. The main character ""Eloise"" is deeply inspired by the 60's and they convey that very well. They have great actors in it. Even though I haven't seen the main actor Thomasin in a lot of films, she's still a very talented actor. I truly felt like I was going crazy watching her play crazy. But with all that, I'm so tired of this recent theme I'm seeing. A great looking, bad movie. I want to see a overall good movie, not only beautiful visuals or costume designs. There is a place for that but I want more as a viewer.The concept was very ""Six Sense"" ish. But frankly this was odd and weird. So many things you can poke holes at. It was just trying to do, to much. This is the first Edgar Wright movie I was truly disappointed in. Like I said it was shot well and costume design could win a Oscar. But movie wise this wasn't it. Shame to put all that amazing acting, to waste. It feels like your watching a bunch of smaller ideas put together to make one big confusing idea. I saw this film with a variety of age groups and we all left the theater with the same perplexed look on our face. If that tells you anything. I give it two more fires🔥🔥

173,sipodge,"A Thoroughly Decent Film, But it Doesn't Live Up to the Trailers",6,7 November 2021,"I was captivated by the premise of the film, as seen in the trailers, but unfortunately the film falls flat after the halfway mark. The direction is superb, the acting worthy of praise, and the 1960s soundtrack a fabulous touch; however, the plot (although not complicated) is more complex than it needs to be: trying to be more clever than it actually is, particularly in the final act.The main character, whose story and experiences we follow, starts out as unique and captivating, standing in stark contrast to the world around her - which creates some interesting conflicts; however, by the end of the film she loses this edge and (perhaps intentionally) is indistinguishable from the world around her.Additionally, it was lovely to see Dame Diana Rigg on the big screen one last time, but it's a shame that this was to be her final role.Last Night in Soho is a thoroughly decent film, but is disappointing in light of the creative flair promised in the trailers.",Last Night in Soho

176,parkerm-21549,A neon lit nightmare (this is a compliment),10,29 October 2021,"Edgar Wright truly knows how to tell a story. Seeing him take on a mind-bending horror/thriller taking place in both 60's/modern day Soho is truly awesome.The music (Wright's genius trademark) leads the film and really encapsulates the mood and eerie vibe of the story (House of Balloons at the Halloween party was great). The editing is remarkable (that dance scene with Jack and the girls was unreal), the acting is phenomenal, and the visuals of neon and darkness truly capture the sinister underbelly of London for Eloise and women in general.I can honestly say this film gave me more chills than any other in recent memory. It definitely keeps you guessing, on the edge of your seat, and you truly feel the horror Eloise feels when she's living out this nightmare of Sandy's.One of my favorite scenes was Sandy going through each night dancing, telling a new guy a new name, and then so on. Leading to Eloise fleeing the club in a truly nightmarish panic as the men chase her.The twist at the end was actually unforeseen by me most of the film until we realized the old man really wasn't Jack. I liked how Sandy was a survivor and Eloise understood why she did what she did.Honestly, I love Edgar Wright, Anya Taylor Joy, and Thomasin McKenzie.

The ending was not great, some questions still remain unanswered.I really liked the whole ""twist"" thing but i feel like there was something missing. The first half was mysterious, but the end felt rushed and the story ended quick. I'd like to know more about Lindsey - did he survive, what did he think of Sandie - did he know she was a killer? I also don't get the ending - did they all heard about what Sandie did?

179,mikearima,Mystery meets Creep,8,31 October 2021,"I came into this movie thinking it was going to be just like any other mystery thriller. It sort of was.The main character is this really cute actress, whom I only seen in the movie ""old"" which I thought was very cheesy by the way.Her acting and beauty is what made her a good choice for this role. She reminds me of the actress Dakota Fanning, but like the new generation version. The other actress, the mystery woman in the movie was absolutely gorgeous. If you want eye candy and scenery, this movie has it. What caught me most about the film was the music. It was retro and gave me some nostalgic memories of the disco era.The movie itself starts off strong with the character introduced to be a fashion artist student who goes to London to pursue her dream to be a fashion designer. She meets people there and somehow she is able to relive the past when she rents out this mysterious room.The girl finds clues of the mystery womans past and discovers that these ghosts are haunting her as she relives an older womans past. The twist at the end was astonishing, but not as astonishing as ""malignant"".If you ever seen the TV show ""Black mirror"" I believe you would enjoy this as the whole movie is a dark story and creepy setting. It is a blend of classic horror and mystery with a bit of heebie jeebie romance.What ruined the movie for me was the ending. I really thought the directors rushed it and botched up what could have been amazing into a silly aftermath. I wont spoil anything, but it is the worst part of the movie.Overall, I recommend to watch in Dolby at the movie theaters because it brings out the energy of the scenery and setting of the movie. There are a few jump-scares and eerie images, but the whole movie kept me on my feet. There was no boring moments like with ""Dune"" which I thought was very overrated and incredibly boring.

185,diogobulhosa,Just another psychological horror film that brought nothing new to the genre,6,2 November 2021,"Last Night in Soho, one of the most anticipated movies of the year, did nothing but disappoint. Unfortunately the film seems to lack some of the most iconic signature styles in Edgar Wright's cinematography.Despite the interesting plot and overall solid argument, Edgar Wright's continued attempts to detach himself from his earlier films and elevate his status as a director, just seem to be backfiring on him. The movie lacks his comedic flair, and unparalleled musical moments (which are what held Baby Driver up as a good film). The cinematography is impeccable, and yes you can sense Edgar Wright's touch in every single frame, but it's not enough. The only thing that truly amazed me were the transitions, and how well the parallelism between the past and present was made. Thomas Mkengzie was great, but it was Anya Taylor-Joy and Matt Smith who carried the movie. The dancing scene with a small wink to Fellini 8½ (or Pulp Fiction) really made me smile. The first hour or so is enjoyable, but once the horror fully kicks in, it seems that Edgar Wright's only strategy to keep the audience gripped was through some very uninteresting and sort of predictable jump scares. There are some good shots, and the use of color is great, but once again, not enough. The soundtrack is still pretty good and worth listening to after leaving the theatres, this man really does have a good taste in music.Overall the film is just average. Just another psychological horror film that brought nothing new to the genre. Usually Edgar Wright's movies always bring a breath of fresh air, or deliver an iconic scene cued to the music, but not this one. He stayed loyal to the genre from start to finish, and I believe most people would be expecting more from him.",Last Night in Soho
186,ethanbirkin,Average (light spoilers),6,3 November 2021,"It breaks my heart that I did not love this film but in all fairness I wasn't expecting to ever since the first trailer came out.Originally being rumoured as a horror film from Edgar Wright I was certainly intrigued as the Cornetto trilogy has plenty of ties and genre nods to different horror films. However, when the first trailer came out I found myself to be disinterested in the premise.Anyway having now actually experienced Last Night In Soho how does it hold up? It is pretty alright I guess. On a technical standpoint the film is gorgeously shot with plenty of smooth and long movements quite unlike some of his previous work. Now I am not saying I need every Wright film to cut 27 times every 10 seconds but there was something about the cinematic presentation that although technically very good was lacking some of his personality. All this considered the film looks great apart from some very generic designs in the third act.The film narratively is fine but stumbles over itself in the third act which left me shrugging as by the time the credits rolled I no longer cared or was remotely scared.There is one scene in particular early on when Eloise first travels to the 60s which I thought was near cinematic perfection and the highlight of the film for me, not to imply it's all downhill from that point but no other moment captured that magic or so effectively put me in a characters shoes as that scene did.On the whole, there is more to like about this film than whinge about; I just didn't connect with it as I much as I'd hoped. The performances are all strong and it is rather gorgeous at times but on the whole it was just fine to me nothing amazing and it might even be my least favourite Wright film as I think I was probably more entertained by Scott Pilgrim's visually even if the characters in that film are even more underdeveloped.One final note: the marketing for this film as a horror was a bad idea as the film is never scary and probably would've worked better without leaning into horror elements as the subject matter is horrific on its own two feet. Moreover yeh tagline is also misleading ""Murder in the past, mystery in the present"" as I didn't really feel like the film develops a mystery at all which is a shame because that could have made it a lot more engaging. Finally, here in Britain it has been rated 18 but I honestly cannot see why it is not very violent no is it incredibly graphic with depictions of sex and in fact the certificate just mentions violence as the reason for its high rating which I think is a shame as the film feels aimed at a teen audience who will not be able to see it because of the stuffy BBFC.",Last Night in Soho

192,george_t93,Consistently entertaining,7,2 October 2021,"What if Hitchcock an Dario Argento had a nephew that loved Agatha Christie novels? That's the premise of the film's aesthetics and I found especially the first half of the film to be really captivating. Anya Taylor Joy's first scene especially was really masterfully crafted. The leading actress was also impeccable.Nevertheless as the film's story built up steam for a climax, the choice of a particularly ugly CGI and some pointless jump-scares started putting me off. The writing became over the top by the end, but at least it all made sense eventually. Thankfully it maintained a steady coolness, with great music and solid acting, and beautiful costumes and scenery. While the nonsense put off some of my ""film buff"" friends, I found it consistently entertaining, and a fun time at the movies.I saw this at a late night screening, at Athens International Film Festival. The hour, the crowd and the vibe really helped the movie experience for me. I recommend it, if you don't get in with high expectations.",Last Night in Soho
193,tubosun97,I Wanna Wake Up From This Movie,5,1 November 2021,"Okay, this movie was not Edgar's best. Per usual, Edgar's sound design is incredible. Characters speaking off-screen, echoing voices, and a dazzling soundtrack - this grabbed my attention - but that's about it.Our protagonist, a soft-spoken fashion designer with the personality of a cold slice of toast mumbles through the movie only daring to speak up when she's haunted by hereditary visions. It made the movie hard to care about but she wasn't the only thing that was uninteresting. The bully, Jocasta, served no purpose outside of being a bully. The love interest, John, had an undying (literally) attachment to a girl he had only known to be borderline psychotic.Unfortunately, Mr. Wright has given us good style without a whole lot of substance. For me, not worth the initial watch and definitely not worth a recommend.",Last Night in Soho
194,TwinMeag1,Still Dancing in My Mind,8,4 November 2021,"I don't often feel the need to share my thoughts on films, but considering 'Last Night in Soho' hasn't left my mind since I exited the theater, it feels necessary. To categorize this solely as a horror is unfair, it's a movie filled with mindbogglingly brilliant camera work and performances from all involved. And although horror elements are present, it feels like this movie is almost a genre of its own borrowing from nostalgia and psychological thrillers. While Anya-Taylor Joy is mesmerizing in anything she does, Thomasin McKenzie is the one to watch in this movie. She channels the '60s starlets her character Eloise emulates with such precision, you can't help but be in awe. This is a movie worth watching, not just once, but many times.",Last Night in Soho

This didn't come to much of a a surprise for anyone familiar with Wright's previous works, most notably his acclaimed ""Cornetto Trilogy"" which on the surface are black comedy cult favourites, but Wright's instantly noticeable style, favours very well when used for scenes that depict Horror.Wright utilises his erratic yet rhythmic editing style in this film to a degree which is both visually and audibly exhilarating for his fans, and any fans of modern horror.",Last Night in Soho

Why would Ellie then have sympathy for Sandy during the fire scene when she has literally just attempted to kill her and her friend?More questions than answers at the end left me feelin unfulfilled.

198,anodette,A Triump for Edgar Wright,10,29 October 2021,"Surely, this will do poorly at the box office. Even pre-pandemic, Edgar Wright's name alone was not enough to draw in a crowd, despite making nothing but hits that are themselves very popular with audiences once they reach home media. Regardless, this movie succeeds in every way possible, box office shouldn't matter here. They say that all manner of classic movies did poorly in their time. Blade Runner, The Thing, The Shining, etc. These movies are considered classic masterpieces today, but were far from box office gold at the time. I feel like this will be the fate of Last Night in Soho. Perhaps it's better to live a long life as a masterpiece than it is to live a short one as a box office beauty.What can be said about Edgar Wright's editing that hasn't been said already? How about this: it works for horror just as well as it works for comedy. This was thrilling, psychological, unnerving, yet still had all the charm and life that any other of Wright's films brings. What truly shines here are the performances by the actors. Thomasin McKenzie is truly making her mark at cinemas this year. After a good performance in Shyamalan's Old earlier this year, I knew she'd be an actress to look out for. Little did I know what she was capable of. She has the charisma of somebody like a Will Smith and that is clear and omnipresent in this film. And to act across powerhouses like Anya Taylor-Joy and Matt Smith is no small feat. These two also give wonderful performances, and perhaps a career best by Smith. Diana Rigg also gives a stellar performance, playing a typical Diana Rigg character.Another standout of this movie is the soundtrack. With a lot of the film being set in the 1960's the soundtrack is filled with classic songs. Coupled with Wright's kinetic editing, one can imagine perfect blend. This soundtrack also serves the psychological nature of the film. When Wright takes the occasional trip down psychedelic-like scenery, it feels very natural.As for the unnatural, we have the plot. And I mean that in a positive way. This is a very unique thriller with plenty of twists and reveals that make the viewer relate to the protagonist as they both seem to be slipping into madness as more is learned. Very fortunately, unlike some psychological horror/thrillers, this movie knows how to end properly and satisfyingly.Overall, this was perhaps the best time I've had at the movies in a very long time. But what's more than that, this was one of the best experiences consuming any media in a very long time. I feel like I watched something that will be regarded as a classic in the future for the very first time. I truly hope that it can reach that status, because everyone should see this movie. I can't wait to see what Edgar Wright does next, because I'm sure it will blow me away. I also hope it encourages other directors to step out of their comfort zones and try out genres they are not known for, because this very well may be Edgar Wright's best film to date.",Last Night in Soho

200,akbrinded,Time will not be kind to movie,5,31 October 2021,"VIsually stunning.Superb soundtrack.I suspect time may not be too kind on this movie, and a lot of that stems from a screenplay which spends too much time on minor plot points and too little time grounding its own logic. I have 8 questions.....1. How did Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy)/Ms. Collins (Diana Rigg) come to own, or live in the house on Goodge Street?2. WHY would Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy)/Ms. Collins (Diana Rigg) want to own, or live in the house on Goodge Street? Okay, so you've murdered 100 men and hid their corpses in the wall cavities, but why would you want to live there?3. I don't believe the strong smell of garlic emitting from the restaurant nearby would be enough to mask the smell of 100 rotting corpses over 50+ years old.4. Why would you rent out the bedsit with corpses in the walls?5. Why do the ghosts of the murdered men only come clean about what it is they want from Eloise at the very end of the movie, and why spend a significant portion of the movie being creepy and basically doing everything to ensure that Eloise is going to run away from you. Seems counterproductive. What happened to allow the ghosts to change from being terrifying, to asking Eloise to kindly do what is necessary to release them?6. Eloise is not the first inhabitant of the bedsit, so what is it that's so specific about her that allows her to go on this journey with Sandie?7. What's the point of Eloise's dead mother popping up?8. How did Sandi get away with murdering 100 men, including Jack?",Last Night in Soho

This is a great shame as many people are going to miss it in theaters, but I see this as one of those movies that gets popular years after it's release.Aside from a couple minor pacing issues I found this film entertaining and it's been the only film I've actually went back to see twice while it was still in theaters.

For me, it's definitely Edgar's strongest film, a technical marvel with incredible in camera effects, a nostalgic compilation of great 1960s music, accompanied by Stephen Price's atmospheric soundtrack, and a vibrant colour palette backed up by a stellar cast who bring all of their acting talent to bear on a film that has clearly been a labour of love for the whole team.Definitely try and go into the movie unspoiled, the marketing team did a great job of holding back too many spoilers during the film's promotion. This is a magical movie that really clicked for me and serves as an important reminder of what can be so special about cinema when so many wonderful elements are expertly pieced together by a team who care about their art and a director who's at the top of his game.Being wary of spoilers I hadn't realised that this film would mark the final cinematic appearances of Dame Diana Rigg and Margaret Nolan, so their performances were a welcome surprise and the dedications to their memory that bookend the film were a lovely tribute, may they both rest in peace.",Last Night in Soho

214,Bloodysquite,Edgar Wright breaking the mold,9,7 November 2021,"Edgar Wright is a director that typically takes a scenario, throws in quick and quippy dialogue mixed with quick cuts and sound design as the glue, this is seasoned with a specific humor that can only be found in his films. This is the most prominent in the three Cornetto films, and also with Scott Pilgrim. Even in Baby Driver, which is without a doubt his most serious film prior to Soho, it doesn't take itself too serious and most importantly it isn't afraid to have fun while still bringing those intense action moments and unforgettable characters. This type of story is expected from most audiences and fans of Wright and if you want more of this sort of film, then you certainly won't find that in his newest addition to his filmography, Last Night in Soho. This time Edgar Wright took a bold step to break the mold. And I say it's a bold step mostly due to the fact that we're talking about a director that is in his seventh film, even though he may not be selling tickets by just his name (though who really is anymore?) he's still grown enough of a dedicated fanbase that scurry to the theater to see his next story come to life on screen. Some may argue that if you find what works then run with it, but does that mean to never try anything new? Well quite frankly when you break the mold, either it works or it doesn't. And Last Night in Soho works...until it doesn't. The concept itself is completely fresh and creative, this is where Wright has never let his audience down in my opinion. He can take any concept and make it feel completely fresh. Also in Soho there is also a fantastic 60's soundtrack that was clearly handpicked by Edgar himself. These two attributes is where Wright is most visible in the film, however the quick cuts and dialogue aren't here because they are not appropriate for a slow tension building thriller. I would have liked to see the film have a little more fun even though it is a horror/thriller and the material itself is dirty and dark. I get it. The most fun we get is a little dancing in the opening from our lead character Ellie. Aside from that, the jokes and fun are bare bones here. Again, maybe not entirely appropriate constantly throughout but one or two wouldn't have hurt. And in that sense, with the dark subject matter and tension building to a final twist, it just didn't feel like a film Edgar Wright film at all. When it didn't work was toward the end when the film sort of fell apart. It's just scene after scene of our lead running around and being haunted by the past, though I won't go too much into spoilers. In the end, I commend him for taking a big chance here and can't wait to see what he makes further.",Last Night in Soho

Though we couldn't help but wonder if the overly graphic use of ""slash 'n blood"" at the end that just tipped the scale and made it a gory mess like any other teen-slasher/Freddy Krueger-ish flick, instead of what could have been a really cool retro study in terror. I even found myself covering my eyes with my COVID mask..it being just a little too much blood.Maybe even more use of the film's 60s icons Diana Rigg, and Rita Tushingham would've made it a bit more meaty.

The cinematography was mind-blowing, and the little details make the movie what it is. Also, the many callbacks scattered throughout the movie were great and really helped tie the present day and 60s stories together.

225,bssyhkv,A litany of cliches,2,6 November 2021,"From the first scene, my hopes for this film started to fade. It is abysmally written, knocked together by a grand total of two brain cells. The characters are cliche and uninteresting and without a single layer of depth, the setups predictable and revisited upon us from a millions other films (bedroom alarm clock going off... the bitchy classmates... overhearing someone talk about you in the bathroom... the plot twist..., etc etc ad nauseum), the acting for the most part unbelievable and often cringe. The one ray of light in the acting was Sam Claflin, who makes a tiny appearance but brings something of interest and intrigue. Why he's not become more mainstream over the years, I have no idea. Sure the cinematography is good, but this alone does not make a film. And we expect decent cinematography as standard from modern films given the leaps in digital technology. Nor does banging some old tunes over celluloid make it hip. This film is entirely style over substance, and unfortunately the style doesn't even come close to the style of the era it attempts to recreate.I'm suspicious of the IMDb rating this film gets. As usual, many one timers popping a rating in. There are 14,000 ratings for this film. This film has made $8 million at the box-office to date. If we assume roughly one in a hundred people rate a film on IMDb and that the average price of a cinema ticket is $15 (probably an underestimate), then this film should have made $21 million. Even if you're generous and give the figures a 30% lag time and account for preview ratings etc, you should still be hitting $15 mil.Me thinks many of these reviews are fake...",Last Night in Soho
226,kdinsiawurkma,WATCH IT!,10,30 October 2021,"This movie was amazing and is an instant classic. The cinematography was amazing, the music choices and the world's use of music and volume is suburb.The special effects are really good even the ones that were cheesy made it feel like it made on that way on purpose to evoke the old 60s B movies.It also handles the complexities of sexual assault and men's control over women and sexism through time is 10+/10.",Last Night in Soho
227,joshuadongalloo,A Hidden Masterpiece!,10,31 October 2021,"I love this movie from start to finish because of how the movie changes from a happy story to a unsettling, eerie story. I believe the trailer could mislead people that this movie is not worth watching, but this movie is more than worth watching.",Last Night in Soho
228,ethanjoughen,My Review on Last Night in Soho,10,29 October 2021,"Honestly what an absolutely masterpiece. I was skeptical at first after seeing the trailer but I'm a massive fan of Edgar Wright movies so I had high hopes. The movie absolutely blew my expectations out of the water. The story was phenomenal, the casting was perfect and the visuals were just out of this world. I honestly can't say anything bad about the movie. There was nothing I disliked and I would easily go see this movie 100+ more times. What an absolute masterpiece.",Last Night in Soho
229,maxjstevens,Worth A Watch,8,30 October 2021,"When I heard that Edgar Wright was releasing a new film, I was incredibly excited. My expectations were met when I finally watched it yesterday. Last Night In Soho is a visual treat and one of Wright's best releases, the first half of the film being one of the most intricate and beautiful sequences I have seen to date. However I do have issues with some of the narrative choices that undermine what I thought was a progressive feminist message from a male director, which is quite a rare sight. Overall Last Night In Soho is worth your time!",Last Night in Soho
230,svalckx,Extremely disappointing,1,30 October 2021,"After watching the preview, I was not expecting the amount of scenes involving implied rape and human trafficking. I'd love to know the reason why the rape victim was portrayed to be the ""bad guy"", while the rapists were portrayed to be the victims. I mean, REALLY?!Shows you where we're at, as a society.",Last Night in Soho
231,jxqcjkjhy,So bad it's good,3,31 October 2021,"I could have written a dissertation on this film, shockingly wrong in so many ways from beginning to end, but can I be bothered with all that? An artless piece of stereotyped hackneyed trash that will be forgotten as soon as soon as it does the rounds. I'm not being mean, I like lots of Edgar's films. Baby Driver was great, the Zombie trilogy and all that, but this was shockingly atrocious in so many ways.The script was damn awful from the very start. Toe curling and leaden to the core, I wanted to crawl under the seat at times, so embarrassed for the poor actors having to regurgitate this tosh. There are some great actors in this, I'd like to give them all a big hug for their bravery in regurgitating this nonsense, they must have bit their lips so many times. One line that stuck out for me was ""do you have a car? 'Yes, how do you think I get from south to North London every day?' Jaw dropping.Then there's the plot, the madness. Not only do we have a time shift of decades, we have nightmares that prove to be just that, we have nightmares that prove to be not, we have nightmares that that prove to be dreams, we have dreams that prove to be real we have real life that proves to be nightmare... must I go on? To call it ramshackle is generous. Insane directing is more appropriate.Then there's the unfortunate storyline-a woman being hounded and chased by multitudes of men. Knives and blank looks and zombie roundups of a single female in soho by multiple blokes. I mean, don't you think this whole episode might just be a little insensitive in the current climate? At time it looked more like a sad Pink Floyd music video.As I said, I could write an essay on the reasons this film was wrong, but I have a life to lead and shouldn't be wasting time on such garbage.Shame on you for wasting your talent.",Last Night in Soho
232,actonceagain,Mesmerizing but bitter,6,6 November 2021,"Edgar Wright bears an eye for capturing Soho as this vibrant and whimsical space; at the same time keeping the sense of eeriness, mystery, and danger. As a fan of Edgar Wright, enjoyed the cinematics, art direction and sound production. Anya and Thomasin did an outstanding performance as they mirrored and tied in each other's characters. The soundtrack sets the mood with the bouncing in between the two eras.But the plot left me quite disappointed. The story is outdated, and gimmicky. Very cheese down. More psychological thriller than horror. There is potential if the focus was more on the plot with a better backstory; but then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Rating: 3.5/5.",Last Night in Soho
233,jhsanford-76264,Uniquely Surprising,9,7 November 2021,"Don't let anyone tell you about this movie. Do not watch a trailer. Go into the movie completely not expecting anything. This was a very surprising unique movie. I have not seen such a unique movie in a long time. I did not like some of the content, but it was real for the time. The movie takes you all over the place and progresses perfectly. I highly recommend it.",Last Night in Soho
234,bradslater-68545,Loved it.,10,7 November 2021,"What a film, top class acting and top class story. Wasn't expecting the story to be so gripping but oh boy did it deliver probably one of the best films I've seen this year.",Last Night in Soho
235,bolter11,Plotless Piece of feminist drivel,1,2 November 2021,"First the good - the cinematography especially at the start of the movie is very intriguing and draws you into the movie.Trust me though, it's not worth staying. Spoilers ahead:
A ghost story about a character that's not even a ghost yet - so stupid and demeaning to men, debasing them all as evil, even murdering the one half decent character. And the main character is so inconsistently protayed that you just want to slap some sense into her through most of the movie.Skip this plotless POS and rent Babe - Pig in the City. Now there a story with a moral worth telling.",Last Night in Soho
236,sameer-jafar,"Fun movie, weak ending",6,17 September 2021,"The film was captivating and very native to Edgar Wright's playful form of filmmaking. It was well cast and there was particularly one moment in the film that truly had me in awe (there is an initial introduction to the alternate world that Ellie experiences). The set and wardrobe design felt authentic and grand all in the same beat.However, after about halfway through the parallel story, it started to lose itself (similar to the main character). What started as a sophisticated weave turned into a tangled knot, leaving many setups in the main plot line without a conclusion and it ultimately lead to a typical big budget ending. Feel free to take the ride if you're ok to forget about it once it's over.",Last Night in Soho
237,codepitts,"A confused, boring attempt at something interesting",3,1 November 2021,"I really wanted to like this movie. I'm a big
fan of Edgar Wright's work, and the idea of seeing his take on horror excited me. I don't know that I would call this horror though, it's more like a slow murder mystery that doesn't clue you in to it being a murder system until it's too late.The acting performances are really fantastic but they are let down by a poorly thought out script. It feels like there is a vaguely feminist critique on the arts and the cost of fame hidden in this film, but it falls very short of making it's point in an effective or intriguing way. This film feels very derivative, boring, and a little unnecessary. Three things I never thought I woukd use to describe an Edgar Wright project. Sad.",Last Night in Soho
238,actionmanfrank,Edgar Wright's version of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining,10,31 October 2021,"The best horror movies are the ones that make you check your surroundings to make sure you feel safe. They also keep you coming back again and again despite the terror they invoke in you. Now this is a subjective condition, so not every scary movie will meet this criteria for you, but will do so for someone else. I say this because Last Night in Soho is one of those movies that terrifies me, but I can't help myself not to keep coming back to this movie. The movie I'm most reminded of when watching this movie is The Shining. But before I go on, it'll probably be easier to explain if we go over the plot first.Thomasin McKenzie plays Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, who's just started college in London. However, London is a seedy place, not for the faint of heart as Ellie soon learns. She seems to have a strong connection to spirits and the past as she's able to see her deceased mother and somehow can see visions of the past. In these visions she sees a wannabe singer named Sandie, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, work her way to stardom and a relationship with a man named Jack, played by former Doctor Who protagonist, Matt Smith. At first amused by the life this woman lived, trying to emulate it, she soon learns that the road to fame is often paved with the blood of sinners. Can Ellie solve what happened to Sandie and maintain her own sanity? Well you have to watch it if you want the answer to that.If you're familiar with anything Edgar Wright has made, you'll know his movies are very stylized with cinematography and editing that alone are novel enough to recommend a movie, even use in a film class honestly. All comes with his amazing team and his unique and passionate method of directing. The shots whenever mirrors are involved are just incredible, I know how most films pull this trick off, but they really do push the techniques for it here. His writing here masterfully invokes the feeling of the 60's the way only someone with the love and care you have to have for that particular time. Which leads to one of the most important aspects of Last Night in Soho and why I compare this movie to The Shining.Ellie, like Danny, appears to have a similar power to the shining that allows her to see spirits and visions of the past. London itself in the movie behaves almost like the Overlook Hotel, a place that feels almost alive and has evil spirits that never checked out. Actually some of the shots and cuts in this movie seem like they were imitating certain scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film. London itself also seems to be trapped in time, still moving forward, but never changing. While definitely a love letter to 1960's London, Edgar Wright knows just how to make even the most lively moments seem terrifying.The cast also does a terrific job here. Sure Anya Taylor-Joy has been in some big stuff, like The Queen's Gambit and The Witch, but still to be this good and landing roles like this is simply impressive. Same could be said for Thomasin McKenzie who's only been in one big movie before this one, Jojo Rabbit, and now is the lead in an Edgar Wright film. Diana Rigg nails her performance here in her last role, after her passing in 2020, and while I haven't seen Doctor Who, I'm not surprised by the amazing work Matt Smith gives here. As for Terence Stamp, well he's great in everything he's in especially if you need him to be creepy and unsettling. The guy is a legend for a reason and you can expect to see that level of performance here.I friggin had an awesome time watching this movie. The cast is terrific, the production is solid, probably one of Edgar Wright's best films, and legit perfect movie for October to get you in the spirit of Halloween. I've already seen it multiple times and I think I'll be watching it more times to come. I guess Soho is a place you don't ever quite leave, at least in this movie. Check out Last Night in Soho.",Last Night in Soho
239,andydooley96,Lost sight of its own plot,6,30 October 2021,"Fun beginning, lackluster finishing.It seems like her dead mother in the mirror was supposed to be more important. But it didn't end up tying into anything really. The movie was focusing her dreams on her trauma, but then the dreams were actually just real and she was able to just see them as they happened? What?And Sandie, was she supposed to be a good guy or a bad guy. What was her calling to heaven at the Pearly Gates? And all that meant for her fashion design was that it was totally awesome again? No other plot repercussions?The whole movie felt unfinished, not thoroughly thought through.",Last Night in Soho

There's no way these reviewers watched the same film as me... Were we supposed to feel bad for the pump/rapist? We're we supposed to feel bad for the men saying ""help me"" or act shocked with the victim used self-defense to a man from raping/trying to kill her??We're we supposed to be scared of Sandy? I'm genuinely shocked. I thought we were in a better place in cinema and representing women. I cannot believe what I just watched/gave money to and please, if you are a survivor of sexual assault this is a major warning not to watch this film.If Edgar was trying to make a rape-revenge film, he did not get that across. What came across was disgusting victim-blaming. Don't watch this.",Last Night in Soho
