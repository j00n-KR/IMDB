0,Leofwine_draca,Seen this one before...,6,22 May 2021,"The latest Hollywood zombie blockbuster comes in the shape of ARMY OF THE DEAD (2021), made by Netflix and directed by Zach Snyder, no stranger to the genre after his 2004 DAWN OF THE DEAD remake. This one's an 'anything goes' comic book-style action adventure in which a crack team are sent into Las Vegas to retrieve a fortune from an underground vault. Two things complicate the situation: 1) the entire city is shortly to be nuked, and 2) the city is overrun with fast-moving zombies. I had no idea what to expect from this one and the end result is enjoyable to a degree, albeit with plenty of caveats.The main problem with the film is that it's surprisingly cliched. ALIENS seems to be a particular inspiration here, with one character a direct copy of Vasquez and the entire climax essentially copying the James Cameron classic. The second problem is that at two and a half hours in length it goes on far too long, with characters regularly pausing for heart-to-heart conversations - ridiculous when they're surrounded by zombies and, later on, a bomb is due to detonate in twenty minutes! A Hollywood trope I always hate to see. Half an hour excised from this would have made it pacier and more exciting. On the plus side, once it gets going it holds together quite nicely, with tons of gory mayhem and a kind of zombie hierarchy that feels based on the White Walkers in GAME OF THRONES; plenty of solid actors in the cast doing their thing well too. It's hardly an unmissable film, but in the tradition of 'switch your brain off' Hollywood entertainment it's not too bad.",Army of the Dead
1,SnoopyStyle,too long,5,25 May 2021,"Vegas, Baby! A military convoy leaves Area 51 with a mystery cargo. They crash into a newlywed couple outside of Vegas. The cargo escapes and a zombie apocalypse is unleashed upon Las Vegas. Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) becomes a hero escaping the chaos. The city is walled off with shipping containers. The government decides to nuke the city and vaporize all the zombies. Scott is recruited to retrieve $200 million from a casino vault before the nuclear blast destroys the cash.At its core, this is a very simple heist movie and really only needs no more than ninety minutes. Zack Snyder decides to do an extra hour on top of that to its detriment. He insists on injecting his political views which is perfectly fine for this franchise which is known to do some political skewering. Go ahead. Go full Joe Rogan. This franchise is built for it. What I hate in this movie is his world construction. Time and time again, I roll my eyes at what this world is doing to deal with a zombie outbreak. There is no way that they would quarantine these people right next to the city. I'm guessing that Snyder is pushing hard for a border comparison to the real world. I'm not feeling it. The shipping container wall is a silly kid's story treatment. It's a 10 year old boy coming up with a comic book idea. It's not thought out. I don't even want to compare it to the real border wall because that wall makes more sense. How do they corral the zombies while the wall is being built? In the real world, there would be a second wall and no go zone around the wall. This world is not well constructed and that bothered me a lot. This is a very expensive B-movie and no money was spent in the writing. Zack Snyder probably wrote most of it and it shows. I do like the simple heist idea at its center. I would give this a passing grade but it's still too damn long.",Army of the Dead
2,Prismark10,Army of the Dead,6,23 May 2021,"Zach Snyder makes an overlong zombie action movie with elements of Aliens and Oceans 11.With Las Vegas infected by zombies. Billionaire casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) approaches mercenary Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) about a heist to recover $200 million from his casino vault before the military destroys Vegas with a tactical nuclear strike.Ward agrees with the money he will get and and recruits his former team members. Ward's estranged daughter Kate joins them as she works in a quarantine camp and is looking for someone lost inside Vegas.However Tanaka has an ulterior motive as his shifty associate also joins the team.This is a dumb action movie with fast moving zombies and even robot zombies. Some zombies are a bit more intelligent than others.There is plenty of blood splattered zombie shootouts, some of the action resembles that of game consoles.There are also plenty of flaws in the film that makes little sense. Too much chatter between characters when there is absolute urgency. A person is locked in a vault and somehow escapes.It is too long and Snyder could had easily shaved half an hour from the running time.",Army of the Dead
3,nogodnomasters,Has the package been breached?,7,30 May 2021,"An army experiment gets loose outside of Vegas which becomes infected. Sealands piled three high create a wall around the city. The President plans to nuke the city. A crew lead by Dave Bautista is hired to go into the city and rob a casino vault of $200 million and fly away in a small helicopter on top of the roof. The city is filled with zombies.The plot is similar to ""Train to Busan II."" It felt like ""Escape from New Your City."" $200 million in $100 dollar pills would weigh 4400 Lbs, i.e. 2 tons. Not something that could be flown in a small helicopter. This is a common missed plot point. Good special effects. Average characters, although they did try to create memorable individuals, it seemed forced.Guide: F-word, brief car oral sex, brief nudity mostly before opening credits.

4,kosmasp,"Lazy writing, big bangs for your buck",8,22 May 2021,"Yes there are plotholes here that are bigger than anything you may have encountered ... on the other hand you may just not care about them. Like with his other output, it is the visual treats that will keep you engaged here, not some character choices that will make you want to personally strangle said character(s)! Or dialog that seems to completely ignore what was said minutes ago ... I guess that is also consistency to just ignore stuff that already happened.In this case I can forgive - and while I was on the verge of going for a 7 rather than an 8, I decided that the fun factor here is high enough to go for the bigger rating. If anything it is not Snyder who changes or the type of movie(s) he's making ... it is how we view it in a sense.So while I personally felt that the flaws in other outputs of his were too big to overlook, I cut him some slack here to say the least. A very bloody affair and as already said quite the visual treat you're getting. There is also some nudity here, though if that is what upsets you ... I seriously am not sure what to tell you - I guess we are all different in things that upsets us ... but yes, just so you know, it's not much, but it is there.The ending wins some brownie points in some sense after characters again are way too slow (even without slow motion) in their decision making, but almost loses them entirely by ... I guess laying a path for a potential sequel ... not that it is surprising. Anyway don't try to make too much sense of things ... you won't go far - no pun intended.",Army of the Dead
5,classicsoncall,"""One more step and I'll blow her head off. Well, more off!""",6,28 May 2021,"I've been known to seek out both zombie films and caper flicks, so ""Army of the Dead"" provides a bonus since it incorporates both themes in one movie. But to say this picture had it's fair share of problems would be an understatement, with it's two and a half hour length being one of it's primary issues. That would have been alright if there was something more to the story and the characters, but this is one film where you don't really get to care about any of the players. Only one of them makes it to the end of the picture, and by that time you're left wondering what the point was, since neither of the two goals set out as a premise for the plot were ever achieved. Even the high profile David Bautista fails to inspire much as the leader of the ragtag bunch that heads into a Las Vegas quarantine zone occupied by hordes of zombies. Why he had so much angst over what kind of food truck he would run after hitting on a fifteen million dollar payday for himself alone was a puzzling question mark for this viewer, even if he did ultimately settle on lobster rolls.Say, for those wondering what happened to Geeta (Huma Qureshi), consider this. When she climbed into the helicopter, she moved to the front and to the right of pilot Peters (Tig Notaro). When the monster zombie jumped on board and began fighting with Scott Ward (Bautista), they went back and forth with Ward angling to get a shot off at his attacker. The second time he fired, he missed the zombie, and his bullet accidentally hit Geeta in the head. It's not shown on screen, but how else do you explain the blood spatter on the windshield and Peters' sickening reaction. That was my immediate thought when I first saw it, and I think that explanation holds up, at least better than having Geeta simply disappear from the story.But that's just one anomaly. I got the biggest kick out of everyone trying to shoot the monster zombie when he had that goofy helmet on his head. How about trying for a body shot? And as far as any urgency to get the heck out of the nuclear blast zone, well, there's no way to explain that one. In fact there wasn't really a whole lot that made sense throughout the movie, but if you like tons of zombies getting mowed down by rapid machine gun fire, there's enough of that to stoke your adrenaline. Otherwise, this is one time when Elvis would have been glad to leave the building.",Army of the Dead
6,BA_Harrison,"Bloated like a week old corpse, and stinks almost as much.",3,23 May 2021,"Of the five previous Zack Snyder films that I have seen, I have only enjoyed two, but one of those was his excellent 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, so I assumed that the man knows what he is doing when it comes to zombies. Army of the Dead has taught me to assume nothing. This is one of the dumbest zombie films I have seen (and I've seen quite a few). It's full of stupid characters making bad decisions, horrible plot developments, and ridiculous action, and worse still, every scene is either shot with an extremely short depth of field, or some kind of blur effect, which proves irritating in the extreme. Come to think of it, some of the CGI is pretty damn ropey as well (zombie tiger!).Dave Bautista is the star of this bloated two-and-a-half-hour undead crapfest, playing hard-nut Scott Ward, who gives up flipping burgers to assemble a team of tough mercenaries with the aim of liberating the zombie-infested city of Las Vegas of the cash still laying in its vaults. With a nuclear strike scheduled to hit the city in little over a day, the last thing they need are problems, such as Ward's daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) joining the mission to try and save a friend, or the traitor in their midst who is willing to sacrifice the others to line his own pockets.A heist movie crossed with the zombie genre should make for a great piece of escapism (I've long had an idea for a similarly themed film myself), but Snyder's screenplay is terrible, packed with unnecessary emotional drama (Ward's estranged relationship with his daughter is such a cliché), moronic developments and plot threads that go nowhere (Kate's rescue mission). All of the mercenaries enter the zombie zone with bare arms, which is asking for trouble; the vault in which the money is kept is protected by booby traps that come straight out of a Looney Tunes cartoon; and why dream of running a sandwich truck if you're going to have $15m in the bank?Worst of all, Snyder's zombies are a special breed, guaranteed to irk most zombie purists: there are slow zombies called shamblers, which is fine, but Snyder also has Vegas inhabited by more intelligent zombies with amazing physical prowess, running at speed, dodging bullets like Neo from The Matrix, and performing incredible leaps, landing in a three-point superhero pose like Thor. Not only are they fast, but they are incredibly strong and seem to communicate in guttural growls and screeches. The leader is able to ride a horse (a zombie horse!), and has even somehow fashioned himself a bulletproof metal helmet. I struggled with Big Daddy from Land of the Dead, so all of this was a few steps too far.2.5/10, generously rounded up to three for the gore, of which there is plenty (the splattery opening credits is the best part of the whole film - it's downhill after that).N. B. Am I imagining it, or did Snyder 'take inspiration' from John Landis: in the opening scene of Army of the Dead, a soldier trips and falls; as his pal goes to lend a hand, he is attacked by a leaping zombie. It's almost identical in execution to the attack on the moors in An American Werewolf in London (my suspicions are compounded by the use of Bad Moon Rising on the soundtrack).",Army of the Dead
7,paul_haakonsen,Hyped up to be way more than it delivered...,4,21 May 2021,"Of course I had to sit down and watch the 2021 zombie movie ""Army of the Dead"", as I do enjoy everything zombie. But I must admit that after having seen the trailer, then I was somewhat put off on the movie. But given the hype of the movie and Zack Snyder, and it being a zombie movie, of course I found myself sitting down to watch it.And as I had feared and anticipated, then ""Army of the Dead"" didn't turn out to be a great movie in the zombie collection. There were just so many things wrong with this movie.First of all, the movie is a total no-brainer plot. You just simply switch off your brain, bring out the popcorn and just lean back and enjoy the action. That is all that was to it, pure and simple. This was a brainless action movie, nothing more, nothing less.I have to say that it didn't feel like a zombie movie at all. Especially because Zack Snyder took every single piece of zombie lore and protocol and just totally ignored it. Sure, that could be a good thing, but it just didn't pan out in ""Army of the Dead"" and it sure didn't provide the zombie genre with a breath of fresh air - pardon the pun.The zombies in the movie, well, where to start? First of all, they were fast and agile, nimble and extremely well-organized. No. That just didn't work. And it didn't really work either with the sounds that they made. No human vocal cords could ever produce such sounds, alive or undead. It just made no sense, and it added a level of stupidity to the movie that I couldn't look past. Then there were the thing about the zombie make-up. Again, no, this didn't feel like a zombie movie. It was more like I was watching a marauding army of orcs from the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. It just had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with zombies.There were only a couple of proper zombie moments in the movie, and that was oddly enough when you saw the zombie tiger and the zombie horse. Everything else was just not working out. Fast and agile zombies that make weird sci-fi noises just doesn't cut it.Then there was the scene where the zombie leader pulled out the unborn zombie child and held it up to the sky while surrounded by a host of his undead minions. Seriously? Zack Snyder went ""The Lion King"" here. It was just so stupid and I was laughing so hard at that scene.Not to mention zombies hibernating. Or zombies retaining intelligence and being able to form a pseudo-kingdom.As for the cast, well they definitely had some rather good actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Omari Hardwick, Matthias Schweighöfer, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tig Notaro and none other than Garret Dillahunt. But they had Dave Bautista in the leading role. Seriously? Dave Bautista?The story was as predictable as it was laughable and silly. And the ending of the movie was just a slap the face with a cold, dead fish to the audience that had suffered through 2 hours of brainless action movie pretending to be a zombie movie.Sure, now I've seen ""Army of the Dead"" and I can tick it off of my 'to-watch-list', but I can honestly say that I am never returning to watch ""Army of the Dead"" a second time.My rating of ""Army of the Dead"" lands on a more than generous four out of ten stars.",Army of the Dead
8,searchanddestroy-1,"Good story, but something wrong with the directing.",7,25 May 2021,"It is exactly what I expected from this film which I wait for since one year and a half now. Fun, dark, violent, moving, it purchases many elements to please the most of the audiences, but in the good sense. But the directing is rather ankward from time to time, maybe because of the over length for this kind of film. And the frame 1.78 is totally wrong, it should have been 2.35. And why did Zack Snyder film an opening sequence, during the credits, NOT BEFORE THE CREDITS, where we can see scenes invisible during the film, scenes where we can see many main characters die? Why? I thought it was a spoiler from the beginning and wanted to stop watching. But I proceeded till the end, and these sequences of the opening credits have NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie. So, if you read those lines before the viewing, don't worry, OK? Not the best Snyder ever but not the worst for sure. You also may prefer DAWN OF THE DEAD, his and Romero's one too. Of course.... And it is never explained, unless I missed something, why Dave Bautista's character killed his wife, whom his daughter talks about? Was he a soldier before, an ex con?",Army of the Dead

10,zardoz-13,Viva Zombies!,8,26 May 2021,"Writer & director Zack Snyder is no stranger to zombie sagas. He made his cinematic directorial debut in 2004 with his inspired remake of George A. Romero's 1978 classic ""Dawn of the Dead,"" starring Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, and Jake Weber. Afterward, he staged his suspenseful Spartan saga ""300"" (2006) with Gerard Butler, and then his magnum opus ""Watchmen"" (2009), with Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Malin Akerman, and Patrick Wilson. Snyder followed up this seminal classic with his bizarre, animated adventure ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" (2010), not exactly kid stuff, before he ventured farther out on a limb with a sinister shoot'em up ""Sucker Punch"" (2011), featuring Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Vanessa Hudgens. Of course, Snyder reinvented the immortal DC Comics' characters Superman and Batman in ""Man of Steel"" (2013), toplining Henry Cavill as the eponymous hero, and then in his notorious ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016), launching Ben Affleck as the Caped Crusader, with Henry Cavill reprising his Superman role. After private tragedies forced him to withdraw from ""Justice League"" (2017), Marvel guru Joss Whedon finished it. Later this summer after its debut on HBO/MAX, ""Zack Snyder's extended cut of Justice League"" (2021) will appear on home video. Seventy-one percent of Rotten Tomatoes critics have given it positive reviews, while ninety-four percent of audiences have loved it.Coming full circle, Snyder has returned to his roots with Netflix's ""Army of the Dead,"" starring David Bautista. Formulaic from start to finish, this two-hour & twenty-minute zombie melodrama/ heist film is sure to assuage the cravings of bloodthirsty zombie fans. Basically, ""Army of the Dead"" is zombie porn about the undead munch-athon. Not surprisingly, bare-breasted zombie strippers feast on an ill-fated tourist, but thereafter Snyder doesn't keeps everybody covered up. Tough guy David Bautista assembles a team of reckless souls and plunges them into the no-man's land of Las Vegas after it has become a hot zone to retrieve $200 million from a casino bank vault. ""Army of the Dead"" gets off to a sturdy start as Snyder and scribes Shay Hatten and Jay Harold explain why ghouls galore overrun Sin City. Like toxic disposal movies where a barrel of chemical waste tumbles off a truck, sinks into a river, and spreads its contaminants both up and down stream, ""Army"" opens with a heavily armed military convoy escorting a 'top-secret' cargo. Ecstatic newlyweds having sex in their front seat crash into the flatbed military cargo truck. The impact knocks a huge locker onto the highway. Told too late to destroy it, the soldiers watch a muscular zombie smash his way out of said locker. Although they empty their automatic weapons into this resilient zombie, the fiend survives and rips them apart. Conveniently, the town nearest the outbreak is Las Vegas!Not only does the alpha zombie who broke out without a scratch forge his own army from scratch, but he also leads his undead minions into an unsuspecting Vegas for the ultimate flesh & blood buffet. The opening twenty minutes quickly establishes the premise of zombified Vegas. Miraculously, the military stacks up a towering barrier of shipping containers around Las Vegas to thwart a zombie exodus. Medical authorities pitch a camp for suspected infected and armed sentries eyeball them. Meantime, the owner of casino, Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada of ""Mr. Holmes""), refuses to let that big boodle of $200 million in loot languish. However, he doesn't have the luxury of forever, our President has ordered an imminent low-yield aerial nuke attack on Sin City. Mind you, Tanaka's insurance company has paid off his monetary losses already, since the loot is forever forfeit, because an army of zombies sits on it like a medieval dragoon. Nevertheless, greedy as only a genuine villain is, Tanaka doesn't want to lose that fortune. He approaches a short-order cook, Scott Ward (David Bautista of ""Spectre""), awarded the Medal of Freedom during the zombie invasion when he rescued the Secretary of Defense, about bringing back those bucks. He offers Scott and company a $50 million payday to fetch him his oodles. Initially skeptical about such an outlandish proposal, Scott decides to take Tanaka's deal.Scott wrangles a maven motley crew. A mechanic named Maria Cruz (Ana De La Reguera of ""Nacho Libre""); a chainsaw-toting troubleshooter Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick of ""Kick Ass""); a hotshot chopper pilot Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro of ""Instant Family""); a crack shot Mikey Guzman (Raúl Castillo of ""Unsane""), with his own YouTube channel for his zombie kills; and a goofball German safecracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer of ""Valkyrie""), who sings like a bimbo soprano with he is scared. They descend into Sin City with a blonde coyote, Chambers (stunt woman Samantha Win), to conduct them through a virulent gauntlet. Chambers warns them that not all of the zombies are so-called 'shamblers,' and some have a modicum of intelligence. Wait, smart zombies? Indeed, the leader of these mindless maniacs is Zeus (Richard Cetrone of ""Underworld""), and he is a genuine oddball. Wearing a tattered cape and a bulletproof face mask which shields the upper part of his face, Zeus rides a horse like Alexander the Great and shares his dominion with a queen, a Medusa-look alike. Snyder and company treat Zeus and his dreadful queen as a rom-com couple. Actually, ""Warm Bodies"" (2013) beat Rich to the punch with its romantic couple subplot. Of course, nothing goes according to plan for either Scott or Tanaka after they roll into Vegas.Snyder dreamed up his outlandish but entertaining ""Army of the Dead"" premise while he was helming ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and he has been biding his time since then to direct it. Mind you, this isn't the first zombie apocalypse to devastate Sin City. ""Highlander"" director Russell Mulcahy's ""Resident Evil: Extinction""(2007) claims that distinction. Nevertheless, the zombie queen's severed head that lives is unforgettable! Altogether, the discouraging ending to ""Army of the Dead"" exacts a terrible toll on what should have amounted to mindless mayhem.",Army of the Dead
11,Calicodreamin,Unexpected,5,23 May 2021,"This movie was unexpected in a lot of ways... and not all of them good. The storyline was disjointed. The heist was straight forward but there were too many side plots, the whole super zombie thing felt misplaced and unnecessary.

12,neil-476,More Snyder immaturity,6,21 June 2021,"Las Vegas is overrun by zombies, but cordoned off. A group of dodgy individuals is commissioned to sneak in and rob a vault in a casino/hotel the day before the government nukes Vegas.This is not a bad idea. Sadly, this does nit make it a good film.So Zack Snyder co-writes and directs a zombie caper movie. It is very long and extraordinarily violent, and typical Snyder ie. Visually very impressive, but with an overriding air of being the sort of thing a rather unpleasant 14-year old might come up with.For every interesting idea - the relationship between the zombie ""king"" and ""queen"", for instance - there are two scenes where an obstacle is introduced for the sole purpose of headshotting videogame zombie fodder. Apart from the relationship between Dave Bautista's character and his daughter, none of the other characters come close to convincing.I say again - keep Snyder behind the camera, but don't let him near a keyboard because the immature adolescent in him comes roaring out.",Army of the Dead

15,siderite,A failed comedy,2,25 May 2021,"This film is directed and written by Zack Snyder?! It's garbage, from start to end. The only good bits in it are comedic and the rest is laughable, but not in a good way. It is a two hour and a half heist movie where everybody is an idiot. With zombies. They are idiots, too. The daughter, as usual, kills more people than the villains by being humane and in distress and, as unbelievable as it sounds, more of an idiot than everybody else.Then there is the acting. Dave Bautista moves like a grandpa. Theo Rossi, who did pretty well in Luke Cage, has a ridiculous role that makes no sense. Garret Dillahunt was good in the Terminator series, but he acts like a jester in this film. Tig Notaro is not really funny after being the highlight of Star Trek Discovery. Hiroyuki Sanada... oh, Hiroyuki Sanada... he was never a good actor, let's face it, but the depths to which he fails as an actor are truly amazing.And there is the story. A heist movie?! But with zombies that make no sense, with failed opportunities for sequels, with cardboard characters, with not one, but two straight white males that have to be brutally punished for their transgressions against women, with scenes like ""I didn't do it for the money! I did it for youuuuu!"". Jesus, it's worst than I am telling you it is, I just can't find the words to express the piece of excrement that this movie is.So if you are really really really drunk, this might be funny.

16,thesar-2,A Lose-Lose Gamble,2,22 May 2021,"You know how they say: there's nothing new in the zombie genre? Well, this movie 1000% proves that to be true.The tagline should've read: ""If you liked I Am Legend, Aliens, Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Extinction, Warm Bodies, Escape from New York, Zombieland and Ocean's 11, then you've already seen Army of the Dead!"" (And I know I must've missed another 6-7 films this straight-up ripped off.)As stated, this barely had a new idea, but probably worse, it had almost zero characters to root for. No one was that likable and everyone's fate is so horribly predicted from moment one. This felt much less like an homage, than just a very poor attempt at plagiarism.The one Brightside was the Nice Vegas backdrop and creativity with the Strip. I also knew they were filming inside The Cromwell during the pandemic (which probably wasn't safe at the time) so it was neat seeing how they transformed the place.Nope, can't recommend. The aforementioned movies are 10x better than this cheap cheat. Save yourself from the excruciatingly long and unnecessary 148 minutes.",Army of the Dead
17,cherold,Dumb fun without the fun,4,27 May 2021,"Army of the dead begins as though it's going to be a fun B movie. 2 exchanges in different vehicles leads to disaster which leads to terror which leads to a fun title sequence in which we see a garish Las Vegas overrun by Zombies. This title sequence packs in a lot of story; in fact, in packs in about 90% of the movie's story.After that a bunch of people decide to go into Zombie-infested Vegas to get some loose cash, which is what the rest of the movie is. In spite of the absence of story, there's still a long chunk of time between the credits and the action which is filled with the strikingly dull enlisting of cannon fodder.You might have a few questions as the movie begins. Are the protagonists being mislead by the billionaire who puts this in place? Is the soldier they're forced to take along untrustworthy? Will someone sacrifice themselves for others even though they probably could have saved themselves as well? Will someone risk everyone's lives on a side mission? Will things suddenly become way more urgent? Will the characters be too undeveloped for you to care about them or their mission? Will this all result because no one in the movie even considered the possibility that things weren't what they seem? Will you be unsurprised at the ""surprise"" ending?If you don't know the answer to any of these questions then you've never seen a movie before and might like this one. Otherwise...There's little attempt to bring these characters to life except in several tediously emotional conversations between two characters you don't care about.Yes, there are some good moments here and there. The aforementioned opening credits. Zombie animals. A quiet scene with an unquiet finale. Occasional moments of good action or suspense. But it all gets suffocated by the length, the slack moments, the predictability, the stupidity, and the high ""who cares"" quotient.Zack Snyder is a hit or miss director, but normally his failures are from pretention and hubris. This time he didn't fail because he was too ambitious, but because he seemingly had no ambitions at all.",Army of the Dead

Including parts that could have changed the entire course of the movie if the characters weren't so dumb in this poorly written script. They even do the anime trope of providing a ridiculous and unnecessary countdown to a deadline that they don't seem to follow at allHow could i forget... almost every single attempt at comedy fell completely flat. Not a chuckle, not even a smirk. Somewhere between crickets and rolling my eyes. And there was one comedic character that was one of the least comedic comedic characters i've ever seen.There were some cool action scenes but not too many. I liked the stylized gore (reminded me of spartacus). The movie was way too long due to the useless subplots. But even if it was shorter, there was nothing special here. Everything felt a little off. And i cared zero for any of the characters or their well-beings. (1 viewing, 5/31/2021)SPOILERSi decided to list some of the most memorable dumb parts:-when tanaka's guy betrayed the girl, they abandoned her when they could have easily saved her. And even worse, she stares into the eyes of her friend before she is killed and decides not to warn them that he might betray them all. Their lives are all in danger, but nah, let's just enjoy the moment-speaking of staring into each other's eyes, when bautista and his daughter get to the chopper and instead of immediately leaving they decide to have a moment which likely got him killed-right after that moment, zombie leader runs towards them as the pilot tries to leave as slowly as possible. But once the zombie is on board, she goes to fast-right before that moment, bautista brings his daughter to the chopper which is gone. ""she left us."" hmmmmmm i wonder if they are gonna do the fake-out where she comes back just when we thought all is lost.-multiple cringe-worthy self-sacrifice cliches-one guy shot a zombie in the eye and chin, underneath was a glowing blue eye and a metal chin. Yes, just like a terminator. I even paused it and went frame by frame to confirm. Makes no sense. Unless that's a hint about what ghost from power said earlier about a loop of the same mission. If so.... BOOOOOO-not so much a moment, but the entire subplot of saving the refugee mom was so pointless. Even worse, they didn't show us a scene of her reuniting with her kids, or even that she survives at all! In fact, the daughter character could have been completely removed without taking anything away from the movie other than runtime.-we need to get a zombie to activate the booby traps.... or we can just use one of these numerous dead bodies to do the same thing without the dangers of capturing a live zombie. Smh-the secret purpose of the mission is to get a zombie head. That could have been accomplished in 5 minutes without the elaborate money and safe-cracking-the zombie tiger did nothing for me. And that's coming from someone who loves tigers. It reminded me of a crappy version of the bear from the movie annihilation, which was legitimately terrifying.-the president decides to do the nuke a day early? Are you KIDDING ME?-they have an hour and 20 minutes to leave. Cracking the safe needs 30 minutes, which he seems to do in time. But now they have 20 minutes-in this 20 minutes they need to take this entire room full of cash to the roof. How is that going to happen?-they act like they successfully got the money, but it was one guy holding two backpacks, which were lost when the zombies ripped them open. They made it seem like that's the moment the money was lost. But it was an entire room full of money. And they showed that room later on, still filled with money.-there are probably 20 more things but i can't remember them.",Army of the Dead
19,Cineanalyst,Zombie Heist: A Movie Robbed of Its Brains,2,22 May 2021,"Zack Snyder doesn't need an editor to enforce cuts because a movie around two-and-a-half hours is too long; he needs one because movies such as ""Army of the Dead"" are bad. The smarter zombies get, I swear, the stupider the movies are. Instead of the reanimated corpses being about something, we get zombies plus a heist flick--plus a father-daughter reunion and other who-cares dramatic arcs. Some of it's ironic, but that's about it. As if this sort of shoot-'em-in-the-head undead junk weren't formulaic enough, now we must endure the assembling of a team for the heist, the double crosses and switcheroos. And that's just before every character seems to think a deadly crisis is a good time to clear the air with their personal grievances or to pause for a gander during one of Snyder's many slow-mo or blurry playing-with-the-focus shots just long enough for a ghoul to sneak up on them. The real zombification here is us being entertained by this dreck.What's the point of the TV news clips of politicos Donna Brazile and Sean Spicer debating refugees, or reading off a witless quotation from the U. S. president regarding nuking Las Vegas, or why even set this mess in that highly-symbolic ""sin"" city if it's not a sustained commentary on anything? Is the point merely that it's all a spectacle? If that's the case, it's all downhill after the slow-mo montage to ""Viva Las Vegas"" during the opening credits. Quite disappointing coming from a filmmaker who managed to infuse the superhero genre with a bit of politics to better effect as in ""Watchmen"" (2009) and the overly-maligned ""Man of Steel"" (2013). Even ""300"" (2006) seemed like it was about something else, whether or not one found it off-putting. There need not be a social or political commentary, either, nor an environmental or pandemic-related one, but there should be something if one is going to pompously drag out the action.I wish I could say I was even rooting for the undead here, what with the human characters being uniformly unlikeable, but Snyder's continued fascination with zombie babies is as uninteresting. A CGI zombie tiger and a zombie boss clever enough to wear a helmet (although apparently not clever enough to have his mindless followers also wear them) may be cool only at first glance--it gets tiresome after that. It's even worse than his overrated ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) remake. There, at least, a semblance of George Romero's much-better 1978 original may've remained in Snyder's mindless action-oriented reengineering.P. S. I'm relieved I don't need to read my TV warranty, but I'm still deducting a star here for Snyder and company leaving those dead pixels in the picture to make me worry in the first place.",Army of the Dead

I love how Stylish so much of the movie is although some of it is weirder than most zombie types. Maybe there's a lot to hate on but I don't see it probably won't I'm even one of very few that loves the way Dexter ended!

23,paulclaassen,"Zombies: been there, done that... time for something new.",4,1 July 2021,"Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' is one of my favorite zombie movies. With so many zombie films out there, I was interested to see how they would make it feel original in 2021. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I suppose Zack also decided too many zombie films out there is a matter of been there, done that, so he tried something new. Las Vegas has been evacuated due to the zombie outbreak, and is about to be nuked. However, there's still $200 million in a casino basement. Scott Ward (Bautista) is approached by the casino owner Tanaka to retrieve the money. In exchange he will be rewarded $50 million.So how did Zack make it different to other zombie films? He created a zombie 'kingdom' - so to speak, ruled by a zombie king and his zombie queen, and he even rode on a zombie horse, and has a zombie tiger guarding their 'kingdom'. The zombies have feelings, emotions, and can think and love - and the queen is pregnant!! Ok, whoa, everything we've come to learn and understand about zombies has just been thrown out the window. I mean, what the bloody hell!?!Despite this new preposterous zombie behavior, the film also gets sidetracked too easily by personal issues, hence the long running time. I also found it a bit slow moving. Yes, there are a number of amazing scenes - like the opening scene and the casino attack scene near the end - but too few and far between to keep me glued to the screen. Furthermore, there were so many cliches - like the characters and their actions. And off course there would be a hand to hand combat scene (with a zombie). I mean this is Hollywood, after all. But why would the zombie fight instead of bite? It makes no sense. Oh, speaking of sense. The zombie even has the common sense to wear a helmet!!!The ending wasn't bad, despite being heavily cliched. Why does the main actors always take long to turn once bitten by a zombie, when all the others turn almost immediately? Hmmm, for convenience purpose, I suppose. Did I enjoy the film? In a way, yes. Did I enjoy it enough to watch it again? Sadly, no. Once is enough.",Army of the Dead

They have to be fast, very careful and to work together if they want to succeed and survive.I liked this movie because it was fun and interesting. The only thing I did not like it was the duration of it which was too long. The direction which was made by Zack Snyder it was very good and he did an amazing job. The interpretations of Dave Bautista who played as Scott Ward, Nora Arnezeder who played as Lilly (The Coyote), Matthias Schweighöfer who played as Dieter and Raúl Castillo who played as Mikey Guzman were very good and their combination made the movie even better.

25,cruise01,Zack Snyder delivers an epic zombie film that never slows down.,10,18 May 2021,"5 out of 5 stars.Army of the Dead is an awesome zombie heist film that takes you on one wild ride from start to end. I love most of Zack Snyders films. I find Dawn of the Dead to be his best til this day. And still find it better. Army of the Dead does delivers lots of action. Intense sequences. And a lot of fun with the characters.The plot is awesome. Military convoy has an accident. Releases something that infects the rests of Las Vegas. Then, like how Dawn of the Dead has Johnny Cash playing during the opening credits. Army has an opening flashy credit scene thats similiar. Showing the mayhem of Vegas. The plot follows Dave Bautista trying to get a team together. To plot a heist in a quarantined infected las Vegas. Now the down side. Its infested with zombies. And a new group of evolved zombies that are smarter. Faster. And stronger.The movie is fast moving. For two and a half hour run time. It still feels short. It never slows down. The characters introduced are fun and the script connects you to them. Be aware, there is a lot of body counts that gets killed off. The film has lots of action sequences that makes this an awesome summer blockbuster film. The visual effects are good. The soundtrack is tolerable. They even play the zombie song from the Cranberries which is awesome. The film does have some humor to lighten its intense mood.The cast ensemble is great. A huge cast with memorable characters. The music score is great by Junkie Xl which is awesome.The film does end in a cliffhanger for a sequel. Which would be great to see Zack Snyder make more movies. Which he does deliver in making an exciting fun zombie films.",Army of the Dead
26,eddie_baggins,A lifeless return to the zombie world for Zack Snyder,2,27 May 2021,"The news that director Zack Snyder would be returning to his zombie roots for the first time since his classic remake debut from 2004 with the much-loved Dawn of the Dead was received with great excitement with the announcement of his Netflix exclusive Army of the Dead the seemingly perfect vehicle for a filmmaker who had found himself lost in a collection of middling films that failed to inspire audiences like his early efforts did.Following on closely also from his labor of love and much-hyped Justice League Snyder Cut, Army looked set to be one of the years most talked about efforts but this bitterly disappointing and lifeless (yes this is a bad thing even for a zombie film) $90 million dollar extravaganza is an instantly forgettable affair and one of the biggest disappointments yet in Snyder's intriguing career.With a downright delicious concept that appears perfectly suited to an incredibly fun adventure infused in action/horror genre tropes as Dave Bautista's mercenary Scott Ward and a rag-tag group of fellow guns for hire enter into the zombie infested Las Vegas to pull of a daring heist before the United States government levels the city with a nuclear blast, Army starts off with a typically fantastic Snyder introduction that makes us believe we are about to be a part of something special only for it to quickly give way to a dull affair mixed with even duller characters as the light-hearted tone of the early moments gets pushed aside for a serious minded but seriously dumb wasted opportunity.Like the buzz-saw one of Army's main characters wields, a machine of death that promises some gruesome zombie carnage but remains cleaner than a freshly minted poker chip, Army is all show but no delivery as Snyder manages to waste his playground of Sin City and potentially colorful characters on a seriously tiresome heist plot with some supposedly relevant political messaging that you wish would've given way to the film actually having some fun and not annoying you with its terrible plot developments and executions.With a trite script full of some high-school worthy scribing and a mostly misused array of stars that all seem unable to do much with their by the numbers characters and overlong but still unfocussed screen time, the whole concept of this team on a mission film is unable to push us through the generic action slog fest that Army becomes in its latter stages or the films more sleep-inducing early stages where you wish deeply that something or anything of note would happen and come the rolling of credits you wish you did what one hilariously underused character does early in the film and just flat out refuses to be a part of this expedition, driving off into the sunset and making a better choice to watch Dawn of the Dead again for their zombie fix.It really does make you wonder about the future of Snyder making high-quality entertaining films again and while no one expected Army to be the new Godfather, everything was laid out before this film to make it something when it comes to big, loud and dumb entertainment only for it to be long, without voice and just frustrating to endure thanks to characters making continually bizarre choices, opportunities frequently missed and story elements making little too no sense throughout.Final Say -What should've been a great big smorgasbord of fun, guts and thrills is an utterly forgettable and listless 2 and half hours of wasted talent, potential and ideas that makes you wonder what on earth went wrong for such possibilities to be squandered? Snyder's return to the realm of the living dead is likely to go down as one of 2021's great misfires.1 zombie tiger out of 5.",Army of the Dead

I really like some of Zack Snyder's movies - 300, Sucker Punch and the remake of Dawn of the Dead for example are top notch, and especially as Mr. Snyder proofed with the remake of Dawn of the Dead that he can do zombie movies, I am really disappointed - Army of the Dead is full of cliched dialogue and comic-strip characters (everything on auto-pilot I like to say, the introduction of the characters is a pure waste of time, I watched that ten million times before done the same way, or that stereotype of that daddy issues game again - this does not add depth anymore to an action movie but boredom, my opinion of course) and the story/direction makes Army of the Dead less a horror movie but an action-heist movie with zombies. Like many reviewers already stated - the plot holes are too big to ignore (you can't fly in the""zone"" but out, no code for the vault, no use of silencers, also why not just hire a unit of mercenaries for the task of getting that pretty zombies lady head? Etc.) What else? Production is pretty solid, acting okay, story like indicated meh. Summa summarum: just another mediocre and generic Netflix movie with an expensive budget. Some questions are left: why this idea needs a show - a mystery, also why they call the story original (by Zack Snyder written etc.) everywhere - I just say Train to Busan 2 - Peninsula...",Army of the Dead

30,SAMTHEBESTEST,An outdated Zombie Flick with an updated visual extravaganza. Snyder's own vision fails to match its potential.,6,22 May 2021,"Army Of The Dead (2021) :
Movie Review -Since 60s decade we have been meeting zombies on screen. Hollywood started it all with 'Night Of The Living Dead' (1968) and then other cinema industries followed the the same path in their own style. Korean Flicks left good impression on audience but as the time passed, the films became outdated and that's a fact which even a die hard fan can't deny. It's surprising to know that someone like Zack Snyder chose to make a film on this topic. He could have easily gone with something new or another sequel to one his own good film from past, but he did this. Well, it doesn't mean he has made it bad but it's not that good either. Army Of The Dead is pretty much watchable for terrifying visuals but rest of the cinematic aspects are hardly bearable. The same film could have reached the better heights with better actors and better screenplay.Following a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, a group of mercenaries take the ultimate gamble, venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted. It was very much predictable for any common viewer to tell what would be next scene, how it would take place and how it would end-up. That's the weakest part of the film, it's goddamn predictable like any 70s or 80s film is Today. Not just the predictability but lacking innovative ideas also hurts the film. Somehow, it's an average writing that can be enjoyed by kids mostly, for adults its bit immature.Like mentioned before, the film does not have any great performances. Even though such genre don't require any high class performances, it's still below par. Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Theo Rossi and the entire cast is barely watchable. Bollywood Actress Huma Qureshi makes her Hollywood debut on very ordinary note as her character hardly makes us feel its presence. It's safe to say that Army Of The Dead is saved by the visual extravaganza, or else it would have been a big disappointment. All the zombies look horrifying and their make-up is terrifying as hell. Here, film has some used innovative ideas such as 'Zombie Tiger', 'King Of Zombies', 'The Queen' and couple of other departments in Zombie Kingdom.There are many eventless scenes in the film which lacks the logic even from the fictional point of view of zombies. It has emotions that don't work, it has action but of unprofessional standards and it has loose storytelling that is way damn artificial. Zack Snyder's vision to bring the visuals on screen works but his storytelling is outdated. The last 20 minutes are so boring that you would prefer to leave the film right there. By the way, why this film has got such a long runtime of 148 minutes? The editor and director were sleeping or what? Why did the story needed 140 minutes when you could have easily wrapped it up within 2 hours? It would have looked finer then. Anyways, it's sort of watchable film with new advanced level visuals of Zombies but don't expect anything else.RATING - 6/10*",Army of the Dead
31,southdavid,Strip for parts.,2,17 June 2021,"I've had a month or so to live with the disappointment of ""Army of The Dead"", as work and holidays stopped me from writing the review immediately. Even now, I'm still confused as to how such and obvious and terrific story idea, could be so completely bungled.The outbreak of a virus leads the US government to contain a zombie uprising in downtown Las Vegas. With the town and its shambling inhabitants to be nuked in a few days, Casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) puts together a small special ops team to infiltrate the city and recover $200 Million from the vault of his casino. Led by Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) the team take the job, but inside the walls they discover a very different enemy from the one their expecting.So, there's two strands to my negative thoughts about ""Army of the Dead"", one is the aspects that make it a bad film. Though the visual effects are always impressive, and the actions scenes are reasonably strong, the performances are terrible, pretty much across the board - even from reliable hands like Garrett Dillahunt and Theo Rossi. The dialogue doesn't help them, but still, it's jarring how poor it is. Tonally the film doesn't have the first idea what it wants to be. ""Dawn of the Dead"" 2004 got that right, moments of levity in an otherwise dark story, ""Army"" veers between parody and pathos far too much and far too quickly.The second strand though is all about the story not being what I wanted it to be. For me, it was far too . . . Complicated is not the right word, because that implies you can't understand it. It's more that it has too many unnecessary aspects and storylines. All I wanted was a heist movie, where the team go through a couple of themed casinos to get to the one they wanted. So say they entered a resort based ancient Rome, then the zombies could be wearing togas, and then some of them are dressed as centurions so they are harder to kill. Then a circus theme, where they're fighting clowns or a New York themed one where they're killing zombies on a Roller Coaster - that sort of stuff. Something that actually makes Vegas, even a rotted Vegas a character in the story. I'm not some sort of zombie purist, just lashing out against the idea of the alphas ( I liked the Tiger, that was one of the few steps in the right direction) but everything that wasn't about the heist, felt like a waste of time, to me - and all of that zombie development was definitely that.Ultimately, it's mess of too many half-thought ideas, complicating what should have been a straightforward and fun time.",Army of the Dead

33,Vartiainen,Fun popcorn entertainment,7,11 September 2021,"Zack Snyder's latest film has him returning back to his zombie roots with another instalment about the living dead. This time the city of Las Vegas has been successfully quarantined after the dead began to rise. Now the government is planning to get rid off the Z-population by nuking the place. But it'd be such a waste to just blow up all that money lying there in the vaults of the casinos. Surely a team has enough time to get in, crack the safe and get out?Zack Snyder has always been about the spectacle and this movie is no different. Thankfully, this time he seems to have had a coherent script to work with, so the film actually flows quite smoothly. It's a bit on the long side, but aside from that it was quite a nice experience. Dave Bautista makes for a surprisingly convincing action lead, the characters very nicely varied (although there were way too many of them) and I also liked the additions to the usual zombie tropes.But yeah, this film could have used some trimming. Cut the character roster in half, drop a subplot or two, and you would have had a much more dynamic movie in your hands. Now there's a lot of time wasted on subpar story elements that don't contribute to the whole.Still, I did enjoy it. It's very easy to see how it could have been even better, but when it works, it works really well. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this.",Army of the Dead
34,subxerogravity,I can't remember the last time I saw a bad zombie movie and Army of the Dead is definitely not that,7,21 May 2021,"If your movie is over two hours, you're making a bold statement of how...good that movie is.Big Zack Snyder has a lot of nerve making a two hour and thirty-minute Zombie movie. I do not care how mainstream the zombie genre got, its still b-movie horror and you take a huge risk in messing it all up for every minute after 90, but as we all know Snyder is a bold filmmaker and his follow up the Dawn of the Dead remake (but not really) is worth the extra minutes.Army of the dead is a sequel onto itself with the opening sequence telling its own Zombie apocalypse story (a rare one as it tells an origin of how the apocalypse got started) then goes into a new story in which the great actor, Dave Bautista leads a small group into a Las Vegas that has become a barricaded undead zone to be nuked in a day, which only gives them that much time to take 200 million tax free dollars from a vault under a Vegas Casino (owned by the guy who plays Scorpion in the Mortal Kombat remake)See that's what's so great about Zombie movies. Army of the Dead uses the Zombie apocalypse as a backdrop for a heist. Although Army of the Dead does do some deep diving into the mythos of this monster, attempting to give it more character. I like the movie overall but I'm curious for the Zombie purist cause Snyder is taking it so above and beyond I raise an eyebrow to say weather this is an actual Zombie movie.Whatever it is or not it's a good watch. Bautista did a lot of whining about what a good actor he is while doing promos for this, and yes it's true, he can hold a line but we also go to see the former Pro Wrestler do what he was first known for in this flick and that made it worth watching.An odd choice of flick for the tail end of a pandemic but would have been worth seeing in a theatre with a bunch of other people.",Army of the Dead

The writer & director is Zack Snyder-if you haven't heard of him, he just released his version of the Justice League on HBOMax. Dave plays a former soldier that is flipping burgers in Las Vegas when a zombie outbreak hits. Hiroyuki approaches Dave with a plan to rob a casino of $25 million before the military nukes the whole city-to contain the zombies, of course. Garret is Hiroyuki's security man that is tagging along on the heist to keep an eye on the money-Hiroyuki doesn't trust mercenaries with that kind of money-and Tig is a member of Dave's team that has her own useful skills. So the plan is to fight through zombies, get the money and get out. Simple, as it always is in these types of movies. In most zombie movies, you either have slow moving zombies or really fast moving ones. This one has both. The fast ones are called alphas because they were the first ones turned and they are also just a tad bit stronger. The slow ones seem to sleep a lot when they aren't feeding. You will also get to see animal zombies and I'm not talking about small cats or dogs, either-Think of animals that might be used in a Vegas act. The ending is a little different, too. Not what you would expect.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 28 minutes.I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Army of the Dead

37,alindsay-al,A Below Average Long Film,4,28 May 2021,"A bit later then I would have liked but I have now watched Zack Snyder's new film Army of the Dead and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of mercenaries attempt to pull of a heist in Las Vegas after it is infected by a Zombie Apocalypse.Main Character
Dave Bautista plays the lead and I think he does a decent job in the role. He feels like a lead actor and a good fit for this whole universe as the main character. But the issue is that there isn't enough there with the character and that isn't really his fault. There are so many characters involved and there is a feeling to give them all something to do, so there is not enough given to him or a reason to really care about his character in the big moments.Supporting Characters
This film has a huge cast so I won't have time to go through them all but there are mixed results for sure. There are some good actors like Garret Dillahunt, Hiroyuki Sanada and Omari Hardwick and they are all very functional in their roles but when the film ended I realised that I didn't care about any of the characters that were on screen and despite these performances that is a huge issue. Ella Purnell who plays Bautista's daughter is so annoying and frustrating to watch which makes it worse when she gets given more of the spotlight then was really necessary. Even Theo Rossi, he isn't in the film much but he plays the same role as he always does and he just adds very little to the whole feel of the film. There was big controversy as Tig Notaro was added late on into this film through greenscreen and effects and it didn't quite work for me. Firstly, the character is the comic relief that isn't very funny and it does become clear that the actors weren't on screen together that much and once you see it, its hard to avoid it.Story
The story had a great premise and I kind of wish that this film had been more about the events that take place at the beginning of the film. Also I liked how the zombies were handled and that it wasn't the generic zombies but they had a hierarchy and society which was one of the more interesting parts of the film. But the characters are just so dull and it really became hard to care about whether any of them lived or died, also their motivations just confused me and it seemed a bit bizarre why some of them would even want to go on this heist for the rewards on offer.Script
The script is easily the worst part of the film for me. The dialogue is clunky and uninspired, with drama and humour being bland and barely worth even mentioning. There are good performers here, but they are not given much to work with and that really hurts this film.Style
The film looks good, Netflix clearly pumped a lot of money into this film and Zack Snyder always makes good looking films with at least some decent action scenes. But this film has a real pacing issue, it is way too long clocking in at 150 minutes, which is ridiculous giving the type of film that this is.Overall
Overall, Army of the Dead is a below average film that really disappoints. There is just too much attempted here and it ends up falling flat and not a film you need to spend your time watching.",Army of the Dead
38,henry8-3,Army of the Dead,4,24 May 2021,"Las Vegas has been turned into a quarantined zone to hold thousands of zombies. Bautista is offered a lot of cash to pick a team and go into the zone, crack a safe and get out the $200m sitting there before a planned nuclear strike is made to wipe the zombies out. A rough ride ensues.There is undoubtedly some fun to be had here - the effects are impressive, it's a hysterical bloodbath with imaginatively dark comedy scenarios, there are few laughs and a few nicely choreographed action set pieces. That said it is 30 minutes at least, too long, it copies Aliens too much, even quoting from it, the 'crew' are mostly forgettable and there are many unnecessary scenes adding nothing to the plot. In addition Bautista doesn't really get to lead in a Gregory Peck / Guns of Navarone type of way and spends most of his screen time having dramatic exchanges with his daughter - yawn. Disappointing.",Army of the Dead
39,yusufpiskin,Thanks Snyder,4,21 May 2021,"A very entertaining zombie blockbuster.The cinematography and direction are both fantastic. Snyder should be the DoP on more of his films. Dave Bautista and Ella Purnell are standouts in terms of performances. Their father/daughter storyline is my favourite aspect of the film. Army of the Dead never holds back in terms of violence and also makes a bold decision towards the end which I really respect.Unfortunately, this film is too crowded. A lot of the members of the team don't really feel like they have much reason to be there and the film spends a lot of time with them. I think Army of the Dead easily could have been a 90 minute movie with less characters and I think it would have been more impactful. I did enjoy the movie but I do think it could have been more if they put less in it.",Army of the Dead

41,Pairic,Good Zombie Fun But a bit Too Long,8,22 May 2021,"Army Of The Dead: You probably know the basic story: a group of mercenaries are hired to get money out of a Zombie infested Las Vegas before the city is nuked. The opening sequences are really impressive - a bio-engineered Zombie with alien DNA is being transported from Area 51 when a car crashes into the transporter, if only the car driver had a heads up. The Zombie escapes, infects soldiers and they descend on Las Vegas. Great fight scenes over the opening credits, Zombies shot, chainsawed, stabbed (by some of the mercenaries who will later come back) as they merrily munch on humans. After a wall of containers is built there are some airstrikes but the Undead remain. A motley crew enter Las Vegas to recover the money, there are Shambler Zombies (shamble and bite) and Alpha zombies who move fast and are intelligent. There is some soapish stuff about family troubles but this is enhanced by real life problems in refugee camps involving abusive guards. The King and Queen of the Zombies are interestingly portrayed, there are real relationships between them and ther Alpha followers. The King has a pet Zombie tiger so there is a nod to The Walking Dead here and the King also rides a Zombie horse, looks a bit like Conan in that pose. Travelling through a devastated Las Vegas, fighting Zombies in the dark, on a strict tie schedule (remember the nuke), things are tough for the mercs. A pretty good Zombie action film but far too long. At least 30 minutes could have been cut from it's 148 minute running time. Still the thread of dark humour which infuses the film makes up for that (sort of). Directed and co-written by Zack Snyder. On Netflix. 8/10.",Army of the Dead
42,andrewchristianjr,FUN. INTENSE.,8,23 May 2021,"The action sequences were really fun and intense, especially the hand to hand combat sequences. The film was extremely gory but not for the sake of being ""gross"" or ""appalling"" but rather for pure entertainment purposes, and I must say, it worked for me. By far, my biggest critic of this film is the runtime. Although the film didn't feel as though it dragged it just seemed unnecessarily long. I wish I could say that this is a film I see myself periodically returning to in the future but the runtime alone really hurts its rewatchability.",Army of the Dead
43,questl-18592,Drax of the Dead,6,29 October 2021,"It's weird to think that the same person behind much of the DCU was also at the helm of this one. It's so bright and colorful and insane feeling at times. I say at times because I weirdly would've appreciated a bit more crazy from this one. It's almost there with the insane zombies, the menagerie of quirky characters and the bright colors but I almost want this to go full on Scott Pilgrim madness. As is, it's a fun, action packed zombie flick with Bautista, which is probably all anyone needs to know. This would've been a great summer blockbuster style movie, if theaters weren't in the state they've been in but it's still a fun movie to hang out and watch.",Army of the Dead
44,aidanratesmovies,"Could have been better, but could have been worse",5,24 May 2021,"Its ambitious, its well shot, and it's action scenes can be rather entertaining- however, that doesn't stop the film from being an underwhelming and thinly written mess- without much of a purpose or any true originality. Something Snyder really nailed on the head early on, was the development of the zombies throughout the states. The special effects on the zombies themselves are incredibly well done, and the development of their society and habits throughout prove to be the only consistently thought provoking thing all the way through. I enjoyed the look of the film, it's incredibly Snyder-esc, dark and gritty with some neo-noir type shots that really escalate the tone he was going for throughout the film. The action scenes are incredibly well done, much more so towards the middle of the film, and many are very entertaining and exciting to watch- which is truly what you hope for in these types of films. Where the film lacks in quality largely is its central human storyline, and the development of the ridiculous heist throughout. I knew the film would have some predictable moments and all, but the set up to the heist is possibly the most generic thing I have ever seen on screen in some time- feeling straight out of the heist parody episode of Rick and Morty. None of the actors are anything grand, some are decent, but most are rather bland. The film is also waaaay too long, with a nearly 2 and a half hour runtime that truly could have been cut to 2 hours easily. In the end, Army of the Dead can be memorable at times- it contains some fantastic worldbuilding and immense potential- but in the end, its structure and script problems lead it down a road of rather mediocrity.My Rating: 5.4/10.",Army of the Dead
45,TheFearmakers,Today's Movies Just Aren't Very Fun Anymore,5,26 May 2021,"It's no secret Zack Snyder's ARMY OF THE DEAD has a Zombie Tiger. But the funny part is that, during what's supposed to be an action-packed third act, the Zombie Tiger actually yawns, watching passively as a horde of intelligent ""Alpha Zombies"" rush towards a building where a ragtag group of heroes, anti-heroes and just plain TERRIBLE MEN are stealing loads of cash from a casino in Las Vegas, an enclosed city much like Manhattan in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, and the only place in America still harboring zombies from a zombie war we see via montage during the opening credits...Long review short... The good guy, led by an aged, stiff-muscular Dave Bautista, is, along with his daughter, so painfully idealistic they're boring, and annoying. Then there's a lesbian chopper pilot trying for the smart allecky Han Solo mixed with Ripley from ALIENS; the deliberate weak-link nerd who's technically important nonetheless; an honorably tough second-in-command; a rogue female tougher and deadlier than any male; and of course, those dirty rotten macho characters who, in today's age of preachy political correctness, you can no longer ""love to hate"" since their own hatred of everything the filmmaker loves makes them deserving of not only extra-horrible deaths, but they're not even supposed to be guiltily-entertaining in the process...So ARMY OF THE DEAD is a pretty bad movie, although not as bad as some are saying because you MIGHT want to stay till the end, to see how things pan out...At which point the ultimate let-down finale and post-finale finale could leave you hating yourself for having wanted to stick around in the first place, but... Either way, movies, as well as their characters (far too many here to remain interesting), are just not as fun as they used to be...The reason that spitfire-dialog comedies and pure-action action flicks were once only 90-minutes long is there's just so much we can either laugh along with or immensely marvel at...Two and a half hours is fine for an epic, say, like GOODFELLAS, detailing the entire life of a character in peril, but for a basic Heist Movie with a zombie twist... or a basic Zombie movie with a heist twist... it's an hour too long, and just not worth the wait.",Army of the Dead

Dave Bautista gives a great lead performance and Tig Notaro, Omari Hardwick and Matthias Schweighöfer are also great. Zack Snyder's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and visually stunning at points. The music by Tom Holkenborg is really good and the soundtrack is excellent.",Army of the Dead
47,davidmvining,Disappointing,4,25 May 2021,"You know the thing about ensemble pieces? They're hard to do right. This is a great example of an ensemble piece having a dozen different elements swirling around each other, the majority of which never come to anything at all, and the movie as a whole suffers greatly for it. What could any of this matter if the trailers are right that this is just a crazy and epic example of zombie action? Well, if more than half the run time is dedicated to thinly written characters that never really amount to anything then that level of crazy, epic zombie action gets reduced in general and the emotional impact of the deaths that happen gets immensely reduced.There's been a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, and the American government barely managed to contain it. Their military effort was led by Dave Bautista's Scott Ward who helped save the Secretary of Defense in the final seconds of the action. He had to kill his own wife in front of his daughter Kate when the whole thing started, and now, some years later he's a burger cook at a crummy dine-in restaurant when Tanaka, a billionaire businessman, walks up to him and offers him fifty million dollars to steal two hundred million dollars hidden underneath the zombie infested Strip before the president's ordered nuclear strike of the city is scheduled in a few days. He, of course, takes the job and needs to assemble his team.I immediately felt something was wrong when the assembly of the team felt so contracted. The personalities of Ward's team are unclear at best, which is a weird thing for a heist movie that's two-and-half hours long. There's Maria, a mechanic, Dieter, the safecracker, Vanderohe, a soldier with a circular saw as a main weapon, Marianne, a helicopter pilot, Martin, Tanaka's right hand man, and Mikey Guzman, an internet personality who seems to sneak into Vegas to pop zombies for clicks. Along the way, they also pick up Kate, Ward's daughter who is volunteering at a refugee camp just outside of Vegas, Lily, a coyote who sneaks people into Vegas to try and reclaim possessions they had left behind, and Burt, a camp guard who treats Kate and Lily poorly. This...this is a lot of characters. What's driving them? Money, mostly. Is there some kind of thematic idea that they share in some way? This is a movie about people going into the post-apocalyptic wasteland infested with zombies where people used to live. Some of these characters (definitely not all) have previous relationships with each other. Is there something that could possibly unite them? Something, perhaps, about reclaiming something from their past? Maybe ultimately about letting go of the past? I've just given this movie's thematic construction more thought that Zack Snyder did, I think, because nothing at all combines these people. There's nothing.Well, are they at least well-written interesting characters? Not really. This is a vehicle for zombie action, not character drama. After the team is assembled (a process that feels way too short in one way and way too long in another, namely how many people they have to get to go in), they walk through the shipping containers that form the boundary with Vegas and enter the world of the zombies. One thing that seems interesting in concept but ultimately feels under-considered in execution is the world building around the zombies. They're not just shambling, Romero zombies, they have a hierarchy and are ruled by a King with a Queen. This sounds fascinating, but that's about where it ends. There are shamblers (Romero zombies) and alphas (fast zombies), and that's kind of it. What this ultimately does is give Snyder a certain amount of freedom in terms of what kind of zombie action he can portray on screen.We get our first death fairly early in an action sequence that extends beyond internal believability, a character that makes no impression who ends up blowing herself up after she gets bit, and then the movie slows down significantly as characters take time to talk while they get close to the casino in question with the money. Ward and Kate have a moment where he discovers that the real reason Kate won't talk to him isn't because he murdered her mother in front of him but because he cut himself off from her after Vegas. Vanderhoe and Deiter begin a cute bromance. Marianne yells at the helicopter on top of the casino to try to get it to work. Lily sacrifices Burt to the Queen to get safe passage. It's a lot that's going on, and very little of it is of much interest. The stuff between father and daughter feels like it should be the bedrock on which the entire film is built, but their spat doesn't affect or interact with anyone else in the group, and it's a shockingly small part of the overall film. So, we just end up with all of these different little story beats that just move in different directions for a while the plot grinds to a screeching halt.And then the nuclear strike gets moved up by more than a day, giving them an hour and a half instead of more than a day, and it doesn't really seem to affect much. We're suddenly given a ticking clock, and it feels like an afterthought half the time. We also end up with a double cross that has no impact because the whole mission has felt like a second thought for about an hour, untied to the characters' actual emotional journeys, and then the big end climax begins. The zombie King decides to kill the humans because they kill his Queen (well decapitate and carry around her head which doesn't die because she's already dead), and the party dwindles down even further. There's zombie action, zombie action, and then more zombie action until the movie comes to an attempted emotional ending that falls completely flat.So, here's the thing, I was kind of with the movie through about the first two-thirds until the start of the big action climax. It wasn't really good, but it was okay. It was the sort of thing that could come together in the end, but nothing really gelled. It was a completely empty spectacle of an ending that I could easily imagine some people getting a fairly amount of out. However, because the movie ends up emotionally inert with way too many characters killed off with no impact, the action becomes literally nothing but the spectacle, a demo reel for stuntmen and CGI artists. There's a shallow enjoyment to be had with it to some degree, but it's not enough to actually make the movie that came before it work any better.I need to take a quick moment to talk about Zack Snyder's cinematography. I have no idea why, but Snyder did not bring his previous cinematographers (either Larry Fong or Fabian Wagner) to shoot Army of the Dead. Instead he shot it himself, and I think it was a bad choice. I couldn't say why, but about 60% of the film is shot in really shallow focus close ups. I find big movies frustrating when they're shot predominantly in close ups in general, but the really shall depth of field makes the images feel wrong. Actors, if they move an inch forward or backward, begin to waver out of focus. Their faces dominate the screen so completely that they might as well be in front of nondescript backgrounds instead of on set. It's surprisingly off-putting over time, especially when it spills over into action scenes.I was kind of looking forward to this. The trailers had me fooled, though. This is another one of those movies where the marketing is selling a wild and crazy time at the movies, but the actual movie doesn't deliver on that promise. I think of Suicide Squad in particular. Guardians of the Galaxy and Mad Max: Fury Road may be the only movies where the level of fun insanity implied by the trailers actually played out in the movies. Instead, Zack Snyder delivered an overly somber, emotional inert, and visually unpleasant epic action film. I was sorely disappointed by this.",Army of the Dead
48,jadepietro,Dinner is Served,6,23 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Gory mash-up that has the zombies outnumbering the humans.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) Every generation has its bevy of great film directors: Bergman, Hitchcock, Kubrick, Truffaut, Altman, Scorsese, Spielberg, The Coen Brothers, to name a few. The 21st century has its share of young talent making movies as well...Cuarón, Anderson (Wes and Paul Thomas), DuVernay, Chazelle. However, one filmmaker is establishing his cred as the decade's most popular director, unseating the reigning Michael Bay, and that man is Zack Snyder (Watchmen, 300, Justice League, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Sucker Punch; Upcoming is his film version of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead...yes, I am serious). His stylish comic book superhero flixs are legendary with his fanbase. Which brings us to his latest zombie thriller, Army of the Dead.Now, you may not be into zombies, but Mr. Snyder certainly is. Over 2½ hours worth of bloody deaths and spattered brain matter. His serviceable story does have, pardon the expression, some meat to it. During a national quarantine, a Rat Pack group of misfits, led by Scott Ward (ex-wrestler Dave Bautista) decide to play the odds and go for broke in Las Vegas for a money-making heist despite a zombie uprising. Who doesn't want to mix their genres: an Ocean 11 crime scenario meets horror movie, at your service. Place your bets on who will be zombie food.There are many well directed action set pieces and even more zombie munching on human parts. The heist becomes secondary to the gore. But there is also some macabre touches of humor that salvage this monster movie. (How could you not admire a movie with zombie Elvis impersonators, zombie showgirls in their feathery boa headdresses, and even a zombie fugitive tiger from the Ziegfried and Roy Revue...and that's mostly in the opening credits!) Mr. Snyder is strong on his gonzo imagery and he ratchets up the tension rather effectively. But restraint is not in his make-up. Let's face it, he never met an excess he didn't like. One cannot deny that he knows how to direct the action scenes with gusto, although he still relies too heavily on gimmicky slo-mo and in-your-face close-ups, not to mention, bodies being blown to bits. But I guess you can't expect subtlety in a zombie flix.Be forewarned, this is not a film for the lighthearted. This is a grisly bloodfest of exploding heads and extreme violence. But any moviegoer knows what to expect from Mr. Snyder's warped imagination. Army of the Dead is exactly what it intends to be, albeit some clever tongue-in-cheek moments...literally speaking. Obviously, what happens in Vegas, should have stayed there, but it is entertaining in is gruesomeness...with or without those zombie showgirls. (GRADE: C+)",Army of the Dead

I don't know what the Snyderites are watching-but maybe it's under the influence. This movie is too long, poorly thought out and has some of the dumbest ideas in film history. The main bad idea is: A guy opens a vault's exit, lugs out two huge bags of money-and walks through a just nuked landscape without dropping dead within twenty feet?

52,Abdulxoxo,Long but enjoyable,7,6 June 2021,"After initial exposure to the origin of the outbreak, we get a brilliant opening credits sequence where we see zombies running wild around Las Vegas, all set to an admittedly odd version of Viva Las Vegas This was a two and a half hour movie where, after that opening sequence, nothing particularly great happens until the final half hour, when all out chaos emerges. To give credit where credit's due. When it comes to the visual effects in 'Army of the Dead' was very impressive. The zombie tiger that's been featured in most of the advertising look awesome. I also thought it was quite interesting that the zombies in this movie are smart zombies, with a hierarchy. It was a smart choice in a sub-genre with increasingly diminishing returns. Unfortunately this is a Zach Snyder directed movie tho. What could have been an excellent 90-minute popcorn flick, is extended to the point of exhaustion with a multitude of slow motion shots, pointless sub-plots and flat dialogue. After that fun opening sequence, there's near enough an hour long chuck of this movie that could have been cut down to maybe 15 minutes, which would have made a massive improvement. There are a lot of supporting characters in this film, most of which have a singular purpose and contribute very less else. There's almost no character development to speak of; and only few performance was enjoyable, among include that of Matthias Schweighofer, who plays the German safe cracker, Dieter. Frankly his comical reactions were the only vaguely believable aspect of any of these characters.

53,arungeorge13,Snyder-isms galore in a mindlessly entertaining zombie-heist flick! [+58%],6,21 May 2021,"A Las Vegas casino heist in the middle of a zombie apocalypse - the premise has an intriguing ring to it. Army of the Dead marks Snyder's return to the zombieverse after a 17-year gap. Snyder leaves no room for subtlety in this film, with some obvious visual and musical choices. It's a Vegas movie - for Snyder, that automatically mandates the need for slo-mo shots of dollar bills flying around. It's a zombie movie - so, you can guess which song by The Cranberries would play at some point. And most of all, it's a Snyder movie - that means we get weird innuendo-filled lines. All that said, there's a fair amount of fun to be had in this zombie splatterfest. I'll tell you why!The cast (i.e. The heist crew in the film) does all the heavy lifting. Dave Bautista (a brawny ex-soldier turned burger chef), Omari Hardwick (a soldier turned philosopher), Ana de la Reguera (a mechanic), Matthias Schweighöfer (a safecracker), Tig Notaro (a helicopter pilot), Nora Arnezeder, Ella Purnell, Raul Castillo, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Huma Qureshi round it off. In particular, Bautista does well as the vulnerable veteran while Schweighöfer keeps things occasionally funny and upbeat. The 2h 28m runtime always felt questionable before it all started. However, knowing Snyder and his fondness for stretched-out scenes, that was a given. The final act is where all the coolth really shows, with a shoot-em-up showdown at a casino, and subsequently on rooftops.The main antagonist (the leader of a smarter, faster-moving zombie horde known as the Alphas) even gets an emotional arc, which while not entirely new, gives an action-heavy film such as this some extra texture. The uneasy father-daughter dynamic between the characters of Bautista and Purnell is utterly generic, only lit up by the former's (deadpan) comedic timing. Snyder reinstates that his focus is purely on the gory action, even featuring a gratuitous scene with a zombified tiger. It's both silly and fun but in the right doses.",Army of the Dead
54,omendata,Gutted,6,8 June 2021,"As a massive fan of the genre and with the director being of one of my favourite zombie films aka Dawn Of The Dead (2004), I think every fan of the genre was really looking forward to this and sadly we are all as gutted as some of the zombies on the show!The main complaint is putting Bautista in as the lead, he simply cannot act or pull off any role other than the sidekick; he was great in Riddick but he simply is not in the league of actors like Ving Rhames, Arnold Schwarzenneger or any of the actors we enjoy watching as the lead kick-ass character. At times you can hardly make out what he says as he, emotionally bereft, mumbles and stumbles his way through this almost FPV game conversion of the computer game ""Zombie Island"".Stir in the by now standard, annoying w0ke ingredients with Cigar chewing, copter pilot and ""mixed"" cast; there is creating an interesting character and then there is just plain dumb casting decisions and this film exemplifies just about the worst casting of any movie this year, with almost every single character being totally out of place and unbelievable, they even had to stir in the Zombie Tiger so utterly obviously ripped off of The King's Tiger in the Walking Dead series; so unoriginal and out of place and to make matters worse they then rip off the evil zombie; once again quite obviously stolen from the excellent Will Smith ""I Am Legend"" zombie film which all makes this unoriginal CGI overload crash and burn HARD!I still enjoyed it accepting it as bubblegum for the eyes, so am as always fair in my reviews and give it a slightly above average 6 hatchets on the horror scale but to say i am disappointed is an understatement and perhaps this is why it went straight to Netflix rather than the cinema and an indication that the Zombie genre is completely as finished as the series The Walking Dead has become - A very sad day indeed for us fans!!!",Army of the Dead

I thought it looked good when reflecting the heat of the desert, and when showing disturbing things off in the distance, but often it seemed a bit distracting and unnecessary.Similarly, the dialogue is very inconsistent, and the attempts at emotion didn't always work for me.BUT: thankfully, this movie is a very fun, very violent, and for the most part very well-paced action/crime/horror hybrid, and honestly, a high-budget zombie movie with proper blood and gore is something I've been wanting to see for years (no, you don't count, World War Z. Get outta here with your PG-13 rating).Would be keen to see Snyder direct more zombie movies (between this and the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, he's shown to be pretty damn good at tackling the genre). Also: more leading roles for Dave Bautista, please. I liked him a lot here. More acting roles for Tig Notaro too, please, movie industry.(The face she made when one character mentioned another character deserved what was coming to him because he was an abuser was priceless, given she herself replaced Chris D'Elia after news broke about his history of sexual misconduct).",Army of the Dead
58,vithiet,Initial reviews tricked me!,5,15 June 2021,"I'm not sure why there were so many praises and high ratings when it came out, but it's definitely not worth it. It really is your run of the mill action movie with a premise that makes very little sense, tons of plot holes, zero character development, and uneven quality VFX. Vaguely entertaining though. I'm a bit sad that's what Dave Bautista had to work with coming out strong from Guardians of the Galaxy and his short appearance in Blade Runner 2049... he can do so much better!",Army of the Dead
59,IonicBreezeMachine,"Zack Snyder's audacious zombie epic is assembled from familiar parts, but oozes viscera and personality in equal measure.",7,21 May 2021,"When the city of Las Vegas falls to a zombie plague, the city is walled off and declared a no man's land with former residents now forced to reside in inadequate refugee camps out of fear for spreading the plague. The enigmatic Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) approaches former soldier Scott Ward (Dave Bautista), a hero of Las Vegas who rescued the Defense Secretary during the zombie uprising now working as a short order cook, with an offer of stealing $200 million in cash from a casino vault before the city is scheduled for a nuclear strike with the promise of $50 million for him and his team to divide. Ward accepts the offer an assembles a team believing he can use the money to bridge his relationship with his estranged daughter, Kate (Ella Purnell), who works as a volunteer with the refugees and can arrange their entrance into Vegas. Kate agrees to help on the condition they locate a friend of her missing within the city. When the group enters the city they face both zombie and non zombie threats.In 2004 Zack Snyder exploded onto the scene with reimagining of Dawn of the Dead that, along with 28 Days Later and the Resident Evil films, helped to re-invigorate the zombie horror subgenre and defining the execution and techniques that would define the subgenre for better or worse. Since Dawn of the Dead, Snyder has dabbled primarily in comic book and comic book inspired films with 300 and Watchmen both tapping into the cultural zeitgeist with their visual stylings giving Snyder a signature look that is unmistakably his, and more controversially his application of those techniques to the DC Cinematic Universe with his takes on Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman, and recently recovered Justice League director's cut that all have their supporters and detractors often for the same reasons. Army of the Dead is very much a back to basics approach for Snyder, that although still firmly in blockbuster territory, still carries over a mostly similar subdued approach that he used in Dawn of the Dead. While Army of the Dead doesn't carry the same level of punch as its 2004 spiritual predecessor, it's still a fun white knuckle ride from start to finish that satisfies on the basis of sheer entertainment value.Army of the Dead is basically a mash-up of Escape from New York, heist films like Ocean's Eleven or The Italian Job, and a Dawn of the Dead all rolled up into one. The movie is unmistakably put together from familiar parts be it the team-make up that draws not only from prior zombie films but also prior heist films. While the movie's parts are familiar, the execution and assembly is where the movie shines as it uses its Vegas setting to terrific effect with a nice color palette and creative action scenes (including an opening credits sequence that hits both dark comic and tragic notes) and a feeling of camaraderie among the cast. Bautista as usual is good in the lead not only effortlessly taking on the action set pieces, but also getting some nice moments of levity from his deadpan delivery of discussing his character's dream of different food truck ideas. The ensemble features a bevy of performances that all bring extra punch to the material with personality to spare such as Garret Dillahunt, Theo Rossi, Ana de la Reguera, and Omari Hardwick all playing well of each other. Tig Notaro, who plays the chopper pilot Peters, does have some funny deliveries in the film, but because she was added so late into production she can't interact with the cast making her feel somewhat crudely inserted (albeit visually speaking it's quite well done). While for the most part the characters do fall into ""types"" and you can reasonably predict who will die in what order, the film did do a nice job of paying off on each character and element introduced and even managed to get legitimate moments of shock.Army of the Dead isn't the most ambitious of Zack Snyder's filmography, but as a back to basics action extravaganza you'd be hard pressed to find better than this. With tight direction that allows for both dark humor and thrills as well a diverse cast of characters who play reasonably well off each other, Army of the Dead is good mindless fun. Whether the movie translates to a successful franchise will certainly be interesting given there are already two spin-offs already completed (a prequel featuring Matthias Schweighofer's Dieter character called army of thieves, and an animated miniseries called Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas) but as far as possible franchise starters go I'm actually pretty optimistic.",Army of the Dead

That's not to say that it's bad,, cause it's not. That's not to say that it's good either. It's okay. If you want to see action, it's got action. If you want to zombies,, it's got those too. It's just,, okay. Imo, it started out great! The first 30-45 mins were exactly what I was looking for. Then the pace changed, and it got a lil bit more complicated. Anyways,, I'd give this one a 6.4,, which really hurts to say. I've been SUCH a fan of Snyder's work. This one just doesn't measure up. Maybe it's Netflix's fault. Maybe they had too much influence on it all. Idk,, it's perfectly worth watching,, just don't expect greatness.Long story longer,,, Las Vegas has become completely overrun with zombies. So much so that walls have been put up all around the city in an effort to keep them from infecting the outside world.The owner of one of Vegas's wealthiest Casino's hires a man (Bautista) to lead a group back into the city to collect the 200 million in cash just sitting in his casino's safe.

62,thekarmicnomad,Nobody realises what an editor does until it is done this badly,4,4 June 2021,"This is a big dumb action movie and for the most part is succeeds at this.The characters are all stereotypes and two dimensional - but that is ok I am not expecting a remake of Jane Eyre or anything.The opening sequence is good fun and is actually the best bit of story telling in the movie and sets a really good tone.There are zombies and gun fights and chainsaws and stuff blowing up, people jumping off things and grasping on by their finger tips - it's all here.The problem is, is the film is too long.You can only watch people run around after zombies for so long before fatigue sets in.So what is so important we have to bloat this movie to over two and a half hours?Well we have:
Walking places,
Looking at people,
Looking at people from a bit further away,
Looking at people from the perspective of an ant,
Looking at people from a helicopter.So much of this movie could just be cut and nobody would notice.You have a scene of someone standing on a car talking poo, then the camera shifts to five different angles for no reason.You get full sequences of people walking across a carpark.If I want to see that I can just go to a carpark.This is a dumb movie that tries to pretend it is smarter than it is - like the kid at school who read one art book and then started wearing a beret.In this instance the makers of this movie needed to pick a team - either commit to being dumb and fun or don't, you won't fool anyone.",Army of the Dead
63,educallejero,Epitome of mediocrity,4,25 September 2021,"In dumb movies, we can accept mediocre and shallow characters, plus a boring cliché ridden story. We can have that and still enjoy the spectacle (Aquaman) or not at all (Transformers sequels). Or even with more stunts as the only thing that matters movies like John Wick, you can enjoy (or not) the violence and superb action, without taking in consideration how hollow the rest of the elements are.But here, everything is mediocre. The action is ok but offers little to nothing new. The gore is ok, but of course that doesn't really matters that much. The visual spectacle just isn't there, which is weird with Snyder, and that includes a horrendous cinematography with no depth that made the whole movie claustrophobic.In the end, we have one great scene with tension and the zombies, some (sparse) fun here and there, and an entertaining but overlong forgettable movie.",Army of the Dead
64,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An interesting genre mixture but with some faults of both genres.,7,12 October 2021,"Some of the most original movies I've seen have mixed genres to create something new. Movies like Cowboys & Aliens (2011) combine the western and sci-fi genres, while movies like Army of the Dead (2021) work by fusing zombie movies with heist films. The tropes of these genres can often accentuate each other and can fuel character development or drive the plot. The premise of Army of the Dead might be a weak reason to motivate the characters to risk their lives in the first place, but as long as the result is a Las Vegas-themed zombie apocalypse, it works.While I'm not generally a fan of ""serious"" zombie films, I can appreciate the level of depth put into the undead in this movie. Generally, ""smart"" zombies are much more interesting than those that mindlessly wander around and wait for someone to make a noise. I also loved the tongue-in-cheek use of ""Viva Las Vegas"" for the opening credits, which set the tone of the whole movie. Unfortunately, with such a huge cast of characters for this heist, I only found Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) and Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro) entertaining and criminally underused.Even though mixing genres can use tropes to strengthen weaknesses, it can also accentuate the glaring holes in these genres. For Army of the Dead, it tries to rely on the ""small crew"" of a heist film but then needs to bloat that crew so that the threat of zombies can also be overcome. As a result, there were a lot of characters (even main ones like Scott Ward (Dave Bautista)) that I didn't fully understand their motivations. In fact, I was confused with a lot of this movie as it tried to add backstory to characters I knew were going to die anyway.An interesting genre mixture but with some faults of both genres, I give Army of the Dead 3.5 stars out of 5.",Army of the Dead
65,Holt344,Army of the Dead is a must watch and also a worthy contribution to the zombie genre - My Ultimate Review,8,21 May 2021,"Army of the Dead marks the return to the zombie genre since Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead which was his feature film debut. This is very much a Zack Snyder film but I'm sure that people who doesn't know who Zack is, will find this film entertaining and hopefully great. Zack Snyder got complete creative control and it shows, it was also the first time as he took the role as cinematographer and it's simply astonishing. He's known for his brutal and dark movies, this has all of that and honestly I didn't expect it to be this bloody but I'm glad it is. Zombie films should be gory and brutal, Zack succeeded with that. I have also never seen a zombie film like this one, it's original in that way and the subtle comedy fits in perfectly. The overall writing and dialogue is simply perfect, there's so many interactions and lines of dialogue that are amazing. Army of the Dead met my expectations.The story is about a group of soldiers who plan a Las Vegas casino heist amid a zombie apocalypse. It's entirely made up by Zack Snyder and the screenplay was co-written by him and two other people. There isn't anything mind blowing with the story but the action, exciting and unique set pieces make the story work and of course the cast of characters. Army of the Dead is filled with a phenomenal cast with the likes of Dave Bautista, Garret Dillahunt, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Theo Rossi, Matthias Schweighöfer, Nora Arnezeder and Hiroyuki Sanada. With lots of others.Seeing Dave Bautista in a role like this is something I have been waiting for since his role in Blade Runner 2049, it's actually a really good performance, both on the dramatic and action side of things. He uses all of his talent and pulls of a fantastic performance. There's so many actors that give performances worth taking note of. Dave Bautista turned down a role from the new Suicide Squad film to be in this, I think it was the right move as I could see him getting lots of dramatic roles after this.Let's talk about the run time for a bit as I read that critics critized it. I was surprised at first but honestly this is a Zack Snyder film and he likes to make longer movies and the extra scenes we get makes us care for the characters and make them more real and less like action heroes. It's called character development and I'm glad we got character development. Just sad I didn't get to see this at the cinema, this is a cinematic experience. I think they succeeded with the musical score and soundtrack. The sound editing is also great, the guns sound real and the zombie noises are different but really good. The fight choreography is honestly great and the zombie kills are satisfying. I also want to praise the visual effects.Army of the Dead will please many fans of the zombie sub-genre, I loved every second of it. For a Zack Snyder film, there are only one slow-mo shot that I noticed. Zack Snyder made a visually stunning film, I hope he gets to continue his work with Netflix with other movies other than this franchise he created. I'm looking forward to the prequel and what else the franchise has to offer. It's an incredible film and opportunity for the visionary director.",Army of the Dead
66,bankofmarquis,Takes Too Long To Get To The Fun Part,6,26 May 2021,"I love me a good Zombie flick. I also love me a good Heist flick. So...when I heard that Zack Snyder (JUSTICE LEAGUE) was making a ""Zombie/Heist Flick"", I thought ""what's not to like""?Turns out...plenty.A pet project of Sndyer's that has been stuck in ""development hell"" in Hollywood for almost 2 decades, ARMY OF THE DEAD tells the tale of a group of mercenaries that look to rob $200 million from a vault under the casinos of Las Vegas - one small problem...Las Vegas has been walled off as a way to contain a zombie plague.My first warning that this was not going to a pleasant experience is that this film has a 2 1/2 hour run time. That certainly seems bloated for a Zombie film and the first 1 1/2 of this flick certainly proves this out as Snyder - ham handedly - seeks to flesh out each of the characters in long, boring exposition scenes that didn't really add anything to the tension or action. Well...it did add something...restless boredom.But...I gotta admit, once the group of mercenaries make their way to the vault in Las Vegas, the last hour of the film was pretty darn fun.Dave Bautista (Drax in the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY films) leads the group of mercenaries and Ella Purnell (Emma in MISS PEREGRINE...) is his estranged daughter. I won't bore you with the details of why these 2 are estranged...but they are and Bautista insists that his daughter NOT come along on this mission. So you know what happens next...yep, she comes along and I was rooting for her to get killed almost from the start. Neither of these 2 characters work and since they are central to the story they are really at the root of the problems with the first 1 1/2 hours of this film.The rest of the ensemble, however, are a lot of fun and bring that ""B Monster Movie"" vibe to the proceedings and they look like they are having alot of fun. Tig Notero, Ana de La Reguera, Omari Hardwick and Theo Rossi are an enjoyable lot and know EXACTLY what type of film they are in.But the standouts of the ensemble are the always great Garret Dillahunt (John Dorie in FEAR THE WALKING DEAD) who brings his usual ""A"" game to the proceedings. As does Nora Arnezeder (SAFE HOUSE) as ""The Coyote"" a survivor who has been in Las Vegas before and - especially - Matthias Schweighofer (RESISTANCE) who steals every scene he is in playing the German safecracker.I would have loved it if Snyder would have cut the Bautista and daughter scenes (and characters) and just had this ensemble go after the loot - it would have been a much better - and shorter - film.But...if you can last through the long, boring first 1 1/2 hours, the last hour is ""good enough"" Zombie action with an interesting ""twist"" on the genre that I will have to give Snyder credit for.If you do all this, you'll have a passably decent enough entertaining time.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Army of the Dead

72,kjproulx,Borrows to Many Familiar Elements to Fully Enjoy,5,1 June 2021,"From Watchmen to Sucker Punch, Zack Snyder has always been a hit-or-miss director for me. There are many times where I found his films to be a blast to watch and others where it felt slightly over-indulgent or just lacking in its narrative. His films are always nice to look at because he definitely has his own visual style, but sometimes, in cases like Man of Steel, I think his vision has been a bit much when it comes to spectacle. Army of the Dead is his latest turn as director, while also having a hand in writing and cinematography. It's a film I can both recommend and call lacklustre, so take this review with a grain of salt.After a zombie outbreak occurs in Las Vegas and the area is contained, a group of mercenaries are recruited to pull a heist at a bank, surrounded by these zombies. The concept of a heist occurring during a zombie apocalypse was enough to warrant a viewing from me because that's never really been done, especially to this extent. It felt like a fresh idea, but upon my viewing and reflecting on it as a whole, it borrows too many plot devices from better movies, which sort of taints it overall. Yes, a movie like this isn't meant to be picked apart, but I saw nearly every plot twist coming from a mile away. If for nothing else, the film delivers on some fun zombie action.If you watch a movie called Army of the Dead and complain about gore or violence, I'm not sure what to tell you. There were many instances where I found that this was the sole purpose for the film existing, to begin with. The film is lead by actor Dave Bautista as Scott Ward and they give him enough of a backstory to care, but the rest of the characters/cast (although likeable) all just felt like they were in a film, acting out a very generic trait. Yes, everyone has at least one great moment to shine, but they were all moments that felt like a copy and paste from other movies. With that said, I still had fun with the movie.By the end of the first act, I could tell what kind of tone and pace the movie was going for and I looked past my main issues. I was eventually starting to have a lot of fun watching it, but the ending truly ruined most of that. Without giving too much away, I felt as though the writers became confused on where to take the story and decided to go in a direction that really collapsed the film as a whole. I never once found myself being satisfied with anything that happened in the third act. The final moments of this film honestly made me question what the point of it was, to begin with.In the end, Army of the Dead is nowhere near a good film, but there is enough fun zombie action here to warrant a pass. Now that I'm really thinking about it, I don't think I would recommend this one, but I can see quite a few viewers getting a big kick out of the characters and set pieces. There are some great character moments and some cool action/fights, but the problem is that it never amounts to anything. Now streaming on Netflix, Army of the Dead couldn't have been any closer to the definition of a middle-of-the-road film.",Army of the Dead
73,AhmedSpielberg99,Boring and Overlong!,4,22 May 2021,"Seeing a hierarchical kingdom of zombies is actually kinda refreshing. We have the Shamblers, who are derived from the typical zombies of the late 60s and the 70s, only slightly more evolved and a tad smarter. We've also got the Alphas, who are far more superior to the Shamblers: extremely agile, relatively fast and even capable of showing emotions. Their leader, Zeus, and the one who likely has turned them all into zombies, is quite intelligent and strong. Pretty much a human hadn't been for his gruesome look and his growling and screeching. He's even got himself a queen. The problem is, there's no proper explanation why they retain such human traits, with the Alphas acting and displaying emotions and feelings like humans to the point they come across as zombie imitators. Even worse, that left the hierarchical structure unexplored and unsatisfyingly vague and muddled. That said, I wouldn't hesitate looking past these inadequacies resulted from such half-baked world building so long as they would be offset by the galore of bloody fun expected from an action-packed zombie flick. Sadly, I can't say the movie fully delivered on that either, as the entertainment value is heavily undercut by a plethora of issues including clunky dialogue, one-note characters that are either mere stereotypes or unabashedly ripped off of other action movie characters - most notably from Aliens - tonal inconsistency, overly-dramatic moments and, worst of all, a total failure in embracing all of these shortcomings openly in an act of self-awareness of sorts. For starters, the attempts at comedy are awfully bad, with all the jokes falling flat and some of them are just plain cringe-worthy. Ludwig Dieter, the German safecracker who's supposed to be the comic relief character, is unbearably annoying and dumb. The same can be said about some frequent, albeit unsubstantial and tentative, tongue-in-cheek allusions to politics. Needless to say, all the concerns mentioned above have come to the surface and become impossible to ignore. The emotional scenes Scott (David Bautista) share with his daughter Kate are both repetitive and devoid of the slightest dramatic impact, mainly because the plotline revolves around their tumultuous relationship is woefully underdeveloped. Although the movie had its fair amount of time to provide necessary background for its main characters, the bulk of the first act is diminished by poor editing, sluggish tone and unfocused narrative. As an actioner, Army of the Dead is, in fact, quite generic and derivative despite its desperate attempts to conceal that with its skin-deep contrivance, buckets of blood and gore and no skimping on slow-motion moments you'd expect from Zack Snyder. No action scene is memorable or even intriguing enough. Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours, the movie also feels strangely limited in scope, which is not only unusual from Zack Snyder but also at odds with the epic it lends itself to be. That, along with having a kind of a pattern when it comes to switching between humour, action and drama, stifled the tension the perilous zombie territory could've yielded in spades. The fact I dozed off midway through is enough to prove how tedious the end result turned out to be. Even the songs in its endless soundtrack playing rather abruptly didn't help galvanizing the ponderous second act. Honestly, however, the movie picks up in its third act, which is basically one elongated action sequence with the climactic scene being genuinely gripping. Dave Bautista's performance is one of the few redeeming factors here, with some schmaltzy emotional scenes he single-handedly rendered them watchable. Still, Army of the Dead is a predictable, ridiculously overlong zombie heist movie that tried so hard to be an epic, brainless gorefest but ended up being nothing but a borefest.",Army of the Dead
74,kuarinofu,Just imagine what it could've been and enjoy your brain going on things,5,22 May 2021,"I remember first seeing the poster for this film around 5 years ago or so, it has spent more time on my watchlist than any other film.What can I say...it wasn't good and this is sad enough.First and foremost, the trailer doesn't just misrepresent the film, it creates completely different expectations.Then bokeh.The tone of the film is constantly shifting. It starts almost like a trailer for a Call of Duty Zombies game or a Dying Light game, very video-gamey. But as the film progresses this gets dropped.Then they introduce some interesting ideas about these zombies' lore, their motivation, some character ties, but again, not really going deep into it, just acknowledging their existence.The pacing slows to a still to the point when it starts to become boring, mostly because you already know everything that is going to happen, down to the last scene.Some more bokeh.After standing still for some time, we get a couple of spectacular action scenes, followed by some bokeh in dark halls so you can't even see the blurred image because it's too dark. Well, at least you can see the dead pixel in one of the cameras.Without actually developing the interesting stuff in the film they just continue on with cliches, making a good joke here or there, inserting actual political agenda here and there. Plus bokeh.The ending happens, and if you have ever seen a film you know how it is going to end. No bokeh here though.To be honest, there were many interesting things in it, good monster designs (although the main zombie reminded me of the Nameless One from Planescape: Torment), good gore, and well-shot (mostly) action scenes. Aliens references were also appreciated.But as a complete film, it only comes as disappointing. I love Snyder's DotD re-make as much as the original, but this one was a miss.P. S.

Some viewers really love his work - Zack Snyder's Justice League was only possible due to passionate, hardcore fans - while others fail to understand the reasons behind the constant hype surrounding the filmmaker's projects. Personally, despite not belonging to his enormous fandom, I quite enjoy his work outside of the DCEU. From Dawn of the Dead to Watchmen, passing through 300, I hold these films in high regard. However, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is unquestionably one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my life, and it's arguably the movie that triggered the beginning of the controversial general opinion about the director.Usually, when people find themselves on a rough path, going back to their roots helps them get back on track, which is precisely what Snyder does here. The ""zombie apocalypse"" genre has been around for decades, but since the start of the new century, audiences all over the world were able to witness a narrative that was once unique and exciting become one of the most overdone, generic, formulaic pieces of storytelling. This last statement doesn't mean a few gems can't come out of it. From probably the greatest zombie film ever, Train to Busan, to the comedy classic Zombieland, there are truly great movies within the genre. So, where does Army of the Dead stand?Somewhere in the middle, labeled as ""good fun"", which is all I expected from this Netflix film. Let me get one thing out of the way immediately: this looks, sounds, and feels like a Snyder movie. Countless over-stylized shots, long slow-motion scenes, an overwhelming amount of gore and blood, bizarre song choices, a two-hour-and-a-half runtime... for better or worst, no one can complain about studio interferences this time. Clearly, the famous director had complete creative freedom, and it shows through all of the film's positives and negatives. Fortunately, Snyder's filmmaking style not only fits well within this genre, but it also works for the simple, entertainment-driven screenplay.A vast majority of viewers will press play in the hopes of receiving an action-heavy, fun, uncomplicated zombie movie with all the attributes that these flesh-eating characters possess. Except for a genuinely interesting storyline - though not new - concerning a specific type of zombies, everything else is pretty much what viewers have seen for the past two decades, which might be disappointing yet still highly enjoyable. From the way people can kill them to the time each infected person takes to become a zombie, every single cliche is present in this film. Honestly, none of them really annoy me unless they're repeated to exhaustion, which I don't believe Army of the Dead does that much.The action sequences are all well-shot, but I did expect more from them. Most scenes are just characters randomly shooting, hitting insane headshots that viewers will just have to accept as something normal, which shouldn't be too hard, considering the recent action flicks. Occasionally, one-on-one or one-on-many combats ensue, and it elevates the excitement levels by focusing on that single character, but then it's brought down again by tiresome shootouts. Snyder asks the viewers to accept several dumb plot and character decisions, so it's always going to be a matter of how much you can take until it starts getting too much...Personally, these logical issues don't really bother me - the ridiculous third act does push my limits, I admit. However, the lack of character development and overall care for everyone in the movie will always be a massive problem, especially when supposedly emotional, heartfelt moments end up having zero impact. I doubt anyone will be surprised to find out that people die in this film besides the zombies, consequently bringing tonal balance to the table. Obviously, not every character needs to receive a deep backstory and complex motivations, but it doesn't hurt to tell the viewers a bit about the people going into the danger zone so that the action sequences can carry more tension.Without spoiling anything, there's a period in the movie where a deadly countdown begins, and everything that occurs from the starting time to the climactic moment just feels like any other scene in the film. The lack of tension and sense of urgency ultimately stops it from being one of the greats. Overall, it's an enjoyable zombie flick that offered me a blast of fun, but I still believe it could have been a lot better. Dave Bautista (My Spy, Avengers: Endgame) is the absolute standout, interpreting the only fully-developed character of the movie. Ella Purnell (Wildlike), Omari Hardwick (Sorry to Bother You), and Nora Arnezeder (Origin) are also quite good.Finally, a point must be made about the relationship between studios and filmmakers. While I'm all in favor of creative freedom, there must always be a compromise between both parties. Snyder didn't gain fame for badly editing his films for no reason. Army of the Dead is, like most of his movies, unnecessarily long. The ""deleted scenes"" feature on Blu-rays doesn't exist for show-off. There's no film in the history of cinema where every single second recorded is pure gold, and runtimes are something studios can *help* filmmakers nail perfectly. In the end, I still consider this movie to move quickly through its straightforward story, so the excess screentime might not be that big of an issue for other viewers.Army of the Dead brings Zack Snyder back to the zombie apocalypse genre, delivering an entertaining, action-driven story that will please most spectators. With his distinct, divisive filmmaking style completely unrestrained, for better or worst, the standout Dave Bautista and his team fight through the cliches, lack of character development, and excessive runtime to still offer plenty of excitement. The lack of tension and urgency hurt some of the last action sequences, but all are well-shot and packed with energy. Exceptional production design and VFX aren't enough to compensate for the predictably formulaic screenplay, especially when the only interesting zombie storyline is only partially explored. Overall, it's the definition of ""good fun"", so if your weekend has a two-and-a-half-hour empty slot, Netflix has my endorsement.Rating: B-",Army of the Dead

80,0w0,"Zack Snyder originally wanted to call the movie: ""Vaseline on the Lens (oh and Zombies)""",4,2 June 2021,"70% of the movie looks like a thick layer of Vaseline was applied to the lens. EVERYTHING except the actors are out of focus and it's very reminicint of a bad video-game's graphics with the 'Depth of Field' setting turned to 11. The movie's green-screen quality is bad... like real bad. This is a 90 million dollar movie, and yet the green-screen scenes are more noticeable and worse quality than many $20m movies. I mean, Matrix (1999) is 22 years old and has the same budget as this movie, yet this movie's green-screen is horrible when compared to it.Other than the terrible, terrible directive choices that Zack made, the movie also spends WAY too much time on non-action filler. This movie has a 140minute running time, yet maybe just like 20minutes of it has what would qualify as 'action.' The movie has a very 'Oceans Eleven' plot/story, but I swear, even a movie like 'Oceans Eleven' has more action than this movie. Also while we're on the subject of 'plot', this movie has a couple of big plot holes. One BIG one is where they kill the main princess zombie, and don't dispose of her body.... it's something so incredibly obvious to the viewer, and yet the characters in the movie never even consider it (this is due to sloppy plot and story writing).Honestly, this movie was a waste of not only 90 million dollars, but also a waste of your eyeballs' time. Poor plot/story, big plot holes, poor directing choices, poor production, low-quality CGI, lack of action scenes, etc. This movie is a solid 4/10, so.... just avoid it.",Army of the Dead
81,MrDHWong,Revels in all the sensationalistic glory of both its genres for a prolonged amount of time,7,3 June 2021,"""Army Of The Dead"" is a zombie heist film co-written and directed by Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead, 300, Zack Snyder's Justice League). Starring Dave Bautista and Ella Purnell, it revels in all the sensationalistic glory of both its genres for a prolonged amount of time.After a zombie escapes from a US military convoy in the Nevada desert, it heads towards the bright neon lights of Las Vegas and within a short while, virtually the entire city has become infected. When the government fails to bring the situation under control, it decides to wall the city off from the rest of the country, strictly allowing nobody in or out. Billionaire casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) offers retired mercenary Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) a job to retrieve $200 million from the vault of his casino before the government drops a nuclear bomb on the city in a few short days. With time running out, Scott accepts the job and recruits a team to help him with this dangerous mission, consisting of his former co-workers Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) and Maria (Ana De La Reguera), safecracker Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer), internet gunman Mikey Guzman (Raúl Castillo), helicopter pilot Marianne (Tig Notaro), people smuggler Lilly (Nora Arnezeder), and Scott's estranged daughter Kate (Ella Purnell).Films, TV shows, and video games featuring zombies feel as though they are everywhere at this point. Everyone is familiar with the basic tropes - a group of people try to survive hordes of the undead at the risk of being bitten and turning into one of them. ""Army Of The Dead"" takes that typical scenario and combines it with that of a heist thriller, bringing us a refreshingly enjoyable take on this otherwise overdone genre. What I believe separates the film most from others was in the depiction of its zombies. Rather than the regular mindless flesheaters we're used to, here we see that some are intelligent enough to communicate with each other to form something of a hierarchy among themselves. This presents a far greater challenge to our human characters, who in addition to breaking into a safe and escaping a soon to be nuked city are also trying to find ways to avoid these resourceful creatures who are efficient enough to outsmart them at every turn. Of course, that doesn't mean the film isn't capable of delivering on the zombie gore. We still see plenty of heads blown off, limbs sawn from bodies, and entrails pouring out of abdomins. This film never forgets how to be fun and should definitely satisfy longtime fans of zombie media who may be worried they won't get their usual fix of blood and guts.Returning to his roots, Zack Snyder is certainly no stranger to zombie films, having previously made his directorial debut with 2004's remake of the 1978 classic ""Dawn Of The Dead"". In that film, Snyder managed to breathe some new life into a then waning art form by reimagining zombies as strong, fast running entities driven by a primal desire to feast on the flesh of the living. Although ""Army"" is unrelated to the canon of ""Dawn"", it does feel like a true spiritual successor in some ways. For example, I particularly liked this film's opening montage of the zombie outbreak set to an amusing lounge cover of Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" performed by Richard Cheese (whose version of Disturbed's ""Down With The Sickness"" was used in a noteworthy scene in ""Dawn""). It perfectly established how the crazy, wild city of Las Vegas has just gotten crazier thanks to the presence of the living dead. This somewhat mirrors the opening of ""Dawn"" which featured news reports and footage of zombies attacking while Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" plays in the background. It's moments like this that make me think that Snyder has had a yearning to return to making movies with zombies in it after all these years. However, where Snyder falls short is in his choice in the film's length. At nearly two and a half hours, there were quite a few scenes that dragged on longer than they should, upsetting the momentum of an otherwise fast-paced movie. Something like this may have worked for his cut of Justice League, which required a lot of breathing room to establish the enormity of an impending threat, but for a zombie film with a ticking clock, it just comes across as unnecessary.The film's ensemble cast are a mixed bag, with some I cared about and others I knew from the very beginning were going to end up as zombie chow. Dave Bautista did a pretty decent job as the group's leader Scott Ward, a skilled former mercenary who knows how to deal with large quantities of the living dead. I thought he and Ella Purnell had believable enough chemistry as father and daughter for me to hope they'd succeed in their mission together. Omari Hardwick was also fun to watch as Scott's old teammate Vanderohe, who forms an unlikely friendship with the meek mannered safecracker Dieter. The one character I wished we'd seen more of was Nora Arnezeder as Lilly, whose tough, no-nonsense attitude felt surprisingly in sync with the other cast members. She sort of reminded me of how Wonder Woman is depicted in the DC Extended Universe, a strong female ally and friend who works well alongside her male counterparts.Though it could have been much better in places, ""Army Of The Dead"" is still an entertaining return to what put Zack Snyder's name on the map in the first place. The now veteran filmmaker feels right at home here, making something in a genre he is clearly passionate about. Reportedly, there is a prequel film ""Army Of Thieves"" and an animated series ""Army Of The Dead: Lost Vegas"" in development that expands on the original story. This likely means that a new zombie franchise has just begun so let's hope for the best that the creators know what they are doing.I rate it 7/10.",Army of the Dead
82,stevelomas-69401,Give this film an award for the most clichés in one film.,6,23 May 2021,"Alternating between sillyness, derivative cliché and internal inconsistency this film is an example of the power of a trailer to sucker you in. It's spectacular brainless high octane fun that collapses under the weight of poor story telling.",Army of the Dead
83,cardsrock,Lack of logic really kills this movie,5,30 May 2021,"The baffling stupidity of the writing and characters makes it hard to really enjoy this film. I tend to at least somewhat enjoy most of Snyder's movies, but this was a chore. The daughter might be the dumbest, most annoying character in recent cinema. There are so many illogical things that happen here and just script-breaking plot holes that make the entire movie unnecessary. The premise is terrific, but is just so poorly executed.The action is mostly enjoyable and Bautista is great, but at 2.5 hours there's only so much of that to enjoy. God this movie was at least 45 minutes too long. Cutting out the unnecessary slo-mo would cut out at least 30 minutes.Snyder should really leave the writing to a professional. Maybe he should become a consultant for opening credits scenes, since they were about the only great thing here.",Army of the Dead
84,CANpatbuck3664,Has Some Fun Moments but its Weighed Down by the Running Time and a Scattershot Attention to Detail,6,22 August 2021,"Army of the Dead had a pretty polarizing reaction when it came out, I had friends that LOVED it and but despite a good overall percentage on Rotten Tomatoes, the backlash seemed just as intense. So I want to start with what I liked and like any good heist movie, a likeable and fun team of miscreants to pull of the heist is a perquisite. Some of the characters are ""types"" but I did end up liking most to almost all of them. They're definitely helped along by the cast (more on that later) but I did want them all to get out of this situation and I did have a few genuine laughs along the way.The characters need to written well but if the acting isn't there, its all for naught. Army of the Dead doesn't feature huge names but all of these people you'll recognize from other projects. Dave Bautista is the lead, it's great to see how's he grown as an actor. He's decent in this but I don't know if he's headliner material as an actor yet. He's a great guy to have in your cast as a supporting player but I just didn't buy Scott's pain or emotional tension with his daughter Kate. Ella Purnell is fine as Kate, she gets across what she needs to, she's the sympathetic member of the team and she doesn't overplay the drama with Scott too bad. Omari Hardwick, Tig Notaro and Matthias Schweighofer were pretty funny as Vanderohe, Marianne and Dieter respectively. They get to cut loose more as the secondary members of the team and I was surprised how much I laughed at Dieter, I would have hated that character in any other movie but I think Matthias sold it as well as he could have. Ana de la Reguera is also decent, she's not given much to do on her own but I thought her and Dave worked well together. Its not a mark against their performances because it was the script but Theo Rossi and Garret Dillahunt were both too easy to spot as villainous characters. In Garret's case, the movie even points it out, obvious bad guys are obvious.I was more on board with this movie than I thought I would be about a third of the way through the running time. Its not high-art or an intellectual feature film but the Zack Snyder/Micheal Bay style sensibility meshed better with the premise than I would have guessed (the heist movie genre helps, who doesn't love a colourful team of characters working together to accomplish a goal with a ticking clock?). Between the cartoon like gory zombie kills (in a very Zombieland sense) and the characters having fun, I was along for the ride. But Army of the Dead falls victim to the runtime and more and more logical inconsistencies kept popping up towards the end. 2.5 hours is just way too long and its almost like the movie cops to it when you realize it as well. The deadline for our characters just jumps ahead out of nowhere and its like the movie's engine had shut off from inactivity and they're trying to jump it back to life. The mission also seemed to be going pretty well for our characters and then just out of the blue, its doomed to failure. Now, that's a normal change in the narrative but it was just so out of left field in this. I also realize the fallacy of pointing out plot holes and missteps in a zombie movie, all this type of movie needs to do is set up its own internal logic and follow it, you just have to go along for the ride. But there were still a couple of moments that had me shaking my head and I couldn't help but be disappointed.I ended up in the middle on Army of the Dead. Zack Snyder is talented but he can't escape his worse impulses as both a writer and a director. I've seen much worse from him and to his credit, its shot pretty well (like Robert Rodriguez, his true talent might be cinematography). This movie wastes a decent concept by being too bloated, too self indulgent and glossing over some things they shouldn't. I also skipped over the plot elements involving the zombie kingdom and the conflict with the king and queen which is a whole other mishmash of okay ideas undone by inconsistencies and a lack of development. If it was 30-45 minutes shorter, I might still recommend it. But at this length and with these flaws, only if you're dying for a new take on the zombie genre or loved Snyder's previous work (to be fair, his cut of Justice League was better). Otherwise, I'd just let this one pass.",Army of the Dead

86,ronakkotian,Boring and illogical with poorly developed characters,3,23 May 2021,"I'm not a fan of Zack Snyder's DC films but I do like his Dawn of the Dead remake so it's nice to see him returning to the genre. Unfortunately, his return is very messy.Army of the Dead follows a group of mercenaries that attempt to pull off a heist worth $200 million in the midst of a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas.Zack Snyder makes his return into the zombie genre with Army of The Dead. The idea of this film sounded interesting and different from what we normally get in zombie movies but the execution is pretty bad. The opening credits sequence was one of the best parts of the film. It was bloody, gory and a lot of fun to watch. However, it got really dull really quick. What this film really lacks is character development. I couldn't bring myself to care about anyone in this film. Snyder attempts to flesh out the relationship between Dave Bautista and his daughter but it wasn't enough. Every other supporting character is given little to no development so I was left with no emotional impact whenever they were in danger. The film is also 2 hours 30 minutes long which is another issue. For a story like this, it didn't need to be this long which is why Army of the Dead dragged in many places for me. The second act was so boring and I found myself losing interest really quickly. Combining that with poorly developed characters made it a slog to sit through.The look of the zombies themselves were decent. I liked the makeup and the different types of zombies Snyder introduces throughout. The decimated look of Las Vegas was visually striking and some of the special effects looked good even though towards the end they started to go down in quality. An aspect which constantly bugged me was the cinematography. Zack Snyder did the cinematography himself and decided to shoot many scenes with shallow focus. It looked awful and was a constant distraction. There were times where I would simply focus on that alone rather than what was going on in the scene. There were also a handful of stupid moments that made no sense. The ending in particular is really illogical. The performances weren't that bad. I thought Dave Bautista did a decent job as well as the supporting cast.Zack Snyder fails to impress me once again with Army of the Dead.

89,trinaboice,Over-the-top blood bath,7,20 May 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Zack Snyder has created an incredibly gory zombie movie that simply crosses the line. Following a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, a group of mercenaries takes the ultimate gamble, venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted. Zack Snyder's first zombie apocalypse movie was Dawn of the Dead in 2004, which was his directorial debut. This is not a sequel or related to that movie. This is his first digitally shot feature film.I was originally excited to see this movie because I thought he did such a great job on his recent Director's Cut of Justice League, but within mere minutes of watching the prologue of ARMY OF THE DEAD, I was disappointed by the extreme gore and disgusting content. I read that he had actually cut some scenes out of the movie that he thought crossed the line. I thought he crossed the line MANY times in this blood bath of a movie. I recognize that there will be many people who think this film is awesome, but it's definitely not going to be everyone's cup of tea.THINGS I LIKED:
Really great camera work. Zack Snyder worked as the cinematographer, director, and even helped with the screenplay.I've liked Dave Bautista ever since I saw him in the first Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical) In this film, he fights zombies, but he also spends a lot of time having sappy conversations with people.The cast includes Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Theo Rossi, Matthias Schweighofer, Nora Arnezeder, Hiroyuki Sanada, Garret Dillahunt, and Tig Notaro, plus many more.Chris D'Elia filmed his role in the movie but when stories broke about his illegal sexual pursuits with underage girls, Zack Snyder yanked him from the movie and replaced him with comedian Tig Notario who was filmed alone on a green screen and inserted into the scenes later in post-production editing. Tig did a great job and so did the editing crew to make those inserts look seamless.The movie was actually filmed in the former Atlantic Club Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, not Las Vegas. Because the hotel had been closed since 2014, they had to bring in dozens of air conditioning units for the crew.Fun fact: A real tiger was used for some of the shots of a zombie tiger. They put makeup on it and had a trainer near it at all times. They also used some computer-generated clips that were inspired by the Netflix documentary series TIGER KING that came out right after the pandemic began in 2020.Good, creepy sound effects and some really good visual effects.Lots and lots of action.There is an attempt at humor. Some of it works, but not all of it lands.You never know what Zack Snyder is going to do with characters. He doesn't seem to care about who lives or dies because he loves a great shock.Great song choices and musical score by Junkie XL.There are some memorable moments that people will be sure to keep talking about.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The story about the queen zombie is ridiculous. It also makes no sense that some of the zombies have feelings and cognitive thinking skills, plus there are plenty of other elements that make no logical sense according to the film's own zombie rules. Zack Snyder tries to create a new kind of zombie kingdom.Topless women zombies
Sometimes the zombies have superhero powers and other times they walk really slowly like we're used to seeing zombies do.Most of the zombies just look like actors in costume and makeup.The movie could have easily been shortened.TIPS FOR PARENTS: This is NOT appropriate for children!SUPER violent and gory
Some inappropriate sexual content
You see a fiery car accident with fatalities
Profanity, crude language, and F-bombs
Spanish is spoken with English subtitles
Lots of destruction.Thieves are glorified.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",Army of the Dead
90,Aylmer,"So very, very tired...",4,12 August 2021,"Back in 2000, it seemed like the zombie genre was desperately in need of revival after a long absence from the screen. After DEAD ALIVE there really wasn't a quality zombie movie up until 28 DAYS LATER, after which there was a veritable explosion of zombie movies including Snyder's breakout hit, the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD. Here he returns to (very) familiar territory but serves up a couple neat things like a zombie tiger, reproducing zombies, and a zombie clever enough to know that only head-shots are fatal and act accordingly.Other than that, this film feels like it's running on fumes throughout. It's better than WORLD WAR Z but suffers from a lot of the same issues. Characters behave idiotically, zombies behave with inconsistent intelligence and ill-defined rules for the universe, and the neat ideas end up being underused. The sets and effects are top notch but it's all largely obscured by the ugly photography with a lot of distracting super-shallow depth of field like that of a first year photography student.All this would be forgivable had this film contained any interesting or likeable characters. There's very little twist on who is good, who is going to survive, etc. That isn't telegraphed from the start. I suppose you could label the lack of any twists a twist in itself, as I was expecting the film to be a lot more surprising than what I ended up getting. It almost felt like a parody at times but by the end felt more like another tired attempt to set up an extended universe populated by plenty of similarly uninspired sequels.Most egregiously, the main character's useless daughter hangs around throughout and wears off her welcome within 3 minutes. The film frequently ceases any sense of urgency and action to delve into some painfully uninteresting canned drama between her and her father which could all be edited out. I could also have done without the on-the-nose moralizing about a few of the more reprehensible characters just so that their obvious deaths would be more cathartic when extended. All in all, it felt like a music video rehashing of ALIENS and even features a few of the same lines of dialog.",Army of the Dead

The plot is functional and has just enough variety in its content to make it interesting. There's violence, gore, action, comedy, a varied and likeable cast, some Vegas references and a different take on the zombie threat, but there should have been more focus on one aspect (or just more of everything) to make it stand out. There's a little bit of horror and tension and it has some style to it but again, this is mostly lacking. The characters are ultimately forgettable and the hinted at sub plots don't go anywhere.",Army of the Dead
93,destroyerwod,"Typical Zack Snyder ... Some cool stuff, but could had been so much better.",6,23 May 2021,"When it comes to Zack Snyder one of the feeling i have with his movies is that there are usually visually beautifull, very stylish, but the substance usually lack. Sucker Punch is probably the best exemple, its extremely beautifull and stylish but the story really didn't interested me.Army of the Dead was looking promising, i really enjoy Dave Bautista in movies, i like zombie movies, it looked like one of those super fun movies, and with Netflix backing it with a decent budget, i knew it could be something very good. But turn out that if there is some amazing visuals and cool sequences when it comes to directing and all, the story and especially the characters are REALLY the weakest point.As Angry Joe said in his review, Zack should had handle the script to a ""script doctor"" because it has so much problem and there is characters and subplots i would have cut entirely. Another issue with Zack Snyder is for some reason his movies need to be way too long. Yes Justice League needed it because it had a lot to introduce and all, but Army of the Dead should had been litteraly 30 to 40 minutes shorter.Overall i had a decent time with the movie, i enjoyed it, but its too easy to spot its problems and feel it could had been a cult classic if handled better in term of story/screenplay. Its definately worth a watch but due to the big runtime and all, i don't think ill rewatch it anytime soon.",Army of the Dead

I think you might find this movie a little bit tiresome, very very over-the-top, very very drawn-out, not funny and just plain old silly.This is cinema that is made to appear to be for adults but the real audience is between 8 and 15. Anyone over 15 who enjoys this film is the kind of person who's going to wait on line for two hours to get onto one of the Disneyland rides during peak hour.Save your time, put more value on your life and find something worthwhile to pursue.

95,danielmanson,Just one big waste of time,4,29 May 2021,"I don't like adding spoilers, but I feel this can't really be done without. But to sum up, this film is just a giant waste of time.It starts well enough, you get introduced to the characters and the plot and the moment zombies get introduced it all goes downhill and worse and worse. The biggest issue is the character development. The film has a good few main characters to get stuck in and yet no detail on any of them!! Not even joking, the film has ended and I can't even remember the names of half of them. You don't see some of them for ages and you forget they exist. They are part of the main heist squad how is this a thing?This leads to the first spoiler. Why have a film to simply kill everyone off? You get introduced to the plot, they do a heist in the middle of this zombie wasteland. How it ends is they all basically die and come out of it with no money. What's the point? Why sit through 2.5 hours for ultimately nothing. You get no satisfaction from the characters and by the end you just don't give a toss what happens anymore. Waste of time. I honestly just can't fathom why anyone thinks it's a good idea to essentially have absolutely no ending to a film. Especially a 2.5 hour one!Another issue is the daughter character. And to be very blunt, she has got to be one of the most annoying characters I've seen. She gets everyone in awkward situations and is just generally extremely unlikeable.Weird plot encounter: She decided to go in the thick of it in order to save some woman (who by the way has about 6 seconds of screen time and we don't know who it is, why she saving her? Why is she so forceful about it?) and guess what? She dies along with the rest. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILM?????Honestly, you are sat in bewilderment by how daft the final half an hour of the film is. The film has been finished for half an hour now and I'm seething still. I've given it a 4/10 because it's fun in parts, there's some good camera shots and some great action scenes. But that's about it. I could honestly go on and on about the stupidity of how the film unfolded and nitpick further about the zombies and even them being weird. But I won't drag this on longer.I do not recommend.",Army of the Dead

So, that's why I was expecting another great movie even the trailer looked pretty bad for me. But I was wrong. The movie itself is even worse than the trailer.First the script is a joke. So, many plot holes, stupid decisions by the characters and extremely dissapointed about the end. Everything is so dumb and unrealistic.Second, I am not sure why they have decided to create this kind of zombies that can think, run, ride horses or even cry. So dumb. But worse of all are the tiger-horse zombies. Are you serious?Last, the movie itself is embarrassing several times because of the dialogues and situations. Looks like it was written to entertain dumb people.So, overall a big dissapointment about this one. Even genre fans can't be happy with this movie.",Army of the Dead

101,ethanbresnett,Stop basing horror/zombie movies around stupid character choices!!!,7,23 May 2021,"I'm not a huge Snyder fan and think his films always have flashes of brilliance mixed with face palm moments, and Army of the Dead doesn't break this mould at all.There's a lot to enjoy with this movie. I love the zombie genre and Zack's take on it in this film was pretty unique and interesting. The central premise was great and put a new spin on the genre. Instead of a ragtag group of survivors doing their best to evade the undead we follow a well equipped and skilled group who know what they are doing and actively head into the lion's den, which was a fresh take that I enjoyed. His style of zombie was very well done as well, with two defined types of zombie that we encounter.The aesthetics were all pretty good, from the zombie design to the ruins of Las Vegas, everything looked cool. There were some typical Snyder directorial trademarks, as well as some blurry camera work which I really wasn't on board with, but on the whole I'd say this is one of Snyder's better looking films.Then there's the main part of any zombie film, are there actually decent action scenes with the zombies? I'm glad to report Army of the Dead is full of some fantastic and gory zombie action. The opening credits are glorious and set the tone for the film in terms of the action. I would have liked a little more, and the pacing of the film was off a bit, as with most Snyder films, but the action we did get was top drawer.Unfortunately, this film fell into the trap of so many horror and zombie films. The numerous nonsensical and idiotic decisions of the characters make these films so frustrating! When there are flesh eating monsters running around you don't have to inject tension, drama, and death through moronic character decisions, there's enough inherent tension already. The result of this is that none of the emotional deaths are deserved and don't carry the impact that was intended, because they are so avoidable. You just end up mad at the character that caused the death. As a result the ending fell flat because it was very avoidable and frustrating.A good film there's no doubt about it, and it's good to see Zack returning to the zombie genre with a solid film, but it couldn't escape the usual genre pitfalls and was pretty frustrating in parts. An enjoyable and cool film though.",Army of the Dead
102,theknownames,Where had all the zombies gone ?,7,26 May 2021,"A brave venture for any team to give us a zombie apocalypse during our own pandemic. First zombie movie during an otherwise dry spell .The opening was excellent as it let us know to loose our expectations, that this ride should be a bit different.All made sense when i realized who directed it and that it's meant to be a summer blockbuster.The choices are understandable now ( including character development and even the color palette ) this would most certainly need to be accessible to theater goers , it's lighter in story heavy on action for summer fun . It's not what true fans of the undead would go for on a Thursday. As it lacked all of the human connections and elements that make them compelling in the first place .I would go so far as to say it exploits the genre.If you like zombie adventure this isn't a total bust . Its not like the good old days or even zombie nuevo, its just a couple of hours to kick back and expand ( if only to appreciate black summer more) You might not be too disappointed it's meant ad pure entertainment.",Army of the Dead

105,nikola17,it's just fun dumb time waster film but it has it's issues,6,12 June 2021,"Imagine Expendables mixed with Dawn of the Dead in a heist film style of zombie apocalypse group of Mercenaries going to Las Vegas for Heist. Sounds like great idea with cast that I luv is Dave Bautista I always loved Bautista I always have back in WWE days in his prime and him in MMA as well him in movies witch I loved most of his direct to DVD films like House of Rising Sun, Wrong Side of Town, The Scorpion King 3, Guardians of Galaxy, Hotel Artemis, Final Score, Stuber and many of other films he did but with this film I have been waiting for 2 years since 2019 I have applied extra for this movie but sadly I haven't got applied. But I was soo hyped for this movie a lot I always have searched up for this when will it come out and trailer as well but then about time when movie got released about time I saw it last night it was fun film I enjoyed it the cinematography, cast worked very well expect I didn't like Raúl Castillo in film I thought he was terrible in movie, his acting is soo bad they should hired other actor I can see anyone playing his role anyMexican actor can play his role I liked Omari Hardwick known for his main role TV series Power James ''GHOST'' Saint Patrick did well in film I don't know if you didn't notice Ana de la Reguera from power as well are both in this movie, Theo Rossi known for Sons of Anarchy as Juice is in this movie but his role is wasted completely thrown out I really loved Samantha Win character sadly he role didn't last long her character was bad ass loved her role wished she kicked more ass. Hiroyuki Sanada known for Mortal Kombat reboot as Scorpion, Wolverine, Sunshine, Twilight Samurai is in this film as well you get few big names but not everyone you not know Tig Notaro who replaced Chris D Ella in film they had to use a lot of CGI to cover him up to her witch it looked very well CGI, I will be curious of how much money did that make. I would say Army of Dead is better movie then to Dawn of Dead remake I didn't hate Dawn of Dead remake but at least this movie at least as tons of crazy action, tons of crazy gore, tons of crazy action if you get bored on weekend this is your ticket but their are things you may not expect when you watch film and yes I have to spoil this movie because if you were waiting for this movie, you are soo curious to see it well just to be clear things in movie that you will expect will happen and other things may change the way you don't how it turn in moviestory plot is very simple Following a zombie outbreak Scott Ward (Dave Baustista) living in a hidden area with survivors including his daughter Kate Ward (Ella Purnell) witch I thought she was annoying but sametime she is pretty as well, they live in a quarantine camp Scott works at Diner a Casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) hires Scott Ward and a group of Mercenaries gives them a job to steal $200 million from his casino vault before the military destroys the city with a tactical nuclear strike. I don't know why do Mercenaries like Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick), Maria Cruz (Ana de la Reguera), Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer), Lilly (Nora Arnezeder), Martin (Garret Dillahunt), Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro), Mikey Guzman (Raúl Castillo), Chambers (Samantha wins) that's your army agreed to do heist to steal $200 million dollars look I understand it's money but your in a zombie apocalypse well their is jobs but your not getting paid to do anything because world isdestroy its full of zombies walking around earth, use money for what just to have it their??? To buy what?? Theirs nothing to buy unless it's something worth buying but what is their to buy earth is destroyed. Anyway Mercenaries accepted job because it's money worth about $200 million they go outside of city to go Las Vegas to do their Heist one of characters gets killed one by one other character Chambers (Samantha Wins) didn't last long in movie sadly I wish it was someone dies first instered of her. Her character was badass she I wanted to know more about her entire film is just Mercenaries running shooting zombies, you have 2 main villain zombies 2 Alpha's one is woman and other is man most powerful zombies rest is just army of zombies their army vs Soldiers. I thought I had tons of fun with rest of movie having Mercenary's running around, Dave Baustista going around shooting zombies, action was very well made entire film, but in sametime I thought their was most silly scene in movie is when Scott close relationship Maria Cruz I like scenes of them2 I was hoping for them to be threw entire movie but sadly she gets killed off in a stupid way she was carrying gun zombie comes out of elevator twists her neck around I am like??? You got gun with you why are you soo shocked about yes it's zombie shoot it!!! Jeez most stupidest scene ever. I loved how Bautista gets in full rage slamming killing zombies stabbing them in necks ripping them apart it looked sick. Threw out entire it kick ass then when you get to end of film it's cliffhanger leaves like this Baustista character Scott Ward gets bitten but main villain zombie Alpha Male fighting in helicopter I like that scene just like in Rambo II where Stallone fights with big Russian guy in Helicopter looked sick and fun in a final showdown. Then he gets bitten he kills zombie I am like isn't Katie gonna do anything to help her father no she watch's it just like if she is enjoying WWE seeing zombie and Bautista fighting each other. So end of movie everyone dies every character that you love will die and Bautista that turns into zombie and he dies witch your lead character dies that sucks I hated that bit of movie, and Katie Ward is only survivor in movie, then Omari Hardwick is survived for some reason he walks with money travels to airport buys private jet I don't know why and where was he planning to go?? To New York to buy his club back called Truth like in power, he is alive but later he will turn into zombie. That's your movie guys end of movie where Dave Bautista aka our lead character gets killed by his daughter witch it is sad and it sucks because I wanted just to be him and his daughter and his close friend Mariayou think at end oh Dave character will live but movie leaves you with disappointing ending at end of day ending was just silly and dumb in Dawn of Dead remake at least has ending where you do you think characters survived or not leaving fate unknown but like this ending just boring idea that killed movie thanks Zack Snyder even he doesn't care about his fans why should I care about this movie a lot I enjoyed for dumb time waster just see Dave as lead kicking ass he did similar movie like this but it wasn't zombies it was war and war on politics that was called Bushwick similar ending like this film. I don't know how in earth how Zack Snyder agreed to this ending, I don't know how in earth he writes his movies he made Dawn of Dead remake great movie but he f*cked up ending of this movie even worse, now it made me think wish if Bautista was in Suicide Squad 2 as Peacekeeper but John Cena toke that role and Dave dropped out for Army of Dead witch I don't know why but it's silly ending that will either make you Disappointed because every character makes at least one dumb decisions, Zack Synder I don't know how you toke this film seriously I rather have other director to make this movie, this film went on series then it turns out to be joke at end if your soo hyped for this movie like me you will be maybe disappointed that's why I written this long as review because I had to honest I can't love a movie where theirs some missing few screws I enjoyed film the idea, cast, Bautista killing zombies, fun ride i had but ending is problem that your gonna have that's why I gave it a 6.10 give it a look and decide that you like it or not that's all I can write.",Army of the Dead
106,stevenrotherforth,Army of the out of focus dead!,6,27 May 2021,"Army Of The DeadMovie 6/10Zach Snyder is having somewhat of a bumper year. What with redeeming the terribly average
'Justice League' with his very own cut of the movie and now this.'Army Of The Dead' comes to Netflix in glorious Dolby Vision. Sadly it's more style over substance. An overly long zombie flick that could possibly play as a sequel to Snyder's 2004 'Dawn Of The Dead'. Not nearly as good as that movie, this latest offering does offer some fun but it takes too long to get there and outstays its welcome in the process. This movie is an amalgamation of better films such as Aliens, Escape From New York and any other Zombie movie made in the last thirty years or so. What is rather clever is mixing the Heist genre with the Zombie genre but the film lacks any tension.Dave Bautista is the movies saving grace proving that he can carry a big budget blockbuster all by himself. The supporting cast is good too but it is the distinctly average script and execution that lets the whole production down.The plot involves a Safe containing lots and lots of cash in the middle of apocalyptic Las Vegas. Overrun with Zombies a team are tasked to go in and retrieve the cash. Why on Earth the owner of the money (Hiroyuki Sanada) who hires the team doesn't just give them the code for the Safe is a little puzzling.'Army Of The Dead' is a huge disappointment of a movie. The trailer looked fantastic. The thought of Zach Snyder returning to the Zombie genre is exciting. The final product is a forgettable experience.Picture quality 8/10As aforementioned Netflix present 'Army Of The Dead' in fabulous Dolby Vision where available.The movie was shot in 8K with a 4K Digital Intermediate and certain scenes do look spectacular. If you have the Netflix UHD package and a fast enough internet connection then you will be able to take advantage of the 4K grain free image. Close up shots offer razor sharp detail and the super resolution does show up some poor make up and prosthetic effects.Snyder opted to use a camera with a ridiculously shallow focus. Anything in the mid to background is a complete blur. I imagine that this was down to artistic intent but it was completely jarring and often took me out of the movie. Dolby Vision offers some wonderful specular highlights. A sunset at the end of the movie was rather impressive. Picture quality is inconsistent but some scenes can be considered as demo worthy. Especially considering that this is streaming content.Sound Quality 8/10Sound quality follows suit with a decent enough Dolby Atmos sound mix. Sadly there's nothing much going on in the height channels. They offer ambiance and musical score but hardly any discreet effects. LFE or bass to non Home theatre nerds is ok. Gunshots and explosions are served adequately enough but the mix is hardly dynamic. Rear Surround sound effects do enough to immerse and the centre channel gives clear sibilance free dialogue. I was expecting a thunderous sound mix. Compare the sound quality of this movie to Angelina Jolie's war movie 'Unbroken' which is also available on Netflix and there's no comparison. Taking into account that 'Unbroken' is only available in standard 5.1, the Atmos mix of 'Army Of The Dead' suddenly seems slightly disappointing.Final thoughts'Army Of The Dead' is nothing more than average Netflix fodder tarted up with a big budget. This could have been great. Snyder made giant leaps forward with his cut of 'The Justice League' only to take a step back with this average movie. I wanted to love this. It's the kind of movie that's usually right up my street.",Army of the Dead

But only Notaro, Bautista, and Schweighöfer were the main reasons I kept on watching. It was like the director said ""Let's make a few really likable characters and then kill them all""! So now I am left with only Kate, who was a horrible actress to begin with. Not believable and stupid, I kept wishing someone would feed her to a zombie for all the things she did in the movie. Most hated character award, goes to you Kate! Not just that, I found her meme face just to be fake in general. I am all about what is inside a person, but the director did a very good job at making me hate here for sure. Sucks to be you Kate! I wish Bautista would have made it out if only to kill Mr. Tanaka, but maybe that would have been expected. It felt like the ending was hanging, if you put that much into a movie why leave it like this? I do recommend, if you like zombie movies. I might even watch it again, just for the 3 actors that made this movie worth watching. I am definitely going to see the prequel Army of Thieves.

With realtime effects, that's scary, Having Great twists and thrills and acting. WE doesn't need another cheap Cgi filled movie with lazy 2dimensional characters gunning down cgi zombies like Its avengers endgame.What I'm saying Is that there's possible thousand ways to produce these mega expensive blockbuster movies and yet..
Directors takes the easy way and everything becomes greenscreen, fake, It doesnt have momentum, no impact or feeling to the scenes or characters. Theyre as lifeless as the zombies itself. Army of the dead Is chock full of these terrible made action scenes. The very first zombie Is a cgi hulk that comes rushing out of the box. Instantly we see these ugly ps2 videogame-like graphics of the zombie fighting.It took me right out of the movie.Why directors like Snyder are a such a beloved nerd director I just dont know. Michael bay Is my first thought watching this. Some scribbles of a plot then there's 99% Cgi to fill out the rest. This Isn't art. It's definitely not Comicart that He tries so hard to emulate. I haven't seen one single movie from the man I liked except 300. Wich was an Entertaining flick.These types of movies are now a norm.Every blockbuster, retelling, prequel and franchise looks Like Army of the dead today.Made to cash In. Not to last.All these classics In our shelves has their own Identity. But today they all share the same space.And that makes me truly sad. Because I haven't watched a good scifi or horror movie In ages.I used to love movies, before the streaming sites destroyed the artform. It's to the point that these shallow, empty brainless CGI movies are as expected like morning coffee. We allready know how lame the next Indy, terminator, starwars, horror movie will be.Army Of the dead Offers nothing new. Its just more of the worse. Bad zombie makeup, nerd cinematography that tries to hard to make It look slick and cool to the point It gets cringy.Just Think zombieland2 with more CGI.This movie Will be forgotten In a week.

A VERY simplistic script (I'd go as far as to say it is underwritten, and anyone interested in how bad it is should watch the popular ""pitch meeting"" video for it on YouTube), with small and very scarce little details that are good. Yet it isn't particularly fun, and ends up being very predictable and bland. No character or dialogue is memorable (though Nora Arnezeder as ""Lily"" stands out with her good performance). It's elevated purely by its visuals and their presentation. And I also didn't particularly like the slapped-on music moments when there is nothing going on, and how slow the movie feels a lot of the time.If you are interested in watching it, you could ""spend"" 2 hours of your time on it.** Garret Dillahunt should get an Oscar, just like Leonardi DiCrapio did, and for the same reasons.",Army of the Dead

Plus points of this film are its technical aspects in which snyder is famous for.Coming to drawbacks, the biggest minus is the daughter character who is annoying to the core and the worst part is she is the one who only survives in the end. The next minus is its runtime where the climax is dragged unnecessarily. Writing has many plotholes. Snyder must stick to directing only.

119,DeBBss,A serious disappointment from Zack Snyder,4,22 May 2021,"There are tons of issues with Army of the Dead, and most of those issues are within the screenplay. Army of the Dead has ridiculously stupid characters. There is not one smart character from the protagonists to the antagonists. For example, Tanaka really wants the zombie DNA, not the $200 million, so why not send a team to retrieve that DNA. Seriously, what's the point in sending a full team that doesn't know the true meaning of the mission. If Tanaka was really smart, he'd just hire the same team to do the real job, therefore it would be more efficient. There are tons of these issues sprinkled throughout the entire movie, and it'll just make you facepalm every time you notice it.Army of the Dead was also horribly paced. The film is just way too long for its own good. They could've cut 30 minutes from the runtime and spare us the long wait for the movie to end. The VFX was good but the visuals were trash. I hated how ultra focused it was. It's literally impossible to see any detail that's behind the characters. It's just a blurry annoying mess, and it's a terrible stylistic decision.Army of the Dead could've been a way better film. It took itself way too seriously instead of having fun. It could've been a simple movie with few plot holes, but it went a route that didn't fit the idea of the film. I'm seriously being generous by giving it a 4/10. I'm a huge fan of Zack Snyder, and this is easily his worst film; and I'm not counting Justice League (2017).",Army of the Dead

Army of the dead was decent and was a lot of fun, but it let itself down with a lot of poor creative decisions.My first few positives would be the fun opening, character introductions and fantastic humour. As well as the great cinematography, action, and gore. As well as some fun scenes. I thought the opening was a lot of fun, it threw you straight into the action, with fun action sequences, brutal kills, and fun zombie moments. It set the tone for the film up very well and didn't take itself too seriously which I loved. I also thought the character introductions were great, the film established the characters well, seeing them in action showed what kind of strengths they would have as the film developed and was a fun way to introduce them. I thought the film was very funny, it never took itself too seriously which I loved. Most of the humour and jokes landed, thanks to the fantastic and charming cast bouncing off each other excellently with brilliant chemistry. I also thought the cinematography was very strong. The scope the film managed to achieve with mostly just one set location was excellent. It was visually stunning with eye catching set locations and shots and the visual creativity with the zombies was also excellent. I also thought this film had so many fun scenes. The film worked at its best when it didn't take itself too seriously or add too much. There were scenes were the characters were really fun and the action was turned up to an eleven with the zombies and they were just fun and entertaining to watch. The action and gore were definitely some of the strongest elements of the movie. The action was over the top, entertaining and creative and always kept me engaged and thoroughly entertained. I also loved the gore, it was the top and overexaggerated but that just made the scenes even more fun and entertaining to watch, with some very gory zombie kills.My next few positives would be the setup, creature designs. Excellent Jumpscares and worldbuilding with the zombies. As well as strong female characters and some good character background and depth. I thought the set up was incredibly fun. Setting up the team and clearly setting out there motivation for the heist was great fun and intriguing. Introducing some interesting relationships and some great comedic moments with the main character Scott (Dave Bautista) offering the characters a different amount of money. I also thought the creature designs for the zombies were excellent. I really like the work they did here with the zombies. They looked scary and creative. Almost with a human like aspect to some of them which gave the film a bit of uniqueness to it. I also really liked the worldbuilding with the zombies. I loved that the zombies essentially had their own kingdom. The rules and hierarchy within the population was fascinating, I have never seen this kind of intricate character work with the zombies almost making you connect with them, I also liked the different types of zombies with the more advanced ones being really strong and much faster. I also thought the Jumpscares and building of tension was excellent. The Jumpscares were well timed, suspenseful and often took me surprise despite their occasional predictability, I also thought the film built tension well. With some excellently crafted and clever scenes involving the zombies that were dormant that had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Finally, I loved the strong female characters and the background and depth to the main character. I loved that this film had strong female characters and representation, they were of equal capability to the male characters and held their own in the action scenes showing that you can have a healthy balance of male and female characters and make it work. I also thought the characters in general were really likeable and had great chemistry with each other. Each character had their own distinct and fun personality and had a good amount of time to shine throughout the film playing there specific roles within the team very well. I also liked the character background and depth between the main character Scott and his daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) the fact that Scott had to kill his own wife due to the zombie outbreak really effected his relationship with his daughter. This was great background and paved the way for some good depth with their relationship as they slowly grew closer and opened up to each other about how they felt.My first few negatives would be the rushed character introductions, and bad creative decisions when it came to the camerawork, structure, and soundtrack. I thought that the film needed to spend more time fleshing out and developing the characters. Considering its run time, they could have easily spent longer introducing the characters and establishing that connection with them. I also thought there was some bad creative decisions across the board. There were some odd soundtrack choices, they worked for the most part. But there were particular scenes where the song felt completely out of place and didn't fit with the film whatsoever and it was very jarring. I also thought that there were some annoying and overused visual techniques with the camerawork. There were some scenes were they would blur the characters face for an extended period of time, or they would have this strange glare In the lens that was really distracting to see. Finally, I thought there was some lazy structure choices that either didn't make sense or were a missed opportunity. There were certain decisions made with the father and daughter as well as the reasoning for certain characters to join in with the heist that were either rushed or unexplored so they either felt forced or illogical.My final few positives would be the soundtrack, the connections, and links between characters. The great performances added stakes with the characters. As well as the plot twist and development to the plot. I thought the soundtrack for the most part was a lot of fun and really worked. It added humour and style to the scenes and added the extra entertainment value to the action scenes. I also really like the connections and links with all of the characters. I really liked that a lot of the characters already knew each other before the heist, so their connections were already there, and they knew how they worked. And a lot of the characters were linked with others which made recruiting them fun and more easy for the characters. I also thought the performances were great here. The whole cast did a brilliant job. This for me was Dave Bautista's strongest performance to date. He was fantastic with the action and humour as expected. But he also bought a bit of emotion to the character and it came across well and it made me connect with his character. He played a bit more of a complex and fun character and he stepped up well. I also thought the films plot twist added a great new element to the film. Having it never be about the money and be about survival was a great and fun twist. The character of Martin (Garrett Dillahunt) turning on the team despite being predictable did increase the stakes for the characters a lot as their lives were even more endangered, with the death of the Alpha Queen being a big turning point in how the plot developed and the stakes increased.Now time for my final few negatives, the twist with the character of Martin was very predictable. I didn't like the amount of character deaths. And the final act was a massive mess. I thought that despite the twist adding stakes to the plot well it wasn't well executed. It was obvious that the character of Martin was not good as soon as he first appeared. And just because the script made the audience aware of this doesn't mean it was done well if anything it just made it more predictable to figure out and wasn't structured very well into the plot. I also really didn't like the amount of characters killed. The film basically killed off the whole cast. I thought this was a poor decision and a big kick in the stomach for the audience. If a film spends over two hours developing characters and making you connect with them only for them to kill them off like they were nothing it almost made a lot of the movie pointless. Finally, my biggest issue with the film was with its final act. It felt like it was written by a completely different person. The first 2/3rds for me were fun and well written with a lot of great elements, but the final act was a mess. It was predictable, generic, and poorly structured. Falling into the genre tropes that it was mostly staying clear off, with dumb and illogical character decisions that were very frustrating to watch and a lazy set up for a sequel that I am now considerably less excited for.Overall, Army of the dead is a lot of fun and very entertaining. With some creative work with the zombies and an excellent cast. But its creative decisions hold it back from being much more than style over substance which is a shame with all the worldbuilding they set up. With a messy, formulaic, and generic final act that slipped too far from what the film was originally doing so well and therefore missed the mark in creating a fresh and creative new zombie film.Overall rating 64/100.",Army of the Dead
123,shanayneigh,Absolutely awful,1,23 May 2021,"Clocking in at just under two and a half hours, it's at least 45 minutes too long. This movie had no business being longer than 100 minutes.I absolutely love Zack Snyder's first movie, ""Dawn of the Dead"". That movie is one of those very rare instances where a remake is better than the original. The only other example I can think of is ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"".Where Dawn had a tight script, real characters and marvellous execution (the opening sequence is still a masterclass in how to establish a universe), Army is a boring, muddled mess. None - I say none - of the actors are good in this. True Snyder's form, there are plenty of homoerotic shots lingering on muscular men, at times shirtless just to be safe. The dialogue is laughable for all the wrong reasons. And the action itself is very rote. Nothing really stands out. Yawn. To think that Netflix spent 90 million on this garbage. I can't say I'm surprised, most of their original content is a dumpster fire.",Army of the Dead

126,aastikhimta,Average,5,24 June 2021,The movie was fun until first half. First of all the plot was average or you can say a little below average. The actions scenes were also not that good. Ending was okay too. Could've been alot better. Disappointed by Snyder!,Army of the Dead
127,Brooklynsmagicmike,This movie was a major letdown.,4,26 May 2021,I was super excited for this movie based off all the press and trailers I had saw about it. But upon conclusion I was left so dissapointed.Outside of the visuals and sound effects which I thought were fantastic. This movie had almost zero redeeming traits. The dialogue and acting were BRUTAL. I wasn't expecting oscar worthy performances in a zombie movie but they could did better job then that. The movie was also incredibly draggy. They could've shaved 30 minutes off from the film and it wouldn't changed nothing. Lastly there was plot holes galore and the action was cheesy/corny. Characters punching zombies? Really?Avoid this movie at all costs. Its not even worth a rainy day watch. I'm surprised the movie critics actually rated it high.,Army of the Dead
128,jakethesnake-42007,Entertaining for what it is but lazy writing,5,22 May 2021,It had potential but it overall fails with over the top action and special effects and lazy writing. Pointless characters and storylines that just drop. You'll yell at the screen for how dumb the characters are and you think this is stupid. There's good action parts. It's a fun movie and turn your mind off you'll enjoy most of it but bottom line it's just a lazy written movie.,Army of the Dead
129,patches89,ZACK'S ZOMBIE HEIST!!,8,1 June 2021,"Over the last few months all the talk has been about Zack Snyder's brilliant Justice League. Fast forward a few months we have his newest film drop on Netflix and of course like so many of his other films it comes with its detractors. For me, I enjoyed the whole thing with a group of soldiers hired to go into the undead stronghold of the Las Vegas strip to recover $200 million and fighting off hoards. Itd make a pretty good team based video game shooter and was a pretty solid and entertaining film with Dave Bautista leading the line, doing great once again showing not only Dwayne Johnson can leave professional wrestling and become a great action star. Dont expect a strongly written plot, with award winning acting, its exactly what it set out to be which is a fan action zombie film with jokes and gore galore.",Army of the Dead

131,EvanKevelson,On a Zack Snyder Scale and the humor of Bautista,5,26 May 2021,"The headline made this average on the Netflix original garbage collection. Definitely more entertaining, than other Snyder Dreck. The pacing and duration made what could have been fun, feel like detention. Better than that Zack Snyder's 4 hour and ten minute homage to CGI but called it Justice League, or Man of Steel, and that Batman vs Superman garbage. But very similar in the CGI overkill, loud, bombastic with cheesy poorly executed sub plot points.There was one time loop joke that woke me up but it was just the one joke upon entry to the casino and finding corpses eerily similarly dressed than the heist squad.Then Mr Snyder has to divert around the fun simple heist in the Zombie Kingdom into Alpha Zombies and a character beheading the Queen on top of that making the Zombie Queen pregnant....
I can name 5 sci-fi films that directly were ripped off, let alone the Zombie overkill.Just pointlessly dragged out...truly utterly painfully long. And then the tone of the film just goes 180 after 1 hour and 45 minutes....leaving you with a painful poorly acted over dramatized final 45 for a ZOMBIE FILM....like is Zack trying to make me cry...or explore what is humanity? If he is he should stop...because he's not effective at it.Not as entertaining as 300 though Zacky....",Army of the Dead

I liked the characters but the daughter Kate and her friend Geeta were so annoying, I would have left them behind. Kate gets to live and everyone else died?? Harsh.Anyways I've seen some bad reviews on here which are even more harsh. I don't even like zombie films but I thought this was good. It doesn't need to be clever or have depth...its a zombie movie. It is what it is.",Army of the Dead

136,thenolanfan,Review - Army of the Dead,3,26 May 2021,"After, multiples comic book films, Zack Snyder returns to make his own story with his character. And, it proves a real disaster, not that I liked all of his comic book films in the first place.He makes an ""original"" film within the zombie genre. He forsakes a good part of Romero's style. But, it is another pair of sleeves regarding the rest of pop culture which seems to be Snyder's main source of inspiration. I believe that most will see references to Fast Five, Suicide Squad, Call of Duty, The Walking Dead. For me, it is problematic, Snyder seems to do all he can to please his fans on Reddit, Youtube, etc. To the point, that one of the characters is a YouTuber.So by attempting to create such a mediatic event just after the release of the Snyder Cut, I get the impression that Snyder lost his style. At the very least, he lost what made his film unique. Most of his others films weren't excellent. But, with The Army of the Dead, the lack of dedication to the project is so apparent. Even Dave Bautista's character, through which Snyder reflects on his grief, lacks depth.I warmly recommend that you skip this film whether you are a Snyder fan or not. You are surely going to be disappointed.",Army of the Dead
137,MandalBros-5,"NOTHING New, Only VIOLENCE.",4,21 May 2021,"First of all I don't like those zombie films where the people aren't afraid of zombies. And this film is one of them. The story is very cliché and predictable. Only new thing is that here are 2 types of zombies, one is normal & another is upgraded version and also one zombie tiger is there and that's it.Just like Peninsula, here, characters love money more than their lives. That's another negative point for me. The character of Huma Qureshi has nothing to do in the film. I didn't understand why they cast an Indian actor for that character. Comedy scenes and emotional moments didn't work. The movie is too much lengthy, so many parts could've been easily edited out.So, you can see so many negative points are there and the only positive thing is that this movie is ONLY for them who love to see VIOLENCE.Available on Netflix.© MandalBros.",Army of the Dead
138,efd-10467,Okay but goes 'flat' several times,5,23 May 2021,"As far as Zombie movies go this one is okay, high on style and ambition, with some above normal effects.A few problems, David Bautista is a terribly wooden actor, happy, sad, action, dialogue, he communicates little apart from physicality.Next was the writing/storyline, it has passages of bait which get you in but it doesn't deliver, the movie literally goes nowhere, the hero doesn't win, nor do the bad guys, the climax is very ho hum and predictable, it jumps from a modern sharp plot to a sentimental piece about dads & daughters, confusing and deflating.Another point is gore & violence, this movie has buckets of it, but in that lies the art of a zombie movie, too much and it loses effect and at times is just silly, this modern trendy take on the zombie genre is just that, silly.",Army of the Dead

But instead of writing a good story, the movie essentially relied on one character to make the stupidest decisions to provide the plot devices for the rest of the movie. At one point I did not care who lived or died.This is a lazy Sunday action flick where you turn off your brain, maybe do laundry while you are watching.

141,darkreignn,"Will most likely please Snyder fans, but may divide general audiences",6,16 May 2021,"Hot on the heels of ""Zack Snyder's Justice League,"" ""Army of the Dead"" is, no doubt, facing mounting expectations from Zack Snyder fans, both from those who simply want to support him, and those who are looking for his next masterpiece. Zack Snyder is a divisive director, one who is known for his distinct visual style, as well as his apparent weakness for storytelling; and this is by no means an insult to Mr. Snyder - I myself am a huge fan of his - I am simply stating the common consensus. So, when ""Army of the Dead"" was announced, you can believe that opinions were mixed: His detractors seemed convinced it was going to fail, while his fans were certain that the film would be his magnum opus, right next to his cut of ""Justice League."" ""Army of the Dead"" is not a failure that so many Zack Snyder haters wanted it to be, but it is neither the perfect film many of his fans desired.Following a group of mercenaries who attempt a seemingly impossible heist in the middle of a quarantined outbreak area in Las Vegas, ""Army of the Dead"" is, first and foremost, entertaining. As a fan of the way that Snyder helms his work, I very much enjoyed the high octane, gory action, the on-the-nose but incredibly fitting musical score (complete with ""Zombie"" by The Cranberries), and the slow-motion opening montage - it all screams Snyder, and if you're going to see this film, that's most likely what you want. Additionally, there is a really great comradery between the main cast, as well as a good sense of humor. Everyone brings their A-game, proving that Zack can add levity to his movies when needed. The film has a nice kind of lighthearted tone that contrasts well against the zombie carnage, ensuring that even the most jaded movie goers will have some semblance of a good time.Dave Bautista was perhaps this movie's greatest asset - turning in a surprisingly restrained and emotional performance, I was honestly shocked by how much he riveted me. Also, Nora Arnezeder was such a badass in this film; she glued me to the screen every time she was on it. She brings a tenacity that feels genuine, rather than feeling like the typical ""cool"" character. Everyone works well together, and the inevitable clashing of personalities is fun to watch, especially since it leads to a lot of shocking scenarios, which compels me to applaud Zack's gutsiness. He did not hold back here, adding in twists and turns that took me completely off guard; the sheer shock factor made me like the film even more.However, something that surprised me was how un-Snyder this film felt for the majority of the running time. Frankly, this movie looks very much like a standard film, lacking many of the distinct visual flairs that you've come to expect from Snyder. Sure, you'll get the slow-mo, and you'll get a few breathtaking vistas, but as a whole, the movie seems to lack the visual beauty that Zack usually brings to the table. That's not to say the movie looks bad, because it doesn't - it just looks, well, ordinary.Additionally, as is typical with Zack's films, ""Army of the Dead"" may have been a touch too long. Many scenes dragged for minutes, when they probably could've taken seconds. This detracts from the story as a whole, as this particular story by no means needed over two hours to tell. There is a ton of content here, with a lot of worldbuilding, but I can't help but think if many of it was cut out or trimmed down, we'd have been treated to a tighter plot. Additionally, at times I felt the editing seemed slightly off, as if individual scenes were cut to speed things up, when instead it just made things a little more confusing.That said, I did enjoy ""Army of the Dead."" As I mentioned, I'm a big fan of Zack, and I'll support him until the day I die. There is a lot to like here, and if you're a fan of Snyder, you'll probably enjoy this. However, the bloated length, quirky tone, and Snyder-isms may turn off general audiences, and I'm interested to hear what the typical moviegoer thinks. Me? I enjoyed watching this in theatres, and I'll certainly give it another go when it releases on Netflix.",Army of the Dead

Everything else here arises from that. It's not nearly as mocking and fun as Jarmusch's Dead Don't Die, but it's kind of fun. Yes, it's cheesy (Swiss kind, with a lot of - plot - holes), predictable, no acting worth mentioning and so on. Direction is pretty good, considering. One-off watch for a dull afternoon. It also seems that movie's pretensions do not reach farther than that. It's not a philosophical discussion with morals or anything alike. So, it's kind of OK. Zombies have nothing to eat here (no brains involved). And I've seen worse in the genre (and also better). Once again, a reminder: there are no zombies. It's a fantasy, people.

With the mini film that proceeds it during the opening credits, being what I would of really wanted from the movie.What we've got instead is a film where zombies have already been beaten and rounded up In what use to be Las Vegas. I was still up for this, as its a new direction I guess. But like other Zack Snyder efforts. There are about 3 movies worth of good ideas all crammed in there. Making for an overstuffed yet still pretty boring film. You think there's going to be brainy fast zombies as well as the usual slow ones, which could of been interesting. But in the end, there are just brainy boring zombies.The biggest mistake here. Is that for a movie called ""army of the dead,"" there's little in the way of zombie action. After alot of promising set up the movie only gets dumber when the action finally kicks in, and it's all topped off with one of the most rediculus and pointless endings ever.A wasted opportunity overall.

145,gabriel_sanchez,"Generic zombie flick that is more action than horror, but definitely watchable",6,10 June 2021,"Zack Snyder has definitely made a name for himself after Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). To me, I know him as the director of Dawn of the Dead (2004) and 300 (2006), which are both good films. Of course, Army of the Dead (2021) caught everyone's attention, in particular for its unusual synopsis and scenery.A group of mercs ventures into Las Vegas, now a zombie-infested quarantine zone, to pull out a big heist. To be fair, ""heist"" is not the correct term here, preferably ""rescue mission,"" but the rescuee is money. It is not like they are robbing someone. Some dude just asked if our main characters can get his money back for a price, and our main characters accepted.The overall photography is OK. It's mostly CGI, but I don't mind it. Green screen effects have given us some great scenarios, so I'm not one to complain here. And the CGI is mostly fair, so kudos.Acting is alright. I mean, disclaimer: you know what you are in for. The cast is at least recognizable, and everyone does their best on trying to act, which is mostly appreciated onscreen. But it's your macho-fest with a bunch of high testosterone people walking around. Even the nerd dude is jacked and ripped, which I think is nice, but he tends to yell a lot like a girl, which I think is dumb. The rest is a bunch of mid-oldie characters trying to act badass.Plot-wise, nothing new. I don't the plot is bad, but I don't think it is good either. The plot is just there for you and me to see. Average and predictable. The premise is not clever, which I suspect is what lead to such a generic zombie film. I love, the virus infection genre, so I'm biased here, but I'll be fair by mentioning some good and bad facts about the plot.The goods are that the film is enjoyable. Everyone is great at being a badass plank, the environment is nice, and if you are into this kind of film, you definitely will enjoy it, even though it is the same as always.The bad parts are mostly in the first 30 minutes of the film. A dumb prologue, then a very long and melodramatic opening scene. The rest of the film is, as mentioned, generic.I liked the Silent Hill-ish moment in one part of the film. Good touch.The final showdown is saddening, but well, we gotta see what we gotta see. The epilogue was definitely expected. (You think we are naive, Zack?)I would recommend this to whoever likes horror films. It is not frightening or anything, just a good time spender. Kinda like a generic action film, but with zombies. Hey, I'm up for that.",Army of the Dead
146,danybur,"Innovative, adrenaline-pumping, and visually stunning",8,23 May 2021,"SummaryIn this film (reviled by the conservative world of fans of the most conservative subgenre of terror perhaps for its virtues), Zack Snyder dares to introduce some innovations in the zombie world, avoids solemnity, includes discreet notes on the present pandemic, notes from humor, some charismatic characters and, fundamentally, it displays extraordinary action scenes, adrenaline, fast-paced and very well resolved visually and from the soundtrack, giving us 2 and a half hours of pure entertainment.Review:The city of Las Vegas has been invaded by zombies and turned by the government into a kind of ghetto. The owner of a casino hires Scott Ward, a veteran (Dave Bautista) to rescue a fortune that was locked in the safe of the same, within the city. Ward will form a small squad to carry out his mission.I am not a particular fan of zombie movies, a horror subgenre in general less innovative than vampire stories and that even makes a cult of rigidly maintaining certain premises. I think this partly explains the anger this Zack Snyder film has unleashed among conservative fans of the subgenre. The director and co-writer does not take his story too seriously, but he does introduce some innovations in the zombie world (generally chaotic and anarchic): humanization, hierarchical and social organization traits that provide some of the best and most powerful moments of the game. Film.The introduction and titles of the film act as a true and accomplished summary of how Las Vegas got there. Its status as a ghetto that has its days numbered and that is surrounded by a wall and the presence of an adjacent medical camp establishes clear connections with the current pandemic moment and the Trump wall (in the latter
case with an ironic undertone).Znyder also does not take too seriously the personal stories and the links between the members of the brigade (in charge of a cast without stars), with their pending accounts, frustrations, expectations, dark points, betrayals, disagreements and reunions. But fortunately he does not fall into parody or self-awareness. The dialogues seem to function more as plot points of rest, almost as separators, in a group dominated by very frustrated Latino and African-American members. Perhaps the best developed and integrated links to the story and with more chemistry are the one that develops between the German safe expert Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer, a find) with one of the members of the group (Omari Hardwick) and ironically another on the zombie side. Another situation, the deteriorating relationship between a father and his rebellious daughter, is already too busy.But the strong point of this film is its extraordinary action scenes, adrenaline, fast-paced and very well resolved, supported by a great soundtrack, with our antiheroes facing all kinds of zombies (some of which run very fast, unlike the traditionally hesitant) in different situations, with abundant dose of gore, in a reconstruction of a semi-destroyed Las Vegas as a mind-blowing setting. Let us bear in mind that the operation takes place before our eyes practically in real time.",Army of the Dead

148,carlos37andre,Fun and entertaining for the most part,6,31 May 2021,"I love Zack Snyder, I loved most of his films (mostly the DC based ones), and well, this movie isn't perfect, but I had a lot of fun, and I think most people that are fans of the genre will be able to watch it and enjoyed.That been said I believe that some elements prevented me to like the movie even more. First, the characters don't exactly have that much into them, under the surface, Dave Batista and his daughter are definitely the more flashed out ones, but after them, it's almost the classic ""let's give each one of the characters a 'thing' that will make them... characters"". Still, that could be better for sure, but doesn't make the movie unwatchable by any means.The run time could be a little bit shorter, I think that might take away some of the ""it's a fun movie, you can just put and enjoy"" element of it, cause, well the movie is 2h30 hours long, and that's lot. Besides that the only other point that, took me a bit out of the movie at times was the element of having some scenes almost entirely out of focus, I thought it was kind of weird that, you get it in some scenes (mainly during the first half of the movie it seems), and others are in a completely different style and feel, idk, it just took me out of the movie a bit.That been said, the movie is really fun, I love most of the cast, Batista is a pretty good lead, and has a lot of charisma, Zack always gives us great visuals for the most part (the opening scene in slow motion is pretty awesome), and well, the concept of having a close and ""trapped"" environment with zombies for years, and how that would affect the world around it in some ways is fascinating.Pretty good, with a lot of gore (if you like that kind of stuff, idk if I do that much), cool concepts, good visuals, and the care and heart Zack put in all of his movies. Worth checking out.6,5/10.",Army of the Dead
149,harrylosborne,Who wrote this rubbish?,3,6 June 2021,"""Army of the Dead'' has it all: by that, I mean absolutely every overplayed movie trope going today.Weird camera work, vomit-inducing characters, a premise with scope but no execution and a multitude of plot holes. Somehow this project was green-lit, and that is the only interesting result of this Netflix-Snyder car crash.First off - who wrote this? It reads like a child's story, a horrible mix of downright cringe dialogue and completely redundant characters. It's a mess of unbearable ""personalities"", each with their own dislikable traits, led by the ascending Dave Bautista.This man can't really act, so when he is your unironic lead, you know something isn't right. The clamour of all these people jostling for screen time is tiresome and garish - not a great start if you're appealing to the masses.What's weird is that the budget is clearly there. Netflix have thrown money at this project, with CGI and set design as good as you might see anywhere. Unfortunately, it's all for naught, since the much-hyped setting of Vegas is totally unexploited.Why use such a variable environment if none of its core elements are going into the film? Set this movie anywhere else on Earth, and nothing (bar the occasional quirkily-dressed zombie) really changes.""Army of the Dead"" can't decide what it wants to be. Is it a comedy without any laughs, or a horror-heist without any drama? Either way, this is nothing short of a total failure, both in creating a story of any merit, but also in delivering something close to a worthwhile two hours.More akin to a video game you would play and forget in a heartbeat, Snyder's latest attempt to regain some credibility is not even worth considering. Back to square one.",Army of the Dead
150,GomezAddams666,A very fun and entertaining zombie movie.,9,21 May 2021,"I myself am not a big fan of the zombie genre, but being a Zack Snyder film and starring some great performers like Dave Bautista and Ana De La Reguera, I just had to check it out.The movie is absolutely great, it doesn't take itself too serious and it is exactly what it needs to be, a very fun and entertaining movie about zombies. It doesn't have any great philosophical or existential paradigm, instead it's very violent, fast paced, filled to the brim with extreme gore and dismemberment galore, and I'm pretty sure they used more buckets of blood than all the Scream movies combined, but that is great, because this is exactly what we came to see, a suspenseful, sometimes frightening and extremely violent zombie movie.The actors do not phone it in by any stretch of the imagination, they actually render very good performances, and the film is shot beautifully by Zack Snyder, who can't help himself from using some iconic horror tropes.If you want to watch a movie with deep and meaningful existential or political agenda, this is not the film for you. But if you just want to enjoy a very well crafted amalgamation of an 80s style action movie and horror, by all means, enjoy this modern zombie classic by the ever-talented Zack Snyder.",Army of the Dead

THIS IS TOTALLY A BIG MESS.At starting, I find it interesting to see a leader of Zombie which is completely different compared to other Zombie Movies. So,It hit me badly,so began watching with a positive thinking. As the time goes, I found it more interesting when a team is hired to recover money from a zombie residence as the government going to blow that site . It seemed like a heist with proper planing, SOMETHING MIND BLOWING! However,the movie let my expectation too down with it's inappropriate zombie lifestyles. Just forget this,the director maybe tried to bring some new things into light. But, after that how the plot turns make it total mess.Dave's daughter just risked everyone's life for woman named Greeta and almost all the members are killed because of her. She even didn't save her either, her father did. Then question arises who is Greeta? We don't know! Just know she has two children, sounds funny! What's her relationship with her or any behind story? Of course not,nothing is shown.At last, is this really for money for which they are hired to? OH NO, A BIG NO. The mastermind hired them to distract zombies and get themselves killed. On the other hand, one of the member of the team is traitor who really know the motive behind and is hired to do bring out real work BRINGING ZOMBIE QUEEN'S HEAD.I still don't get, what's the mastermind is gonna do with the head.

The opening was enough for me to want to turn it off, and that was before the song and bland introduction of our terrible characters. What really sold me tho, was the ocean's esque planning. For me it just made the movie campy and cheesy. In a zombie flick that isn't a joss whedon production, I don't want to see humor. I'd like a sense of fear. After the 40 minutes I just left it on while I did other things around the house. Really don't understand why people love snyder so much. Anyone can do something in 4hrs!

Sure, there are a few jump-scares throughout this film, but the main zombies grow old and stale after a very short while.This film should have been edited.

157,anthonyjlangford,Army of the Trolls,8,31 August 2021,"What is it with all these low quality reviews from these adolescent trolls? Are they being paid by an opposing studio to trash this film? One star reviews are bogus. It's not Schindler's List. It's a zombie film. These loser haters criticize the writing yet can't even spell themselves. Nothing else to do but play with their phone and their nads while camping out at Grandma's trailer.This draws heavily on the premise of Escape from New York but it's still a fun ride. There a lot of enjoyable scenes. It's a genre piece. As long as it has some decent action then that's all that really counts. It's a movie, not a series, so the story can only go so far. It ticks all the boxes with really no surprises but it's competently directed once again by Zach. Great opening credit montage too.I liked Dieter. There always has to be a comic relief and he was quite good. He had an arc as did most characters. The gay pilot was pretty cool too. The security dude was a bit of a knob but he didn't deserve that treatment. That felt quite woke to me. All the female characters were strong and good people so yes it was quite woke in that regard. It's tedious. We get the picture. Women are strong. But do they all have to be faultless? Stop patronizing us and just get on with it.Speaking of which, the daughter was super annoying. I wanted a zombie to eat her brains out very slowly. Then spit them out in disgust. Still, she had a role to play otherwise there would be no drama. There has to be conflict. Bad decisions. Characters have to face dilemmas.There was a very obvious homage to an American Werewolf in London in the beginning. A literal scene re-creation. Unfortunately doesn't come close to the tension and horror of that masterpiece but it was certainly a respectful nod.There's a lot to enjoy about this film. It takes the zombie genre which has been done to death, excuse the pun, and adds to it by giving the zombies some extra skills and character. There are some pretty great set pieces too. It mimics a lot of 80s films, Aliens an obvious one, and that's not a bad thing.Yes it's too long. But if you leave your cinematic discerning snobbery to one side you will find a lot to enjoy. It's mere entertainment. That's all. Assault rifles and exploding heads. If you want something with some genuine character depth, go and watch Magnolia or Citizen Kane.Good music choices and great to hear Dolores in there. That version of Zombie was tastefully done.

Extremely well-choreographed action and excellent sound design and CGI make up for what the film lacks in character development.Snyder is as usual, on top of his game when it comes to stylizing even the goriest and bloodiest of scenes, bringing in elements like a full-blown zombie tiger and many other surprises to keep the audience engrossed.Bautista and Ella Purnell put in cliched but likeable performances, while everyone else including India's very own Huma Qureshi reduces to background scenery.There is no nuance or subtlety here, nor is it needed. Ruthless in its direction and unapologetically old-school, the Army of the Dead is a return to the 90s era of brainless action films.And for me, it was exactly what the doctor ordered in these turbulent times.

I mean that song went on forever, and the slow-mo mega-campy zombie stuff got old real quick. But wait! There's more. A lot more. The soundtrack nearly ruined it for me, that is, if it weren't for the other factors. Such as the drawn out scenes of zombies just sniffing and growling, the major-yawn family drama cliches, the abuse of teenage-level humor (performed by characters in their 40s/50s), and of course the scene where a young girl miraculously survives a brutal doorless-heli crash in the desert that kills 2 passengers but all she has is a forehead scratch. I can suspend disbelief only to an extent. Judging by my criticisms, you may be wondering why I've elected a 6 and not lower. Well, the CGI was in fact amazing, and I think the zombie tiger was a really cool addition, as well as other unique plot points merely hinted at subtly in the film, and by the director during interviews. But good God it was 40min too long, and bogged down by a Bible-length list of cliches.

There's no denying that some of the action is exciting, but some of it has a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay kind of feel to it, and that's not a compliment, with interruptions of various lost loves and family drama. Where Dawn of the Dead was a tight and suspenseful little with some good performances this is nearly the opposite. There is not a performance in this of note though Tig Notaro & German actor Matthias Schweighofer have some funny moments, but one of the film's problems is trying to add in too much humor. It mostly doesn't work. Still, it will mostly hold your attention and there are a few tense scenes & some mildly humorous usage of songs.

Even with dialogue and entire sequences ripped straight from ""Aliens,"" Snyder's film can't produce even an ounce of the gory thrills that Cameron delivered. The story is predictable and so uninteresting that even Snyder forgets about it from time to time so he can cram in another poorly judged needle drop. How can a heist movie with a zombie tiger be so boring?!?!And how can a movie with a $100 million budget look so ugly? Filmed with cameras he bought off eBay (true story), Snyder's soft cinematography is an absolute eyesore as you constantly strain to make out what's happening within the blurry shallowness that is the frame. I've seen clearer quality on a Fisher-Price camera.At least this movie could confirm my theory that Tig Notaro and Kate McKinnon are the same person. Honestly, this movie would have been a lot better if every character was cut out except for Tig's.With ""Army of the Dead,"" ""The Last Thing He Wanted,"" and ""The Highwaymen,"" Netflix now boasts the worst movies of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Indeed he was because this movie is so bad that hurts.For someone that was responsible to remake Dawn Of The Dead and be praised by George A. Romero himself for doing that, it was kind of natural imagine that Army Of Dead would be entertaining at least.Instead it's a movie full of bad choices. Story is awful, the number of characters is huge with no purpose, every single one of them lacks of good development and the movie leads us to nowhere because every single objective presented in the very beginning isn't completed at all, which makes entire movie has no reason at all to exist. The conflicts are dull, mainly between Scott and Kate's father/daughter confusing relationship. Kate, as any other character, is completely forgetable, but what did make her the worst one is the fact that she's not just useless, but an element that leads entire story to its dead end. Not even the true reason for her to be there was achieved at all because writers did forget to conclude it (Geeta, where are you?). Pointless.The dialogs are misplaced all the time with a writing that tries really hard to bring comic relief as an old trick to fill gaps when consistence lacks. Or bring long melodramatic moments with background music to make story longer than it could be. The world is falling apart, but they have plenty of time to discuss issues that we don't care at all while a generator must be turned on so a guy can open the safest safe on the planet using only his hearing powers.Now is the time for those ones that should be the most important characters of entire movie: the zombies.The only thing I must say about them is that I cringed myself all the time they appeared. The idea of making them a population of an intelingent kind that can communicate, have leaders and... babies (!!!). There's nothing I can think that can be worse than that. Romero did that once with Land Of The Dead, but the mess Snyder and his writers do here is far away from the acceptable.Snyder never was part of my favorite directors and I persistently watch his movies hoping for the best, but I'm always disappointed.",Army of the Dead

183,arabnikita,THIS IS A ZOMBIE MOVIE,7,24 May 2021,"Good Zombie movies are a rarity because directors often lack the creativity to keep the audience engaged with something that they haven't seen before. The reason why Army of the Dead is an refreshing watch is because Zack Snyder wasn't afraid to take risks. Essentially, this is a heist movie where a team, somewhat similar to the Italian Job, must break into a casino to steal 200 million dollars. Only problem is that the casino is managed by zombies and their management style revolves around eating everyone who enters the premises.To make things exciting, the entire Las Vegas is about to be nuked by the government to contain the outbreak so time is of the essence. While the main characters are busy getting close to the casino vault, the zombies got their own thing going on. Here, they have a societal hierarchy with specific rules established by ""smart"" zombies, they got zombie tigers and I kid you not, even a pregnant zombie. Despite the fact that most of this creativity doesn't get fully explored, it was certainly refreshing to see both sides of the conflict getting some development.Despite it's length, Army of the Dead has a well paced plot due to the diverse cast led by Bautista and well made action. At the end of the day, this is a ZOMBIE movie so there have to be annoying characters and people will make stupid choices as this is how the genre works. If you are a zombie fan, step right in but if you are looking for an intricately logical narrative then this might not be for you. The film occasionally lacks consistency in terms of the world that it has built but regardless of that, it delivers exactly what is expected from a one time watch zombie action movie.P. S.

184,stimpy_tr,Another Zombie Action from the Headshot Addict,7,8 November 2021,"First, I have to warn you that director Zack Snyder is obsessed with headshots. In his zombie movies, all characters, either men or women, are excellent shooters giving hundreds of headshots to zombies with almost no misses. If you find it exaggerated, this movie is not for you.The opening credits are awesome. A lot of effort is put for the musical action scenes summarizing the events that lead to the zombie apocalypse in Las Vegas. Here, the gory scenes are exaggerated like an exploitation film. After the opening credits, the story begins at a point where the war between the army and zombies is halted. Las Vegas is enclosed with large walls and abandoned to zombies. It is to be nuked in a few days. A team involving both men and women gathers to intrude the area and get 200 millions of dollars from a casino vault.What I don't like is that conflicts emerge among team members as soon as they infiltrate just like in La Casa de Papel. And the conflict has a feminist subtext as usual. This trend continues in a more subtle manner in the fate of characters. Otherwise, action sequences and visual effects are nice.",Army of the Dead
185,paudieconnolly,Good music and plot Idea and Visuals,6,22 May 2021,"That's were the good ends. Takes the best of what makes a classic Zombie movies done well and puts a new spin on them some amazing visuals but not the best use of the fear factor. Ordinary people in extraordinarily situations are what makes the best of zombie movies. What seen on screen from the actors is all trying to be funny don't seem to worried about the situation and none act like a real person or at least a believable person with the exception of Dave Bautista, and maybe that's down to the screen time give to each story may have worked much better with a smaller group to many characters to build.

There's not one single original thing in the concept or execution. There cast is uniformly poor, and the direction seems non-existent, producing confused, flat, emotionless performances.It opens with a scene that's so poorly written and acted that it wouldn't make the cut in a low budget weekly TV show, let alone a 'feature' film, and that sets the tone for the next two and a half hours.What plot there is drags and drags and drags on for far too long, spending over 40 minutes just introducing unappealing character that you'll uniformly hate. There's not one appealing person in this - even Dave Bautista gives such a reserved, hesitant performance that it's impossible to sympathise with him. Ella Purnell as his daughter is so actively, stubbornly idiotic that you'll want her to be devoured, and we need to address that Nora Arnezeder can't act in English.When the ""action"" does eventually get going, it's reluctant, and clumsily done with far too many close-ups and jump cuts hiding the lack of budget (and competence).You'll expect all the unexpected twists, and you'll enjoy none of it. In the end, this feels like three or four episodes of Z-Nation clumsily edited together, but with all the quirky charm and humour drained out of them, leaving a shambling, brainless, joyless husk that seems to hate itself as much as its audience.",Army of the Dead

But I simply hate when they create annoying female characters like the daughter. First of all, she's pissed off at him for being away after he offed the mother after she became a zombie.. come on.. but ok understandable her blaming him for that.But her forcing herself into the mission just because another woman ran away is simply stupid. She clearly can't protect herself but of course, she doesn't listen to reason because she's a girl an she's got giiirrrll poweeeerrr..Other thing.. isn't it kinda obvious the bodyguard was up to something from the start? Weird ting they barely blinked an eye when the first girl got cornered and died... but I love the actor.. Garret Dillahunt is awesome at playing villains.Now, let's talk about the zombies in the hallways.. what the hell? Let's take TWD for example.. they see you, they grab and bite you.. these zombies on the other hand, are like fans at Wrestlemania desperate to touch the wrestlers while cheering them.. lol.Oh come on.. the scene at the top of the building was ridiculous.. blondie could've just walked slowly towards the chooper while carrying the head and not away from it.. convenient stupidity to make batista and daughter the only survivors.. I'm not counting the pilot because she barely was shown doing anything.By the way, look at how convenient Theo Rossi the only zombie who actually tried biting the humans at first chance insteag of just gently tapping their shoulders and arms.. they all should've beaten all those times they used their arms as shields.. oh how exactly did daughter went from jut inside the vault to outside inside a car? Wat thank God plot armor saved her ass right.So i guess in the end she was the only survivor.. I mean 100% healthy.

The rest sucked.",Army of the Dead
196,TheRadiobox,A dire and untrained army,3,25 May 2021,"Army of the Dead was directed by Zack Snyder, written by Snyder, Joby Harold, and Shay Hatten, and stars Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Garret Dillahunt, Matthias Schweighofer, Tig Notaro, Raul Castillo, and Nora Arnezeder. It's about a ragtag group of people who take a deal from a millionaire to return to a zombified Las Vegas to score $200 million.The Plot: It seems as though Snyder and his co-writers watched whichever Fast and Furious movie had the crew driving with a safe attached to the back of a truck through a city and said ""Yes. Now let's add zombies."" and throttled everything else. Scott (Bautista) is propositioned by millionaire Tanaka to return to a cordoned-off Vegas to break into a vault for a fortune before the whole city is nuked. He gathers a team which includes Maria (Reguera), Vanderohe (Hardwick), Dieter (Schweighofer), Peters (Notaro), Mikey (Castillo), and Lilly (Arnezeder); Scott's daughter Kate (Purnell) demands to join. She, along with Tanaka's man Martin (Dillahunt) round out the crew. Snyder gets down to business quickly, establishing the plan and the crew hastily to get to the heist. From that point on the movie becomes a generic action movie with zombie fodder and some worldbuilding on the side. Plenty of questions go unasked or unanswered regarding the mission, both before and during. While Snyder does add some life via a lead zombie and a hierarchy, the story lifts so much from Aliens and the ""Fast"" franchise that it's groan worthy.The Characters: Attempts are made to create an emotional center with Scott and Kate's relationship. Scott is the reluctant hero who had to make a tough call in killing his infected wife to save his daughter; becoming something of a hero in the process of their own escape from the initial outbreak. It costs him his future and his daughter's love. If that sounds good it's because I told it that way, in the movie Kate only makes stupid decisions that cost more lives while still resenting her father until the very end. The few scenes between the pair make Kate despicable and Scott a sad sight. The rest are broad sketches that can be simplified in one word: Vanderohe = hardened, Maria = bubbly. Dieter = eccentric. Martin = Burke from Aliens. It's rough and uninvolving but the characters need to exist to form a cohesive team. Additionally, the opening credits lazily establish Scott's background literally by showing a picture. Cardboard cutouts would've made better protagonists. Conversely, the lead zombies are given a family element and repeatedly receive moments where they act like a real couple. There's more to the zombies than the humans. Why.The Action: With the movie working to add some variance to the zombies with the inclusion of a ""king"" and ""queen"" for lack of a better word, and different types of zombies like the shamblers (Romero-esq zombies), runners (Boyle-esq infected), and some kind of zombie baby thing (zombaby?); it would be reasonable to assume that the action scenes involving them would be something different. It was not reasonable. When Tanaka discusses the plan with the crew before they execute it, there's a visual showcase of what it may look like, and that is the peak of the action even though it doesn't technically happen. Action beats in reality consist of the characters stabbing a few heads and sneaking by the rest. Two sequences are worth noting and both involve Scott brawling with zombies. Army of the Dead needed more of that and less of the zombies being non threats, actively avoiding biting the humans to attempt to heighten the drama.The Technics: It's a real mixed bag when it comes to the more mechanical aspects of the movie. Being a zombie movie, there's gore, plenty of it. It's really gruesome and gross and fun to look at but the rest of the effects look awful. Valentine (the zombified white tiger) looks like an asset ripped from a PS2 game, the explosions look mediocre at best, and Peters' character was blatantly comped in after filming. Pacing is equally disastrous, with the first act being an agreeable good time with some lighthearted jaunt, but the middle hour is just the characters sitting in the casino waiting for the vault to be opened. Army of the Dead never picks up from the slump it puts itself in. Interestingly, Snyder did his own cinematography and it shows since there's a distortion to the depth of field throughout most of the runtime that appears like everything I see when I take off my glasses. It's irritating. The gore is the saving grace, just barely.Zack Snyder's return to undead action comes off as a rushed and poorly thought-out concept stretched to fill nearly 250 minutes at the cost of logic, likeable characters, and fun. There's good gore and some good performances from Bautista and Dillahunt but Army of the Dead is only something to watch if a gamble goes bad.30/100.",Army of the Dead

199,hoernkeem,"Army of the Dead (2021, Zack Snyder) Snyder's zombie mashup film borrows from a lot and has its moments but is a bit of a letdown",6,6 July 2021,"From Zack Snyder of 'Justice League' fame or infamy, as the case may be, comes this action heist zombie hybrid film. If you discount the 'Snyder Cut' of 'Justice League' the 2017 theatrical version of that film was the last directorial output by Snyder. Snyder's directorial debut was 2004's very well done 'Dawn of the Dead'. He certainly has a signature style and this film allows him to flex his very stylized, vibrant visual flair. This film was kicked around for a few years before finally being acquired by Netflix. It stars Dave Bautista amidst a broad ensemble cast with only a few recognizable faces.In a quick opening a military convoy from Area 51 has an accident releasing a mysterious payload which turns out to be a zombie. The crash occurred just outside Las Vegas and the zombie turns its sights on sin city. Zombies corrupt Vegas. Some get out. There is a war of sorts that ensues with ""troops"" on the ground attempting to evacuate uninfected. Eventually the city is walled off utilizing containers and as we pick up the government has decided to end the zombie threat with a nuclear strike in a few days time. Bautista plays Scott Ward who got out and led an effective zombie killing team and now flips burgers at a diner. He is approached by a casino bigwig who wants him to enter zombie infested Vegas and retrieve a large quantity of money from his vault before the nuke goes off. Bautista reassembles his old team plus a few new members for the endeavor including casino guy's henchman, an internet zombie killing sensation, a German safecracker, and even his own daughter winds up on the escapade. They enter through a secret way with the help of a coyote and the balance of the movie is spent getting to the vault and then trying to escape. As you would expect a lot of bloody gruesome deaths, both human and zombies, ensue and all that gore is about the best thing in the movie. You know when all is said and done only one or two will be left alive and the only question is who will be left standing. I was not surprised Bautista's daughter wound up up surviving, but I was surprised that they did away with Bautista himself and instead used another character to potentially perpetuate a sequel because clearly this is the type of film that will leave a dangling character such that more zombies and death and mayhem can ensue in a subsequent film.This movie was a crazy, messy amalgamation of numerous other genre films. Take one part 'Zombieland' and mix with one part 'Suicide Squad' and toss in some 'Ocean's Eleven' among others and you get in the wheelhouse of what this film was trying to be. This film was fun if a bit long. I think it suffers a bit from having a lackluster cast, and Bautista for all his intimidating muscled bulk is not a quality actor. He is never going to be able to go the r0ute of Dwayne Johnson because he lacks the acting skill to pull off what the Rock is cooking. He can do niche roles and roles that are less reliant on dialogue and more reliant on his brute force and presence. This walks that line but skews more toward the actiony side which works for him and it only becomes problematic when he tries to deliver any meaningful dialogue. Beyond that the film's premise, while outlandish, was fine. I liked how they altered the zombie factor with the ""alphas"" which were zombies that were actually thinking and organized although the idea that these zombies would somehow remain a mystery seems a bit farfetched even in a very farfetched movie. This film, though, isn't very interested in explanations. It wanted a premise to a get a team into a locked down zombie area and here it is. Now let's have a thin plot and a bunch of killing and gore. Check and double check.I think it is reasonable to expect a bit more from Snyder especially considering how good his 'Dawn of the Dead' was, but really this movie I think hit the mark it was trying to hit. This certainly put out some interesting ideas (I'm looking at you zombie fetus) even if it sort of abandoned everything due to the nuclear strike that occurred. The plot and script certainly could have been tightened up as well as bringing the bloated running time down a bit. 'Army of the Dead' is just trying to do to much and be too many things and in a genre like this sometimes less is more. So while I was overall hoping for better this is basically right where I expected this film to be which is average to slightly better than average overall, but also a bit of a disappointment considering Snyder is capable of much better.Eric's Grade: C+",Army of the Dead

This isn't one of those films.It's just a loud and dumb film, both from a narrative perspective, character actions, just everything.Generally Dave Bautista does well for what this film is, he is great for action scenes, but he's no leading man. Someone ""else"" should have been picked for this ""emotional center"" role.I'm also a fan of Snyder's ""montage openings"", usually, but I don't think it worked in this film. Snyder also takes a ""anyone is at risk"" approach to this film, which is fine, but not nearly as unique to the genre as he probably thinks he's being. No different than a random season 4 episode of TWD.Mostly though, my biggest complaint with this film was the length. Just. Too. Long. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was ""long"" for a zombie film, but it didn't feel it, not nearly so much as this one feels it's length. An hour into it I swore it was nearly over, but nope, a long way to go still.And the endings, why was there a need for multiple endings that each got progressively less epic as they went on?

There really isn't anything terrible that this film does but there isn't anything great either besides Dave Bautista's performance which I was really surprised it. Bautista made his very thin character much more enjoyable than all the others and I'm excited that he's trying to take on more dramatic roles now. All of the other performances are perfectly fine however I found the German character to be very annoying sometimes. The script isn't great but it's not bad either. All of the moral issues about free thinking and other species is incredibly on the nose and not subtle in any way, shape or form. The dialogue feels very wonky sometimes but it's better than Batman v Superman's dialogue. The cinematography is good at points but Snyder does not know how to use a tripod. It works pretty well for the action actually but not for dialogue scenes. Some of the shots are honestly beautiful but the shaky cam diminishes it. The story is passable but incredibly generic which is frustrating because this idea is fun but I wish they had done more with it. However, the action is pretty fun. It doesn't feel generic and is just a ton of fun. This is where the shaky cam works well. The visual effects at points are really bad especially towards the end with a helicopter flying. Another issue I had was the runtime and length of scenes. One example being the prologue. It's WAY too long. It gets what it needs to get done but keeps on going when it probably shouldn't plus the 2 and a half hour runtime is not warranted at all. 30 minutes of this movie is just bad jokes and really boring exposition which could either be cut out or done better to make the film more enjoyable.

Depth of field effects are cool in one or two scenes, but when it's in almost every scene... not so much. The usage of depth of field in this film is on par with the lens flare that JJ Abrams use. It's truly appalling.Some of the characters were great, the german guy was the best though. I was also very impressed by Dave Bautista, he did a great job.All in all, the movie becomes a cliché-fest 2/3rds into the film, the cinematography would've been 1000000 times better if they didn't use the depth of field effects in almost every scene, but it did have some interesting story stuff with the zombies that I think most people would enjoy.

229,residentgrigo,"Old Genre Director, Fresh Meat",8,18 May 2021,"DoTD 2004 wasn´t the first use of fast zombies but it is still the best. AotD (not a sequel but it originally was) isn´t the first use of smart zombies or the first movie with zombie romance or all the other stuff but all these tropes bloom here like never before. The film has less zombie action than one would think. Not due to a lack of zombies though and the tensest action scenes are all amazing. Arguably the best in the genre. Or at least the best shot. Snyder himself carried this camera and decided to use the hazy lens. A lot of the tropey seeming characters are fully realized and can keep your attention in the many calm moments. The film is about them and not about lining up headshots or being Ocean's Eleven with the undead. I would argue that the trailer sells a different film altogether by focusing on establishing shots and mostly scenes from the opening montage and an idealized dream sequence. Some say this film is too long but I wouldn´t have minded a 3-hour movie.The 2022 animated prequel about the barely touched upon outbreak and the clearly teased sequel are full of potential so Netflix bet on the right man by rescuing Snyder from their dead hands of WB. And don´t forget how bleak Snyder´s last zombie film and many of his other works are so set your expectations right. #AllwaysBetOnDead indeed. They're coming to get you, Barbara! 8.5/10.PS: The way Tig is integrated is unnoticeable. I hope Zack wins an award for how he did that.

238,TheSeaLion,Suicide Squad Meets Zombie Apocalypse: Somehow Boring,3,23 May 2021,"It would have been so easy for Army of the Dead to be a fun movie: the premise of a colorful band of mercenaries going into a zombie-ridden Las Vegas to steal millions of dollars from a vault on the behest of billionaire Bly Tanaka before a nuke takes out the entire city has so much potential going for it. And somehow, it manages not to hit any meaningful marks.The team of mercenaries going in almost feels like DC's Suicide Squad: fun characters on a special assignment. Among the mercenaries are a trio who fought in the initial outbreak to rescue civilians from Las Vegas (Dave Bautista, Ana de la Reguera, and Omari Hardwick), Bautista's daughter (Ella Purnell) who enters with the group to find a missing person, an awkward and out-of-place locksmith (Matthias Schweighöfer), and their guide inside Las Vegas known as The Coyote (Nora Arnezeder), among others. These characters, however, do fall into the same problem that Suicide Squad faced where there are so many in the group that they all end up underdeveloped and uninteresting. The only two that manage to be fun are the locksmith (who ends up being more grating that amusing) and the quipster helicopter pilot (Tig Notaro), who is perfectly casted. (Why anyone would originally want Chris D'Elia in the role is beyond me). The most development any of the characters get is with Bautista and his daughter, who have a strained relationship. Them rekindling their relationship works as an emotional core to the film, but it leaves the daughter just with the group and doing nothing for a lot of the movie until she goes searching for the missing person or she engages in some meaningful dialogue with Bautista. There's even a character who works for Tanaka (Garret Dillahunt) whose addition to the team feels like it's literally taken from the Suicide Squad movie. (This is Katana, she has my back).The first forty-five minutes of this two and a half hour film are dedicated to this team being put together, which drags on until they finally enter Las Vegas. Once inside, the audience is treated to some interesting zombie ideas, fun gore, and good action scenes, but it is difficult to be fully invested with how little you care about the characters, and the runtime continues its slow momentum.Even setting aside the boring nature of the movie, what's ultimately Army of the Dead's downfall is how pointless everything ends up being. It turns out the character who works for Tanaka was sent in with a different mission and that the heist was just a distraction. The problem? He could have easily accomplished his goals without the fake heist, so why even bother with that? On top of that, when everyone but Bautista's daughter ends up dead (including the missing person whom her entry into Las Vegas was solely based on), she's left with a little bit of the money that Bautista salvaged, but nothing else. Their rekindled relationship is ultimately meaningless now, and her reasoning for entry in the first place to rescue a missing woman who had children is also technically a failure. It's just a bad note to end the movie on.Army of the Dead is riddled with fun ideas that could have made for an entertaining and fresh zombie film had those elements just gotten more focus time. If the characters were all built up better and maybe a few were removed, it probably could have done that. There's nothing more disappointing than a film with such a great premise failing in such an avoidable way.",Army of the Dead

There were some great, funny and serious characters in a dysfunctional team moving through 'Lost Vegas' with the standard heist trope of the plan going wrong and losing members along the way in some gruesome, blood soaked violence.If your expecting a ground breaking story this will not be the film for you, not every film has to be the pianist or Schindler's list! Bautistas emotions come out in this movie as the stone wall leader of the team with some touching parts with his daughter switching quickly to his rage in taking down hordes of zombies whilst jumping over Poker tables. It was a shame to see Samantha Win's bad ass die so quickly, after managing to break out of locked rooms and fight of close quarter zombies we see her go up in flames as the first sacrificial death to save the rest of the team. Would liked to have seen her in the closing moments of the movie. Matthias Schweighöfer is a scene stealer for me every time he's interacting with any of the cast it brings a smile to my face, chemistry with Omari Hardwick is also a great addition to the teams dynamic. Ella Purnell is an annoying character but is totally how this was meant to be played. From the outcry of the character she's succeed in bringing the character to the screen. Most sudden death has to go to Ana de la Reguera with a simple neck snap this sets off the rage inside Bautista. Garret Dillahunt I thought he would would have been more ready to survive zombies after he role from Fear the Walking dead but a zombie tiger is just one step to far for him. After seeing this go full Revenant in showing all of the gruesome details of fighting a tiger just this one scene totally justifies the R rating. Coming in late in the project and being digitally added Tig Notaro really has been type cast from her role in Star Trek Discovery but in this it just works perfectly. No nonsense fighter piolet with some great one liners during the movie.The style and tone of the movie is set close between the WB suicide squad a lot of neon apart of the advertising tied closely with the Evil Dead tv series and just seems to be a match that works so well. Along with the time loop aspect showing 4 of the longest surviving members also shown dead at the gate before the vault. This tiny details of this being a loop is awesome and this being the one time that the vaults opened and pulled this into an alternate universe as describing this a 'doorway to another realm, my friends'Overall this is far better than the Josstice league that this seems to be getting the same treatment for no reason.

253,tvdefrancesco,Some Good Most Really Bad,5,25 May 2021,"The opening scene of this movie was fantastic. The main zombie cuts through the Seals team quickly and with ferocious intensity. We then see that these zombies can communicate with each other. I thought to myself ohh this is going to be good. I was wrong.We then have one of the strangest most drawn out intros I've ever seen. I guess it was supposed to be comedic but we see people in Las Vegas killing thousands of zombies and they are stupid and slow, nothing like the zombies from the opening scene. Like the credits there are multiple scenes that drag on and on. I turned to my friend at one point during one of the numerous unnecessary side bar ""heart to heart"" conversations and said are they ever going to fight any zombies? There's like 20 minutes left in the movie.The daughter was an insufferable character. She volunteered at this camp and was obsessed with Gheeta for some reason and her 3 sisters. All of which die and she doesn't care at all. She survives a plane crash and a nuclear explosion and then Dave Batista gives her money to help Gheetas kids and get the out of the camp. Are you kidding me?!??! We saw that the camp was up against the shipping containers walls of Las Vegas and they just dropped a nuclear bomb on it!! Anyone in that camp was liquified. Well except for the guy in the safe who isn't affected by radiation or nuclear bombs apparently. And doesn't know when he is bit by a Zombie. Isn't that the whole reason they wanted out of the camps? So a nuke didn't drop on them. Gheeta's whole family is toast. And the insufferable daughter will be dead in a few days from radiation as well.When the Japanese guy is going over the plans it almost sounded satirical. The German guys comic relief is not funny at all. The funniest part of the movie is when the Spanish woman's head gets snapped backwards. The guy who betrayed them was so clearly going to betray them. This movie was a joke.The only reason I'm giving it a 5 is because the opening scene was cool, I liked the concept of the alphas and how they could communicate and even reproduce, and I thought the French girl Coyote was a good character. The rest of it sucked!Hey Gheeta, I've got a feeling your whole family's going down!",Army of the Dead
254,ryanpersaud-59415,Snyder Will Never Make Another Dawn of the Dead,5,23 May 2021,"The Good: Snyder is super talented when it comes to action scenes. The scenes here are well filmed, cathartic and fun. Anytime the characters are putting bullet or knife to zombie, the film is at its best. I also like some of the ideas here; that zombies like the heat of the living, that there's this weird zombie hierarchy and yes...zombie tigers are inherently cool.The Bad: Unfortunately, that doesn't happen NEARLY enough. The rest of this 2 1/2 hour bloated film is awkward dialog, weird editing and subplots that go nowhere. Snyder has lost the ability to direct actors properly; the line delivery is just so bad on all fronts here. Bautista has no actual character here, which is shame, because we know he has range. This film also has way, way too many characters and a very odd structure where they just sort of walk around for 45 minutes and not much happens. I just don't know why Snyder loves to keep audiences in seats so long.The Ugly: the CG was a little spotty at times - a chronic trend in this age of lower budget, direct to streaming films during the pandemic - and it definitely took me out of the movie. I love the creative gore, but when it looks so digital, it definitely hits different. Also, Tig Notaro was clearly not on set with the rest of the cast, and it's super obvious. The green screen makes her look clear than everyone else.",Army of the Dead
255,M_Exchange,Less is more,4,23 May 2021,"Chris Stuckmann stated that if I liked Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake then I would like this movie. No... Just no. I continue to believe that Snyder's Dawn remake is his best movie ever. At the time even Stephen King said that it was the best movie of 2004. This thing is quite a departure from it.When I was in film school, my teachers preached ""KISS""-- ""keep it simple, stupid."" As they stated, in horror especially, less is generally more. For instance, when Spielberg made ""Jaws"" he couldn't get his motorized model shark to function properly, so he made use of just splashes and minimal use of his shark models. It was extremely effective, and it made the movie much scarier. If the motorized model had worked properly then that movie probably wouldn't be regarded as a masterpiece.As Snyder himself stated in the director's commentary version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" we should not see prolonged shots of the zombies. Also, they should not have human-level intelligence. The best zombie movies, including his first one, rely on the interactions and conflicts between HUMANS. In such movies, the zombies are just hurdles, and sometimes they cause moral dilemmas between the HUMANS. George Romero made this mistake himself with ""Diary of the Dead""-- the zombies could communicate and plot with each other, and it made for a painfully boring film. ""Day of the Dead"" is one of his finest movies partly because his ""intelligent"" zombie Bub played only a minor part in the story.In Army of the Dead the vast majority of the zombies have human-level intelligence, and they might as well just be ugly humans. Unlike Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, Army has almost no character development partly as a result of the superficial character building with the zombies. It's just.... dumb. I don't care about the zombies' lives and motivations. Why would you sacrifice the quality of the humans' story for their story? Why would you remove their mystique and scare factor?This movie has good, twisted scenery and good action sequences, but ultimately it's everything that I feared that Znyder would do to ruin his zombie movie legacy if he had a bloated budget.

I was far more than moderately entertained by ""army of the dead"" and score this one 8/10!",Army of the Dead

263,gacsogergely,This is not the heist you are looking for,5,3 June 2021,"Instead being the promised lighthearted action-flick, it is a scifi drama.With a pathetic excuse of the to-be-continued twist/cliffnager ending.Send back Mr. Snyder directing Justice League or whatnot please.",Army of the Dead
264,nodlimax,"Drawn out, boring and only unlikable characters",2,22 May 2021,"My recommendation here would be not to waste your time with this movie. The story is unnecessarily drawn out and especially in the first half just very boring. All characters are unlikable and the acting is not good.The first half the movie is trying to establish the characters and their relationships. All of it is just so poorly done that I couldn't even wait for crew members to start dying as they were getting on my nerves.The creators of the movie apparently also were unsure what age restrictions this movie was supposed to get. In the beginning you have various scenes where the movie just cuts away from the violence so that you're not really seeing anything implying a PG rating (12+) but later it constantly switches between gore scenes that would either 16+ or 18+. It's just very messy and inconsistent.Also the movie tries to play with the concept of ""intelligent"" zombies which we've seen in other movies like ""I Am Legend"". Again it's just poorly done here. Overall the zombies in this movie are not really threatening. The slow ones are just used as canon fodder and even the faster and supposedly smart ones are not scary at all. There were several scenes where I was just outright laughing because of how bad the action was.Oh and btw. Hollywood had to inject some political correctness preaching again. It just made the scene in which it happened really awkward and it immediately made me hate a certain character even more.This could've been a good movie but the ideas presented in here are now just a collection of wasted opportunities.",Army of the Dead

267,ThomDerd,"The reviewers say it right: this movie is just bad, sorry Zack.",2,23 May 2021,"(Netflix...once again) A stupidly bad film. So much money spent for this rather silly zombie flick and Zack Snyder got a nice paycheck for preparing and executing a script of a 10 year old. I don't even know where to start with this dumb script and scenes, let alone the enormous runtime of more than 2h, which completely killed this film.I thought I will see something cool once the starting titles went in; I found that small part a great start for a nice, interesting and intense Zack Snyder film. But little did I know...The dialogue is so bad that it is not even funny, the motivation of the protagonist(s) and the character development are non existent. If you see someone saying this movie is fun then it's either Netflix social media writers or people that have never ever seen a zombie flick before. Because this is clearly not fun, but more of a money run! 2/10 just for the starting titles.",Army of the Dead
268,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A fun zombie heist film that had a lot more potential,7,2 June 2021,"Army of the Dead, the latest Zack Snyder zombie action film from Netflix, has all the makings to be the next game changer in the zombie film genre since Train to Busan. Armed with a great ensemble cast and a proper budget, it unfortunately lacks the literary chutzpah to give weight to its otherwise fascinating contemporary themes. While it is a fun and entertaining flesh-eating romp, the film's George Romero-esque title suggests a social satire. Army of the Dead sadly isn't a social satire, it just has the appearance of it.I had fun with Army of the Dead. Each character on the heist team is memorable and distinct and their interplay is what makes the film. It isn't a case of immediately waiting for them to be killed off. If you squint your eyes and blur your vision, you could see what a Zack Snyder version of Suicide Squad would have been.Dave Bautista does a good job in the lead role, showing a range beyond Drax that answers to the potential shown in his supporting role from Blade Runner 2049. Having recently expressed a desire to play Ernest Hemingway, Bautista has a natural propensity for quiet pensive characters that remains untapped. I say let him do Hemingway.The father-daughter story, despite the actors' efforts, is a very American father-daughter dynamic that seemed like a first world problem that could have been resolved at any time from normal conversation and not while running from flesh-eating zombies.Oddly, despite the script, I was still moved by the father-daughter story outside the context of the film itself. I could feel what Zack Snyder, who had lost his daughter Autumn to suicide, was saying personally underneath the canvas of the story.The cinematography, shot by Snyder himself, experiments with shallow depth-of-field, achieved through the Canon ""Dream Lens."" The Knightmare sequence from Zack Snyder's Justice League was shot in the same fashion.The shallow focus started as a cool idea initially, giving a sense of one's visual periphery that perhaps is missing a zombie creeping up from a corner. Or maybe it was easier to hide special effects. Who knows? The soft focus was overindulged in as it went along, mainly cause it's unclear what was motivating all that fuzziness.Snyder's spin on zombie lore is creative and fun for zombie fans. The film is littered with contemporary 2021 themes, including Trump's Mexico wall, the Me Too Movement, capitalism, Marxist class struggle and social media. They are all fascinating fresh motifs but it amounts to mere window-dressing as none are ever fully explored. ""Ah, I see what he's going for here..."" was my reoccurring thought throughout Army of the Dead.Zack Snyder's aesthetic is often misunderstood. He has a deep understanding of visual symbolism, genre films and mythology. He works akin to a painter, unleashing the narrative power of matted still frames, which is often misconstrued as shallow, slow-paced or confusing by general audiences that prefer to get to the point. It often leads to Snyder having to explain his convention-breaking choices or narrative gaps, like Batman killing criminals, the peacemaking properties of the name Martha or Darkseid forgetting the location of Earth.He is a director audiences have to go along with and take the time to understand what he's conveying through his frames. For any film fan who doesn't want to do homework to enjoy a film, I understand but his films are instantly more enjoyable if you indulge along.Zack Snyder's Justice League, for this very reason, remains his best film, or perhaps for others, his most honest. It is Zack Snyder completely free and unhinged, taking the amount of time to do what he wants.Army of the Dead will be remembered as a less important entry in the Zack Snyder catalogue. There are future plans for more stories in this world with Netflix and I look forward to them. It seemed like Snyder just wanted to let loose and have fun and less shooting for an artistic goal. It is fun. It is puzzling as he set up the world and themes so well that there are too many missed opportunities.",Army of the Dead

Think Oceans 11 meets Resident evil. What's worse is the team doesn't even get into zombie territory for 50 mins!! It's literally them 'getting a team together' for that long. I laughed thinking of how Rick and Morty made fun of how rubbish these movies were. 😂

275,DaegT,Dave Bautista n Nora Arnezeder better than expected,9,22 May 2021,"With respect, I m never a die hard fan of Zack Snyder. To me, his style is too heroic and too American.The primary reason that I watched this movie is because of the subgenre: zoms-vs-squad. I always give this subgenre a go.This time, Dave Bautista has made himself different. His character is more ""human"" than expected. That's to say, he is a good combination of your neighbour and an elite soldier. I like'm wearing glasses, which is a warm daddy look.Another reason is Nora Arnezeder, aka Coyote in the story. I missed her performance after Netflix's Zoo series. Her character looks stunningly stylish n badass. Wonder if Coyote has smoky eyes or just tired, bruised eyes but anyway that's a sharp match to her platinum cool-back hair. French women always know how to look good.Not much gotta say about the story and plot holes. I know it's not Nat-Geo and zoms don't exist. And I also know all such stories contain stupid people, stupid ideas and stupid decisions. Guys when we sit back n relax to enjoy the show, these are all expected.Any new elements in this movie?

278,liam_nb,An attempt at a good movie,5,28 May 2021,"So from the intro it looks like a fun maybe even comedic attempt at a zombie movie it sets up the characters for a little bit too long in my opinion but then the movie actually begins and it's alright generic zombie stuff and heist stuff with at least an original take on zombies but it's all dragging on way too much.Get to about 1hr 45 in and it all starts to go wrong for the crew do what started as light hearted fun movie starts to become insanely bleak as the tone switches in an instant and all the characters start acting like idiots who can't seem to notice a guy is wearing a metal helmet so maybe they could shoot him in the legs or something, that's just a little nitpick tho the point of this review is just how long and bleak this zombie movie gets by the end it started off fine generic action stuff but it just turned into a boring slog where characters act so dumb dooming each other to death for poor reasons and the only one to survive is the worst offender who runs off on her own full well knowing that she would get everyone else killed after being told this and showing herself to be a good person helping kids she still gets several people killed and the people she rescues die anyway. Am I overanalyzing maybe but I can't think of any positive things to say about this movie other than that lass in the bandana was pretty good at offing zombies but she somehow died first pretty much do that kinda sucked, the effects where good I guess, and something I noticed is some of the zombies had like blue blood or metallic parts in there heads or something weird like that which I don't think was explained.I'd say this movie lives up to Netflix standards since they never produce anything good, it's watchable if you skip through it a bit which luckily is easy on Netflix and I think Zack Snyder is really letting himself down after justice league which is a shame, maybe Netflix told him to make a bad movie or something.",Army of the Dead

288,Wikkid_Gamez,Why so much hate??... I thought it was fun!,8,22 May 2021,"So many harsh reviews, I don't understand it. Its a zombie movie for freaks sakes, not an epic drama! People sure seem to have seriously high expectations out of things like this and I have no idea why. I keep seeing people comment about the whole safe cracking, lack of just being given the combination issue. I guess all of those people completely missed the whole concept, it wasn't about the money, it was about getting a sample (head) of one of the top Alphas out. None of the rest of the group was meant to get away, they were just a distraction.I personally have found a large portion of the zombie ""blockbusters"" that have come out in the past decade or two too slowly paced or they took themselves too seriously for me to watch more than once. I am probably in the minority with that though. It isn't even required to be seen in the theaters, its on Netflix, so it's not like people have to pay money to go see it. Knowing that this script has been sat on for a decade puts it in front of a good portion of the movies that have come out during that time. It probably would have been better received by a lot of those bashing it had it come out then. That said...I found this a fun watch, I don't even know where to start with the main cast as most of them I have liked in other things with a couple of personal favorites like Tig Notaro (who plays a favorite of mine in Star Trek Discovery, she plays a similar personality in this movie), and Theo Rossi (Sons of Anarchy). Then of course we have Hiroyuki Sanada (The Last Samurai, 47 Ronin), Omari Hardwick (Power), and Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy Franchise)... With some new to me actors I will be adding to my list of people to look for like Matthias Schweighöfer. I know I am forgetting to mention some people, basically everyone on the main cast is worth checking out. The music was fun, I was surprised to hear anything like Control Machete in an american movie. The acting was on point, the effects were good. The heart of the storyline was simple yes, but again, no one should be watching a zombie movie for a complicated ""epic drama"" storyline. This isn't the type of movie where heavy background stories, character building or origin explanations are necessary.No, this wasn't completely ""original"", nothing is anymore. I really get tired of saying that. Anyone that still expects completely original anything shouldn't be watching any kind of zombie movie period if they are going to complain about it after. Just take it for what it is, a fun mixed genre movie made for entertainment, not deep thinking. It is definitely a mash-up of a few ideas, genres and movie concepts but I like what they did with it. I liked the hive mentality and the zombie alphas and stuff, not really a new concept as its been done with the vampire genre a lot. But not so much with zombies, there are a handful of them out there over the years but not many. Lots of action and good CGI, really well done zombies both human and animals (zombie tiger!) A little bit of humor and just enough drama to keep it rounded out. I personally really liked it and would most definitely watch a sequel.Not child appropriate, nudity ect.... Parents should pre-screen before allowing older teens to watch.",Army of the Dead
289,A_Llama_Drama,Nice change for Snyder,7,23 May 2021,"Snyder's ""Army of the Dead"" more than qualifies its existence with its opening credits. Watching Vegas crumble (figuratively and literally) into a zombie nest with ""Viva Las Vegas"" blasting over the carnage, is some of the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long, long time.Snyder follows this up with a Heist movie that involves all the trappings of a good heist: the round up of skilled oddballs, the visual display of how the heist will go (cause its obviously not going to go that well) and lashings of double crossing and emotional breakthroughs. Snyder, though, like Adam Reed when he was in control of Archer, doesn't seem to care for convention or reaching goals. Sadly, unlike Adam Reed's charming collection of self-destructive nutjobs, Snyder doesn't give us enough to connect to his cast of bandits to make the failings of the group, or the betrayals all that involving for the audience.Points, though, for finding a new spin on zombies. The Army of the Dead deserves its name. The humans might have guns and a helicopter, but the undead have a tiger and a horse and a man with a metal helmet. They've also learned the meaning of a choke point, how to pincer and when to throw pawns in the way. Add in a scene reminiscent of Silent Hill's Nurses and you've got some very fun zombie hijinks.Overall, a diverting watch and fun change of pace for Snyder after years of the Snyderverse.",Army of the Dead

291,MovieWarfare,Zack shouldn't be allowed to write for movies,4,31 May 2021,"Zack returns to the zombie genre after his 17 years since Dawn of the Dead (2004). I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead so I hyped at the idea of him making another zombie movie. The premise is ""After a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, a group of mercenaries takes the ultimate gamble by venturing into the quarantine zone for the greatest heist ever"". So was this one hell of a heist or dead one?Firstly, the action scenes are great. The opening montage scene showing vegas becoming infected was phenomenal and could've been a movie itself. There is also a cool John Wick style zombie shootout scene that was awesome. Near the end where it starts to live up to the title of ""Army of the Dead"" was one chaotic but fun zombie action sequence. I also like the soundtrack by Junkie XL even though there isn't a memorable soundtrack such as with the DCEU stuff. For the most part, the soundtrack elevates the scene and there is also pop music that actually works well in the movie.I also really liked Dave Bautista as the main lead. Dave gives a pretty strong performance and shows that he can give emotive acting if need be. In terms of characters, there were three I liked which were Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick), Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) and Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro). I liked how Vanderohe was this badass zombie slayer while Ludwig was skilled in safe cracking but knew nothing when it came to zombies. The growing relationship between them is one of the best parts of the movie. I also like Marianne's wisecracking and sarcastic personality which was charming despite her small screen time. I also got to appreciate how they green-screened Tig to replace Chris D'Elia, who was accused of sexual misconduct, into the movie as it still feels natural. Although, the green screen can feel pretty obvious at times.Unfortunately, I could give zero care for the other characters. Everyone else is either so forgettable, dies too early or is unlikeable. Zack seems to kill off characters for shock value when the character themselves are becoming interesting which is a shame. There are also way too many characters in my opinion and I honestly feel like some of the characters just didn't need to be in the movie. I also have mixed feelings about the cinematography which is done by Zack Snyder, the director, himself. The cinematography isn't awful or anything but it certainly isn't as good as Zack's previous movies which are clear as he didn't hire a cinematographer and did it himself. It's just very dull to look at. There are also a lot of shots where it is blurry and pixelated which is just very ugly to look at.The biggest problem with Army of the Dead is the writing which is also done by Zack Snyder. Zack had a unique idea with the zombie heist idea but he then ruins it by adding a bunch of convoluted zombie stuff and a dumb plotline with Scott (Dave Bautista) daughter Kate. Kate joins because a stupid mother went into a zombie-filled Las Vegas and she is going to find her. What annoys me is that there is no reason for Kate to be a part of the heist which is made worst as her character is annoying. Zack also seems to even forget about the mother as well which makes this plotline seem even more irrelevant. There is also a plotline with a spy that also amounts to nothing by the end of the movie. There is also some dumb plotline with the Alpha zombie and some baby thing which was also very pointless. Army of the Dead is 2 hours 28 minutes which is very noticeable as the pacing slows down a lot. They could easily cut it down by 30 minutes and the movie remains the same.I don't mind dumb movies and a movie can be so dumb that it becomes good. However, Army of the Dead is so dumb to the point that the movie loses enjoyment. THERE ARE MILD SPOILERS HERE but who cares because the movie is stupid anyway. Why is it the government can allow a group to fly out of Vegas but not fly into Vegas? Why is there a line about zombies hibernating but wakes when it rains if that is never going to come into play? If the vault is owned by Tanaka, the big boss who wants the heist, why does he not just give them the code? If Tanaka wanted the zombie blood then why not just have the heist be about getting the zombie blood instead of the bloody vault? Why does a character who never killed zombies ever, able to John Wick all the zombies? Why does the character who gets betrayed not mention the person who betrayed them? Why does no one help save the person who is only surrounded by 5 zombies and instead just stare at them? Why do the characters talk about their suspicion of this person being a spy but never bring it up again? Why is it with a Nuke incoming that the characters stop and stare at each other a lot? Why do they not just use dead bodies to activate traps instead of an alive zombie? Why is a dead zombie hand able to attract a zombie? Why do some zombies hibernate but some don't? How is a zombie horse able to catch up to a helicopter? Why do some people turn into zombies in a matter of minutes but someone else can takes hours? WHY ARE THERE ROBOT ZOMBIES? Why does Zack not understand how nuke works?Overall, Army of the Dead could've been a fun, exciting zombie and heist movie but fails to deliver in both. The movie had a lot of potentials but it is ruined by Zack's terrible writing skills. If you want some fun zombie action then there is that but don't expect much more.",Army of the Dead

293,neener3707,I see Where People Are Coming From....,4,25 May 2021,"This was not great, for many reasons. While I did like some of it, there was a plethora of issues here that I had personally that are mostly missing from the 3 sentence ""reviews"" we mostly see here for this one.Yes it was a huge departure from zombie lore, the idea of these ""Alpha"" zombies that communicate and have human feelings. Yes I did not particularly like that and found some of it even cringey at moments. But we must also remember that Snyder departed from typical zombie lore in his well respected remake of Dawn of the Dead which was almost nothing like the original. And even in Romero's Day of the Dead there was that famous zombie that could think, and even shoot a gun. But even with these possible defenses, the human-like zombies are simply too far, and reek of b-movie, uninspired garbage.The writing was also..... bad. Not just the story itself with plot lines that either mean nothing or go nowhere, or massive plot holes, but also the characters. Most (not all) of the characters were just bad, embarrassing, and poorly written. A far cry from Snyder's last zombie film. The pacing of the writing itself too was very slow, this movie could have easily be half an hour shorter. The dialog is just plain old bad, why did this need to be a semi-comedy? I don't know Zak, you tell me.But the gore, action, and the setting was just good enough to keep me watching until the end. The use of practical effects is a breath of fresh air in a 10 year era of digital blood and dismemberment nonsense in things like The Walking Dead and all those half baked b-movie style zombie movie/series of the SyFy channel, Hulu, and Netflix. The gore was (for the most part) real physical blood and several gory moments were very nice to see and made me smile and how ridiculous it was, its nice to see this, I don't see it as often as I used to.All in all its not a good movie. If I were to recommend it to a friend, I would tell them to fast forward to the action.",Army of the Dead

It had me thinking this was going to be a great movie but honestly it's the best this is going to get. There's some good gore effects and Nora Arnezeder is insanely hot but overall this was slow, too long and kind of a mess. Some of the CGI doesn't look great, the zombies are established as a deadly threat at first but the characters mow them down with ease for the most part and why is every single scene filmed with that obnoxious depth of field effect?Seriously, the depth of field used in this movie is so abrasive and distracting.

Firstly Geeta, this random woman who suddenly leads to Dave's daughter going on a crusade and getting lots of people killed because she wants to save this somehow super important person was a real poor plot point. Secondly the daughter is insufferable and a horrible character, simply awful and it's really bad that she ends up being the only one to survive. She was the worst character I think we all agree on that. Helicopter pilot was generic and dull, guy who starred in 'Power' was passible but nothing special, the rest were tag alongs, quite liked ""coyote"" she was decent. Where I think this film excelled was the soundtrack, not since guardians of the galaxy have I heard such good music play in a film and also take center stage in a lot of scenes really making them more enjoyable. The action scenes were decent enough and the cgi for things like the tiger were good. Story wise it went along at a decent pace but I think it could have been shortened by about 20-30 mins. The ending left a few frustrating unanswered questions, specifically what happened to the guy who hired them all. Maybe they plan to make a sequel but I wouldn't recommend it.

Vegas is in zombie lockdown.This is a B movie plot. It should be done and dusted in 90 minutes. It should zip by and be pulled along by relentless action with a few short breaks to catch your breath.What it is, is 148 minutes long. Skip the first 40 or so because F all happens except the 'this is your mission' set up, and the gathering of the 'this is my team of misfits' schtick. This could all be done in 5 minutes, but it's dragged across the concrete for so long you almost forget to stay awake.45 or so minutes in and the crew get into Vegas proper. We're introduced to zombie types: Shufflers who seem to be in hibernation for some reason; Alphas who seem to be entirely made up of third tier parkour wannabes who bounce roll needlessly, and dancers who like to run with their arms swung back gloriously while striking poses every so often - vain much - as if there was a zombie instagram dating app; King & Queen, an hilariously narcissistic buff couple of celebrity level zombies who prance and screech between HIIT routines to the adoration of their z-list fans.Dave Bautista out acts everyone.I have no idea who everyone else is except for Tig 'one note' Notaro and Garret Dillahunt who plays the kind of person you'd expect him to play with all those expectations met in the first 5 seconds of meeting him. Of the rest, Matthias Schweighöfer provides some laughs.There are hundred of CGI shots of CGI zombies heads exploding.There are almost as many cliches.There are zero chills.And zero thrills.All 4 stars go to Dave Bautista, who deserves better than being meat chucked at CGI.

Actions scenes are slick and well directed, especially in the latter half. The super zombie antagonist looks scary. There is also a fight with a zombie tiger which is slickly shot.The ending is cliched and has nothing new to offer.Huma Qureshi has a blink and miss role in the film.

The way actor Dave Bautista delivered his performance you just feel like you want more from him as the
movie progresses. Story wise this film is nothing big and awesome but kinda predictable. The mild twist that this film has makes us remember about any previous movie with this same pattern. The cinematography is well put together. The way the movie ends it makes you feel that overall it's a 2 hour plus content that you will definitely enjoy when you are watching it but you will not remember it that much when it will end.

Was expecting this to be the much brutal, much well-developed version of Zack's own reboot of ""Dawn of the Dead"" which the former being the case, but unfortunately not the later. The casts are great (Especially Dave), so are the characters (especially the zombie leader), but the plot however is pretty boring up until the second half of the movie, where you literally get all the action being packed almost in one place (oh and in the opening too), which is odd for a zombie or even a Zack Snyder movie, though I appreciate he brought along new elements never before seen in a zombie flick that (again) unfortunately left unexplained even until the credit rolls. But dunno, maybe it'll be explained in the prequel/sequel animated series, Zack launched not just a movie, but a whole franchise off this one remember? So that's my only issue with the movie. Never had a problem with his slow-mo technique in his products, including this one (though sometimes it's being unnecessarily overused), to be honest I barely remember the slow-mo scenes in this film, a good sign that he wasn't overusing it, and the gore, by God, I'm happy he's taking the Tarantino route of using practical blood effect instead of heavily relying on CGI like in ""300"". As a movie-goer, I can proudly proclaim that Zack Snyder is one of the four movie directors (the other being Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, and Bong Joon Ho) whom I followed no matter how good or bad his movies would be.

The review on why this movie is confusing people.,6,8 June 2021,"So if you want the spoiler reasons why this movie may have flopped, (or not) go to the section marked with @@@@@@. If you don't want spoilers, just stop reading when you see those symbols.Basic review of this movie while it has some nice scenes and interesting ideas, its a confusing mess in terms of its story due to some spoiler reasons I'll mention as pointed out at the ""symobl"" section. What I can say without spoilers is the way they went about promoting this movie would leave you thinking it was perhaps unfinished or had a really bad script writer who didn't know what they are doing. Don't expect to watch this movie and expect answers at all. And don't expect some of it to make sense either.Again, without spoilers its REALLY hard to tell you why and what the truth is. Confusing thing aside the CGI was really good and I love the new take on zombies. A take I haven't really seen (more or less). There was some really nice death scenes in this that were creative, all be it sometimes predictable. The choice of music really added to the atmosphere of the movie. I can't really say anything other then at most ""check it out"" and decide for yourself.Now.... here is the spoiler reasons why people are so confused/angry about this movie.@@@@@@@@@@@SPOILERS REVIEW@@@@@@Going back to why I gave this movie a 6. I enjoyed the idea there being some ""super zombies"" that are smart and to some degree can understand us. Such as us giving them a human sacrifice in order to go into the city. Or the fact somehow the female queen was pregnant with whatever the heck the blue baby was supposed to be. I also enjoyed the fact they had zombie animals.There were a ton of moments that made no sense sadly. Such as how did they wall off a city without any zombies escaping? How come there is a no fly zone around the city, but you can fly out? If this was the one guys vault, why didn't he just give them the code to get in? What happened to the one woman in the chopper at the end? Why was the first woman that died left to die when she was only a few feet away from the group? I could go on and on.What really makes the movie even worse/confusing is the movie is meant to be part of a ""universe"" of movies. So half of the things we see in this have no answers yet and leave you really baffled at what the heck is going on.For example some zombies appears to robots. Some zombies have blue blood/eyes. There is also a scene with UFOs at the start (blink and you'll miss it). And perhaps the biggest ""what is going on?"" moment comes when the crew gets to the vault and a character mentions what appears to be another dead crew on the ground. All of which look EXACTLY like the current crew. The guy talks about being stuck in a timeloop and that dead crew was them from the last time this whole scenario took place.As you can see, without any more context, all these things leave you not understanding most of what's going on. Perhaps if they or Zack mentioned they wanted to make a universe out of this, people would have left better reviews because they knew there would be answers later on. As it is there is a prequel (not sure why it wasn't first) in the works and a series that take place after this.I gave this movie a a 6 because I truly hope we get answers in the prequel/future things. If not I'll be lowering my review score. The movie does have some very interesting ideas that it hints at. Robots, time travel...etc all seem great. It better pay off. Even with the movies sometimes predictable moments and non-sensical stuff, I still enjoyed it. Would I buy this? Heck no. But it was worth the watch. Again, everything depends on the future of this series. It will either make the rest a for sure flop or success.Again, if Zack would have pointed out alot of info early on, perhaps there would be better reviews since we would know there would be lingering questions. But because he didn't say anything until after, it left people confused and annoyed.",Army of the Dead

Still, Army of the Dead manages to stay afloat by presenting a measured amount of the old cliches and offering up some genuinely tense moments.Then you've got the characters and believe me, this movie could have succeeded with about half the speaking parts that it has. Given the familiar character archetypes that are present here - creepy alpha-jerk, funny geek, etc. - it could have easily been tiresome viewing. But again, the word measured comes to mind. Whether we're talking about one-liners, jump scares or awkward jokes, it's as if director Snyder knows when to put on the breaks.

Up until that point, I'd rate it an easy 7.I knew the film was heading toward a 1 rating during the Chambers (Samantha Win) scene when she alerted the a**hole and he quickly sabotaged her. So cliché in such a clumsy way. Her fight scene, however, was remarkable. Her will to survive inspiring, her spirit flew to heights few have ever reached. I was rooting for her as she fought for her life with a desperate tenacity I don't think I've ever seen before in any film.It filled me with hope. It was the stuff of legends. My soul hung in the balance. The scene was a building block for what could have been an amazing film. I screamed at the film not to go there... She earned her spot in life like few others ever had. She was killed anyway. It felt so wrong. It broke my heart.If she had prevailed, if the a**hole was dealt with at that point - this film could have marched to a solid 9 rating. This was the fork on the road that could have produced a completely different film.After this scene, the film nosedived completely. It turned to nonsense, a kinda' of video gibberish. There was an hour left where the only thing you could count on were gaping plotholes. Everyone's ticket was going to get punched except the one character that should not have been in the group - the daughter.I feel like a joke was played on me. Like I said earlier, a great cast: Bautista, Ana de la Reguera (the love interest), Omari Hardwick (easily another leader, like Bautista), Matthias Schweighöfer (too muscular - an awkward casting but he actually pulled off the character Dieter very well), Tig Notaro (awesome as the pilot), Samantha Win. Even Ella Purnell (daughter) wasn't bad if it wasn't for the nonsensical script - as she too displayed a caring emotional toughness that could guide her through anything (like so many of these likable tough characters).It was the kind of cast/group that should have prevailed. Except for Dieter - they were smart, battle tested, street-savvy, emotionally resilient and worked really well as a team. I would've put this team against many others without a second thought. Any of these core individuals could have been dropped off in any hostile area on earth - from a drug-infested city with only a dollar in their pocket to a war-torn country in the heat of battle. Each would have found a way to fit in or survive. Each of them a survivor.The only thing that could have beat this team was a horrific script. It beat this team to a pulp.",Army of the Dead

Really? 500k for 5 people!? They are ok with it? Even after they saw theres actually 200 mills in the vault? I cant, I just cant accept that.5, the daughter not just killed her own dad, but literally caused everyone dead, at the end she didnt save those women nor taken 15 millions, WTF is wrong with you?

There was nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing that hadn't been done hundreds of times over and then some. The acting was only half there, the script was ridiculously predictable, and the plot... what plot? Over all, the movie was extremely boring, like watching grass grow, although the latter seems more natural and exciting. Watched the movie in small chunks of 5-10 minutes and then got bored and went back to reading tax auditing reports. The movie is a terrible waste of money, and the people who worked on it should honestly ask themselves the value of these type of productions to humanity as a whole.",Army of the Dead

You've also seen every single scene in this film in another, better, movie. The editing is odd, you have scenes where there are random shots ,sometimes several in a row, that aren't needed and don't do anything - If it weren't for all the money on the screen you might thing this was a film-makers first film.Really, save yourself two and a half hours.

Movies lately are too high definition and too much colored, when I think of zombies more like scary movies that are well made such as Quarantine and Train to Busan and any of the 28 days or weeks later. Zombies should be scary and not just target practice like in these movies. I don't understand maybe it's just me. Why does the annoying character always survive I mean Ella is beautiful but I don't believe she is his daughter she has bigger eyes but she got the pilot and her dad killed because of her stupidity when all she had to do was take those kids and raise them herself...just plain stupid.

Like so many of George Romero's zombie movies, and Zack previous remake of Dawn of the Dead, there is always a Directors Cut. They usually add to the story and have all the gore that should have been in the original. That's what these movies are all about after all, stylistic zombie violence. Some parts of this movie looked lie Train from Busan, where the idea of a zombie killing was some cgi blood squirting out a zombies head from a distance. Rubbish, we need some more close up zombie explosions like the genre was built on. So, I rated it more on the movie it should be , rather than the movie it currently is. I mean, the budget is over twice that of the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, which I regard as the directors best movie, and an all round sound, contemporary zombie flick. The cgi is impressive for 60 million, but it feels that there is something missing. I do not know why they do that, maybe its to satisfy more sensitive audiences first. After all, horror has always been a hit and miss at the box office.",Army of the Dead
341,xpunisherx,"Started great, ended bad",6,25 May 2021,It starts off strong and has you wondering why the reviews are so bad. As the movie progresses it gets worse and worse. The ending is probably one of the worst endings I've seen. There's also tons of moments where zero sense was made. They have awesome weapons when it's needed and then no weapons during some scenes. They decide not to kill some zombies only to end up killing them later on. Oh and zombies can teleport. Pretty unrealistic and confusing.,Army of the Dead
342,mocaler,So little made sense even for a zombie movie,1,28 May 2021,$90 million for this? Most of it made no sense for even a zombie movie. Too much of the plot made no sense. Too much of the visuals made no sense. So many variations of zombies made no sense. Many of the deaths made no sense. The inclusion of Sean Spicer made no sense. A good zombie movie has to be careful since it already deals with the extreme concept of zombies. But this movie reminds me of the breakfast served during shellback initiation. Massive amounts of leftovers mixed together. It was difficult to digest. And they had the absurd idea to end the absurd movie with a cliffhanger.,Army of the Dead

345,ty-jensen,Okay zombie movie,5,23 May 2021,"Army of the Dead was loosely on my radar since I'm not a horror guy and I like Dave Bautista and Zack Snyder. The only other zombie movies I seen are Shuan of the Dead, Planet Terror and the Zombieland movies but I tried watching Snyder's Dawn of the Dead back in 2010. Army of the Dead was okay as expected.The acting is passable, I don't think anyone was bad. Bautista was good but he was better as Drax. The characters are weak like most genre films, some fans may find the daughter annoying.The action scenes are passable but one of them took place in the dark. Snyder loves slow motion but he rarely uses it here maybe because it felt weird or off. Yes, the film is really gory but I was never disturbed. The effects and make-up are good.Army of the Dead isn't overly serious, the humor was fine which may sound picky. The safecracker and the pilot are the comic relief. I don't know if zombie movies are generally grim. Army of the Dead is a heist film so it has plenty of set-up. It's a long film, I think it's 10, 15 minutes overlong.Overall, Army of the Dead was okay. I'm not a horror guy so I wasn't excited for it. I'm still not interested in the prequel film or the anime series. Zombie fans will enjoy Army of the Dead.",Army of the Dead

This time produced by Netflix.Expectations were very high and, I'm sorry to say, they came out somewhat disappointing.A clearly series B plot/script, which isn't necessarily bad. The casting is well chosen given the series B premise. It is well done, the scenography is not bad and the action scenes are fun, but there are no moments of great brilliance.But the worst and what bothers me the most is the zombies' distortion, I'm not talking about being agile and running, that already happened in the remake of ""Dawn of The Dead"" and generated some controversy, but I didn't mind that option .I'm talking about being organized and having a leader, about being able to reproduce, about having feelings of love and revenge... This isn't zombies anymore, it's something else.However, it's not a bad movie in the genre and it even manages to elevate series B to another level without losing its essence.I recommend it even though I was disappointed with the ""somethings, but certainly not zombies"".

The only thing that I thought was really stupid were the 3 women that thought they could enter the zombie zone after the fully armed military was pretty much decimated in. Then you have the daughter who tells her father either he takes her or she goes on her own and gets eaten. You have the predictable characters and zombies more like the creatures in I am Legend. As far as zombie movies goes it was decent. This is an action zombie movie and not really a horror zombie movie. Think World War Z but looking for money and the obvious screw over character that is looking for something else.My only question is it seems like the military was involved in the heist so why couldn't they get what was ultimately wanted? They didn't care for the cash. They would have had the ability to get what they wanted.Everything about this movie was predictable. It is not a bad movie as long as you are not expecting some new inventive plot or amazing action. I would watch it again just because it is well done.

They felt a lot like the ones from ""I Am Legend"" at different points.Decent characters. You wanted to know more about some, but others were pretty standard or not great. I liked most of the acting, but Dave Bautista always feels mediocre on screen. There wasn't a lot of character development at all.It was too long for what it delivered, and fell apart towards the end. The story wasn't great to begin with, but I thought the premise was fun, and that's easy to overlook if they managed to deliver in other areas. It has a lame and forgettable conclusion and overall it fell short of the potential.This is another movie where they forced an annoying teenager into the film to use ""family"" as a driving factor for the lead. The character is not good, her dialogue is not good, the decisions she makes in the story are nonsensical, and I think she detracted from every single moment she was on screen. She is even the major contributor to the reasons it falls apart in the final act.

Sadly this is the only new concept I liked about the film.Now, Snyder has definitely given a new touch to the zombies but it didn't really excite me. Everytime i looked at the King and Queen zombie, they reminded me of those boss villains from a Marvel or DC film. So, at times i felt i was watching an Avengers film all over again.Rest everything is quite generic. Unnecessary father-daughter angle that adds nothing to the film. A fierce escape sequence that is quite well shot. A love relation between the zombie king and queen and i could not help laugh and cringe out at the point where the zombie queen got pregnant and gave birth to a baby! LMAO . Also, the fact that in the opening sequence, a car just randomly crashes into a truck and it explodes the moment it even touches the truck made reminded me of those typical Indian Rohit Shetty films.Huma Qureshi from our India has very limited space and nothing much to doOverall, just a one time watch just for the cool action sequences and VFX (Hollywood films always tend to get away with their weak storyline by dazzling the Indian audience with the terrific VFX and terrific action sequences but I am not a fool).",Army of the Dead

355,svtcobra331,An interesting film to study,6,25 May 2021,"The story was more or less predictable, and this movie wasn't Shakespeare, but it definitely has its positive points. This is one of those films that if you changed one or two stupid subplots you'd have a really good film, and you'd be at the watercooler explaining to your friends ""I know the movie is named 'Army of the Dead', but it's actually a good movie.""
The Good: Solid acting with watchable characters. There are no idiot special ops guys always dialoging in cliches, and the Hollywood ""guy leading squad stops and puts his right fist up, as if everybody behind him won't know to stop when he stops"".The characters were each well defined and likeable, and the badguys were loathsome without being ridiculous.The new zombie rules were fun.The stress scenes were well done... you know, like in The Birds when the group had to walk past all the birds that were just watching them.Tig Notaro was up to her signature wisecracks. In whatever production she's in, her character's wisecracks actually help bring the viewer into the reality of the story.The Bad: Special Ops guys are always musclemen, right? /s I don't think anyone in Hollywood has seen a real live SEAL. Oh wait, these are just guys who survived fighting zombies... So where are the special forces? I mean seriously, a couple marksmen up on the walls would really negate the need for an atom freakin bomb.Oh, and Hollywood knows all about guns and combat tactics... the scene where the two seasoned zombie killers with their ARs tell the gay guy to stand behind them, but aim is pistol in the direction they're aiming while awaiting the zombie zerg rush... uh... his pistol is about a foot behind your ear and less than three feet from it... in a closed room... and nobody has hearing protection. Plain stupid. That's like making a movie about Apollo 11 and having the launch button on the launch pad, ten feet from the rocket.And the zombies themselves... this is a movie and I get that makeup artists sometimes become captain of the ship, but whoever is in charge of the movie is responsible for engaging an audience with a story, and hopefully makeup will add to the story, not just be repulsive nonsense added to irritating shrieks that don't really make any sense.The Ugly: The white heterosexual males were a sexual predator and a murderer. The other white male was a homosexual that would scream like a girl... so there's a lot of white-male-hate in this movie... and I thought we were past portraying homosexuals as comic relief.This movie was overall enjoyable despite all its flaws.

362,cristinalinderman,A slightly entertaining zombie film.,5,24 May 2021,"(Rating 5.5/10)* There is no end credit scene *The director Zack Snyder and crew brought a slightly entertaining zombie film. The story sets when mercenaries try to pull a heist in Las Vegas knowing that there lies a quarantine zone due to a zombie outbreak. I was expecting to be completely entertained but the movie lacked many compelling points to keep me engaged. The opening sequence was fantastic from the moment the package was compromised to the moment they showed the battle of the military securing the zone of Las Vegas to the rest of the world. My heart skip a beat in that opening scene when a daughter didn't leave her mother's side no matter what fate would become of her due to her beautiful action. From that point on I thought I was going to watch an intriguing story but sadly it never reached that point. It doesn't take away the fact that it had a good concept because it has many great things like the different types of zombies. It was captivating the story side of the Alpha Zombie making me feel more for their side than for the human side. The movie was struggling heavily on the human side, some characters had fantastic personalities balancing great humor in the story but the emotional part was not grounded making the father and daughter storyline too superficial.The composer Tom Holkenborg was setting a good zombie atmosphere with his outstanding music but it was barely felt due to the director adding more songs than letting the composer flow with his music for the story. I found it very disrespectful having a great-known composer and not letting his music ground the movie instead the choice of songs was giving the setting of Las Vegas but not the zombie storyline. It such a shame I had to look for his music of this movie to enjoy how amazing it was since the movie didn't capture it due to the songs chosen.The cast was amazing and many of them perform greatly for what they were given except Ella Purnell, the one portraying the daughter Kate. Her performance wasn't believable, she was beautiful but beauty can't erase her lack of acting skills. If only she was portrayed by another female actor it could have made a big difference in the father and daughter storyline in setting it at the emotional level like it should have been. I also felt that the cast was too big since they didn't pay enough attention to give some a proper storyline for their characters. Now the one who was the highlight of the movie and the one who made only one scene to be bearable to watch over and over again was Samantha Win as Chambers. She was magnificent, I wish her scene was longer, I love how unpredictable it was when she was being so badass. She was the only true thing that makes this movie to recommend but only for her.",Army of the Dead

364,mr_sharma,A reasonably fun big budget movie with plenty of plot holes,6,24 May 2021,"I like Dave Batistuta. I thought he was very good in the recent Bladerunner sequel and I think he's engaging in this.To call it a heist movie, I'm not sure. And a zombie movie....well tbh the creatures reminded me of the Will Smith version of I am Legend.For such a long film, the action is really only concentrated in the last 40 or so minutes.But, it's not boring.The film has plenty of plot holes and logic lapses. Timing issues (you are thinking how the hell are they going to do all that in the remaining time they have). Logic issues (characters making decisions that make no sense or not taking the obviously, easy choice).But this is a fun melting pot of talented actors and actresses. I'm not saying they are delivering method acting but I am saying that (having seen a number of them on big budget TV shows), you can see a number of them have their charm.I try and not say much about plot (trailers are there for a reason) but the question is does it live up to expectations.Well not quite. As I said, for an action movie, where the action is really in the last third or so of the film, it feels odd....although again to say...it seems to zip through the film without being boring.There are some novel ideas (for a zombie film) in this but by the end you feel unsatisfied. There are things explained about this ""zombie"" universe, early on in the film, that never really get to fruition. One is the way it ends....because the clever thing to do was never done....it all ended up like countless films before it...readying itself for a sequel.And that's the pity.",Army of the Dead

Zack Snyder churned out a truly big toilet bowel filler.It's a huge rip off, some "" Homages "" (I'm being nice) a soundtrack worse than Suicide Squads, the longest ever opening pointless credit sequence and an hour too long.Avoid at all cost !!",Army of the Dead

It is not possible to give 8 to justice league which ok is not bad, but neither is the masterpiece that the poor and ridiculous fanboys boast and to give a poor 6 to this film.Let me clarify, even Army of the dead is not a masterpiece, but it is definitely better than 90% of cinecomics and as action / horror it works very well, the gore is not lacking, the cast is valid, Bautista is great and the action scenes are very well Turned and intense, they don't have the hateful slow motion you see in Justice League or in movie rubbish like Man of Steel or Batman vs Superman.Personally I think that the right rating for this film is 7/10, undoubtedly, on the zombie theme, Snyder did better with the very valid Dawn of the dead.",Army of the Dead

It was very disappointing. Actually i tell a lie, the opening scene as they roll through the credits and show you how Vegas got to be the way it was, i was scoring the movie 7/10 at that point. But it went down hill, all the way.Now i dont expect a masterpiece of writing in a good zombie flick, but i am expecting some hardcore nutjob like characters, and though the intro suggested we were going to get them, they never really took off.The daughter and her storyline in this movie has to be one of the most annoying characters(almost as bad as Jar Jar) to be seen in a movie this century. Bautista just has no acting ability, so to fully utilize him it should have been full speed ahead zombie guts everywhere, but the zombie scenes were actually few and far between.Total miss mr Snyder. Hope your TV show based on this disappointing movie is much better.",Army of the Dead
369,lumieretrain,Army of the Dead by Zack Snyder,7,28 October 2021,"Developing a heist story with the zombies around is one of the most thrilling concepts, to see how the main characters will try to get out from the territory filled with living dead, while they are proceeding with the robbery; some of these stories will end with the dead of the whole robbery group after they tried to get the money robbed, while others will end with the few surviving robbery group who will later on try to have a normal life without get in the trouble anymore. The visionary filmmaker Zack Snyder has written the story with this idea, after his first feature movie Dawn of the Dead came out, but for different reasons this idea was not going to be made; until he went in the production with Netflix, which gave him the opportunity to make the movie. After a long time of work, in 2021 came out Army of the Dead by Zack Snyder with Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Theo Rossi, Matthias Schweighöfer, Nora Arnezeder, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tig Notari, Raúl Castillo, Huma Qureshi, Garret Dillahunt and Richard Centrone. The movie's plot: A group of mercenaries have been given the opportunity to get a lot of money, by entering in Las Vegas which is now a quarantine zone filled with an army of the living dead, to commit their greatest heist in a casino. When the movie has been announced, several fans of the filmmaker Zack Snyder as well as the critics have been intrigued to see which direction his next feature movie will go; especially to see how the movie will be different than the previous ones directed by Zack Snyder, like how the settings of the story will be represented, how the development of the main characters will be processed and especially how the zombies will be represented, on the way they will act when they capture the victims in their path and how they will take actions. Indeed, the movie has been shown to be an entertaining movie filled with humor, dynamic rhythm and unexpected foolishness to be shown, especially to see there are different kinds of zombies in the story, like there are besides the classic living dead, there are also alpha zombies, who are the smartest and fastest zombie species and there are also zombie machines which can be recognized, once some them will get killed in some of the most thrilling moments of the story. At the same time the movie gives moments, on how the main characters will cooperate with each other, while they are proceeding with their heist, and how much they will interact with each other. As Zack Snyder is the director, co-producer, co-screenwriter and the director of photography of the movie, he has put so much energy for this passionate project, which make clear how the story will be told from the beginning to the end in every single camera movements and in every single angle shots; to see how some of the most essential aspects of the story will be shown in every single frames of story, as well as how the tone of the story will change from being dynamically thrilling, to become a story which shows some humor to be entertaining and finally to become even a story which has intimate moments between some characters. The production designer Julie Berghof has created settings which bonds with the movie's atmospheres as well as the movie's dynamism, filled with specific details of raw environment and destroyed materials which will let the audience feel the situation that the main characters are getting through; especially when they have been put in a dangerous environment, which is surrounded by death, to find something precious that lies in a casino. The costume designer Stephanie Porter has created costumes which fit with the shape and the colors of the main characters, especially to see how strong they are, both physically and psychologically, to face some of the most deadliest paths they are walking through, while they are searching to what they are looking for. The makeup department has created the prosthetic makeup of the zombies in a detailed way, on how their skin look and on how they express their emotions facially when they are interacting with each other, by letting the cast of the zombies to easily move physically to be expressive in their body language. The editor Dody Dorn has elaborated the narration's rhythm in a clear way of how the movie will be told from the beginning to the end, by balancing the story's atmospheres filled with thrilling moments, humorous moments and dramatic moments, without distorting the elements needed to be shown in the movie. The visual effects have been specifically elaborated to add furthermore details, needed to create the environment, where the main characters are getting through, in a much hostile way as well as dirtier way to let the audience feel the tension of some of the most thrilling moments, filled with a nonstop dynamic rhythm. The score by Tom Holkenborg has been elaborated, with musical notes which balance the movie's atmospheres, especially when some tracks of the score starts from being thrilling with dynamic rhythm, to change with much dramatic score tracks to let the audience feel the emotions of the main characters. Dave Bautista did an excellent performance as Scott Ward, a mercenary who has a dramatic dark past and once he will get asked to get the opportunity, to earn a lot of money by committing the biggest heist, he will do whatever is necessary to do the right job. Ella Purnell did a well done performance as Kate Ward, the daughter of Scott Ward who will join with the mercenary group to see where her friend Geeta is, once she is in the quarantine zone with the group she will be much closer to her father. Omari Hardwick did a well done performance as Vanderohe, a mercenary who is one of the former Scott Ward's teammates and he will do anything to make sure the job will be done as quickly as possible, to make it look professionally. Ana de la Reguera did an excellent performance as Maria Cruz, a mercenary who was also one of the former Scott Ward's teammates, she will do whatever it takes to accomplish the heist, even she takes part of the group to accomplish the robbery, she also came for a very specific reason to be personal. Theo Rossi did a well done performance as Burt Cummings, an abusive camp security guard who participates in the group, until something horrifying happens to him, as things will change to him in an unexpected way, while the rest of the group moved forward with the robbery. Matthias Schweighöfer did an excellent performance as Ludwig Dieter, a safecracker who initially does not know how to fight against the zombies, until the more he will move forward with the group, the more he knows how to defend himself. Nora Arnezeder did an excellent performance as Lilly, a smuggler who will help the group to enter the quarantine zone, as she will do anything to make sure no one is going to be put in danger, even when some consequences will inevitably happen. Hiroyuki Sanada did a well done performance as Bly Tanaka, the owner of the casino who will be the one to offer on Scott Ward's team to commit their biggest heist, even later on the team will understand which is the reason he brought them to the danger. Tig Notari did an excellent performance as Marianne Peters, the helicopter pilot who will do anything to what is right with the plan and once the heist has been accomplish, she will make sure to bring the team back home. Raúl Castillo did an excellent performance as Mikey Guzman, an energetic sharpshooter who will be ready to intervene, no matter how the situation might get more or less dangerous. Huma Qureshi did an excellent performance as Geeta, the friend of Kate Ward and a mother, who will do anything to make sure her children are going to get a better future. Garret Dillahunt did a well done performance as Martin, the one who will help to get access to the casino, even later on it will become clear the reason he has been put in the team. Richard Centrone did an excellent performance as Zeus, the alpha leader of the intelligent zombies who will be ready to attack anyone that dares to interfere in the quarantine zone, especially when something happens to the female Alpha known as the Queen. Army of the Dead is one of the most energetically entertaining movies ever made, which is filled with thrilling moments, humorous moments and dramatic moments, with a nonstop dynamic rhythm.",Army of the Dead
370,lusciousmuffins,They made zombies political,3,23 May 2021,"You watch movies for escapism.Zombies movies in particular are supposed to be unrealistic fun driven by gore and action.This one went for messages about police are bad, illegals are misunderstood, government are evil, capitalism is even worse, our military is incompetent, women are powerful, as well as a bunch of other SJW nonsense.I hate to say it, but Hollywood has jumped the shark.They churn out unwatchable propaganda instead of entertainment and this is merely another painful example of their insistence on pushing an agenda nobody asked for or wanted.When people want lessons on morality, they go to church.When people want a lecture on gender dynamics, they go to college.When people want to hear about geopolitical shifts, they watch the news.When people want to be entertained they used to go to a movie or turn on a TV, but not any more.Army of the Dead is just another example of the entertainment industry pushing their politics first, while actually entertaining the audience becomes an afterthought.",Army of the Dead
371,bodhi-13262,Zack Snyder's 'Zombie Squad!',5,22 May 2021,"Zack Snyder's first non comic-book film since '300' and 2nd zombie film of his directorial career, but does it deliver on the horror/action aspects it promises?1. On the bright side, the cinematography and direction by Snyder is exceptional and some of the vast and wide shots during certain sequences are jaw dropping. He also knows how to direct action and there are a minimum of his signature slow-mo shots. I enjoyed the simple setup of there being a zombie outbreak in a now quarantined Las Vegas where an ex military team attempts a heist to secure 50 million dollars stashed in a hotel's vault. Little to no complexity to a story (especially horror ones) that are supposed to be action packed is always a good thing.2. Though not the most charismatic lead, Dave Bautista is probably the most level-headed character who does things logically. On the other hand, the absolute worst addition to the cast is actress Ella Purnell who plays Bautista's bratty daughter who extorts her father into partaking in the mission. Her presence is an unnecessary and annoying one who's stupid actions near the end ultimately cost some people their lives. I hate when straight-forward films try to be more empathetic for no reason as the film tries to incorporate a romantic subplot that goes nowhere.3. Apart from the daughter, there are a few other characters who do dumb things including revealing their alternative agenda to others and not expecting to get screwed over in the end. The film also tries to setup a possible sequel in the most ridiculous way possible at the very end which seems like a complete afterthought. Clever writing with funny dialogue could have compensated for the slow parts and lack of action sequences. I commend Richard Cetrone who plays Zeus (the King zombie) as he was indeed the next compelling character after Bautista.4. I wanted to enjoy this film as it was sold as this fun horror/action/heist film based on the trailers, but it stumbles really hard after the first act. The middle of the film moves at a snail's pace until the climax and I couldn't overcome the slew of dumb/annoying characters. I applaud Zack Snyder for his film making but this was another miss for me. ""Okay"" is the perfect word for summing up the type of film this is. No doubt people will find this enjoyable, and I'm glad some find it entertaining, however, this didn't quite do it for me despite having lowered standards.If you want to see a far better thrilling zombie action flick that genuinely delivers, go watch 'World War Z' or 'Train to Busan'.",Army of the Dead

Nevertheless, it falters because of the stereotypes it does not overcome, and once again Snyder's visual aesthetic does not elevate.

Also most of them are so unlikeable that you actually sympathize with the zombies most of the time (maybe that was intended, i don't know).All in all you don't really care about anyone and that only makes it more uninteresting.Then there is all the usual WHY? Moments. There is a lot, but to take one: Why don't all the zombies just wear helmets (if they can make one..) and why does the one that has one, keep taking it off?Seems whenever the big red Netflix logo comes on a movie it is just bad or boring.",Army of the Dead

After taking almost an hour to set up the characters and basic plot, the film shifts to zombie land where there is a systematic social life among advanced zombies which is a concept that deserves a praise. But thats the end of new things. The film doesn't take forward the societal structure nor their intellectual ability. The much hyped zombie attacks last for the last half an hour of the film which is just usual zombie scenes with just quick moving 3 4 zombies..most of them are blasted off with explosions..

But, when needed for allegedly touching dialogue scenes, there is a dramatically convenient delay of infection built in, and people linger for long minutes as they emote.A shame, really. I've enjoyed most of Zack Synder's adaptation works (and yes, the Synder Cut of Justice League is the Schizz). His original stuff, like this and Power Gurrlz or whatever that was called, not so much.A lot of money and technology went into this, and there are some thrilling sequences, but, man, there was a lot of really sloppy story-telling, too.",Army of the Dead

Incredible zombie action, ridiculous circumstances, A ZOMBIE TIGER!?!?! This is not meant to be taken seriously and for the most part, it knows that. Army of the dead really goes hard on trying to create compelling characters as well. They really want you to like the good characters, and they REALLY want you to hate the not so good characters. This aspect of the film was missing a little something but overall, a good cast was put together to pull it off and they did the best they could with what they had to work with. Where the film really loses points for me however, is it's grueling 2 and a half hour runtime!

If you dislike this movie then the 'Z Train' will tell you how not every movie has to be Oscar worthy.The truth is, this is a bad movie.For such a simple premise it's ridiculous that the core of the story makes no sense (why would a billionaire create a dangerous, complicated ruse to complete a simple task?) The acting is ropey and the characters are at best clichéd and at worst just annoying. The story also tends to rely on bits from other zombie movies which only adds to the already overly long 2.5 hour slog that it is.And this is a big part of its failing. The movie could have been 90min long, done the same thing and people would have (maybe) come away being 'entertained', rather than being dragged through so much unnecessary baggage for such a mediocre experience.And for those that decided to watch the 'Sneak Peak' promo (of the first 15min) would have realised that the reason for it was because the opening was probably the best part of the movie (albeit very Zombieland-esque! - see above).Other than that it's all about: 'Valentine - the Zombie Tiger'.

Zack Snyder Delivered This Time an Entertaining , Enjoyable Experience in An Action & Zombie Blended Genre mixed with a good Dramatic Aspect
So Here's My Review & opinion About The Movie ! :
Positives ✅ :
-Creating a whole unique , Special tones for such a genre Made the Movie Very Distinguished !-Interesting choice of some pretty matching , Affecting music & Songs 🎶👌
There were some Great Action Sequences 🔥💥 , Like the first encounter with the shamblers , The escape from casino Sequence-The introduction of The Characters earned the whole 50 min period 👍and proved its worth
-Interesting & Unique choice of Angles and lenses in term of Photography Style that I haven't witnessed before and Thus Zack Was Right for taking the job Of Cinematography for Himself to fully Achieve his Vision but I think that this decision affected his Roles as a Director 🤔
-The world Building and The Relationships between the Zombies were something new which we haven't witnessed before 👍
-Very Captivating , Catchy Pacing of the Acts of the Movie ❤👌👏
-The Last Act was very sentimental , Poignant
fulfilled its purpose
Despite that there were some major Issues with the plot ...
-Good Visual Affects
they're only good in my opinion because in some scenes they don't seen polished enough 😞
-Great Casting ! 👍
Dave Bautista Delivered a very Acceptable Acting Range for Someone who Didn't Establish his Acting Career in his early years and Entered this Domain in a relatively late stage ...
Negatives ❌ :
-There were lots of flaws in the Scenario 😕😞
-The Plot :
Weak Dramatic turns without enough Establishing
Some Plot points weren't compelling enough and the events weren't built around them and yet they affect the last act of the movie on a major scale !-Some Characters developments weren't justified , they directly jump into the culmination of a character without setting enough establish8ng to that
-Poor reveal of the Crucial Plot twists without setting a proper establishing !-Some Characters' actions and Decisions lack the compelling reasons and motivations
-I think that the Script is very weak and fragile in its elements that actually fail to deliver a memorable Story and also some of the Main Turns of the Plot didn't leave the impact that they should have had
-The Multiplicity of Characters Actually Weakened and Dispersed the Focus on their Personallities , Aspects , Struggles and Thus their DevelopmentMy Final rating : 7/10 ✅",Army of the Dead

You know, regular ammunition wouldn't suffice. Or, you know, since you sealed off the inner city, maybe killing them with snipers or from helicopters or with special incursion teams...4.

After a long battle the government/military wipes out not all, but a large amount of the Zombies. A bomb is the final solution to the remaining Zombie problem. But before the bomb is launched and while still evacuating the residents, the city of Las Vegas is fenced off by a wall of containers to lock the Zombies in. However the city becomes a fortress for the Zombies.Ex military hero turned hamburger cook Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) is offered $50 million dollars to go into Las Vegas before the bomb is dropped, navigate through the Zombie's, break into a casino vault and get the $200 million dollars sitting inside the vault, take his cut and give the rest of the money to it's owner. That's the plan but the time frame is reduced without much notice, and the money isn't the only thing that's wanted inside Zombie city.It's a deal too good to refuse and Scott Ward accepts the offer. Ward then assembles a motley crew of helpers to do the job, all want the money on offer and don't seem too worried about the Zombies or the odds of successfully doing the job. Wards brat daughter also get's into the act, for nuisance value and to look for some lost friends.There is the customary shooting of 100's of Zombies in the head and a race against time. Ex wrestler Dave Bautista is the lead character and he is definitely a B grade action hero at best. Not sure if Dave will ever hit it big as a leading man? The other characters/actors in the film are bland and uninspiring. This movie also proves that director/writer Zack Snyder can't do magic with all film's. The story is not bad but just poorly done. The movie is way too long and painful at 2 hours and 28 minutes, it's at least 30 minutes too long/painful. It's slightly better than I expected, but it's still a very average Zombie movie with the usual trimmings. If you are Ok with B grade shoot 'em up Zombie movies, you might be able to sit through this offering.",Army of the Dead
402,darklydreamingrahu,Zombie Cartoon Brought to Life,8,22 May 2021,"Army of the Dead is a unique, adrenaline-pumped fantasy cartoon brought to life by WWE stars and casino heists.Every part of this wild movie is jacked to 10, and some people will absolutely hate the ""dumb"" factor of it. It's clearly gearing for the upcoming Netflix animation series ""Lost Vegas,"" and it has no qualms about letting its cartoonish energy come to life in glorious Snyder fashion.The characters are pretty one dimensional here, and no performance particularly shines. They are fun archetypes though with some funny one-liners and interesting character quirks. Every actor looks like they're having a blast working on this.Bautista gets a decidedly more complex role than everyone else. His Scott Ward character is soft-spoken and pained. It's a fairly endearing portrayal that works in some places, but feels underdeveloped in others.The world-building is deep and it's really where Army of the Dead shines. As an introduction to a deeper animation universe, I see real potential here for awesomeness.However, I'm not sure how any of this is connected to Snyder's Dawn of the Dead. I was under the impression that this was a shared universe, but I could be wrong about that. Maybe it really is just a spiritual successor, and it simply marks the director's return into an undead universe.Snyder's unique visual flair and divisive style are both here. You either like it or you don't. If you don't like it, then Army of the Dead won't be changing your mind.This, like the recently released Zack Snyder's Justice League, is a director fully indulging in his own flair while maintaining his wide-eyed reverence for the mythical and outrageous.This isn't as good of a film as Zack Snyder's Justice League, Watchmen, or 300, but it's a solid start to a straight-up bonkers cinematic universe that pulls no punches about its cartoonish influences.Also, there is some hilarious zombie action in here, if you're into that kind of thing.For me, this is an 8/10, but I'm a Snyder fan.Outside of the Snyderverse, or if you are indifferent to his style and vision, it's more like a 6/10. A fun action horror romp with over-the-top gore and some surprisingly deep world-building.A live-action zombie cartoon that's comfortable just being its silly self.",Army of the Dead

Unfortunately when I actually saw it, I was again let down by modern Hollywood. I like Dave Bautista but he is not good enough to carry a movie by himself. I was also hoping for more dark humor as there was ample material from the zombies infesting Vegas. The story is pretty standard but it tries to toss in some family drama and it just doesn't work.

That's what this movie is, and what it does. Could it be romance (eg. Warm bodies)? No, a zombie movies's about flesh eating monsters. Is it comedy (eg. Zombieland)? No, it's still about flesh eating monsters. Perhaps drama (eg. The walking dead)? No, remember: flesh eating monsters. Maybe action (eg. World war Z)?

411,northernpaladin,The cult of Zack Snyder,3,12 August 2021,"What is it with the critics and fans love affair with this purveyor of bombastic, empty dross? I've seen a few now, always hoping for something to justify the plaudits but with the exception of maybe Man of Steel nothing. Some have been boring, some plain silly, but this is just absolute rubbish. The plot, such as it is, could have worked; a bunch of mercenaries hired to rob a casino in zombie infested Las Vegas is nicely ironic and the set up of it being due to a military bio experiment gone wrong is plausible but for this kind of thing to work you need to care about the bunch and frankly there is nothing to care about. None of their back stories work or are even believable and the reasons for hiring them make no sense, the back stories of Oceans Eleven work better. So off they go into the zombie holocaust and as soon as they enter through a ridiculous back door in the high security perimeter wall which they leave open behind them! You know all semblance of 'reality' has been thrown out of the window. But it's a zombie film I hear you say, yes, now watch Romero""s master pieces or The Walking Dead opening season or even World War Z and you realise what is required. As the bunch penetrate the zombie kingdom Snyder just can't resist piling on the stupidity; there is a hierarchy amongst the zombies, they have an intelligent leader (done much better in I Am Legend), they are organised, they hibernate like Dracula's minions, there is a queen who is pregnant, there is a zombie tiger, there is a zombie horse the leader rides like one of the four horsemen, and so it goes on, all cheap rip offs from other films, obvious and insulting to the audience. Not surprisingly various members of the bunch die as we proceed, some pointlessly, some in direct rips from other films - Aliens came to mind on at least 3 occasions, all bloodily and we just don't care. Then comes the inevitable betrayal and double cross which of course doesn't go well and we have the sacrifice moment by one of the few vaguely sympathetic characters which makes absolutely no sense. Finally we have the escape, which nearly isn't an escape but heroic Bautista does the right thing and tears are shed, but not by the audience who are now bored rigid, and we cap it off with the lazy, insulting, director conceit of 'aha, you thought you were safe but look out here's the one that got away!'
A lot of money must have been thrown at this just because it was Snyder and it had zombies and stuff blew up, but that money could have been spent on films of value made by people of skill with something to say; or even a better version of this film, 90 minutes long, without the intelligent zombie sub plot, with characters that had a decent back story and a reason to be there and yes even die.I watched with low expectations thinking this could be a bit of fun with a beer, it wasn't, don't bother.",Army of the Dead

Instead I will list a few highlights and criticisms. Overall Army of the Dead is a satisfying zombie movie and I think most people who watch it will find something they like about the movie.Pros:
Opening 15 minutes splatterfest.Hibernation sequence.Punchy-Bloody action sequences.Bits of world building.Great cast/performances especially from Bautista.Fantastic production design. Zombie ridden Las Vegas is an awesome setting.Zombie Tiger.Some creative cinematography/direction from Snyder.Cons:
Minimal character development in a 2 hr and 30 minute movie. I barely remember any of the characters names.To avoid spoilers a decision a certain character makes in the 3rd act. A very frustrating direction to take a character we're meant to care about.Never recaptured the bonkers gorefest the opening sequence delivered in the 3rd acts action sequences.

419,roondogbb,A movie with many positives and unfortunately drawbacks that could easily be avoided.,7,29 May 2021,"I wanted to review this movie after watching it, to see it was as bad as the reviewers out there on Imdb are making it out to be. I have to say my overall summation of the movie was that it is one with many peaks and many lows but overall delivered something unique.I think in recent years zombies have become a well that has dried up and new flourishing ideas to inject into the genre are hard to come by, let alone execute. So this movie as becomes obvious is trying to start a new franchise in the same way 28 days later did. There are some similarities to both franchies in at the beginning and the end of the movie and anyone who has seen 28 days later will recognize this.Anyway the plot of the movie is very simple and direct (as it should be), go in and steal millions from a vault before a nuke is dropped, while avoiding being slaughtered by Zombies. The problem with regards to this movie and so many other movies and tv shows alike regardless if they're Zombie films or action films etc. They add B plots with, with characters with little build and significance to the more interesting A plot. I.e Someone from B plot needs to search for a lost daughter? Seriously why should I care? I've never seen her before, I've hardly seen you on screen before. The A plot seems far more interesting and it will probably just suck the time away from the A plot. Maybe a B plot like this could have worked over a 8 part tv series where more background could have been executed but not in a film. So I'm sorry I just didn't care about the search for the daughter, especially when the other characters where more dynamic and had interesting personalities and I was actually invested in their life or death moments.So now for the good. This film reminds me of many little things. It reminds me of Zack Snyder's other film from back in 2006, ""300"" The king zombie had motifs of being a greek warrior and the queen, that of Madussa.... These made for interesting visuals and the zombies where fast and intelligent (to some degree). The other human characters (besides b plot characters) where interesting and one did as much as one could with as many characters over the space of one film. Dave Batista's character, the sneaker agent, the coyote, all were interesting. More so than the 10 seasons ultra marathon that was the soap opera called the walking dead. Which after that long series would turn anyone into a zombie.Now where the movie really stands out for a zombie movie is the cinematography, you instantly get the sensation that you're in Vegas, dry but colourful and its errily quiet for the most part. 24 days later did it better, but it was perhaps going for something different, complete isolation and silence. Where this is action/comedy. The increase in noise works. The music in the movie was excellent and yes as everyone is saying Zombie by the cranberries is here and it feels right on the money. Obviously the song is about the troubles in Ireland during the 90s and the ""zombie thinking"" idiots in my home city. But it really transfers well into actual zombie films.Recently I've seen some excellent 2 hour narrative focused masterpieces that look at the story arcs of maybe 2 or 1 characters. This isn't that, so don't judge it for being hallow. It not supposed to be a piece of narative excellence (albiet it could be better) I was entertained however for two hours and I'm curious to see if this franchise continues as I'll just say, the doors are left open in that regard. As they are in many zombie movies. Some people say there are plot holes. Well there are many plot holes. Zombies don't exist. However it's fantasy and the plotholes don't ruin the entertainment.I'll give it a 7/10.... It's not the best it could have been. It's certainly not worth 1 or 2 out of 10 that other reviewers are giving it. A few misplaced bricks doesn't make film collapse. This film is sturdy enough to stand on its own two feet and entertain.",Army of the Dead

A gender diverse bunch of chancers try their luck to break in and take cash from a bank vault. However, that is as good as it gets. It fails each step of the way as the plotting never manages to suspend the audiences disbelief. A recurring theme is the troop's inability to ever shut a door they have come through to prevent zombies attacking them from behind. A lack of logic is indeed found each step of the plot. Equally bad is the feeble back stories for the characters - Hollywood tradition is that a character's back story helps the audience know how to feel about them and gives some logic on who dies and who survives - there is no such logic here at all. It feels rushed and careless. Above all by the end I did not care if anyone died or survived.",Army of the Dead

Another Zack Synder film that showcases detailed (in the case of this film , gruesome) combat/ gunplay.The tone of the film is confusing. Are you trying to be easy going or more serious? The storyline is predictable with basic dialogue that doesn't evoke much emotion nor development. Subordinate characters receive gnarly deaths which adds some enjoyment of the film.Verdict :This is a decent film, it's what you would expect from a Netflix film.

again nothing new every single character is cliched the ending is cliched the emotional scenes are cliched...the sacrifices are cliched ofc it would be nearly impossible to make a specific zombie movie without these elements.But what works in ARMY OF THE DEAD is 1. Zack Snyder the movie even though visually doesn't have THAT much to offer llike his previous works or film tone...he still has done a good job in all four roles in directing producing and screenplay and story(even if it's cliched)Now comes acting another plus point the movie doesn't have much dialogues to offer but still I think all the cast were convincing to watchACTION scenes...another plus point of this movie...the gore definitely is a part of it too...but I really thought it'd go on extreme level sadly it didn'tAnd the freshest part ofc would be the Zombie tribes....even though there is no much action for shamblers....the alphas have been created designed and depicted in a FRESH way...Okay now what the movie was mainly criticized was for its duration and the lack of emotional tone.I almost agree with the secondary point but personally I didn't feel a bit bored through this freakishly long movie...and that's surprising even to meThe opening 15 mins alone could've been made as the primary movie and this one as the sequel....but I am fine with it...Since I believe this has great scope as a franchise
Not a must watch in theatre but could've offered a better experienceBut all in all I am satisfied with the prequel coming in and also the anime styled series depicting the first adv of Scott and team in the doomed LAS VEGAS....just hoping that since it a tv show I hope they penn down a strong screenplay and take the bloodbath and gore to the extreme....I would've given this a 6

I like the cast ensemble it sort of reminds me of the film Aliens. A zombie heist movie. There is a warning about the graphic violence but in all honesty it doesn't compare to the Walking Dead for graphic violence and therein perhaps are some points for consideration. This film is very energetic- they're zombies but more akin to I Am Legend. They're intelligent and violent, rather than walkers with sharp nashers. Even the animals are infected within the zone. But somehow the infestation is localised to Vegas and seems to start with a patient zero as some sort of army creation. There are some twists but nothing you xant see coming. It's just missing Sly Stallone.",Army of the Dead

445,Shadowking1001,Lesson in the Art of Making Terrible Big Budget Movies,4,12 August 2021,"This project shows big budget does not equate to competent movies. My ratings: 7 for CGI/make-up/set staging/action sequences (want to acknowledge a job well done). However, minus 3 for immature story and hyper annoying characters and dialogue.Some such examples:
1. Soldiers SUDDENLY cannot hear clear instructions to leave the area immediately. And they decide to walk into the dark dessert rather than driving off in the Humvee they are standing RIGHT NEXT TO?? That's a Geico commercial right there!2. Shut the doors! When the team initially passes through the protective wall into zombie land, they inexplicably leave the barrier doors wide open behind them.Then later at the Olympus, they have two steel doors they could close behind them to hold off the infuriated King zombie to give them more time to escape - but decide to leave both wide open.3. When helicopter finally shows up (Alien movie rip-off), pilot must deliver a cheesy line before people can start getting in. Bizarrely, Father Scott continues to stand outside giving irritating Daughter Kate dreamy dopey looks, instead of getting onboard to leave immediately! I mean, there is only the murderous King zombie hell-bent on killing them AND a nuclear bomb is imminent. Terrible writing!4. We eventually find out that bad billionaire Tanaka never wanted the money at all, but only a vial of blood from an alpha zombie. So Tanaka concocts a ultra-complicated heist as cover for his real objective, although he has done exactly the same thing before - and they ALL FAILED!! His solution? Let's do the same thing again!Why not just send a small team to lure and trap the zombie to get its blood. This could have been done quickly (as Martin did). But now, instead of leaving immediately with the zombie head, Martin has to lug it deeper into dangerous territory, lowering the chances of success and then, wait around for the team to break into the bobby-trapped difficult to open safe - which Tanaka doesn't even care about! Seriously...!5. Chambers had plenty of time to tell Guzman about the traitor Martin, but she inexplicably doesn't. Then while she is valiantly fighting off ONLY A FEW zombies that were attacking her, Guzman just stands there for a long time - just watching instead of shooting those few attacking zombies to help her. He only starts shooting when she gets overwhelmed and bitten.6. The Geeta character was so redundant - except as being the reason that killed most of the team. In fact, SO REDUNDANT was Geeta that Snyder completely forgot about her character in the end. Similarly redundant was the irritating character of the daughter, whose sole function was to annoy the audience. What were they thinking??7. And why is this movie so long? So bloated with appalling unnecessary dialogue. As it progressed, I kept walking off to do other things. I just didn't care about what happened to the characters (I still don't know what happened to the safe-cracker - and I can't be bothered to find out).Could go on and on, but you get the picture. It was actually more fun writing this review (and reading other similar reviews). Proceed at your own risk!",Army of the Dead
446,ranwulfs,Flogging an (un)dead horse,3,22 May 2021,"I like zombie movies, but I think Hollywood has officially run out of zombie movie ideas. There are fast zombies like ""28 Days Later,"" which briefly ""revived"" the genre (see what I did there?) and slow zombies like ""Dawn of the Dead"" and its ilk. There are funny zombie movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland"" (my favorite). They've even got a Jane Austen zombie movie: ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" But I think they're flogging an (un)dead horse at this point. I mean, a zombie casino vault heist? Okay. Whatever. If the great Zack Snyder can't make a good zombie movie, is there really any hope left?I'm giving this 3 stars because I like Dave Bautista. Also - Ella Purnell doesn't make me want to stab myself in the eyes. And I guess Snyder gets *some* brownie points for writing a smarter zombie and adding another layer to zombie lore. But it fails, though. Predictable action, two-dimensional characters, and a run time that's easily an hour too long. Skip it.",Army of the Dead
447,druss44121-1,"Stylish... but a huge ripoff of better movies, like Aliens (1986)",6,22 May 2021,"Zack Snyder already did this better in 2004 with his Dawn of the Dead remake.The biggest problem with this film is a lack of original ideas. It brings up a couple of interesting things about a ""zombie society"" but does very little with those concepts. They're probably saving that stuff for other movies or TV shows. This type of franchise thinking is bad, though, when it limits the scope of your first entry. I'm also guessing they haven't thought it through too much.Worst of all, this film rips off Aliens to an almost hilarious degree. From certain lines (a la ""they're just dumb animals"") to an escape scene that involves them having to flee an area before a nuke goes off and thinking their pilot has left them while the ""queen"" follows them... it's just endless. SO many characters are even lifted from the archetypes created by Aliens (which is a much better film, by the way). James Cameron could probably sue.Last thing -- the film is too long. For 90 minutes, it's a fun Saturday afternoon matinee type of experience, but 2 and a half hours is just overkill. No pun intended.If you're bored, watch it, sure, but don't expect anything special.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDB.",Army of the Dead

It is a horror film in the truest sense of the word: you will be horrified by the atrocious script and risible plot developments till your teeth ache.It seems to go on for months, and even the grim satisfaction of seeing nearly all of the cardboard characters get snuffed out by the end isn't enough to remove the bad taste from your mouth.Easily one of the ten worst films I have ever seen.",Army of the Dead

The anticlimactic moment with the smuggler lady was meaningless and left you with a huge question mark as to why you wasted even a bit of your life on watching this pile of crap.The violence was extremely gratuitous for no reason; I'm fine with gore but there is a difference between story driven gore and gore just for the sake of it.I only gave it a 2 for the one scene with the lady fighting zombies in an enclosed space.

I fast forwarded a lot of times because I knew what dialogues would be spoken. It's so easy to guess. BTW, if the makers could make a Zombie tiger, why the same treatment was not given to the horse. I guess if horse could speak, then there would be another #horsematters movement. I mean the horse was not even moving anything. Not it's head or tail. Attention to details matter or else it would be another zombie movie where everyone dies except one or two.

451,warren-87235,Carter J. Burke gets eaten by a zombie tiger in Las Vegas!,5,28 May 2021,"Zack Snyder is very much a Marmite film-maker. Most people either love him or hate him. Myself, I'm an anomaly that sits pretty much in the middle. I actually really enjoy the Snyder DCEU and, despite some major flaws (Honestly, Jar Jar Binks would've made for a better Lex Luthor), I find there's more interesting character and story elements going on than pretty much any of the vacuous (but sometimes fun) MCU. I even enjoy Sucker Punch as stylised eye candy.Having said that, I don't idolise him. 300 was interesting, but I can't say I've ever felt the urge to re-watch it. I still haven't gone beyond 20 minutes of Watchmen, out of sheer boredom.So what of Army of the Dead? It's visually fun. I don't mind Snyder having a bit of a lark, and overindulging his need for narrow-depth-of-field and slow-mo. The real problems come with the story and script. This really is just Snyder's love-letter to Aliens. So many of the story beats, even parts of the script, are blatant rip-offs. It wouldn't be so bad, if it at least worked. There have been numerous rip-offs, nods, homages, etc. To Aliens since its release. Some are fun and some just take it too far. This takes it too far...There's also a heavy dash of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, but again, where Snyder falls over is in lacking any of the story or character set up that both Aliens and GoM have in spades. Those films manage to very efficiently and quickly establish memorable and distinctive characters. In GoM's case, with a far shorter run-time!Given the budget, talent and time behind this, I expected more, and with the two and a half hour the run-time, there's no excuse for the boring characterisations.Probably the most blatant Aliens character rip-off is the 'outsider' to the group, hired by the man who is funding their mission. He's very much Carter J. Burke. He sells people out for the profit, and even has a moment when he shuts a door on everyone else. This is where the bad writing comes in. In Aliens, Burke had motivation for these moments. A) He saw potential profit in the Aliens, so wanted to sneak some back in Ripley and Newt, and B) he was a coward who ran off and hid. Shutting the door on everyone else was not about stopping them, but about being selfish and attempting to save himself. His alter-ego in Army of the Dead does the same actions (he even does the door-closing twice!) but without sufficient motivation. He does it when he would stand a better chance of survival _with_ the people he's shutting out, and does it out of sheer need to be a theatrical chuckling villain.It's also a movie that relies on that old horror movie trope of 'stupid people have to do stupid things to move the plot along, because we can't think of a better excuse'. In one scene, the Burke-a-like first betrays someone for being a little suspicious of him. They're creeping through a mass of sleeping zombies, and he throws a glow stick in the wrong direction to mislead her. She has waited so long before following him (for no particular reason), that she doesn't see this deception. Obviously she gets attacked by zombies as a result, and this is when Burke-a-like does his first cackling ""Haha! I've shut a door on you, so you're screwed!"" moment. But wait! That's not the end of it... The woman manages to survive long enough to break through a window right beside the rest of the team, still un-bitten, and they all just stand there waiting for her to be eaten! They don't even react besides her one friend. And with her dying words, does she give away the traitor? No. Clearly she's just not that bothered.Later, we have a mind-numbingly stupid moment when it's revealed that Burke-a-like is after the true prize: the head of an alpha zombie (as opposed to facehuggers), worth far more than the money they're attempting to steal. What makes this all so utterly stupid, is that when the characters first entered Las Vegas, they sacrificed a team member as an offering to this same alpha zombie, in order to get safe-passage. They could have taken the head of the zombie at that same moment, and immediately turned around and left, making the rest of the movie completely redundant!Talking of the sacrificial team member (henceforth STM), this is another case of bad writing. We, the audience, see some earlier events to imply that STM is in fact a sleaze ball. Although he comes over as an a-hole, only the guide (who sacrifices him) knows he is such a sleaze ball. So what happens when she shoots him in the leg and quickly explains to everyone that they need a sacrifice? They just go with it! So from the team's perspective, they now have a guide who would shoot any one of them at a moment's notice, to appease the zombies. Bautista's character could have at least grabbed her and threatened to kill her for so casually killing a team member (not to mention giving away their position without warning). Then, once she explained, maybe, _maybe_, let her off with a warning that he'll keep an eye on her, and stop her if she steps out of line again. Instead, the team just carry on as if nothing happened. As if to say ""Oh, right, you sacrificed a member of the team to a gruesome and painful death, so we can keep going? Sure thing. Where to next?""Lastly, the whole final action scene is reliant on Bautista's idiot daughter running off to try and save someone. His daughter is effectively Newt, to Bautista's Ripley. Again, this is where the writing misses the mark. Newt wasn't captured because she was stupid. In this, Newt-a-like is an idiotic woman who risks everyone's lives and actually causes both the death of the pilot, her father, and (presumably in the final crash) the woman she was rescuing.One thing I will give them... A lot of people have complained about the character who survived the nuclear blast at the end. Yes, he was in a bank vault, but the thought is that he should have died from radiation poisoning once he came out. However, it is revealed that he is slowly turning into a zombie, so it's reasonable to assume that it is the zombie virus (or whatever it is) that has kept him going. Having said that, it is again another stupid moment, because the implication is that this individual will then unleash the zombie apocalypse once again on the world! All because of this inept team of half-wits.It took three sittings to bother getting through this, just as casual viewing. It's pretty bad and, I hate to say it, I hope they don't waste any more time, money or effort turning it into the proposed trilogy that is apparently planned.",Army of the Dead

She gave no consideration to the rest of the group she didn't care That her selfish decision would put the rest of the group in danger, knowing that her father would want to come after her. All she wanted to do was fill her own selfish needs. It is truly and example of many narcissist in our country today. Whatever I need to do to make myself feel better even if it cost someone else. In the end her selfish move cost her dad's life and the pilots life, and to top it off she didn't even accomplish what she went off on her own to do. The actress that played the narcissist has a very keen ability to take on role that make you want to lose your lunch.The movie was predictable and even more so was the daughter character, the father should've knocked her out and went on without her.

If there's an overarching lesson in this movie, it's the importance of keeping your word and being there for loved ones, because too often it's a late realization.Dave Bautista was at risk of being typecast as a brute in Guardians, Bond and other outings.

458,AxProductions,"Not great, Not bad, Just there",6,2 June 2021,"I'll start off with the great things about this movie, first of all, the use of visual effects throughout the movie is great, cgi or otherwise. They fit the vibe, and especially the costume design is brilliant.The story however does not make much sense, it's something that needs a lot more context, and maybe could have made a good episode in a series, but not an entire movie. It's definitely drawn out to a pretty big extent, and the story could have been told in 1hr to 1hr 30 mins at most. I don't know if there is a previous film that explains certain parts of this film. I also don't think there is enough screen time between Father and Daughter to make that part of the film land right.Now onto the biggest gripe everyone seems to have with this film, the cinematography. Now, it really isn't as bad as everyone says, some of the shots throughout are genuinely impressive composition wise, like, look at that shot where scott dies at the end, insane wide shot, like damn, that looks insane, there are some genuinely beautiful shots in this film, however, the cinematography falls apart in a technical way. The budget they had to spend on set design, it's sad to see such a shallow depth of field hide all of it. Sure it looked great at the start, though very soft, I liked the concept. There are definitely some shots that work really well with the shallowness, however most of the time I wish they stopped down to at least T2.8 so that I could see what the hell people looked like rather than constantly looking at the lenses chromatic aberrations. I also don't like how many handheld shots there are, though I am a David Fincher fan so that may be part of the problem. The dead pixels are also really funny as I thought it was my monitor every time, until they cut to a scene with a B-cam. Also, don't blame the AC for missing focus, it was an f 0.95 lens on a bloody red monstro LF sensor. Yes they used photography glass on a film with a 70 mill budget...The acting, in my eyes, wasn't awful, but nothing to right home about, sometimes the moments even hit pretty well, I feel like the acting felt off at points due to the script being totally shocking and full of cliche sayings. I do however like the way the film isn't scared to kill off main characters, something I miss now that I mostly watch series. Character development because of that is non existent though. The ending is pretty fun though

473,thefoochie,Good zombie fun,8,20 May 2021,"This was a pleasant surprise. I went in the movie with no expectations, and boy did I enjoy it.I really liked how the movie was more of a heist movie, instead of the typical survival movie.The characters were fine. The daughter was annoying at times, but at least she didn't act reckless and jeopardize the mission. My favorite character was the German dude, he was funny.Of course, the action was great. Thankfully, the movie didn't have too many scenes of just talking. Nope, it jumps straight into the action. Because of this, I was almost never bored during the whole 150 minute runtime.Overall, a good movie that I would definitely recommend!",Army of the Dead
474,Shadowboy_25cm,Solid Popcorn-Movie with Style over Substance,6,5 August 2021,"Zack Snyder returns to his beginnings (debut film: Dawn of the Dead, 2004) and makes a zombie movie. But not just any zombie movie, that would be too lame. But combines the zombie theme with the Heist theme and finished is: Army of the Dead.Not so easy.When I first heard about Zack Snyder making yet another zombie movie, I remembered his great remake ""Dawn of the Dead"" and thought, cool, this will be a fine thing. The trailer (although I'm absolutely not a fan of trailers) was also fun.After I have now seen ""Army of the Dead"", unfortunately came the disillusionment:
A technically, audio-visually well made film, a playful soundtrack with cool cover versions of well-known songs (""Sucker Punch"" sends its regards), some handmade effects, a lot of CGI, a lot of shooting. You might think, what could go wrong? It's all there for a great movie.The beginning of the film alone is a stupid pretext for the premise: Zombies in Las Vegas. Well, the premise may be stupid. There are enough movies that have a bad premise and develop splendidly as they go along. Given.Las Vegas is totally sealed off. No one goes in, no one comes out, so the zombies are only in Las Vegas. And of all places, a hired troop has to go in to do a job. Of course, some of them are veterans who killed plenty of zombies in Las Vegas before Las Vegas was sealed off.Etc, etc...Besides all the great technical make, the movie limps on the story, on the characters. Unfortunately, the film is completely lacking in suspense, offers no surprises (maybe one, but it won't be revealed), some characters are rather caricatures and very one-dimensional, so they soon start to get annoying; some plot points are so predictable that you can already see them coming miles downwind, and for me as a viewer, the film offers little that is surprising or lasting, where I think, yeah, cool, I can watch it again.If you're just in the mood for a no-brainer with cool visuals, cool music and lots of gunplay, blood and some gore, this popcorn movie is recommended.(Overall, the film reminded me of the story, the structure and many scenes of a much better, great and legendary film of the 80s: ""Aliens"" by James Cameron. If you haven't seen that one, watch ""Aliens"" instead of this one).",Army of the Dead
475,natemansur,Netflix lost a bet,1,25 May 2021,This script was so bad that Las Vegas would rather lose money during the covid pandemic than let them film in it. Now add a bunch of crappy actors and Zach Snyder. A 3 year old could have made a better film.,Army of the Dead
476,cary_howe,"Stupid, stupid, stupid movie",2,21 May 2021,"I would have given it 5 stars instead of four but come on, the entire script is ripped off of other films and they did a bad job of stealing. Towards the end they even ripped off Aliens! No, I just removed another point for ripping off story so it's down to 3 stars. Why so few? NO EXCUSES! They had plenty of money and several of the cast are good actors with most of the rest solid so it's all on the writer and director for this embarrassing train wreck. You make a film like this for 3 mill and it ends up on scifi channel, but if you're Netflix you'll spend 20X or in this case more for roughly the same film. This film was as plausible as Sharknado! Towards the end I think they manage to out do the Raiders 4 refrigerator scene for shear silliness. Please tell me the writer was stoned out his head? I'd hate to think he wrote this hot mess while he was straight? Just remember they spent 70 million on this disaster. You could have made 70 good films for that much. No, they lost another star for having a 70 million budget and spending a buck fifty on the script!",Army of the Dead

Army Of The Dead might not be the worst film of the year so far but it's definitely the most dull. Just another bad Zack Snyder film that should be ignored. Avoid.",Army of the Dead
479,zanghi_james,Army of the Dead is great!,8,23 May 2021,"I, like a lot of people, still say that Zack Snyder got dealt a bad hand by Warner Bros and DC Comics, especially after giving them over ten years of solid action films that were all wild rides. Would It be great if he could finish his Justice League series? Yes. But it appears he has found a better production company in Netflix who are more interested in producing his totally gonzo action films. And it works.Army of the Dead is a pretty fantastic film. From the opening shot at Area 51 with those two UFOs watching the convoy, there are plenty of little tidbits for the upcoming prequels and spin-offs that Snyder has planned (and hopefully a sequel, too!).The action is wild and fun and most of the deaths in the film are impressive and emotional (and in the case of human bad guys, satisfying).The acting isn't incredible for the most part, and the script is a little similar to such films like Aliens and Resident Evil, but those cliches work for a reason, after all. Yes, Ella Purnell's character doesn't exactly fit into the main story, but I enjoyed her story-arc. Dave Batista shows some great acting chops and shows he is one of the best action stars out there. His character had some great fight scenes but also some fine emotional scenes, including a major one right out of Snyder's directorial debut (Dawn of the Dead).Tom Holkenborg's score isn't as epic as Justice League or Fury Road, but it isn't his worst, either. The song choices in the soundtrack are great. I really thought it was a nice hat nod to Justice League in the opening title sequence with Alison Crowe singing a song.The characters of the Alpha Zombies, especially the leader couple, were incredible. I really felt for them throughout the entire movie and saw them as sympathetic monsters. They sort of are like Frankenstein's Monster and the Bride. They just want to exist in their own little corner of the world. Sort of like the zombies, reportedly and appropriately, in Romero's Land of the Dead.The Good Points of the Movie:
Movie took the time to establish the characters and show some great action.Dave Batista kicking major butt but also being quite emotional.Zombie TigerHolkenborg's score. Love his music.The Alpha Zombie CoupleGreat callbacks to Romero's Zombies filmsInteresting Teasers and Easter Eggs that set this film up to be part of a larger cinematic universe.Quoting Joseph Campbell at the end.The Bad Points of the Movie:
Not enough explanation for various plot pointsElla Purnell's character's friend going missing at the end is a major plot hole.Overall:
Army of the Dead is great and I can't wait for more! Keep making films Zack Snyder!",Army of the Dead
480,Francois84,Dross,1,22 May 2021,"Seriously, who actually likes this nonsensical mindless rubbish?! It's excruciatingly bad. It's not even a guilty pleasure. It's not even entertaining. Now his 'Dawn of the Dead' remake was great B-movie fun. But this is just plain bad. The humour is so forced that the film is desperately trying to make you laugh but fails miserably. And there's too many moments of exposition for characters I couldn't care less about, during moments of imminent danger where you wouldn't just be stood around chewing the fat, bearing your soul, or trying to make up for years of not being present as a parent. Zack Snyder has plumbed new depths and has somehow received a relatively positive reception for this travesty of filmmaking. It really does make me despair for the film industry that this can be made and worse, be liked by so many people. Save 180 minutes of your life and avoid.",Army of the Dead

That's when this started going down hill for me. The whole heist while in an zombie apocalypse storyline was creative and enjoyable. Like ok, I'm down for the plot twist, but I'm going to need more elaboration on the undead being able to procreate. Like wth!! The acting was alright. Dave Bautista is an alright actor, I'm just going to need for him to emote a bit better. Ana De La Reguera is my queen. I absolutely loved her acting she never misses. The rest of the cast was ok. I guess. And if I'm being honest with the amount of people we had to follow I truly could not remember any of their names at the end of the movie.Do I recommend to a friend?Meh.

It's not really rocket science, but Snyder in this case completely underestimates the intelligence of his audience.",Army of the Dead
483,Camerenth,A bombastic zombie thrill ride,8,25 May 2021,This is a fun and entertaining movie through and through. The action is top tier even for Zac Snyder. The plot is straightforward on the surface but with many added threads that make it just that much more interesting if you aren't already on board for the zombies. The cast is well diverse and is excellently lead by Dave Bautista who shows his acting range. Only gripe I would have is that certain plot threads are cut unexpectedly to refocus scenes for action. Overall a great time to be a zombie fan.,Army of the Dead
484,smashthecontrolmachine,Zombie Tigers & More oh my!,10,23 May 2021,"This zombie hunting film is one fun, action packed thrill fest. Not sure what all the complaining is about from other reviewers, they needed to just sit back & enjoy the ride! Zack Snyder isn't trying to reinvent the wheel here in terms of these types of movies, there would honestly be no need to. These types of flicks are meant to be pure entertainment & my rating of a '10' is based on that Army of the Dead delivers just that. It is set in Las Vegas, it has larger than life zombie battle scenes, is has over the top characters, is has violence, gore, guns, explosions, drama & even a scene stealing zombie tiger. Yes, you read that right, 'Valentine' is a zombie tiger that could get its own stand alone film, it's that badass. So I don't see a reason not to love this living dead motion picture romp for what it is - as it doesn't pretend to be anything other than that - it is afterall, just plain enjoyable, relentless, unapologetic & bold zomstomping fun!",Army of the Dead
485,pirlo2004,A confused mess,4,23 May 2021,"The film can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a horror, a comedy or a family drama and as a viewer I found it disconcerting.The pacing was terrible, I don't mind a long movie, but this manages to seem rushed whilst taking forever, again, disconcerting... Which seems to be the theme.Visually it looks good, as you would expect from a ZS movie and there are a few decent 'holy moly' moments, but for the most part the action just didn't bind. Also, the Dolby vision didn't really seem up to scratch.There seems to be a lot of music randomly placed throughout, which again didn't land, like nearly ALL of the comedy moments.I liked the fact that they tried to do something different with the zombies eg intelligence and communication skills, but parkour took it a bit too far and there were far too many emotions, Zombies in love? This was the same for the human characters, to soppy in places. It's not that I don't like a movie that fleshes out emotion, but I never got to care about any of the characters so the slow emotional scenes just seemed boring.The mishmash of androgynous characters didn't work either, I know it's trendy these days but none of them had any chemistry, it had a real Suicide Squad feel to it.I'm a huge fan of ZS and amongst the minority that Loved BvS and thought Man of Steel was an absolute masterpiece, and of course his Dawn of the Dead remake. Other films such as Watchmen and Sucker Punch admittedly took a second viewing before I realised their class and beauty. But honestly, I don't think I could sit through this again, and that's a real shame because I was really, really looking forward to it.",Army of the Dead

Unfortunately it had a slowly paced storyline, too many characters with no backstory, not enough action, zero suspense and tension and it wasn't even very funny...It really missed on all marks... It could have been as good as Zombieland, let's be honest that's the vibe we as the audience were hoping for/expecting. There were so many moments that were missed, and could have been epic zombie/action sequences, but by the time you got to the third act you really didn't care that much...The sequence of trying to open the safe, we know from the trailer that this occurs, should have been tense and had the characters overcoming challenges with his Moir to release said tension. Instead you get a succession of the same joke, and no tension or 'payoff' as an audience member... The best bit of the whole film was the slow motion opening title sequences...!Still very strange that with such a good blend of ideas and sub-genre's that they couldn't really make it work...

494,sithstalker-75789,Dumb ass zombie flick,3,1 June 2021,"If you can turn off the rational part of ur brain then it's a cheesy popcorn flick I suppose. There are some enormous glaring plot holes like at the start when the Aplha gets released the commanding officer acts like a 14 year old stoner, takes all the time in the world to relay the urgent message to his team team then should have evacuated everyone into all the remaining working military vehicles and High tailed it.But alas his team moves towards the open cage (after a couple of honeymooners crash head on into the lead vehicle)
For some bizarre reason he grabs his only remaining soldier from a fully functioning military vehicle and climbs up a bank and thinks yea we've lost it after this monster has just eviserated his entire crew.Why not get back in your working vehicle drive away and have the alpha zombie chase them and track them down? At least that would have been believable but na we'll climb a bank and jump over it and hope Alpha zombie doesn't get us.Look I'm not expecting perfection from a zombie flick but at least don't treat the viewer like a complete idiot. I'm not expecting black hawk down or anything like that but cmon this sets the pace for the entire film. Then we get zombie tigers and later we see Zombie Alpha riding a zombie horse. Wtf?? Why?? Like I said turn that brain off nothing makes sense.I ain't gonna spoil the entire film coz that's not fair but I find it highly ironic that the productionn company is called Stones Quarry because this film is dumber than a bag of rocksDave Batista has a moment with his wife and daughter watching on and it's nice to see him show a but more emotional range it's actually quite a well done scene imo. But I'm a bit baised being a massive Batista fan.The rest of the film is try with no plan and try to get the money.Personally imo u wanna good zombie film watch train to busan and its sequel peninsula. 28 days and 28 weeks later these are all brilliant zombie films.If like me you love your Atmos sound watch wheelman and the highwayman. Again amazing films with the added bonus of atmos on Netflix. Even the atmos sound couldn't save this film for me. 5/10 is my score and that's only coz I'm a Dave Batista fan if he wasn't init then probably a 4. I'm loving atmos films and shows on Netflix like Peaky Blinders, Top Boy, Daredevil and Extraction just name a film. Watch this film tho make up your own mind but didn't cut the mustard for me.TLDR - Generic zombie flick no real back stories except Batista . So for most of the main characters it's a bit difficult for me to invest in them.

Generic bad guy with ulterior motives hires a crew we know nothing about for a heist. Heist goes wrong, yada yada. The thing is, the movie kind of tries to be both serious and schlocky, rather than just choosing a lane and staying in it.

505,cyguration,"Nothing memorable, and lots of masculine women...",4,22 May 2021,"If you enjoy your action flicks where all the women act more like men than the men do, then you'll enjoy Army of the Dead.The movie starts pretty stupid, but most fans of the genre expect as much. What we don't expect is for the movie to stay stupid, and that's sort of what happens here.It's filmed well enough, and the locations look decent, and the cinematography is okay. The sound design isn't bad, but all the CGI effects look awful and dated.The most important thing in an action-oriented zombie flick is the ACTION. And here, there isn't a whole lot of it.The most action you get is from the opening credits montage, which showcases all of these heroic and kick-butt moments that you expect to see showcased throughout the rest of the film... only they aren't.There's only one actual action scene that's cool but it doesn't involve any of the main top-billed characters, which makes no sense to me.If you're expecting Dave Bautista to steal the spotlight with a lot of cool fight scenes and zombie killing, your expectations are too high. In fact, Bautista does a lot more physical action in the movie Bushwick than he does here. That's no lie.Most of the film is carried by very masculine women in the hero roles with the exception of Bautista and Omari Hardwick, the latter of whom isn't really involved in any memorable action scenes in the movie either.In retrospect I don't really know who this movie was made for. Fans of Bautista and Hardwick get shortchanged greatly. The two look awesome in their roles, but they don't do much heavy lifting.The film clocks in at two-and-a-half hours yet the actual action sequences are far and few between, with nearly an entire 40 minutes going by before things really get moving.If you're going into this thinking it's Ocean's 11 just with zombies. Think again. The actual heisting makes up for an extremely limited amount of screentime and is almost negligible in the grand scheme of things.I really like Bautista and Hardwick as actors, but this film does neither actor any justice. Majority of the heroism is given to the female actresses who most people going into a movie like this have never heard of. Worst yet is that they all seemed to copy-and-paste a very similar female template here, aping Ripley and Vasquez; but lacking the charm, charisma, and believability of either.If you just want a zombie flick to pass two-and-a-half hours... watch the original 1978 Dawn of the Dead. It's an amazing film well worth every minute, with believable characters and great action sequences.If you wanted a more modern zombie film to waste two-and-a-half-hours, try Zack Snyder's 2004 Dawn of the Dead, which is a far superior film to this one.

511,ksharath1999,200 million for a suicide mission is too much of an offer to refuse!,7,4 August 2021,"Zack Snyder's Army of dead gets a strong start followed by a weird model sequence with a song which is highly subjective. The movie almost takes 50 minutes to start the real play till then we are introduced to the characters. The movie is applaudable for its artistic take, cinematography and background tracks. Army Of Dead has immense potential to satisfy R rated movie lovers who was quenching for R rated quality stuff for a long time. The accelerated pace after the one hour run time and the intensity certain scenes provides is yet another factor to watch out for. The final act was really intense due to all the R rated stuff and twists elevating the whole movie to a greater extent. Coming to action sequences, most of them are well placed and highly enjoyable, My personal favourite is the one women v many sequence. All the actors have performed their parts giving the film the genre feel it deserves. Last but not the least, surprise deaths and twists feels like the core part of the movie and succeeds on its course.The viewer doesn't feel any attachment to any of the characters which is the biggest flaw of the movie. Zack accidentally or intentionally avoids all the savage scary scenes to provide the movie the face of a entertainer. The movie is extremely questionable at times and might become not everyone's cup of tea due to a lot of factors.In the end, Zack Snyder's Army Of Dead or better call it Suicide Squad stands out among other movies from Zombie genre. Asking anything from a movie from zombie genre is a crime so keep your brains out and enjoy the zombie kill.Rating:69%",Army of the Dead

513,julianmarku,Move over Micheal Bay. Scott Snyder is taking over...,5,23 May 2021,I honestly wanted to give this movie a 6 because Dave Batista is holding this movie up but holy schnitzel... even I can't do wonders.Now if you like special effects this movie might be an 7 maybe a 8. But I am a story guy and this movie rips pages out of the script like toilet paper. So many plotholes and plotshields that make no sense. So many cliches. So many questions that you will definitly be left wondering if Scott Snyder has finally cracked and decided to go full Micheal Bay!This is a great chance for Dave Batista to be the lead man of his own action movie and... I honestly wish him luck on his next project because I hope this won't be the last action movie he leads. The guy is good provided that he has the right people writing his scripts. Not this movie... not so much.,Army of the Dead
514,gelmcchristop,"By a true filmmaker, still somehow mediocre",7,8 August 2021,"Out of the many fancy directors out there, Snyder is one of the few who deserves to be attributed the term ""filmmaker"". From writing to cinematography to directing, he knows to bring his own style to his films, and Army of the Dead is no exception. The blurry lens filters, the beautiful lens flares and the wide apertures definitely make the movie one of its own kind, far from the forgettable blockbusters tiring audiences these days.The post production as well falls nothing short of the highest expectations. The editing is surprisingly smooth, and the sound design on-point, featuring some of the most satisfying gunshot sounds, as well as the zombie grunts being somewhat meaningful. The vfx for the most part is truly solid (I pity the artists for having to run dozens of flesh and blood simulations, but the outcome was impressive), and it's no easy task distinguishing between practical makeup and digital enhancements.The story itself is miles ahead of the idiotic piles of nonsense other zombie movies like WWZ have bored us with. The characters are a touch flat and baseline, however they are definitely intriguing enough to maintain the attention of the audience. Most importantly however the take on the zombies is what makes the movie special. Instead of portraying them as hordes of senseless creatures, Snyder builds a society around them, effectively turning them into a new lifeform we explore as we progress further into the movie.So far so good. But the film just doesn't work. There are a number of clear reasons behind this, and i many more obscure i am assured. First of all, the trailer is a disaster (if you haven't watched it yet excellent, just go watch the movie first). The core issue is that it revealed 90% of the zombie community the writer struggled so much to retain secret. Secondly, the characters don't seem to influence the plot. At all. They willingly hop in the mess, shoot some dead guys and that's all. The story progresses entirely on its own. Lastly, the zombie community... it doesn't work. Though the revelation of the ins and outs of it sets a solid foundation for the movie, it ends up revealing a snapshot in the evolution of the community. Literally not a word on how things got there. So it all ends up feeling empty...",Army of the Dead

The plot is obviously predictable as we see through the trailer. All the actors involved play their respective role aptly, especially the female characters.The action begins following an hour as the story requires some investment. The director give arcs and offer bends to its characters. Overall, the film is adventurous. Cinematography is something to be noted here, the color toning is really ""A"" rated.Coming into BGM and soundtrack it is incredible, Be it Viva Las Vegas or ""Zombie"" by The Cranberries, everything fits the scene impeccably.About the audience it may divide as Snyder fans will laud this by Dawn of the Dead 2.0 and others will characterize this as another post-apocalypse zombie movie.This movie demonstrates that old is yet gold with the amount of big budgets and big names involved this maybe a block buster hit and if not then it will be a cult classic for years to come.",Army of the Dead

DOD was a classic and a different type of movie. But this was not a bad movie. It doesn't follow all of the regular old zombie rules, except you still gotta shoot em in the head. But in this, the zombies are smarter, faster, stronger, can communicate, ride domesticated zombie animals and even follow a king and queen zombie as their leaders.But really....how many more ways could you keep showing the same old zombie movie and make it original? People trying to survive, lumbering (or sprinting in some cases) zombies closing in, lots of shooting and gore, everyone but a one or two survive, roll the credits. Let's face it, we needed something different. And this is different.Snyder is great and I love his movies. Bautista is slowly but surely replacing the Rock as the new alpha wrestler-turned-actor. Most of the other actors are a bit unknown, or at least to me, but they do good. The safe-cracking guy turns in a good performance and the blond chick that leads them in plays her part well.It's full of action and gore and it's a little over the top in some places. The biggest question you're left with is, if the military really wanted to get ahold of one of the intelligent Zombie heads to weaponize zombies, why didn't they just send in a couple of hundred marines, instead of bothering with ragtag mercenaries, and kill the queen or king zombie before they nuked the city? I mean, they're all contained, its not like they are going to be running off anywhere to hide or anything.But you should overlook that little headscratcher and enjoy the movie for what it is.

Of course there's some sequences that seem familiar because there are a bloody lot of zombie films and comics out there so it is absolutely imposible not to repeat some stuff, however, then there are the things you never dreamed of that are put out there and you just kind of shake your head and say, I didn't think of that.

Like the first 10 minutes was already ridiculous... that's why I recommend this for a one time watch... go in it without expectations of this being deep, touching, dramatic and certainly try not to nitpick how bad it is... just watch the gore (if you're into the blood, this has sooooo much blood), ridiculousness, predictable plot.. and just zombie killings. Just take it like a light easy watch with some popcorn and beer.

528,ethantoy,Peculiar Zombie film,7,24 May 2021,"Army of the Dead is directed by Zack Snyder, who's had a history of zombie films before. Dawn of the Dead in my opinion, was a phenomenal remake and great zombie film. As far as Army of the Dead goes, I'd say much less. Army of the Dead albeit, is a great action movie to watch, yet it is incredibly poor in its direction for zombies. I was quite disappointed and irked by the portrayal of the zombies, and felt really gassed up on something that I felt I was missing in the story. The movie looks great, it's a lot of fun, and it's enjoyable for the most part. Somehow though, I was more invested in the characters and banter they had more than I was over the element of horror that is fundamentally a part of zombie films. It seemed so unique of an idea, but it felt rehashed and misguided. It was very skewed and strung out to feel empty almost. The practical effects were awesome, the location and set piece was awesome, the effects were awesome- but the story and plot? Absolutely revolting. Whatever it was, that the writer and Zach Snyder had in mind for story, it was completely off the charts and ridiculous to the point that I wouldn't even consider the zombies, actual zombies. It felt very Planet of the Apes to me, and that is so odd and peculiar to me that a zombie film feels more like a talking race of apes than flesh-eating, vicious monsters. Aside from my gripes with the zombies, I have to say Army of the Dead is a lot of fun, and it's enjoyable as hell. Real zombie fans may be disappointed because this film touches no where near what Dawn of the Dead did, but it certainly will be a cult film with a following.",Army of the Dead

Which in my opinion is an incredible win. This definitely feels like an injection of life into the genre while also utilising the loveable tropes we've come to expect from a zombie movie. You'll find plenty of run 'n gun, zombie-killing action with a high stakes, against the clock feel which makes for great tension. An entire lore is established within the story, and while it doesn't explain every question it sets up, I feel enough was answered not to leave the film feeling too bloated, while remaining mysterious and open ended.

She was the main reason why everyone was killed, over one person who really didn't have a chance to begin with and ending up dying anyways. Because of her selfish ways, it costed everyone their lives. Now let's talk about Scott Ward, who was denser than rocks. His charity had to development and basically aided his daughters irresponsible behavior and wasted time sensitive moments by rambling and trying to have heart to hearts at the worst possible moments. The charity Martin could have literally cut off the head of the zombie without the help of a whole squad and ram back to the container fortress with ease instead of wasting time over something his boss didn't even want to begin with.

It stars Dave Bautista and bunch of others.This time the zombie outbreak isn't worldwide, like many other films, it is instead focusing on Las Vegas. I like the idea of this and the way this film is going.Now the formula of a team in a survival movie must contain a muscular guy, an annoying kid, a strong woman, a talkative helper and some guys who no one knows why they're there.Zack Snyder is the director of photography apparently. I felt this film try too hard to be good at cinematography. There is close-up shots of actors very frequently to the point it starts to become annoying and unecessary.Dave Bautista is great. I like his character a lot. He is not a muscular idiot like the ones in Bloodshot. Now people are saying his daughter is a terrible character. She's not that bad really. Or maybe I just got used to annoying characters.Critics and audiences are way too harsh on the movie. It doesn't take it self too seriously. You can tell by the comical and over-the-top gore.

It would have been a more successful mission if the daughter had just stayed home and got a mani pedi. They get the safe open and then don't even TRY to take the money. This could have easily been a 100 min film (instead of.148) Didn't need the wedding opening, didn't need any of the zombie king/queen bs, didn't need any of the daughter plot line.

548,jonny_mcclatch,"Awful, super predictable, bad acting and pointlessly long.",1,1 September 2021,"I'll admit i'm not a massive fan of zombie movies in general, there are plenty that are still watchable or at least somewhat original but woah this one was awful for so many reasons. Where to start is a little daunting, I mean right off the bat they start with a giant cliche. The US military yet again carrying out covert operations, bringing a crate with ""secret"" contents to Area 51. It of course escapes easily and starts to infect people in Las Vegas?But don't worry they've managed to trap all those infected within the city and they're going to nuke them all so the movie is rightfully ended there and then? Of course not, a small group of expendables/generic heist members with the usual elite skills are going in there (obviously) for the worlds thinnest reason. For some reason a business man has just remembered he left his $200 million in the worlds most secure underground safe which he also can't remember the password to or something? This is endorsed by the fact they had to seek out supposedly one of the few super safe crackers on earth, so this thing is really tough and somewhere that is near impossible to get to... one would almost say it would certainly survive a nuclear explosion but this movie has two and a half hours to kill.Not content without his $200 million and needing a human walnut to carry it (worth noting in large bills this would weigh about 2200lbs and they're bringing schoolbags to carry it), so he's willing to give the ever mumbling Dave Bautista a full quarter of this money for the privilege of carrying out this Las Vegas job dodging zombies and a nuclear explosion alarm clock. And if you think, Dave Bautista huh? I hope he carries out his world famous signature move the Batista Bomb during this may as well be three hour movie? You can rest assured he absolutely doesn't which is about the biggest curve ball this movie is going to throw you.Before they begin businessman Tanaka tells them to take his pal Martin in with them just for observation reasons and not to stab everyone in the back later. They head to a zombie quarantine camp just outside the city where we meet another three plotlines, Dave's daughter who asks to be taken into the city so of course he says no (but don't worry she comes along anyway because otherwise meeting her would be pointless). We meet short haired badass quirky woman who everyone instantly thinks is infected because she is weird and vague for absolutely no reason other than to appear to be infected especially because she's the person they have to ask for help from later. Finally a camp security guard who we are assured is human garbage, he threatens women and takes bribes and this is very important to remember.So anyway they decided all these three people are great to add to their already overly large team because $50 million is too much for Dave and he needs to try split it or at least raise the body count for the movie. Dave asks his daughter to promise not to leave his sight at any point so there's only about 15 minutes until that happens because Ella Purnell is the best actor in this movie and does her best to not be in most of it. But they enter the city and instantly short hair woman injures creepy security guard man but it's fine because we've already established about 50 times that he's garbage and therefore absolutely fine to use him as human bait. He quickly gets bitten but will return later to be woman threatening zombie garbage once more and die a well deserved death.But for now everyone has made it into the building with a safe underneath it, but oh no we have to navigate through a room filled with sleeping zombies without making any noise? Of course nothing would cause that to go pear shaped and Martin only there for observation doesn't begin to do anything suspicious...Several dead characters 'so pointless i've failed to mention them' later, they're at the safe. Long story short Martin stabs everyone in the back and locks them inside the room and one man gets locked inside the safe itself. The money gets mostly destroyed making the entire original premise pointless. But also there was a king and queen zombie, Lily short hair at some point stole the queens head and Martin now wants to have it like he's Billy from Jurassic Park III stealing raptor eggs. King zombie turns up angry that he doesn't have queen zombies head oh and she was also pregnant for some reason. So Martin dies and she (Lily) lures angry zombie man with this head and dies the last of i'd say three sacrificial deaths?! But destroys the head first to annoy everyone who wanted it and end another pointless plotline that was a literal dead end.Dave and his daughter the only two characters we have been made to care about for this whole movie make it to another character who has been on a roof excitingly fixing a helicopter for the entire movie until this point apart from pretending to fly off and leave them (you know the old fake out), she flies the two to relative safety for a good three seconds before Bautista wrestles end boss zombie out of the chopper all just before the nuke explodes and before Geeta quickly crashes the helicopter to make sure she doesn't make it to the end of the movie.Dave and his daughter have a lovely chat about how they have some of the remaining money and are going to live forever. But uh oh, he was bitten and has just enough time to finish his heartwarming speech before he zombifies and gets shot by his daughter who cries, takes the money and flies right out of this movie.So that's all the loose threads tied up, or is it? Remember how we sent a team to get the money from the safe before the nuke destroyed it and the money, but one guy got locked in there? Funnily enough he survives along with some money because it's undeground and a safe and luckily there is no remaining radiation from nuclear fallout so he can just walk out completely unharmed.So he survived the blast and has a decent amount of money, doing what any of us would, hires a private plane to go party in Mexico City but uh oh he was secretly bitten (thank god they didn't literally do this five minutes ago) also don't try to work out logisitics here, but he was bitten before he went into the safe, everyone else left had a couple fights and deaths, some people got on a chopper then Dave fights King zombie and gets bitten then quickly turns into a zombie shortly after that. Meanwhile my man here sat through all that, escapes the safe, hires a plane, gets on the plane and half way to Mexico, notices he has been bitten about half a day ago but has waited until this most inconvenient time to start to be a zombie mid flight. It's safe to assume that either he waits patiently until they land in Mexico City or he did his zombie pilots license and I swear this better not be a setup for a sequel.That concludes this Zack Snyder ""movie"" that tries too hard to be an overly stylish all action gambit with endless twists you see coming from a mile away and scenes that came from nowhere and go nowhere.",Army of the Dead

But wow, I do not know what the hell happened. I only liked the costume and makeup. The script/dialogue was made terribly; the characters lacked depth (and some even lacked common sense) and the story tried to capture everything where it didn't work out.The movie seemed slow at parts but then rushed through other parts, so the flow wasn't there. I also wasn't sure if the movie was supposed to be funny or serious.

As the movie, cross the intermission- the intent of going in the city changes- way brutal than thoughts. According to the trailer this movie was look like another suicide squad kind of movie but when u see the movie, you will see it is not even close to it. Emotional scenes coming in between- affect the pace of the movie. Which results in loosing interest towards characters n storyline. Average performance by the starcast-Antagonist acting was way better then than the other starcast, but the challenge was no dialogues had been given due to his character as undead.

I've already seen countless people giving bad reviews, because they think the story isn't well-developed and has bad character studies. To all does people I would like to ask: What did you expect? Is the story the most groundbreaking thing ever? God no, but that's not what I came for. I came to see a group of weirdos chop some zombies and grab some money, and I got exactly what I wanted. I honestly think it has some surprisingly emotional moments. They didn't make me cry or anything, but I felt the relationship and the pain between Bautista and Purnell's characters. But then again, it's Zack Snyder. This man has already proven this year that he can humanize a fiction movie with Justice League, so I shouldn't be that surprised. But what I really came for, was the action. I wanted to see Zack Snyder at his best with he's great camera direction and fight scenes. The ending left me a little underwhelmed in terms of an end battle, but it still has so much energy over the entire movie with great battles and fight scenes. The story builds up the tension perfectly and kept me on the edge of my seat. This makes the fight scenes so much better.

The movie shows that actions have consequences but doesnt hold the daughter character to the same standards and gives her a free pass when she is single handedly responsible for the protaganists' demise.The way the coyote died, didnt make any sense since she could have easily got on the chopper and then thrown the head to the zombie king.This ended up being kinda like snuff film where everyone dies.",Army of the Dead

But was it a massively entertaining, rip roaring fun zombie adventure romp at least as good as anything else in the genre? Hell yes!

564,ryanwesthamfan,Overlong Awesome Zombie Film,7,27 May 2021,"The Good- Straightaway the film has a great genre blending concept. When I first heard about this immediately it appealed to me. I enjoy zombie films, I enjoy heist films so it sounds likes something that I would enjoy. Just like that you get some great action and visuals. Even in the first 15 minutes the action blows me away. When you get into the main story you see all different types of zombies and our main characters are all finding different ways to kill zombies. The characters are all written to be these over the top people, they all get some spotlight. If this film sounds like it would appeal to you, you will definitely find something here you will enjoy.The Mixed- The big thing is the movie introduces new zombie mythology. Although it shows you some implications, it didn't exactly lead anywhere by the end of the film.The Bad- I don't think the film needs to be as long as it was, I think if it was half an hour shorter and more faster paced it would of worked a lot better. The script goes for these funny one liners but the humour is very hit and miss some of it works some of it didn't.I went into this films excited, I'm a big Zack Snyder and Dave Bautista fan, I love zombie apocalypse films, I enjoyed a good percentage of films. But it did have it's faults. One of my friends turned it of half way through because it wasn't fun enough and he didn't think there was enough action. I had a good time with it. Overall I would give Army Of The Dead a 7/10 and if you love Zack Snyder or zombie apocalypse films then I would check this one out on Netflix.",Army of the Dead
565,kuner-59029,What a stinker,3,22 May 2021,"This is by far Zack Snyder's worst film, and I say this as someone who generally admires his work. Surprisingly, considering how much input he had in making this film, it feels less like a Zack Synder movie and more of a James Gunn ripoff, which is puzzling, since Zack Snyder is normally leagues above James Gunn.Everything here is a mess: The tone is all over the place, jumping from serious techy heist movie to campy zombie splatter, to wannabe suspense horror to action to blatant Guardians of the Galaxy rip off full of self-referential wink-wink humor and worst of all: music videos which interrupt the flow of the film. On top of this, the color grading is awful, the pacing is inconsistent, the acting is largely terrible (especially the daughter) and the writing is beyond terrible. Score and camera work are banal.There are some trademark Zack Snyder shots (he does the character's face coming in and out of focus with strong bokeh effect ad nauseum), tons of slow motion, some fun gore and the movie does ramp up around the middle, but it's not enough.As an example of how bad the writing is: The team is hired by a casino owner to steal the contents of the casino's safe, yes bring along a safe cracker. The owner could have just given them the code.Idiocy like this runs throughout the script.I'm sad to say, but this movie is near unwatchable, unless you absolutely don't care and just want to see some gore.",Army of the Dead

I liked the setting as it was something not seen before in zombie films, the idea of the Alphas and the tiger.Unfortunately that was the only positives really I took. I feel like they missed a lot of opportunities to make this a really memorable zombie film. They could have done more with the Alphas, explained things a bit better and given more context as to what the King was doing keeping survivors in a room in his hideout. With regards the pregnancy, I don't even want to know the story or logistics behind it but I thought it was a bit comical and out of place.The plot was very predictable which was also disappointing. Certain characters die that you can guess will die. And the ending was also very predictable and a bit too ""Hollywood"".The characters were all dull, half due to writing and half due to poor casting. There was no character development so it just made the deaths of characters fall flat. The most interesting characters and relationship was between the King and Queen alpha in my opinion.I also found it a bit annoying when they would stop to have deep conversations, for example after they have just opened the safe packing the cash to leave, and also right before getting onto the helicopter. The writers just assumed that the audience wouldn't be aware that they were trying to escape before being nuked.And playing zombie at the end... just cheesy and uncalled for... that summed the movie up for me.I really had high hopes with it being directed by Zack Snyder.Overall just disappointing and not a zombie movie that will go down as a modern classic.",Army of the Dead

All the scenes feel so cobbled together. Just like the last cut to finally make a sensible movie out of the material, was left out. And two and a half hours are definitely too long for a movie that has not much to say. I mean, Forrest Gump has the same runtime but has an epic story in contrast.But ""Army of the Dead"" does not want to be a movie like Forrest Gump or Ben Hur. And taken as a fun zombie action movie, it is quite entertaining. But there are also a lot of things which spoil the fun. And so the mildly entertaining movie just becomes a mediocre one.

A millionaire wants zombie head for some unknown reason!A man walks out safe from the place tha was nuked and in the end he doesn't kill himself when he realizes he is infected.Apparently most people in their world think it's so easy to enter a place full of zombies to steal just a small bag of money, so they enter there randomly and gets abducted by zombies (reason, not mentioned why they kept her abducted instead of biting).Saving a random woman Geeta is more important than everything in the world.Before flying, they keep the door to the roof open, then finds enough time to speak some useless dialogues showing their swags, then wastes some more time smiling at each other when technically each one of them gets more than enough time to board helicopter and fly away safely.All this to save Geeta who they doesn't bother about in the end to check if she is alive or dead, no one knows.Then for some random reason the bullet hits the woman riding helicopter, she keeps flying it conveniently for a period of time when she must have died immediately ?Anyway, I think the movie could have been much better if they took zombies seriously like it would be in real world. It felt boring and long.",Army of the Dead

Sucker Punch was just way better and I can't believe he would put something like this out? It is even getting a animated sequel and a prequel film; please don't turn out like this.One of my main problems with the movie is that it awkwardly switches between goofy comedy; at the most serious moments. Then just when you might get some character building, another character does something stupid or dies.Action sequences was good though and the zombies were smartly written, unlike the daughter character.",Army of the Dead

599,bmaschi,"For me, it had a Fatal Flaw",4,6 June 2021,"SPOILERS!I doubt many will agree with me. But this was a missed opportunity for a simple reason.At the beginning the hero had to kill his wife in front of their daughter. This SHOULD have been the reason father and daughter became estranged. She blamed him for her mom's death.Fast forward to the end. The daughter is forced to kill her turning dad. That should have been a loop. She witnessed her dad kill mom and was angry about it. Then, she is forced to do the same by killing her dad and she realizes why he'd done it, and how horribly he felt about it.A nice and tidy loop which I suspect was how it was originally written - and probably changed by the director because, they could. What did we get instead? Silly drama about her being mad at dad because he didn't comfort her after mom's death. So, instead of a deeply dramatic loop, we get silly tripe.Still, it was a zombie movie. And I love zombie movies.",Army of the Dead
600,Snownoise,Zack Snyder can make a bad movie too.,1,29 May 2021,"If there's one thing this movie taught me, then that is, Zack Snyder too can make a bad movie. I get the hate. This movie has a good amount of inconsistencies. Many people probably and already called this movie as, ""plot holes galore"". No surprise there. Why did I watch this movie.? I thought it would be something different because, come on, it's from Zack Snyder. Turns out, it wasn't really. Zombies are slightly different than usual ones, but if I compare them to those from I'm legend, there's no much of significant distinction. Also, the plot and the characters are just as familiar as ketchup bottle in the fridge. I gotta say again, I was really surprised by the fact this movie was written and directed by Zack Snyder. Nobody's perfect, I guess.",Army of the Dead
601,HeroOfTomorrow,Literally unwatchable.,1,21 May 2021,"I applaud anyone who got through more than the first 15 minutes, because that was the point that my girlfriend and I said ""nope!"" and shut it off. Let me break down this garbage into easy-to-understand segments:-visually, this movie is an inexcusable mess. Not only did they apparently forget to light the whole movie; every shot has such a stupidly narrow depth-of-field that 90% of each frame is blurry at all times. It's like optical vomit, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this ugly.-starting your movie off with a scene that shatters any possibility for suspension of disbelief isn't a great plan. You're telling me that highly trained special convoy soldiers with code names can't take a direct order to abort mission, but slowly say ""what do you mean?"" 12 times before replying after one of their trucks literally blew up? You're telling me that they can be attacked by a single assailant without shooting for the first five seconds? Why are the two guys who get away LAUGHING, 2 minutes after their entire squad was murdered? Why does the door to this highly dangerous zombie enclosure open of its own accord? WHY DOES THE TRUCK EXPLODE?-the script was not only unbearably cringe; it made no sense whatsoever. The exposition is 2003-film-student-level. The tone is schizophrenic.Once the security guard made a rectal thermometer joke, we thought ""we're not drunk and insecure and 17 enough to like this, and it's ZERO fun ironically 'cause you can't even see what hell is going on due to that DAMN DEPTH OF FIELD.""Worst movie of the year, and I only saw 15 minutes.",Army of the Dead

605,jacques77,A Flamboyant Feast of Thematic Splendor,9,25 May 2021,"This feature is a good example of, why more and more these days I go against the onslaught of layman reviews and ratings of IMDB .The sheep of the general populous has become addicted to the grain feeding of Hollywood branding and cinema that is nothing more than another sip of the ""new Coca-Cola"" addicted generation of Political Correctness. It's an invasion of entitlement and unoriginality of repeated Marvel narratives over and over like drooling zombies staring at the 8K HDMI screen of gory and bland repetitive jumps, naked breasts swinging while another rendition of Michael Meyers drags his feet toward their inevitable doom.And then there was Zack. A director who understands that a film needs a thematical narrative which goes beyond the brains on the wall and the naked woman and six-pack obsessed gay men (no offence - I am gay myself) and trying to please the eye rather than the mind.As simplistic as it might seem, setting this film in the zombie environment of gambling culture to tell a story about greed, and the ultimate price there is to pay for profits are sheer simplistic genius. Occom would be proud.Then Snyder proceeds to honour all the conventions without being clichéd. Well maybe some people prefer their horror to be another sequel of the same monster doing the same thing for the umptieth time repeatedly. And I can respect that. To each their own. I mean cows eat the same grass every day, so who am I to argue.What I find a shame is the myriad of negative reviews with absolutely no substantial argument towards why they did not like this piece of horror-art. Okay sure, I hear you. Comparing horror to art is like comparing country music to Bach, but hey, I like horror. And I love country music. And I'm a filmmaker. I do get to be both, okay...So, if the mindless repetition of Hollywood trope is your thing, hang in there kid, another Halloween is coming soon. But if you actually want to sit and watch something original and new with thematic excellence and are not offended with critique on modern day greed and capitalist extremism.... Don't read the bad reviews and watch this film.And PS. I am not a communist - I also want to be able to buy a yacht one day, so that has nothing to do with this review.

608,deric-15124,What a stinker of a movie!,1,1 June 2021,First of all my favorite type of movies has always been horror and post apocalyptic flicks with or without zombies. This movie had so much potential but in the end it sucked ass!! The zombies looked pretty cool but that was it. The idea of the zombies being trapped in Las Vegas and the zombies being smarter was actually kinda dumb. But by far what makes this movie suck so much ass is the acting. Which sucks to say because I like Dave Bautista. Every actor and actress in this movie was just awful. Especially the guy who was there to crack the safe and the Ellen DeGeneres reject helicopter pilot!!! Seriously (WTF) where did they find those two??? Was Snyder strapped for cash with budgeting actors and actresses or something??? I expected way better from Zack Snyder especially since his Dawn Of The Dead remake is one of my favorite movies.,Army of the Dead

After 'I care alot' I lost all hope in netflix. Now coming towards this movie, i was really hyped by all the zombie genre and thought that maybe this will be another Day of the dead. But oh boy i was so wrong. This is the worst movie ever and not to mention they ruined the zombie genre so effectively. Major spoilers ahead:How come the soldiers didn't saw the headlights of coming car before the head on collision. Any sane person specially a tactical trained professional would have spotted the car a mile before.How come the armored military truck worth millions of dollars just simply gave up infront of an old 70's beat up car.Why did the two remaining soldiers didn't got in their humvee and got the hell out of there. Instead they chose to walk in the woods with a zombie hulk chasing them. Wow hats off to the writers of the movie.Why did scott just readily accepted the offer of 50 million and didn't demanded more.Why ( a big why) did the boss remained quiet and didn't gave them safe's codes or told them about the booby traps.How were they so sure that the helicopter would still fly and didn't cared much about the weight of the money and the passengers.When the first girl died, why she didn't told her boyfriend about the traitor. There was plenty of time for her to spit it out and save many lives.How come no one said anything when they found out that there were many teams before them who just happened to die in the casino and near the safe. Any sane person would had got the hell out of there after learning that secret.Why on earth the boss's man ( with the queen's head) went outside the building and not on the roof to the helicopter.Why didn't the team had not one single silencer with them. It would be so easy to just kill the zombie tiger, the queen, the other alpha zombie in the beginning and get over with it. And that too without alerting anyone. Plus it could had been so easy for them to continue without offering the bait. (which was insane btw)*The worst mercenaries ever* The daughter character was so dumb and annoying. Minus her in the movie and it would be a much better movie.* The list goes on and on and on.A wasted opportunity in my opinion. With this budget they could had made a superb movie.

But it all falls flat very quickly. When a super soldier project is accidentally released on the city of Las Vegas, the military immediately walls off the city using cargo containers. Survivors of Vegas are asked by Japanese billionaire to fetch his 100 million dollars for a 50% cut. They have 3 days to go in get the cash and fly out.The motives of these people range from idiotic to lame for even attempting this task, but they do it anyway. Once again, don't think, just enjoy the action. The premise of super soldier virus is very good sci-fi plot, but then the zombie super soldiers can survive the impossible, such as being turned into jerky and reanimated should it rain.

I saw bad reviews and heard the biggest criticism of plot holes but this is embarassingly shocking.Right off the bat, Kate, an absolutely god awful character, a moody, mouthy, trouble causing snob, who in typical fashion has daddy issues. She forces her way onto the team on a completely moronic one woman crusade to risk the lives of everyone to save the life of one woman she knows. Every scene with kate is a total waste of time and since this movie is already far too bloated for the lack of entertainment it provides it wears thin very quickly just how bad a character she is.The main motivation for the characters is money. They fought through the initial zombie outbreak, saved people in the process and were acknowledged for it enough to get government medals yet they couldnt cash in? In a world where online patforms make new millionaires every hour people to survive a zombe outbreak cant get a single sponsor or tv show?Why was the convoy at the start of the movie written like each of them had less brain activity than coma patients?When they radioed in for help why did the woman not tell them to aim for the head? Why did she tell those highly trained men to run away and just let the alpha roam free?Why were they all incredibly bad shots? Every single person in every single reality knows that zombies are taken down by destroying the brain. Yet a team of presumably specialized soldiers trusted to transport the zombie from area 51 not one of them thought to aim for the head? Every single one of them decided that every bullet they fire should be at the chest at nowhere else.Opening montage scene: Why did the US military have soldiers parachute into the middle of ground over run by zombies? Las vegas is in the dessert, there are countless miles of road and empty dessert where military convoys could have approached fromWhy did they use shipping containers as their brilliant containment strategy? You are telling me it was faster for the military to get thousands of shipping containers and have numerous cranes play a game of tetris slowly putting up a perimeter, opposed to teams of military men and women erecting barbed wire fences?We saw the military bombing the area , why did they stop? Why didnt they finish the job?Once the area was contained why didnt they cleam up the mess? A few tanks and a few teams of military personael with padded body armour could sweep through a contained area and make short of the zombies.Why was the outbreak blindly accepted? Thousands of people die because it comes to light the government had a zombie and they screwed up the containment, transport and clean up so badly that america lost an entire city to a zombie outbreak and the world doesnt care? We see a tv interview of someone complaining about conditions in quarantine but there isnt a single question asked about the origins of the zombieChambers: She fights her way through hordes of zombies single-handedly, despite martins multiple attempts to sabotage her, she makes it past the bulk of the zombies and is mere meters away from the rest of the team. How do the team respond? They do absolutely nothing "" one of our members who has just proven herself to be an invaluable fighter is not infected and is still fighting, should we help her? Nah brah, lol"", Only guzman and martin even acknowledge that she exists at all. She is still fighting and is not bitten but for some reason instead of helping her guzman fires a single bullet and then just stands there watching her get overwhelmed and then shoots the gas tank on her back, at which point bautista magically materializes and despite not giving a single crap to help chambers is suddenly beside guzman, aware of what is going on and telling guzman to keep walking. Also Guzman knew martin was involved in what happened to chambers, he was confronting him because he *knew* he did something, then guzman sees chambers dying and all of a sudden he completely loses interest. He was all over martin when he didnt know what happened to chambers but then he sees her die and knows full well the untrustworthy unwelcome person on the team was behind it and instantly any anger he had about some scumbag getting his friend killed dissipates, for all intents and purposes when chambers died guzman became like the rest of the team. Written so poorly they are oblivious to the fact that she ever existed in the first place
^What!? Even just typing this point out I could feel some brain cells dying, how the ever loving eff did this movie getting approved by netflix and this script and screenplay got the greenlight from zack snyder, netflix high ups and teams of high earning producers and at no point in shooting or editing did anyone point out any of the hundreds of cases of embarassingly p poor writing?Martin: every single person on the team knew from the offset that martin was not their ally, that he was not tagging along to help out, yet nobody did anything about it. They knew he was agaisnt them, they knew he was involved in sabotaging them repeteadly and they did absolutely jack. A city overrun with zombies, with no cameras, that is being given a wide berth before it is nuked and where every single other person would agree to kill him and yet they dont, they enable him to cause problem after problem after problem for themsleves. This is yet again another example of pathetic writing. If tanaka had convinced one of the people scott recuited then it would make sense for the team to play nice and for them not to want to kill that person, but thats not the case. A blatant bad guy and an entire team of ""good guys"" choose for almost 2 full hours to let him screw them over and it isnt even like he is subtle about the way he does so which makes the already flat death scenes of the characters have even less impact than they already did becuase the other characters dont care, at all, and numerous of the deaths were completely avoidable if they had a single IQ point to share between them.Deflating end: Casualties in zombie media are to be expected, but almost every death scene in this movie did not feel organic to the situation, they felt forced. We sit through over 2 hours of inane drivel and between the deaths and the completely monotone reactions from the other charactes about each death we are left feeling completely flat. We sat through all that to see the end and thats what the finale is? Some of the worst writing ever seen in modern media and then it is topped off with the most unrewarding ending imagineable.I went into this moving expecting and hoping for some dumb fun. I thought a non-cerebral, purely visceral action packed movie could be a fun nights watch, but ..1: it isnt dumb, it is incomprehensibly stupid thats an important disctintion to make, its not a movie that is dumb because it is intended to be, is intended as some straight forward escapism from the real world, instead its a story with more plot holes, inconsistencies and just pathetically poor writing that I could give my 4 year old nephew a crayon and the result would be a more sound, cohesive tale than this
2: it isnt fun, a weird hybrid between a heist movie and a zombie movie that tells its story through action far more than words, should be fun, but nope, like I mentioned above there are extended action sequences from numerous characters that serve literally no purpose, we see characters who have no depth to them so there is no reason for us to feel invested in their survival, we see them fighting for their lives for drawn out periods only for them to die and since its so poorly written that even in close quarters somehow the rest of the team are completely oblivious to the action going on that the scenes have no impact on us the viewer and also have zero impact on the characters and the story, if what happens is so inconsequential that even the characters in the story are compeltely indifferent how are we supposed to feel invested in what is going on?As I mentioned zack snyders catalogue may not be to everyone's taste, but there are few people who could say a bad word against the story telling or the quality of the production but this steaming pile right here is legitimately worse than most student projects. Dumb fun movies have their place, but this is dumber than sharknado and has worse writing and more plot holes than any other single piece of media I have witnessed in 29 years.As a fan of horror movies and someone who has seen all of zack snyders productions to date I can confidently and without hesitation nominate this for worst zack snyder creation, worst zombie movie, worst heist movie and one of netflix worst productions, right up there with the amy schumer ""comedy"" special, you know, the one where she got on stage and in front of camera and bare faced regurgitated jokes she had stolen from actual comedians and that was universally seen for how bad it was to the point where netflix permanently changed their rating system solely to protect the inflated ego of one multi millionaire hack? Yeah, well this movie is on par with that. The live action dead rising video game adaptions are not ""good"" movies, but for dumb fun action packed zombie movies, that have a sense of humour and dont take themselves too seriously they are infintely better than this movie despite a tiny fraction of the budget.",Army of the Dead

652,sebastianschlicht,Trivial Zombie Trash!,4,30 June 2021,"Good old Zack Snyder strikes again. After he was finally able to release his ""Justice League""-film according to his wishes (with the fitting title ""Snyder Cut""), his next project was ""Army of the Dead"" (2021). 2004 Snyder had already to do with the undead in ""Dawn of the Dead"". Apparently, he missed the genre. Snyder has long been known for putting more emphasis on ""dark and cool"" looks than on good stories. His best film ""Watchmen"" had a great comic book as the source material (and great scriptwriters as well), but when Snyder himself tries to write dialogue himself (or worse: David S. Goyer!), it gets rather dark for the viewer. ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman V Superman"" were sad examples of confused and exhausting CGI-bombast. Can Snyder start a new era after a family tragedy and with renewed vigor? Unfortunately, no.Las Vegas is overrun by zombies. Shortly before a nuclear hit, the dubious Tanaka wants to send a group of mercenaries into this hell of casinos to get $ 200 million that are hidden there. The leader of the team is Scott Ward, a former mercenary who lost his wife to the undead and can´t get along with his daughter ...Without a doubt the best part of the film is the setting and the occasionally strong images in the destroyed city. The idea of intelligent zombies (so called alphas) isn't bad either. Even if the film is not always optically up to date (a lot of shakey cam and a slightly trashy look shimmers through again and again), the splatter part is entertaining and so are the zombie moments.But sadly that's it. . . The potential is there, but it is hardly used. As so often, Snyder wants to make the whole thing look cool, spectacular and tough. He succeeds every now and then, but as with the motto ""Style over Substance"", there is not much behind the gaudy effects and the bloody zombie slime. All the characters are superficial, one-dimensional and totally cliché. The protagonist has problems with his daughter, then we have a supporting character who is responsible for the humor and on top of that he represents the typical german (the character Dieter) and so on and so forth. Funnily enough, the movie has far too many parallels to James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and seems like a cheap imitation of the mega hit from 1986. . . And I don't want to start with all the plot holes!There is also nothing special about the cast either: Dave Bautista is wooden and the rest of the actors are partially really bad. The german actor Matthias Schweighöfer plays Dieter who is even supposed to get a prequel that he is directing himself ... wow! In germany he is known for his terrible comedies and here he should make the audience laugh. But unfortunately, every attempt at humor in the film (especially by him) is embarrassing and cringy!Tom Holkenborg's music was not really noticable, but I liked some cover versions of the famous rock and pop songs, even if the use of these hits in the film always seemed forced.Conclusion: ""Army of the Dead"" is a rotten zombie meal with no substance. If you want to be see some bloody stuff for two and a half hours, you might have fun here, but Zack Snyder only proves that his best days as a director are long gone.",Army of the Dead

The second act really sets things in motion and we learn more about the refugee camps and the society the zombies have created. It falls apart in the third act with everything stopping to give each character some emotional point so we are supposed to care.

There are tons of logic errors, which are so obvious it takes you out the movie permanently thinking ""why did they do this?"".The most serious issue with this movie is that there is no tension at all. And there should be quite a lot considering the fact that a bunch of people are facing permanent being killed by Zombies and even an atomic bomb being dropped on them.The acting is fine, but characters are very very stereotype as we may can expect from a movie like this.Army Of The Dead is not a bad movie , but nothing more than about average.",Army of the Dead

I am more than capable of leaving my brain at the door so I can enjoy a bit of zombie action - but I found this picture a real chore to sit through. I found myself zoning out around the 60 minute mark - with the film playing quietly in the background as I typed away on my laptop. I also find Zack Snyder to be a bit of a wet blanket as a director too - particularly with this film. For example, the majority of the men in the squad have been nerfed, i.e., drained of fortitude and machismo. A stark contrast to the female characters who appear to possess all the aggression and tactical nous required to appear competent. It's become a bit of an action film trope now - tiresome to say the least. I also found the ''melodrama'' incredibly forced and poorly executed too. A better alternative to AotD, if you enjoy the action-horror genre, would be: DAWN OF THE DEAD (1979); ARMY OF DARKNESS (1994); FROM DUSK TIL DAWN (1996); BLADE (1998); PITCH BLACK (2000); DOG SOLDIERS (2002); or LEFT 4 DEAD 1 & 2 (video game).",Army of the Dead

We need our movies to not only have great action or special effects or drama etc. But also a storyline which makes sense and sometimes writers and directors can be too smart for the own good. Just like I Am Omega failed to capitalise on the biggest subplot which was the zombies acting with purpose and not just flailing about. Similarly this movie failed to expand on some pretty big and vital storyline's e.g. Who was patient zero and why was he being transported by the government and how was he able to control the other zombies. Who was his queen and her bodyguard? How was his hair growing? And how did she become pregnant? Also why was he taking prisoners and turning them one at a time? These are really huge aspects of what could have been a new direction in the genre which basically just sees zombies as posing one singular goal which is to eat brains.

Yet this movie is absolutely perfect for what it is, which is a heist movie in a zombie infested danger zone. I like the idea of Las Vegas being converted into a Zombie kingdom with the king zombie and his queen and their henchmen and serfs. The infighting in the heist team is done well with redemption arcs and honorable self-sacrifice to save others and backstabbers getting their just desserts. The zombie killing effects and FX were some of the best I've seen.With the death of the great late John Romero, who is left to take up the mantle of the great contemporary zombie movie director ? Well my guess is that it's Zack Snyder now.",Army of the Dead

684,DezmoTheMovieMan,"Walkedin with low expectations, walked out impressed",7,23 May 2021,"First things first, people that walk into a zombie movie expecting to see anything but a zombie movie amuse me. This movie was made to entertain and it did just that. I walked in not expecting a lot from Bautista, but I'll admit he held his own. Most of the cast was pretty strong and did a great job portraying their role.Then in walks the daughter.If anything, the daughter character was more of a distraction than anything else. I happen to be a Snyder fan, so this movie aligned with what I was expecting. The Zombie story was awesome, and gave a different perspective to a level of commitment and loyalty to the zombies. The story itself was entertaining, and provided a connection to all of the characters sans the daughter.The daughter character was annoying, but I managed to get past it... I mean c'mon, I'm a volunteer and I'm so committed to this one family that I will not only walk into a pre-nuked zombie war, I'll also sneak away from the vigilantes on my own to find the zombies with a hand gun... (insert eye roll here). Oh yeah, and she's an great shot, she manages to always get a head shot with every bullet on every zombie.Also, there were a few other things that didn't make sense. Why did the zombies keep people captured and not bite them? Were they now so smart that they were holding them for negotiating power? C'mon man. Why not bite them immediately and make them zombies?Why is it when the team first walked into the zombie compound, they didn't even close the door... what if a bunch of zombies ran in... and the best one.. why is it that when the bosses army guy betrays the girl and leaves her for dead, then she still manages to escape, why didn't she tell them he betrayed her. And why didn't they help her instead of just watching her get eaten? Made ZERO sense.Pregnant zombies? I like the idea, I think... but when the head was chopped off the zombie was still alive in just the head? Ummmm... OK. So why is it that other zombies that had their head chopped off lived?Back to the movie. I love how each character had a story, I love how I connected and how there was a clean antagonist and protagonist with a little deception in between. This movie was entertaining with great effects and sound... it was fun to watch and I'll watch it again, just can't think of the small inconsistencies or it will drive me crazy.",Army of the Dead

While it does have a lot of predictable points, it also manages to successfully blend a zombie film with a heist movie. It does so very successful and is a highly enjoyable ride. Yes, some elements are a bit ridiculous but did you really expect any different?The only things I wish they would have done differently would be to explain the traitor plot a little better. The guy betrays one major character and steals a zombie head but then dies without any real explanation what he is up to. Either follow that plot or don't, don't simply scratch the surface just to kill him. Secondly, I wish they would not have ended in such failure with nearly every major character killed and they only walk out with a tiny portion of the money.",Army of the Dead
686,HockeyFan13,"Again, Snyder Let's a Horrid Ending Ruin a Zombie Movie",6,25 May 2021,"I am not much for smart, running zombies that can do things as a zombie that they could never do as a person. The beginning suggests that the zombie was created through some sort of alien/government/conspiracy program? Who knows. Who cares. It follows the zombie cliche of ""not knowing is all you'll know"" about how things get started.Why They would ship something like that across the country is anyone's guess. Again, asking questions is pointless.Half way through this movie I was surprisingly enjoying the ride. Big Dave did a great job carrying the movie and showed gravitas in a leading role. The supporting cast is very strong in support but mostly serve as ""red shirts"" in people that you know are not going to make it through to the end. All that is a standard thing in zombie movies and the entire horror genre.All that is forgivable.The movie absolutely should have ended with Scott being ended by his daughter after turning. I thought to myself.. ok the main hero died, but that is a good ending.Then Vanderohe climbs out of a the vault after they nuke Vegas.OK.He carries three big bags of money walking out of a city that was literally just nuked.OK.Then he rents a private jet with cash and no ID, looking like he just walked out of a city that was nuked.OK.Then he feels sick.OK. You see where this is going.THEN he realizes he is bitten just as the plane is landing in Mexico. So he didn't check that pain in his arm for the seemingly hours he was shielded from the nuclear blast in the vault? He didn't realize he was bitten while he carried the three huge sacks of cash?Are you effing kidding me?I don't know what it is with Snyder, making a good zombie movie and then just taking a dump on it with a horrible, ill thought out ending that essentially ruins the movie before it.

704,blackknight-51234,Army of the daft,4,30 May 2021,"I was really looking forward to this. A zombie heist movie set in Las Vegas that didn't take itself too seriously sounded like a perfect film for a Saturday night. Sadly, the film smells like a zombie left out in the Nevada desert at high noon.Things to like - it's quite good visually, the sets are attractive, there's action and a half decent soundtrack. A couple of the characters work quite well. The opening scene in Vegas is quite good.Things not to like (deep breath)
It's way too long - it takes 50 minutes for them to even enter Vegas.The timing/continuity is a mess.Predictable, you can literally guess what will happen and that there is a double cross coming.Unbelievable - lots of things happen that are simply not possible - a helicopter catches fire, twice, and the pilot fixes it without spare parts. The same helicopter has no fuel, so they carry a couple of 25 litre jerry cans, which is enough to power the helicopter almost indefinitely.Non trained people headshoting zombies like Seal Team 6.The back story for the zombies is muddled and their behavior makes no sense - except as a plot device. Rather than sticking to standard zombie behavior, there is a weird two tier arrangement which adds nothing to the story. Likewise infection times seem completely random.Despite seemingly endless dialogue, none of the characters have any real depth. Most of their interactions feel like cut scenes from Grand Theft Auto.Convoluted plot arcs which makes no sense - the reason for things happening makes no sense.Missing person - one of the secondary characters (who is the sole motivation for one of the main characters) and one of the main plot device is completely missed out at the end - like they never existed.A real shame and a missed opportunity.",Army of the Dead

There were zombies in it, but the zombies in it were so fantastical, it felt like the hobbit of zombie movies.The dialogue in it was just as cringe. The lines in it. I thought the lines in Justice League was bad, but wow.Only good thing about this was some of the special effects, but they tried doing way too much.This movie felt more like a bad comedy.Remember Michael Bay, how he blew up out of nowhere then became quiet as kept.

The plot was solid. The movie was action packed and more serious in comparison and cohesive to Army of Thieves. There wasnt really ever a dull moment. The movies oscar little over 2 hours long and the writer/director made sure to use every minute. I was really appreciative of that because I didn't want the movie to end.***SPOILER ***Despite all of that good the direction of the film REALLY disappointed me. Nothing was gained in the end. Great characters were taken out for what? There was no point. Why did the writer chose to let the least important and least interesting character live? For what? There was no happy ending and all of the characters went through all of that difficult work for no reason. It's laughable. Ridiculous. I dont see how Army of Thieves was a prequel. It did not transition into Army of the Dead. It's like they named Army of Thieves as a prequel as an after thought. Why would the writer choose to take out the one main character that we all fell in love with in the prequel?

The special effects are top-notch. And the action is plentiful and fun to watch. Now you would think that if this were only a mindless action blockbuster that would be enough to give it a passing grade and be done with it, but unfortunately Zack Snyder got a hold of the pen as well on this one and that's where it falls flat on it's face and gets in the way of it just being a fun watch.Don't get me wrong here, I'm not hating on Zack Snyder. When it comes to directing and filming the man knows what he's doing and he can impress. That is what he is good at. Writing a screenplay and/or a script is one of the things he is not good at and something he should stay away from and leave to others.But Zack is booming right now after the whole Justice League Snyder cut thing so who could say now to him when he says he wants to do something. And that's what I think happened here. Probably no one dared to tell him that yet another scene or event in this movie makes no sense at all.I know ""but it's an action movie, things don't need to make sense"" and you'd be right, if only the amount of disbelief and inconsistencies weren't so blatant and plentiful to create a piling on effect. So much so that it takes you out of the movie every time there is no action on the screen, and that makes this a very hard watch at times. You want to see more exploding zombies and zombie tigers but you'll have to sit through another non-sensical dialogue first. Time is running out, things are about to go sideways really quickly, so this seems the perfect time to talk about our feelings. You need to sneak in to the the city, but you can fly out , no problem. There are just so many moments in this movie where I went ""WTF? Why!?"" that at this moment I'm still deciding between giving this movie a 5 or a 4....You know what, the acting overal was actually pretty good.

Sadly it's extremely boring, with a very slow pace, a lazy dialogue and even more lazy plot ideas and nonsensical action scenes.It's unbelievable (and maybe a little ironic) that after his remake of Justice League, where mr Snyder showed the world that he can make exceptional movies if executives don't get in his way, has now released a movie that seems in immediate need of decent production, something like a ""Heaven's Gate"" of zombie films.In conclusion, this movie is a complete mess and not worth seeing . With the exception of Stephen King's ""the cell"", literally every other zombie movie I can think of is better than the Army of the Dead.",Army of the Dead
730,dcj2,What happens in Vegas...I didn't really care.,5,16 May 2021,"***Possible mild spoilers ahead ***I had such high hopes for this one. The slow-pacing of the first act promises something more than the typical two-dimensional characters, but it never pays off. When the action finally starts, it's just a sequence of events - this happens then that happens then something else happens. None of the character choices are driven by their backstories, they just do things to move things along to the next set piece. The pacing if awful. Just when the action gets up some steam, we pause for extended, quiet dialog scenes that add nothing to the story. Arguably the two most intiguing characters - the zombie leader and his...girlfriend? Are given no backstory at all. The action pieces are shot well enough, but nothing is all that original or memorable. The dialog is cringe worthy in a typical Zack Snyder way. The musical choices try too hard to be clever (Elvis singing ""We're caught is a trap..."", the Cranberries classic song ""Zombie""...) are just too on the nose to be amusing. Overall the movie is waaaay too long. By the time we hit the 2-hour mark (with another half hour to go!) I had given up caring about any of the charavters and just wanted them to drop the nuke already so I could get on with my life. Snyder fanboys will no doubt love it, as is evident by all the 9 and 10 star reviews, but for the rest of us, this one is easily skipped.",Army of the Dead
731,onze-kris,food for zombies,1,27 May 2021,"I think Mr Snyder needs to reflect about his writing capabilities and his camerawork.He overuses some techniques a lot and they don't add anything to what is going on. Because he overuses the out of focus technique, well it doesn't have any impact infact it becomes troublesome to watch...For the odd chance of Mr snyder reading this. If it happens frequently people get used to it... If it happens only once or very infrequently chances are the impact is higher.Obviously Mr snyder has seen zombiemovies before. He borrowed some cool ideas but you need more than some cool zombiemoves to make a movie.The characters in the movie.... Well I can be short about the character development because there is hardly one... This might have to do with his involvement in bringing comic books to the silver screen.There is however a big gap between the two... If I see a superhero movie. I know a lot of the background. If I know no background of the characters the movies well still have some because it is much better written...Spoilers.For example conversation between dad and daughter about dad killing mum is unreal.The youtuber who gets a nickname after being together for an hour or two ? Doesn't seem plausible.The daughter and the hierarchy in the camp doesn't seem plausible.The camp still being crowded before the nuking....
the helicopter pilot talking about her share (2 million) and that she is after the safecracker (500.000)
the mother in the camp who leaves her kids behind... (too find money in las vegas to give her kids a better life). Why are they in the camp anyways....
what happens to the mother...
the cannon fodder that is used (the two friends of the mother)
the safecracker complimenting the youtuber and later sacrificing his life for the only survivor besides the daughter... Why didn't they wait until it got nuked and than got in to get the money....
the open ending and the reaction to it.Well I just should stop spending time on this...I do want to thank Mr snyder that he puts his name in the title of another movie... that makes it easier to avoid.",Army of the Dead

This bloated mess has it all. By which I mean too much. And most of that too much is straight up plagerisim. This is like if a fan made a zombie movie playing loose with fair use.

Special undead made only by the leader in a secret location from game of thrones season 1? Check. Zombie animals from game of thrones? Check. Crack team bank heist against the clock from hard rain? Check. Smart lead zombie from land of the dead? Check. Conflicted hero with a troubled family tortured by past decisions ( pick your movie) check. Lead special undead riding an undead horse from game of thrones? CheckPlagerisim of the dead is what happens when you storyboard a movie by cutting sections from the comics of 10 diffrent great movies. Then make it boring and out of focus. Blurry cam is everywhere in this movie. Like they were so desprate to hide cheap cgi they greased the lense. Dark scenes are saturated black in post and look cartoonish at times. Gore is pg13 at best with most people wrestling zombies with some red smudged on them. Gun sound effects I skipped ahead 10 minutes 4 times. And lost nothing. That's how slow this movie is.If you can't sleep put on army of the dead. You have seen this movie a dozen times with better actors already anyway.

Dwayne Johnson, it's surprising how likeable they come across and seem to have a better range than some other supposed actors.The good. It's bright, it's fast paced, it tries to establish each character and give them personality, the settings and zombies look great and some decent jokes.The bad. It's too long, there's too much procrastination where people are talking but not doing, 30 mins could be cut from this and it would probably help the movie. It feels like characters are set up but then just thrown away unnecessarily. This isn't really a zombie movie, it's not a horror, it's not a comedy... It's a sort of hybrid action movie and I wasn't expecting that. Can the camera man not maintain focus!!! The shots often blur to bring your focus to a different character onscreen and I found it quite distracting. Too much of the daughter, she's annoying and too 'goody goody' for my liking.I did like the way that the zombies had started to evolve, there are some good ideas, I like the zombie animals. I really liked how the zombie king/leader fella was smart enough to create a metal mask to protect his head and brain.

746,MTZink,Cut 'N Paste Tropefest - Devil's In The Details,4,22 May 2021,"Outstanding CGI and intro; the rest just a well-produced shrug with every trope in the book shaken out. Brat daughter estranged from main hero and ends up going along w/rest of suspected mischief. And as marvelous some attention is given to background detail, it's simply annoying to see lazy writing/moviemaking constantly springing up to bite. To wit in no order:
1. Insufferable wastes of time monologuing/dinking around (like rooftop ""climax"") instead of... oh, I don't know, outrunning the nuke due in minutes? And, of course, to allow the head baddie to show for the final bout.2. Helo pilots/passengers wear headphones just for show. Simply yell louder.3. Convenient No Fly Zone allowing flights OUT, just not IN. Else 10 minute job.4. Um, helo sitting on rooftop in NEVADA desert for how long? Doesn't it take generators to start the things? And avg fuel consumption of (varies but at LEAST 16 gpm if not more with old one, don't think 8-10 gallons would do it. Nice backpack spare cans; water's 8lbs/gal; maybe gas is lighter. Yep.5. Going into zombie infested nest dressed for the beach or night club. No helmets, personal armor x show for baddies.6. Speaking of, yeah, we'll just wall off Vegas and let zombies thrive. Unlikely without at least someone opening an attraction; hey, like those drive thru safari parks? No way would that just be shrugged off.7. Zombies in general. Too much ""fearing our own selves"" vs simple common sense. Ok, accept either a virus or hell, even totally undead spring back up. W/o BIG mention of how they basically can function, it's a human chassis, right? Unless I missed something in the mythos whereupon base structures turns to Kevlar, it's still organic and bullets... well, bullets move very fast and simple kinetic force would toast 'em/blast 'em apart. (Note: um, metal helmet okay, bullets still moving fast and ever see an accurate portrayal of getting shot with a vest?)\
8. Hint: maybe CLOSING DOORS BEHIND YOU might help? First in their dramatic entry into zombieville and the rooftop... with several in between.9. Can accept application of sufficient twisting mechanical force can break a human living neck. Yet the head IS connected to the body and body's aren't anchored to floors to allow cool scenes.10. Funny guy wasn't funny.11. Tough guy scene intimating taking along a giant power saw as fav weapon then never seen again; likely no prop available and had to pick up a real one. Speaking of, for WHAT? A concrete saw? Weighing how much? Yep, sounds like wise weapon for about 4 seconds of melee. (""Just hold up! Ok, now... freak'n gas is on... choke on... try again..."")
12. The Indiana Jones stupidity in bank vault. Would love to watch the manager orientation on that one. And the insurance meeting. AND the original sales demo and/or model catalog. ""Tell y'what... pick the acid bath option and the big rolling boulder is 25% off. See the trapdoors into shark tanks yet? Over here... NO, not THAT way... no worries, yessir....""
Expected more from Snyder hype... silly me. Just a lazy tropefest of no consequence other than more entertaining than most fare lately. Shrug. And if the lazy writing/attention to basic real life details isn't too annoying.",Army of the Dead

Since he's also the DP of this movie, there's really no one else to blame for the, and I'm not exaggerating, ULTRA-SHALLOW depth of field in LITERALLY 95+% of the shots. It's so bad than in a good number of shots the characters who are in focus start to become blurry around the edges. It's just aweful, and the entire movie is like this. Some of the shots are so shallow it's like just watching a frame full of bokeh. And not pretty even.Apart from the awful cinematography, the movie is, as others have pointed out, incredibly stupid. That's it. There's no logic to almost anything, the dialogue is laughable, and not in a good way, and the characters are... let's just stop.This is a dumb movie, that's shot in a dumb way, and Netflix maintains its crown as the main streaming producer and distributer of utter garbage.

751,jprice-38253,This is NOT the Zack Snyder that I know.,4,21 May 2021,"I love Zack Snyder and I like zombie films in general. Zack Snyder's work has usually never disappointed me. From his works such as 300, SuckerPunch, Watchmen and many others, Snyder always has his own tone and look of his films. Unfortunately for this one, this one just does not feel or look like a Zack Snyder film at all. It's very hard for me to believe that he actually wrote and directed this. His attempt to make a zombie film just fails. He can do waaay better than this. C'mon now. I was really disappointed in this film.Only reason why I watched it and caught my attention was because I saw that Dave Bautista and Hiroyuki Sanada were in it. They were the only two characters I was interested in and loved watching when they came on screen of course. And speaking of characters, everyone else just sucks. You really don't care what they say, you really don't care what they are doing, the writing is terrible. Hell I was so terribly bored after the first 30 minutes of this film, that I couldn't help but just play games on my phone. I couldn't stand watching these characters as they were on screen. It got to a point in the movie where all I wanted to do was literally just fast forward to the action and zombie parts. That's it. And the zombies are really really cool. You can obviously tell they focused on the setting and the zombies more than the actual story and characters. Didn't really seem to have a story though. It was too all over the place. All they're doing is going after money. It just doesn't seem original to me and not interesting or engaging or exciting enough for an audience.Now the zombies. You see that there's an main alpha and his zombie queen who is pregnant. You really feel their emotions and care more about them than the actual characters. The fact that you can't care about your actual human characters whatsoever, but care more about the zombies, is just...sad.I honestly think this film may have been better if it was less than 2 hours or maybe have been better if it was a different story. For 2 and a half hours, this really drags. Go ahead and give this watch if you want, if you really like zombies. But prepare for boredom. The only thing you'll like is the zombies and action. You'll see exactly what I was talking about.",Army of the Dead

The action sequences are repetitive and with no sense of progression, the supposed twists are both predictable and nonsensical. The dialog drags even at 1.5 speed. This is, by far, the worst zombie content I have seen in my life. And believe me, I have seen a lot.I can't believe this is from Zack Snyder, the director of Dawn Of The Dead. That movie had heart and a real sense of suspense, and many memorable characters and sequences. It had pace and rhythm. Not all exposition at the beginning and action in the end.What a letdown.

is also a given.The plot is what you see in the trailer and anything you can predict can happen does end up happening.Well, for most parts.Acting wise everyone is doing a decent job. I guess we can now count Dave Bautista as a lead actor after this. I was also happy to see Huma Qureshi in the movie. She has about 3 scenes but they are integral for an important sub-plot.Hope to see her do more international projects after this.The USP of the movie is that these are not your typical zombies. They are fast and smart and have organisational skills. Also they have a zombie tiger. Now that's crazy.The action is fast paced, but you obviously also have your signature Zack Snyder slow motion scenes which really let you enjoy all the zombie killings. On the flipside it adds extra unnecessary runtime to the movie.The rules to kill the zombies remain the same i.e. Aim for the head.

The acting is serviceable and the SFX are really good. Snyder's done better even in the same genre - Dawn of the Dead is still fantastic. But he's also done much worse - see: Sucker Punch and BvS.A little too long for my taste. But Snyder tends to do that lately. Could have easily chopped 20 minutes off but whatever.

What year is it supposed to be? 1800s?Was there no other SIMPLER casino to rob in the entire Vegas Strip? Instead of one giant vault at the Bly, they could have targeted smaller ones without such complicated security, no?Kate morphs away from the gang near the safe despite the only way out is via the elevator.

She is then shown to run inside the Olympus""What's in this bag is worth ten times than what's in the vault"". The zombie head. If that's all he was after, why go to the safe at all? Just get out?

Because she didn't bother telling Kate this and just left her kids aloneAssuming Kate has had no experience with weapons at all, all of a sudden she is landing headshotsWhy would the pilot not keep the engine running and stay on the roof? Not like they'll run out of fuel. Not like they're flying from America to Egypt (WW84 reference)If the military just nuked Vegas and they saw a chopper fly out and crash land, imo there's no need to check for survivors because you're risking a spared zombieSo Vanderohe survives inside a safe. How did he get out from inside? Also how did he get bitten? What's more is that the blast would have contaminated the area and Vanderohe would have been exposed to serious amounts of radiation and probably not survived""If you coordinate & communicate, this should be a simple in-and-out"" - COULD NOT HAVE SUMMED UP BETTER - Why did NOBODY have any cellphone or laptop or walkie talkie to communicate with the outside world or with eachother?",Army of the Dead
766,njoy_dj_joy,Zack Snyder is too overrated...,2,22 May 2021,None of the actors impressed me ... I have no problem with long movie I am Indian... But this is just boring... Zack has made this too lame its like characters are giving zombies head start to reach them and kill them too stupid characterization ... The pilot lady trying to hard to be like texas cow boy kinda irritates me... No action scene with zombies are worth remembering... It's zombies vs top army there sud be good action. But nothing really is memorable.... Some times zombies are too strong and fast some time they are not...

When you watch this movie, you wonder how Zack went through the entire creative process and calls this creative in interviews! Entire cast is acting like some high school students with cheeky lines. Story is pretty much simple and that's ok. I gave 6 for the actions. However the acting in this movie can be rated only 5 or less. It's bad. It has so much potential and its wasted very well.

Namely the corporate asshole who screws over the entire team to bring back the zombie head of the alpha queen (aka Burke) or the daughter of the main character who disregards her promise to take care of the kids to potentially save the mom against all odds.The effects and the backdrop of a devastated Las Vegas looked good and I loved some of the characters such as Lilly, Scott, Guzman and the smart ass chopper pilot as well as the zombie tiger.It was a little disappointing to see that none of the team survived except the Kate who really got the chopper pilot killed and Scott turned into a zombie through her actions. Heck we don't even find out if the mom she went into the quarantine zone to find survives.Given its deficiencies in some of the story elements I'd say this film is definitely worth a watch especially if you are a fan of the zombie genre.",Army of the Dead

Does that count as an endorsement?If you like zombie flicks, you gotta watch it. Just know, you've been warned. I just wish I cared about at least one of the characters.

-Girl wearing immaculate white top after running around in the sand and dirt for several hours.No one being bothered that a nuke is heading their way in an hour.

-Badass stuck in corridor with zombies. She nearly dies several times. Gets out by smashing through glass. Her friends could have rescued her as they're all close enough...but they don't. She dies.

It's like writers today are just writing from the same template as each other. As soon as I saw the daughter I knew Bautista would end up dying.Chambers had plenty of time to reveal the security guy locked her in with the zombies, but just didn't.Van never got to use his saw on the zombies even though it probably would have done some damage to the big guy.Too many times it felt like choices were made just so the story could go on.

792,juanquaglia,Oh boy...,2,21 May 2021,"I usually enjoy zombie films, but I struggled to watch this one to the end. It is surprising, because another of Zack Snyder's creations, ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004), is one of my favourite all-time films. I don't know where to start to explain what is wrong with ""Army of the Dead"". Weak script, bad acting, and plagued of clichés from both the zombie and heist genres. At certain points it reminded me of that episode of ""Rick & Morty"" where they make fun of heist films, because they followed the formula step by step. It almost seems like a parody, but without any trace of comedy.The plot itself is unnecessarily convoluted and delays the action. In regards to bad acting, Tig Notaro's and Matthias Schweighöfer's are the two most memorable performances. It's a big mystery to me how Notaro keeps getting acting roles because even though I don't know much about her I can tell she's not an actress just by watching her work. And Schweighöfer is just over the top. He seems to believe he's channeling Jim Carrey.The characters are unidimensional, almost caricatures, which makes it difficult to empathise at all with any of them or get any sense of depth. Every single one of them seems to be able to express only one single emotion and behaves the same way for the whole or most of the film. Some of the scenes where the characters had to take part indeed look like taken from a cartoon because of their silliness and lack of realism. I think I'll just watch ""Dawn of the Dead"" again.",Army of the Dead

Most moronic scene I have seen but it gets worse. The origin of the virus is Area 51 how original and dumb. Everyone bar 2 characters have sense 1 doesn't want to heist a Casino surrounded by zombies the other Tig says they should let the guy who's watching them all they should let him die but they don't so they get betrayed and almost all die. There's a credit intro that's good sort of a mini story about the zombie wars which is way more interesting than a slow moving 2hour 30 minute heist movie. The pace is very slow in this. The tone is messy funny one minute serious the next. Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead did it way better this does not. One character a Mexican guy is setup to be able to kill 3 zombies with one shot which we see in a social media video but at no point saves his female friend who is setup by a character that none of the group trust. The Mexican chap has a rifle and watches his female friend attacked by zombies barely surviving and he lets her die. He stand there and watches at no point is the betrayal brought up again or her death. The characters are stupid in this film. It takes a good hour plus for some action and then it's over. It's not a good action film, comedy film or zombie film. The heist itself is boring the traps are easily sprung by a zombie very dull. The super zombies seem to just let all their zombies die but only care when the queen is killed then they attack. I got bored mid way there was barely any character development and when they snuffed it you felt nothing. Dave is good I'm getting to like him from Blade runner to Guardians he is underated as an actor but the story ruins all his work in this film. It's very formulaic. By the end you see one character survives a nuke walks carrying millions in 3 bags of cash through nuclear fallout from Las Vegas to Utah Airport mostly on foot which is 136 hours then gets in a plane gets in the air and finally notices he's been bitten but hasn't turned into a zombie. Every other bit person turns in minutes. Snyder stop writing stop making films you make Uwe Bill look like Kubrick you are an embarrassment and so are your fart sniffing fans.

801,nyxstrix,A B-movie with a big budget. That is what this movie is.,7,29 May 2021,"I don't know what movie everybody else watched, but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen.Here are the issues:1. Pacing
2. Character development
3. Plot development(it's almost exclusively based on plot holes).4. Scenes that make 0 sense
5. Stupid characters
6. Bad acting
7. No sense of passage of time. Zombies outrunning a helicopter across town. See point #4.8. A completely futile side rescue mission story.9. Ending that makes no sense(consider how quickly the characters turn into zombies). Again, see point #4.10. Poorly setup atmosphere that doesn't invoke any sense of doom.Spoilers aheadHere are just a few examples of this movie making no sense. First of, the zombies don't really do much for almost the entire movie except kill the latina girl early on. They're just there but for the most part the cast walks around the film largely unopposed.Second point of stupidity, all the characters are just standing around while the Latina girl gets attacked by zombies. They literally stand and watch as she gets attacked and don't try to help her, only killing her after her drawn out pointless fight. Like they couldn't fire their guns before?Third point of stupidity, and i'm not straining my memory too much here: the hired gun leaves everyone behind and supposedly escapes to the chopper except for the fact that the chopper is on the rooftop and he's at the front of the casino where he gets pointlessly eaten by a tiger. He knew the chopper was on the roof, he even said that's where he's going as he blocked off the others, so why was he out in front of the casino?4th point: the remaining characters escape from the lead zombie and fly off the casino roof, and head to another one to rescue Dave Bautista's stupid daughter who went off by herself on a side rescue mission.It obviously takes time to get from one casino to the next, even by chopper, and yet the leader of the zombies gets there at the same time.Point #5: This is from earlier on in the film. The safecracker locks his buddy in the vault while he himself dies. He was slamming the door shut from the outside instead of the inside despite the fact he could have done that very easily as there were handles to grab onto. He coulud have also asked his buddy to help him with the door.Point #6: it is well established early on in the film that people turn into zombies within about a minute after being bitten, and yet the only surviving character is somehow fine for like half a day afterwards.Point #7: Dave Bautista's daughter rescues her friend only for the friend to unceremoniously die towards the end of the film in the chopper crash, making the mission and her friend completely irrelevant to the film.Point #8: Nobody is freaking out over the fact there is a nuke heading their way in a matter of an hour and a half. There is no tension, no suspense, they just acknowledge it casually and go about their business.Point #9: Why do they need a safecracker to break into a safe when the owner of the safe should have the code to it? The movie implies it's his safe, so why wouldn't he know the code?Point #10: With a nuke just minutes away and zombies not far behind him, Dave Bautista decides to stare at his daughter who's safely sitting i the chopper. He on the other hand just stands there and smiles instead of getting into the helicopter like literally any person would do. This of course leads to his demise.This movie is so stupid you would have to really go out of your way to make it dumber if you were given a chance to.",Army of the Dead
802,JTReviewsPlus,Zack Snyder new take on zombies is excellent but....,7,21 May 2021,"Army of the Dead lacks a cohesive story that leaps in logic toward the films conclusion. Zack Snyder's phenomenal eye for action and visual spectacle are showcased from beginning to end however there are side stories that take up a good amount of time that could've been better spent building up our main protagonist's backstory. Instead of focusing on Ward's daughter's uninteresting side arc we could've learned more about Ward himself. Sure we knew a decent amount about him but all that info felt surface level due to the quick breaks of exposition dumps throughout the movie. However Dave Bautista still managed to pull off a great performance. There were also some plot twists that were either predictable or just didn't make sense logically. Aside from the violence and beautiful camerawork, the crew was the highlight of the movie. Everyone from the safecracker to the professional zombie killer to the Vegas navigator to the helicopter pilot were all uniquely badass, charismatic, and easy to root for.

Fans of this truly scare me. I assume ""Hurricane Heist"" also rates 10 stars on their lists, blowing their tiny minds with the combination of genres. These reviewers make statements like ""it's a zombie movie, people, not Pride and Prejudice"" to justify the absurdly high ratings, as if you are somehow mentally defective by expecting a movie to meet basic standards of reasoning and logic. I cannot bring myself to analyse this nonsense - please see some of the other one star reviews for a breakdown of the endless plot holes and absurdities. The empty-headed reviewers tell you to ""switch off your brain, it's a zombie movie"", not realising that most people cannot do this without slipping into unconsciousness. If you are not a simpleton, you will be incapable of accepting the onslaught of flaws in this movie. Acting, dialogue, plot, pacing, all truly abysmal. I have to keep going back to the delusional reviewers who rate this highly; one raved about Bautista's performance, comparing him to ""The Rock"" and saying that Bautista is capable of far more range. Bautista barely has more range than A rock. If you are using ex-wrestlers as baselines for acting chops, you have problems. An ex-wrestler in the lead role of a movie is a major red flag; I just assumed a zombie movie would be an easy watch as a time killer. How wrong I was.

809,johnnyutah31,Dawn of the Dead it ain't,5,8 July 2021,"In 2004 Zack Snyder sort of did the unthinkable. He remade George Romero's classic, 1978's ""Dawn of the Dead"". He also had the audacity to implement fast zombies into his version. But, he pulled it off. Not only was it good, it was darn good. Now 17 years later he returns to the zombie genre but does he deliver another classic? I don't think we were expecting it to be..but does it come close? Sadly, no. I'm sure by now we all know that Snyder's films deliver on the flash. This one doesn't disappoint. It looks great, especially with the Vegas backdrop. But behind all the well crafted shots and colorful scenery is a film that's way too long and is filled with characters making some of the most dumbest decisions you'd think aren't humanly possible. Of course some bad choices help the plot move forward in order to raise stakes and such but here it's painfully obvious those things are about to occur. Nevertheless the film still manages to be entertaining and amusing at times. The evolved zombie dynamic is interesting even for someone like me who prefers their undead slow and dumb. But without a doubt the film could've benefited from a shorter run time which therefore would excuse most of its shortcomings.",Army of the Dead

There were so many unanswered questions and annoying character decisions made throughout with extremely poor dialog and writing. I'm not sure if they were ever going for ""humor"" but if they were it really missed its mark. The movie felt ridiculous at times and still took itself too serious.

814,SimonsRants,Could've Been Better,5,22 May 2021,"Snyder had some interesting ideas that he put into this film but ultimately left all of them underutilized. The zombie hierarchy of alphas vs shamblers, the zombified tiger, the idea of zombies reproducing - all good ideas! But none of them were fulfilled and just ended up falling flat.The acting and writing were all atrocious - obviously - as the film was made more as a homage to b-movie zombie flicks; this film certainly hit the nail on the head by portraying how silly those are.I enjoyed the over the top style and gore of it all but found myself bored as the movie was bogged down by attempts to be relatable and show genuine human emotion. It failed at making a good film and should have focused more on leaning into the cheesy and ridiculous.As a Snyder fan I thought Army of the Dead (which I'm still confused why it was named that as there is no army of zombies at any point? Maybe name it something to do with a heist? Or Vegas? Viva la Zombie perhaps?) was okay. It's not Snyder's worst film but also far from his best. Knowing this was his first film entirely away from studio interference had my expectations up but after seeing it I realized that was unjustified. This wasn't Snyder as we've never seen him before, it's exactly what we're used to getting from him, just unedited. He wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel, just make a ridiculous zombie movie - and he succeeded at that.Army of the Dead was far from a work of art but it is also enjoyable for what it is: a cheesy zombie b-movie. If you go in with the right expectations and expect the plot to make zero sense, the acting to be hammy, and the gore to be off the charts you might just have a good time.

I had to watch the movie in 3 parts, two different days - and 2+ hours is not that long of a run time let's be real, but the movie just was not engaging. The action does nothing different/new; the story itself it is as flat as it could've been and the additional plots - where drama was meant to derive - are just annoying. In the end a person is left without knowing what he is aiming for - it seemed he wanted to achieve some diversity (diverse in casting and the roles they played...) highlights but misses it! I think of movies like WWZ - it's non-stop action, and yet can be said to be very intelligent, this is none of that. I think what is leaving me confused about his latest debuts is this urge to stretch narratives for whatever reason and still not adding lot (Justice League...), he seems to be more successful when he focuses in letting the action inform the narrative rather than the opposite (300, Man of Steel...).

Now i understand that it is a trope in the zombie genre to have dumb characters, but without spoiling anything, the main ""heart"" of the movie just flat out does not work.Its clear that Snyder wanted to tell a story of family and loss, but you dont feel any attachment to the rescue subplot of the film, which just drags it down. But then the ""twist"" of the movie is revealed and just made me roll my eyes.

838,VVMini,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,2,31 May 2021,"I know that's a phrase that gets thrown around a lot, but in this case you can check my ratings history to see that it's true, having rated only around a dozen or so movies a 2 or lower. One of them being another Zach Snyder movie (Justice League), while Batman v Superman and Man of Steel didn't fare much better. I guess it's fair to say Snyder ain't exactly my favourite director, though not because I want to. Watchmen is one of my all time favourite movies, and I even somewhat liked Sucker Punch for the ridiculousness that it is. I want to like his movies, but increasingly I end up blatingly hating them. So what makes Army of the Dead so especially repugnant for me?First and foremost, it's the terrible screenplay. The story itself is just so poor, filled with plot holes and conveniences that make me roll my eyes way too much. I don't expect Oscar worthy level of writing from a zombie heist film, but basic competence is the least I ask for. When your very first scene consists entirely of people doing the dumbest things possible, you know you're in for a wobbly ride.It feels like the script has not been proof read and the very first draft has been used. This idea is further supported by the fact that the movie is at least 45 minutes too long, classic case of the writer not wanting to kill his darlings. Which is what happens when you let your director also write the movie.Then there are the horrible characters that were all awful and desperately unlikeable. They are all incredibly one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Dave Bautista's character who is at least given some sort of backstory. The father-daughter relationship was supposed to be the backbone of the movie, but the daughter's actions were so stupid that I really couldn't care for a second about it.Worse were the two 'evil' human characters that were so laughably one-dimensional that they might have well been twirling their mustache and laughing maniacally everytime they were on screen (which I feel they might have actually done at some point). They were just thrown in there to have them been mauled in the worst ways possible and make us cheer instead of being repelled by it, which should be the case when humans get shredded by flesheating zombies. It's exceptionally cheap writing which showcases an inability to write any sense of moral ambiguity into your movie.Maybe I'm just not the target audience for this kind of movie, needing some sort of depth in my story instead of mindless cheap action and gore. And while I don't mind a bit of humor in my action movies, I think what Snyder wrote could barely constitute as such. Making a nerdy character scream like a little girl everytime he encounters a zombie is just not my idea of funny, sorry.Ultimately, it all feels incredibly cheap. From the writing to the production to the cinematography it feels like a blown up student movie. The actors did their best, but the fact that the cast is entirely C-list does not do the movie any favours. It makes each character more forgettable than the last and makes me not care at at all about any of them.Occasionally, Snyder does some interesting visual things, but man please let him stay as far away as possible from the writing table. Watchmen was a great movie, mostly because it stayed pretty close to the amazing source material. That's when Snyder's visual style actually enhances a movie. With terrible writing like Army of the Dead, all his visual quirks just make the experience even more grating.",Army of the Dead

847,nick-kelly-104-817149,Terrible cinematography,4,23 May 2021,"This film has some of the worst, most amateur, cinematography I have ever seen. What kind of noob cameraman shoots a portrait shot in shadow against an extremely bright background??? It was obviously a creative choice, because the exposition is delivered in back-lit darkness over and over and over again. As a photographer I found it infuriating. When someone is delivering dialogue you want their face lit so you can see properly what they are saying and the facial expressions, not people talking in shadow repeatedly. Maybe it was done on purpose so you cant see the wooden acting very well, who knows but I found it to be terrible. Large parts of the film are shot at a ridiculously shallow depth of field, sometimes leaving the subject of the frame out of focus! Some of the action sequences are a messy blur and much of it could be filmed anywhere as the background is continually out of focus. Its like someone has just discovered bokeh and totally overuses the effect when it is not needed or beneficial. It also had very excessive slow-mo.As for the movie itself, it was fun in a few places, had a couple of funny moments but was mostly fairly predictable and dull. It may have been because I was really looking forward to the film based on the trailers, the actual film itself was a bit of a let down in comparison. If you've seen the trailers you've seen 95% of the best parts of the entire 2.5 hour running time. It could easily have had 30-45 minutes chopped off with no loss and would have probably made for a better film. I felt it dragged on and on in places where the action slowed to some heartfelt dialogue, but I cared little for the characters, so wasn't really bothered about all the relationship parts of the film. Some of this endless exposition was during the time they were supposed to be racing against the clock, so destroyed any sense of tension.It was a passable movie, but nothing special and certainly not something I would want to watch more than once. It was also a swiss cheese of plot holes and unfired Chekov's guns, it seems that they were planning to make a string of movies setting up all kinds of plot directions that went unanswered. If there are sequels they will have to do much better than the first to regain my interest in a franchise.",Army of the Dead

Hell, hire a SEAL team, not a rag-tag bunch of wannabe mercenaries.2. For some reason, the daughter is willing to risk her life and everyone else's for some random mother (who dies anyway). There relationship is in no way established so why should we believe she cares?3. Random army dudes change into zombies immediately, but main characters take minutes/hours so they can have lengthy emotional conversations (see #13).4. SO much out-of-focus background shots, come on Zach! I felt like I needed glasses.5. Chambers (the only character I really liked) was a 100% Vasquez (Aliens) rip-off, even down to the bandana.6. For that matter, Martin was Burke. C'mon, Zach, have some originality!7. How did zombies turn Las Vegas to rubble?8. This is not a sequel to Zach's Dawn of the Dead (which I love). Having zombies enclosed in one city was incredibly dull.9. I did not buy for a single second that these people were zombies. Most of them looked like Cirque de Soil performers.

Nobody attempted to shoot the small group of zombies attacking Chambers and stood around, watching her get killed. And why didn't Chambers shout ""Martin tried to kill me!"" when she had the chance?13. Time for 2-3 sappy, pointless father/daughter chats when there's a nuke on the way?14. There's a nuke coming. Let's pause and have a nice ""You came back!"" conversation with the helicopter pilot, when in reality everyone would be clambering on that chopper and getting the hell out of there.15. Blonde girl could have easily gotten on the chopper while holding the gun to the zombie queen's head, then tossed it as they took off.16. How can zombies have babies? If they're dead anyway, how can the baby die? Wouldn't it still be a zombie even without its mother's head?17. I'm really confused as to why there are refugees(?)/a quarantine center right outside a zombie city. Um, perhaps move the camp a little bit further away? You know, for safety? And everyone's getting moved anyway to avoid the nuke, why would a mother need to go into the zombie city to buy her freedom?18. If it was a 50 million dollar heist, why go in with duffel bags? There's no way they grabbed more than a few hundred grand tops.19. Las Vegas bank vault has lethal booby traps?20. Lone survivor wanders through radiation zone like it's a day in the park.

I did scratch my head a few times as I watched just because of some of the actions by the characters. Mostly when the plan was unveiled for how they're going to get all the money out of the safe then return. Get $200 million in cash, load it onto a helicopter with multiple people and expect to fly out of there is about the dumbest and laziest plan I've ever seen in any movie.

The opening sequence promises much but, alas, that's about as good as it ever gets. At about 1hr 45mins I turned to my friend and said 'I really wish they'd hurry up and kill something'Characters you won't like, utterly silly plot points, poor dialogue and a soundtrack that favours weak cover versions of much loved classic songs instead of the originals.Poor outing but at least it cost a fortune!I don't normally call other reviewers out as it's pretty classless BUT, the writer who insists that the negative reviews here are 'corporate sabotage' really needs to grow up.That which is garbage, should be called garbage.",Army of the Dead

I also felt like this movie was a huge nod to An American Werewolf in London and Aliens. If you know those two movies you will know what I am talking about. Storyline was a little off center.

No. No it won't.This is Zack Snyder's best story he wrote...when he was a 14 year old boy.Save yourself two and a half hours (let's not even open that can of worms), and watch Dawn of the dead, I am Legend, or how about 28 days later... Ah the good old days.Honestly, this is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen, it's like it was written by a child and performed by college students. A world where nothing makes sense, and by that I mean the plot, character motivation, zombie lore, basic logic... (Two and a half hours later) ... Dialogue, acting, why was it copying scenes from Aliens?Those that love the zombie genre will love this?Get the heck out of here! I think you'll find fans of the genre will dislike this more than the average Joe (or Joeline).As will fans of heist movies, horror, action horror, comedy horror... This movie tries to be the jack of all trades, and predictably becomes the master of none.Let's be wacky like zombie land- next scene- I had to put down your mummy with a stake in the brain, sorry about that.The tone can't decide what is it, because the movie can't either.And it had the gaul to quote Joseph Campbell (The hero's journey) at the end...

VFX - Amazing,
Storyline - Different,
Music department - Well done,
Cinematography - Nailed it,
Screenplay - Good,
But there is no ""Emotional connectivity"" between any of those characters present in this movie. I think the character development completely fails in this ""Unlike Train to Busan there is no emotional connectivity in this movie"" and here is where this movie fails even though it is technically amazing.To be frank Dave Bautista character isn't written well and I expected lot of jumpscares but I got nothing.If these mistakes were rectified means ""Army of the dead"" would be a MASTERPIECE.",Army of the Dead

The zombies were way more interesting than the characters yet they were also 1 demential.The resolution is in no way worth the 2.5 hours to get there. There was no character development other than superficial and then by the end of the movie it was all for naught.

The two straight white guys are evil villains, par for the course at this point. I know when I'm being insulted, these garbage films, shows and streaming services aren't exactly subtle about it. By the way, I'm sure it's comments like these that got my last review refused. As mentioned elsewhere, the daughter character is hateful, the actress playing her gives a horrible performance.

875,RageQuitLeigh,File under don't take this too serious,6,9 June 2021,"Army Of The Dead is a vault heist movie set during a zombie pandemic which has been isolated to Las Vegas. A group is hired to infiltrate the city and crack a safe located within a casino and then escape within a timeframe splitting the cash with their benefactor.The main issue with AOTD is the run time of 2.5 hours, its just ridiculously too long and could easily have been cut down to 90 minute without any impact to the movie presented by Zak Synder. The reason why the timeframe is such an issue is that very little happens out side of the actual premise. Had the movie been a lot tighter and punchy it would be much easier to overlook and/or enjoy the weak casting apart from Bautista and Dillahunt (the rest is really laughably weak), the constant weird decisions by the characters or impeccable accuracy almost everyone had in killing the dead.That being said it does look great overall, the segments to music are impressive and we are given a slightly different take on the zombie that we get most of the time. Therefore I suggest that this movie is filed under don't take too serious and try and enjoy.I suspect that we will see more of this franchise as there were many Easter eggs and brief events throughout the movie that had no impact on the characters or their journey but were seemingly there for world building purposes.Lastly this movie felt like it was more of a theatre presentation and being restricted to streaming on your tv definitely didn't help any of the above.",Army of the Dead

You have to be really dumb to to like something like this. My guess is Netflix paid for reviews while this movie is in the theatres, so they do not lose their profits.Right in the beginning military truck exploding in frontal collision is just plain stupid. If you would like to know the only explosion that can occur is from hitting fuel tank, not a single military vehicle nor a civilian has a frontal fuel tank. If Zack Snyder approved this scene he is just dumb! This fact alone makes this movie already stupid. In the middle of the movie my only desire was to fast forward and be done with it.Verdict: this movie is not worth our precious time or money, if you are desperate to see it, make sure you don't pay for this crap.

Why bother having someone tell us they have NEVER killed a zombie only to have her turn into John Wick and proceed to kill more zombies than the freaking nuke does?? Why were there terminator zombies with metal skulls that's sparkled? I honestly thought there was going to be an M Night twist once I started noticing it. Why waste so much time on that one dumb lady just to have her die in the last minute?? Why give Vandy a mystery bite when we don't actually see him get bitten? We get a good look at the arm right after the ""bite"" and oh look, no marks. The infection takes minutes up to an hour to take effect. My guy had time to survive the nuclear blast, find a way to get out of the vault, haul heavy bags of money across the Nevada desert to reach his secluded shack, drive to Utah, rent a plane in Utah, fly from Utah to Mexico city and then started feeling sick.

Dawn is great and captures the mood perfectly and has a great cast. This is full of annoying cardboard cutout characters with a stupid plot with some zombies acting more like deranged humans from Mad Max or The Hills Have Eyes. Everything about this felt forced and lacked genuine emotion or tension from the getting the team together scenes to the 'heartfelt' scenes between Scott and Kate (I had to look up their names) to the mission itself (oh they're there already) and the inevitable finale.

887,big_c_boss,"Please Zack Synder, Stop Making Movies.",1,22 May 2021,"The movie opens with two Army guys, driving a truck that is carrying a secret payload (I wonder what it is?) and cutting back and forth between a Just Married couple (Who is an obvious Gold Digger and Tubby guy with Money). The Army guys talk back and forth about what they could be carrying, throwing out every pop culture reference they can. Because Zack Synder is Smart and Witty. While doing this they hit the car of Newlyweds, Somehow. Their payload shoots of the truck and the car explodes. A few seconds later, the door on the payload opens, because, ya. And the Army guys decide to get close to it, while One of the Two Drivers calls for what to do. Keep in mind, the door is open and whatever is inside is just hanging out, while Army guys point guns inside and stare. As soon as they're told to retreat, a Zombie jumps out and kills them all, within seconds (He was waiting for the suspense music, as we all do). The two Army drivers run for it, but get caught and killed. And now the three of them go to Vegas for a Buffet. Don't worry about what happened to all the other Army guys. The Zombie ""Venom"" didn't work on them, I guess.I only described the opening like this to show you the level of incompetence we are dealing with.Now onto the Opening Credit Montage, Synder is legally required to have in every movie. And b y the end of the opening credits, you're slapped with 110% Snyder. Nothing but stupid and action, also a cliched and not so subtle song choice. Of course.As soon as the movie opens, Synder goes into high gear with the purely Expositional Character, asking our Main Character to ""Come out of retirement for one last job"". Then we go into the ""Toxic Male"" who treats Women like crap. So far, Synder is showing us how great he always is at character development.Cut to the Synder Nightmare scene in every one of his movies, where more exposition is told for multiple characters at once, insanely sloppy and amateurish. Batista wakes up, it was his nightmare and we get to see him crying like a big scary baby in it. He then makes the call to accept the job, but making sure loudly say ""I don't like you!"", so we know he's the good guy. Keep up the great work Zack.Now, It's time to get the team together. And since it's 2021, you know it's full of tiny, but unbelievably tough Women and Badass Minorities. Sometimes both at once. And now it's time to get the eccentric but quirky and lovable safecracker. Yes, That's right. Zack Synder read Filmmaking for Dummies and memorized it cover to cover.Immediately after, cut to the another terrible, cliched cover song over a montage. Ya, yet one more Montage. Synder can't tell anyone anything about a character without a montage or dream sequence. Well or an expendable expositional character.Now that the team is assembled, time to get everyone in a room and tell everyone the plan and reason it's hard to get in, but easy to get out.Now, Keep in mind, except for there being Zombies, this could honestly being one of any 10 different movies, beat for beat. The fact this came out on Netflix and was made by Zack Synder mean that this movie could never have been good. But, This is even beyond any level of terrible and blatantly unoriginal that we come to except from BOTH Zack Synder and NetFlix. It's only been 34 minutes of two and a half hours and I think this movie was made on a bet. Because, can even Zack Synder be this oblivious and delusional to his complete lack of talent?By the 40 minute mark and the ""I'm Head of Security and I'm going with you. Whether you like it or not"" Character, that this movie wasn't complete without. Oh, and also the ""I was terrible Father and I'm getting this money for you. But I need your help"" scene. I'm out. This movie is just everything we all knew about Zack Synder since 300, He can ONLY direct action scenes.Now i'm just skipping through the rest, hoping to be entertained by Zombie Carnage. Because I need to be entertained by something in this overlong mess.I hope this helped you decide not to watch this movie and just stare at a wall for two and half hours.",Army of the Dead
888,teocrito,More plot holes than zombies,3,22 May 2021,"I watched the movie the other day and I felt so disappointed. Dawn of the death was fantastic, just what zombie genre needed. But this? This is just bad. Horribly written with so much plot holes and so many stupid decisions. Here is a list of what is wrong with the movie:
Why the military is always so stupid? An important package is transported by a military convoy and it gets involved in a car crash. OK, could happen... But it's not enough to destroy a military trunk.Soon there is a zombie apocalypse in Las Vegas and the city is closed down but inexplicable they make a quarantine zone just beside 50.000 zombies and people go in and out like students in a boarding school. Aren't they afraid of another outbreak?The movie doesn't say how many time pass between the first outbreak and the present, but it's suggested that two or three years at least, so why is still a quarantine zone and why some people like the main characters can abandon it and others not? It's clear that they aren't infected so what's the point?The quarantine zone is a complete joke, not just because the security is nonexistent, it's because it's supposed to be a zombie outbreak where are the scientists? Why do they need volunteers? It doesn't make any sense. The whole army should be there and it should be a restricted area.Why Tanaka, the guy who hires the team, hired them? I mean he is supposed to be rich, why not hire professionals who wouldn't even go against you? Because when it's revealed what he needs they don't want to do it. Besides it's stupid that they go for that much trouble just to get a zombie head. I believe that is quite easy.Now let's talk about the protagonist and his daughter. Yes, she is a volunteer is the quarantine zone and the team need her to go into the city and of course at first she doesn't want to go in but when she realizes that some friends have gone inside Las Vegas she joined them and put the whole team at risk because she is a useless.The other characters are specifically picked because of their qualities, well at least in the movie because they are casted like Netflix does, not because of their talent but for the sake of diversity. We have a Latino woman, some black dudes, strong women, a German boy that looks like a hipster that tell people off when they are politically incorrect... I know these things in EEUU are somehow important but in Europe we see this as laughable and sad. And don't worry there are references to how men (always white) are evil when it comes to women.How is it possible that a guy that works in a hardware store knows how to open a casino vault? I think he is wasting his talents as clerk.At some point the protagonist daughter flees to look for her friends that are being held by some clever zombies (who knows why) but she seems to have a sixth sense or something because she knows exactly in which casino she is. And of course, when his father realized that she is missing he goes to look for her and he knows exactly where to look. And of course, the casino is huge, laden with rooms and quite destroyed but they found each other quite fast.At one moment the daughter starts shooting zombies in the head without fail even though she has never shot anything in his life.In the end the remaining team flee from the city when the nuclear bomb is coming and they are in a helicopter crash that in the real world would kill everyone inside. Not here, the daughter and the father survive, but he has been bitten so she has to kill him...At the beginning of the movie we see that once your are bitten you become a zombie in seconds. Well, one of the characters managed to survive hiding in the vault and escape for a secret passage (Kanata didn't know that even though he gave the team a detailed blueprint. He has been bitten but not only he doesn't become a zombie in second but also he survives the radiation of the nuclear bomb. And of course, he finds a car in perfect condition.There are more of inconsistencies but I would be writing more than I spent watching this garbage. I don't recommend it.",Army of the Dead

Zack Snyder was behind Dawn of the Dead back in 2004 which is one of my favorite zombie movies. I like Dave Bautista, Omari Hardwick, Theo Rossi, and Hiroyuki Sanada. Unfortunately, it was slow paced with way too many dialog scenes so I found myself bored AF half way through it. I think Zack Snyder has gotten used to putting out long movies even when it is not needed. They should have cut out 20 minutes of the talking scenes to speed things along. Ella Purnell that played the daughter was awful, worst actor in the movie. I like Tig Notaro but her scenes felt so fake and out of place since her scenes were shot after the movie was complete. You can't have the same vibe or flow as the rest of the cast if you were never involved in the original filming, so it is not her fault. I get replacing Chris D'elia but they should have left him in for the sake of the movie. I didn't like him even before the accusations, I just think the character would have flowed with the movie better. I can say visually, the movie looks great. Just the story was weak and too much dialog was added for zero reason. For you Snyder groupies, he has some good movies under his belt but some bad ones too...he is truly a mediocre director. He will never be Christopher Nolan, Stephen Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, or even Quentin Tarantino. Just deal with it.",Army of the Dead
897,matttalks,Zack Snyder is just not a good director,3,22 May 2021,"Script was pretty bad. I know it's a zombie movie but a lot of the issues I had with the writing seemed to be just simple laziness on the writers. The music was also bad. And I've noticed this in other of his movies but just songs that don't match up with the feel of what's going on. He also does this thing where he tries to make things seem much more epic by including some of his bs music during a scene that's supposed to be ""deep"" for lack of a better word, and stays with the scene for way longer then it worked for. That's not good storytelling. It's a step above the characters simply saying to the audience that this scene is important. Most of the actions and motivations of the characters also just didn't make sense. Also the acting of the daughter was not very good. The only cool thing about the film was the different kind of zombie situation. However, even with the zombies, they didn't all or almost any for that matter eat or try to eat people. But then in other pasty's they did. Like I said, the writing was bad. Lastly there was so much of the story that was shown in close up shots of one person while they're talking or doing something. And I feel like this was meant to be artistic but all it seemed to do for me was make me feel like there was no ""world of the movie"". It was distracting and made the end result feel lik not a cohesive story but and Amalgam of random things sewn together. He's just not a talented director. And the writers were all talentless or they just put as little effort as possible into this project. Whenever I get that impression from something I'm watching I honestly get offended bc I and I'm sure countless other people would kill for an opportunity to work on a movie or in that world so when I see or experience people that obviously don't respect what their doing or the audience enough to not make really stupid mistakes or to put out enough effort to not have a bowl movement equate the the movie going experience of their project, it makes me really hate those people. I got that feeling as a result of watching this movie. The different zombie dynamic is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star.",Army of the Dead
898,Freakinoldguy,Wow.,2,24 May 2021,"I really wanted to like this move, I really did. But it was pretty much impossible. The acting is wooden, the script is ridiculous and the plot line is less than intelligent but the special effects were okay and apparently that's all you need to make a movie that people today will happily watch.On the plus side though, you do get your money's worth because besides being free it's actually 4 movies in one. You get 300 Miles to Graceland, Dawn of the Dead, Stakeland (the good one) and Mars Attacks. Any of which would be considered an Oscar contender when compared to this dog.I heard it called ""campy fun"" by one Youtube reviewer. Well unfortunately it's campy but fun isn't what i'd describe the experience of watching it as. Suffice to say that by trying to incorporate every horror movie ever made into one move Netflix swung for the fences and as to be expected when aiming that high.missed. Although they do get high marks for being 100% politically correct and incorporating every minority group into the movie.But maybe next time they could skip spending most of the budget on special effects and put it towards screenwriters that can actually tell a story that follows a logical plotline and makes sense,",Army of the Dead

This is a great B movie, and I'd wager to bet that it will be a cult classic in 20ish years. First off, the movie scored points with me right away simply by referring to them as zombies. The movie knows what it is, not ashamed of it, doesn't hide it. It's a B movie. Simple as that, it delivers on gore, action, and some pretty decent effects and worldbuilding, and you'll find it a bit lacking in scripting or trying a bit too hard at times. But the result is just a fun ride. The zombies were pretty great too, the fact that they were at least semi-sentient without being outright smart made them all the more creepy. Lots of semi-overt humor as well. Like primitive cavemen, that sort of society. The movie starts out a bit slow, but picks up once they get inside the city. Nice ending with a chance for a sequel. If you compare it to top tier blockbusters, it would be like a 4, maybe. But for a zombie B flick, easily an 8-9, and if you add a pinch of 42O to the mix easily a 9-10.",Army of the Dead

904,TheBabayaga,It's fun. Nothing more nothing less.,7,14 May 2021,"For the most part you should bet all in for a good time because Army of the Dead is a riotous, gratuitous, gleefully over-the-top zombie thriller overloaded with guts, gore and visual flair. The plot is also irresistibly ludicrous. Think Aliens or Ocean's Eleven with zombies and you've pretty much got the gist. The whole package on display here is fun and utterly bonkers. Nothing more nothing less.However, this being a Zack Snyder film, you should expect the usual frustrations, namely a lack of character development and a bum-numbing runtime. It's not without its other niggles, too. Following a strong opening credits sequence, pacing problems make way for a predictable introduction to an array of thinly veiled characters, all of whom appear to be discount versions of Burke and Vasquez from Aliens. It's clear to me the majority of this cast were picked for their collectively distinctive looks and little else.Army of the Dead is also riddled with plot holes...and annoying character deaths. Take the largely insignificant character of Chambers for example. After she's led astray into a trap set by Martin, she amasses a totally badass 50 kill streak before being left for dead by her crew, including her sharpshooter best friend who does nothing to save her when there was ample opportunity to do so. WTF!? This was annoying and an unnecessary attempt to maintain the story's vague and far-fetched mystery. Chambers deserved better.Look, I still stand by what I said. Army of the Dead is fun. Nothing more nothing less. There's no need for a Snyder cut of this film. For better or worse, this is a Zack Snyder film through and through; it's one of his better works since Watchmen (2009) and maybe enough to win over some of the stubborn Snyder skeptics.",Army of the Dead

The problem is the execution.I watched the movie expecting to get zombie killing fun with cheesy moments and an overall fun time. I got that, but the movie feels a bit bloated at times, and also could have spent more time on the heist and the zombie killing,The one thing that really holds this movie back from greatness is the side plot with the daughter wanting to save 3 people who willingly went back into Las Vegas to get money from one of the casinos. I understand the motivation to save people, but when there's 9 minute left till the city is nuked, it's a really dumb decision.Also, there isn't really even a heist. It all goes wrong because one of the guys in the crew turns on the rest. As a result, no money is taken, and the entire crew is pretty much killed. It all feels like it was for nothing. This movie could have been sick. But instead, the movie wastes its potential by falling on dumb cliches and dumb plot points.Watch the first 15 minutes and then just turn it off.

920,fostersforums,Watch this if you want to be even more braindead than the zombies,2,23 May 2021,"Bad:The daughter: one of the most vapid, annoying, unlikeable characters in the movie, even more so than one of the characters who is SUPPOSED to be unlikeable. I wanted to slap her a few times - just a pessimistic, ungrateful runt who plays to the overtired, one-note ""I hate my dad who is trying to patch things up with me"" trope. Her only purpose in the movie is to be as annoying as possible.As a side note - Hollywood: can we PLEASE abandon the ""I'm coming with you"" trope? How many times must this awful device be hammered into audiences? It's been done to death for decades now, and it is shallow, lazy, everyone expects it and just tells us you can't be bothered with writing better scripts.Anyway, I couldn't find a single engaging thing about her and was hoping she would be one of the first to die. That would have been an interesting departure from the Hollywood schlock.Acting: yeah, I get this is a zombie flick, but is it possible to hire actors who don't overdeliver their lines? The the dialogue can be partly to blame for this, which leads us to...The dialogue: even when you take away the vomit-inducing conversations between the father and daughter, most of the lines are terribly written cringe fests. When there are attempts at humor, it's try-hard and equally cringey.Zombies: I might get a lot of flack for this, but the whole ""look I'm a zombie, I'm going to writhe around and screech for 20 minutes straight in a closeup which shows my scary, scary eyes!"" got old 15 years ago. I found the sub-plot of the ""kingdom"" to be very silly. I suppose this is where the title of the movie comes from.Good:I'm struggling here... Bautista was OK, much toned down from what we've seen in his Guardians role. Some of the action scenes were cool, but this isn't saying much.I struggled to watch the whole way through and stopped 20 minutes short to write this review. Don't think I'll watch the rest. It is just too vapid and mediocre a movie for me to wonder how it all plays out.I'm surprised this came from Zack Snyder's direction, the same guy who created Watchmen which I deem as close to a masterpiece. AOTD is a far, far cry from that level of direction and storytelling. Watch this only if you want to be as braindead as the zombies.",Army of the Dead

922,platon_mp,Enjoyable ride! if you like the genre u will be entertained,7,10 June 2021,"Zombie movies are mostly known for being absolutely rubbish so if you compare it to the most of them its a decent take. Now if they removed the daughters arc completely the movie would have flown much more natural. I Felt annoyed that the screentime she took at the end could be used for a boss fight between Batista and the zombie chief or an epic closure with the team firing in the open to thousands of zombies while trying to escape with the helicopter. But instead Batista had to chase the little shit who after hours of not giving a damm suddenly remembered to go save her ""friend"" in the last 20 mins before a nuclear bomb explodes in their heads.But apart from that i dont see any major flaw in the movie. The pacing was fine, especially after they entered the city, the characters were likeable with a light persona and i would totally love to be in their group, the camera work decent with the only thing that i noticed is the overuse of close shots. And finally the action was great, you could sense the danger the moment they stepped in the city, the zombies were threaneting and the concept of hierarchy was new and fresh.And that makes me wonder if the reviews nowdays are just a race of who can nitpick the most unimportant annoying details and logical gaps In a B MOVIE about zombies. I could agree with an bad rating if i watched some real arguments but apparently some of the reasons that are enough for most imdb critics to give 1star ratings is 1) They didnt close the door when they entered the city 2) First woman didnt warn them about the guy when she died 3) how daughter can headshot with no training 4) black guy doesnt die of radiaton.....and more. Thats not even seeing the forest for the tree but for the leaf. Taking the trouble to answer in such points will hurt my intelligence.Having said that ..the movie had so much potential that i can understard some viewers being mad but its worth a watch in a saturday night with friends.

None of the characters are likeable except maybe the German safe cracker and the daughter is unintentionally maybe the biggest villan in the movie! The plot holes are as numerous as the amount of headshots even the noob shooters seem to land against hoards of running and dodging undead. So your telling us Tanakas cash in that vault wasn't insured and why doesn't he know the safe codes to his own vault? Why are some zombies eyes and brains blue? We know a bit about zombie king but zombie queen? Zero context, why does she run and move different to the rest? The undead can have babies?? Then theres the annoying nonsensicle writing. No country in their right mind would nuke a contained threat that could be eliminated with bullets to the head. The army at the beginning are so untrained and non lethal a scout group would be a better option for a high security escort. That same scout group could probably also plan a better way of getting the money out of the casino while keeping the place locked down and zombies out. Did I mention the zombie headshot to bullets fired ratio? While I love a clean pumpkin popping cranium explosion as much as the next guy, the ease at which these are pulled by the triggers of the untrained marksman in the film is a bit cringy, And then with all that epic fire power they just bail on the first Latino girl that dies in the hall way, they could have easily got her out of that scratch. Would you bring a concrete saw to a zombie fight? For something that weighs equivalent to a mini gun this was a wasted opertunity. If the vault wasn't locked when the black guy was shut in it I understand him getting out, but how he then crawled out from ground zero of a nuclear explosion without growing a second head I'll never understand. The opening montage screamed zombieland without the humour, though the rest of the visuals are very well done. Bautista was good, always a fan. The time loop theory when they find the other team dead in the vault room was cool and could have been furthered. Zombie tiger was cool. The movie In general thankfully wasn't overly woke or politically preachy which was a fresh breeze of hope for what now days seems to be a crumpling Hollywood and is the reason for at least 3 stars, Bautista gets the other.

940,recca01982,Don't waste your time,2,27 May 2021,"Okay so first of all, I will preface this with the fact that I generally love all zombie movies. There're few of them that I can't watch due to either horrendous scripts, or horrendous actors. That being said,... this was BARELY watchable. That was mostly due to the fact that I had nothing else to do.The plot - I'd love to give you a plot,... except it was basically ""Hey, there's a bank with chump change to me, but you might want it. Go get it. Oh, a plan? I'm sure you'll think of something. The crew? Oh that's up to you!""There was literally nothing to say more than this. It was a ""heist"" (very loosely worded) of missing money insurance already paid out to a billionaire. Nothing about it made sense, even with the addition of the David Hasselhoff wannabe (seriously, he looked like a young Hasselhoff to me), and attempting to make a zombie army.The Characters - This is where it honestly annoyed me the most. Such a rag tag group of nobodies thrown together, given a crap backstory and a ""medal of honor"" for their duties. We are supposed to want them to succeed with the plan and live happily ever after. But to be completely honest,.... I was routing for them all to die because they're so FREAKING ANNOYING. Batista's character is so dense and monotone that it felt like a chore listening to him act it out. Geeta was somebody that the movie honestly could've gone completely without, ergo also removing the daughter. That would've saved us 20 minutes of stupidity. Cumming's could've been removed from the entire movie, because his sole purpose was to be a BARTER item. Question for you,... what was the plan BEFORE he wandered into the equation. What were we trading then?!?About the only ones I decently liked was Dieter and. Vanderohe, and that was just because of the comedic acts between the two. Which, was horrendously out of place in this style of movie.Then you have the big 'baddie' of zombies. Yikes,.... tell me you're trying to make Planet of the Zombies. Intelligent alpha's controlling the minors to do their bidding. A 'love' story between two zombies which makes ZERO sense at all. And a revenge ending John Wick style because they cut off his dog's(female love interests) head. It was horrible!The Music - This was an obvious attempt at playing into the popularity of Day of the Dead and Shaun of the dead. Random music mix's that made light of situations and or attempted to make them feel more epic than they were.The slow motion - WHY are we doing slow motion in a zombie movie?!? It just makes the FLAWS that much more obvious. And this movie abused the slow motion more than any college co-ed movie did (you know the ones). Especially during the opening scenes, the slow motion was so painful to watch with guns not being aimed where heads are being blown up. Character faces being frozen in weird expressions. Gore which was obviously thrown in to appease the ""gore"" trope.The Plot holes - Okay,.... I honestly can't be bothered to point all of these out. But the glaring ones for me were the following; (no order, just how I remember them)
1) At the end, they take off in a Helicopter toward the Olympus. They lead the big baddie on the rooftop while they fly away. Cut the next scene of them arriving at the Olympus, and the big baddie ALREADY ARRIVED ON A DEAD HORSE. Talk about beating a dead horse.2) Like every good C-rated movie,... you need to stop and stare at the enemies and have someone die before you react. Case in point, let's stop and stare at the elevator full of zombies, let the SUDDEN (and I mean sudden) love interest get her head twisted. THEN wait another couple seconds to react.This will be the final one, because honestly I feel like a book writer right now with how bad this movie turned out.3) The scene where they leave Chambers for dead,... despite there only being two zombies holding her down. That scene INFURIATED ME. Why even add her to the roster if you were just going to sit around and watch her die, pretending to give a hoot. Then,.... the movie goes on as if she never existed. Guz obviously noticed something was amiss, even blamed The Hasselhoff impersonator, and then seemed to completely forget everything that happened.Okay one more. I was going to ignore this one, but it was just annoying me...4) The heist,...... the entire point and basis of this movie? Pointless. The whole objective of Tanaka was supposedly the blood of the zombies to create an army. You're telling me that he couldn't just get inside with his own team, take one, and get out within 20 minutes? He had to mess around, make a dastardly plan and try and bribe some ex-heroes to do it? And the Government obviously knew about it, since there's a scene where Tanaka is sitting with Military personnel. They could've gotten the clearance just as easily!The movie,... didn't have to exist. At all. Just let that sink in, while you try and try to defend and justify the $70m-$90m budget of this movie. What. A. Waste. Of. Money. And to hear they're attempting to push for a TV series from this garbage,... laughable. Honestly,.... don't waste your time here.",Army of the Dead

942,Donnie_Quixotic,Zombie Adventure Hits Dead On,8,21 May 2021,"A perfect companion piece to Snyder's previous zombie flick, ""Dawn of the Dead."" Being a fan of that film, as well as other movies and games like ""I Am Legend,"" ""World War Z,"" and ""The Last of Us,"" this really was a blast to watch.The performances are great, led by Dave Bautista who I've been a fan of since his small role in ""Blade Runner 2049"" as well as ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - he always shows legitimate acting chops. The rest of the characters are all well differentiated, having their unique quirks which makes them fun to watch.My only minor gripe with film is Snyder's cinematography - don't get me wrong he's always good with his shot selection and composition, but the camera is out of focus for a lot of the shots; which I'm assuming was some bizarre artistic choice... Anyway, I found it a little distracting and unnecessary, but as I said, it's a minor thing and not a movie killer.In summing up, ""Army of the Dead"" is helluva a lot of fun, with a tonne of heart, some real dramatic moments of pathos, mixed with moments of levity, and energised by a smorgasbord of grotesque meaty action sequences and an upbeat and playful soundtrack. I'm thrilled I got to watch it at home on Netflix, but it's definitely a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen in theatres.",Army of the Dead

This muddled, horrendously captured crap fest was truly a slog to get through - it took me three days to work my way through it - and there was hardly one original thought in an overlong, uninspired, badly acted (Ella Purnell in particular deserves a mention here) mess.

951,charleski2000,Aliens 2,4,28 May 2021,"James Cameron's Aliens is one of the great action movies of all time. It has had enormous influence on the films that came after. But I don't know I've seen any quote it so literally and at such length. The quotes go right down to lines lifted verbatim, ""You don't see them ****ing each other over.""The difference is that Aliens was Sigourney Weaver versus the Mother-Queen, and this is Dave Batista versus the Husband-King. Oh, and obviously all the zenomorph space stuff is ripped out and zombie Las Vegas grafted in place. Instead of Newt we have a load of money.Still, it's enjoyable as a b-movie.I might have said it was well-made, except for the fact that Zack Snyder needs to stop messing with technical stuff he doesn't understand and realise that the setting to remove dead pixels needs to be kept 'on'. Turning it off on the camera does *not* result in a better picture. Luckily the studio can largely fix that in post if the film makes enough money to justify the considerable expense this will involve. At least two of the camera units he used to film had different faulty pixels, and the eye jumps right to them every time they appear. It's like an old movie that was shot on the cheap and had a couple of reels go slightly bad in processing which were then spliced in with the rest of the takes.",Army of the Dead

The subsequent vault robbery could have been more like the quiet tension of World War Z mixed with the fun characterizations of Oceans 11. Too much time spent on the Alpha ""zombie"" and that story which was supposed to give a reason for the behavior, which honestly to me has no place in a zombie movie. This is more like the alternate ending of I am Legend, but even more poorly done. A poor excuse for a zombie movie, closer in plot to Aliens.

The way it was done just grated and did not sit well.The acting was ropey and of course you had to have the strong women roles shoved in there front and centre as per usual. Look, I don't mind women in strong roles (Alien - one of the best films ever) it's just every $%$@ action film nowadays and as soon as I see it, it Just feels forced. I see it so much I am half expecting the lady in our corner shop to be wearing sunglasses with a chewed matchstick hanging out the corner of her mouth the next time I pop in for some milk - ""here's yer Goddam change!"", as she headbutts me out the door!I think Dave Bautista is great but have been waiting for a great movie for him - so disappointed in the Die Hard rip-off Final Score that he was in.Thought the CGI tiger looked great in the trailer but I am not wasting anymore of my life with this film.",Army of the Dead

I cannot believe it takes 40+ minutes before they actually enter zombie land! Honestly I did not care. The only issue I had was it seemed like to many female superwoman characters. Once the movie starts I had some questions. Why do they not just have soldiers stand on the walls and shoot zombies? Bautista never misses. I bet him and the first girl that does both kill over 100 zombies each. Why did the Security guy not go with the first team that went in? How did they all die in same place and not get turned into zombies? How did snider get away with ripping off aliens so many times.1. Company man who is a traitor! 2. Company man betrays and locks them in so that they will all die. 3 company man gets immediately killed and so basically his death means nothing. 4. Pilot moves vehicle, making hero of movie think they are betrayed and at last minute vehicle comes up over wall while at same time creature is exiting elevator/stairs.Coyote makes group move in doors and after going through one area filled with zombies they attack zombies and leave and immediately are back outside and all zombies apparently have decided to take a break till later in movie. Why not just stay outside till you get to main casino? I know a little about generators and a full tank on a regular generator can run about 8 hours and keep power on for about half the things in the house. The characters put in a few gallons and are able to run ever slot machine ever light and ever elevator as well as everything else until they need to leave. One character dies on way to casino and one is captured. Once they get to main casino all but three of the characters die mostly in stupid ways. How did the black guy get through all the radiation? How did the main zombie get back to his hotel a second after the helicopter got there? This could have been great. Instead it was stupid. Bautista was not bad, but he was dumb as main character. At least 30 minutes of the movie are spent with characters having long conversations when there kind should be on staying alive. The good of this movie. The German! He is awesome! The love interest is good as well, this movie would have been way better as a Poseidon adventure with one by one group dying as they try to get to chopper. Chopper pilot was too unbelievable.

True, there are one or two plot imperfections, but not enough to seriously distract or subtract from the overall premise.How can people suspend belief enough to even consider watching a zombie movie, but draw the line at the actions of these characters? (There are individuals who actually exist that are much more unbelievable and bizarre). This is a zombie movie that most negative reviewers are grading as if it's an Oscar contender (in my opinion, A. Of the D. Is not quite bad enough for Oscar consideration).Army of the Dead is the first best new zombie movie of 2021. Fine acting, unusual plot, great sets, superb visuals, realistic effects.

1000,johnofardeal,Army of the bad writers,5,3 June 2021,"My biggest gripe with this movie is that the trailer was big lie - all the great action sequences and chainsawing of zombies was condensed in a brief 5 minutes intro. I wanted to see that dude use his massive chainsaw, that's what I signed up for. I wanted to see more of zombie tiger, more of Bautista beating zombie.My 2nd issue with this movie - Ella Purnell's character. I don't recall seeing Ella in other movies, but man... her character was so annoying and so overacted. I completely lost interest in the movie when she joined the crew. I was obvious what was about to happen. The whole father - daughter re-connecting plot was just thrown in. I would've liked to see more of the other characters and focus on the bad decisions some numb-minded brat made.My 3rd issue - the plot with the missing ladies and the ending. How was I supposed to care about the those ladies? They didn't add anything. Was there supposed to be some emotional thing going on there with them taking a chance on the other side of the fence? I've only seen them for la 30 seconds and I'm supposed to care about the deep meta plot that completely overrides stakes of the movies in the end? Such a bad writing decision.I did like the diverse personalities in the main line-up. I thought that had a lot of potential but I was left wanting more. I really enjoyed the interactions between the Dieter and the chainsaw guy. I wanted more of that. More action, more zombie fights. I wanted the dead to actually pose a threat.",Army of the Dead
1001,AussieJim,A complete waste of time and $70M dollars,3,22 May 2021,"Netflix has added a feature that allows viewers to increase a films playing speed 1.25 and 1.5 times.After sitting through the first 40 minutes of this nonsense, I increased the playing speed to 1.25, and about half way through the film, instead of stopping it to watch something else, I pushed the playing speed up to 1.5.Although it did make the action speed by much faster, it did not improve the acting, storyline, or anything else about the film.It saddens me to see the budget for this schlock was 70-million dollars. Netflix could have given ten million dollars each to seven young directors and asked each of them to produce their first feature film.I guarantee at least one or two of those first films would have been better than Army Of The Dead.Ironically, the title sums up the film perfectly.

Some of the effects are poorly executed and clunky such as gun flashes that look superimposed.The story is poor and editing muddled.The acting is ok but spoiled by some annoying characters and yes they are such cliché of just about any other heist/zombie/action movie.Such a shame as I was really looking forward to watching this latest offering from Zack Snyder who does make some great action movies.For me the saving grace was the soundtrack with some fun re interpretations of old classics and some great originals.If the annoying, boring and cliché talky bits were edited out and the film reduced to about 1hr 40mins it would be a much better movie.",Army of the Dead

1012,SnekDok,seriously terrible in every way.,1,24 May 2021,"Acting - Awful. Everyone delivers their lines in the most over acted way. The screaming child to the slow talking omg finish a sentence pilot.Writing - The plot is sooooo incredibly bad. The actual screenplay, like why chars move from here to here makes no sense at all. The actions of the chars is WELL beyond dumb. Like .... makes ZERO sense possible. I feel like maybe a joke was supposed to happen somewhere in this movie... nope. Majority of the movie is watching actors move from point A to point B in the slowest most boring way possible. Even the action scenes are boring as all hell.Music - Awesome sound track that should never have been tainted on the likes of this crap. When I heard Zombie by the cranberries, all washed out and filtered over top this movie I wanted to cry.Directing - Zack Snyder has got to be one of the worst directors in the last 10 years. Dawn of the dead was decent, but it did have its lulls. But my god... the moment this guy discovered slow mo...snap cut...slo mo again. My god, he never stops. From the opening to the ending.. its non stop slow mo.. snap cut.. slow mo. Same crap you see in all his super hero fight scenes. It would be a realllly cool effect if used sparingly.. but nope. EVERY OTHER CUT. This movie should be 75 mins TOPS. But it drags into 2 hours because of horrible dialogue, directing and editing.I donno how anyone, even a film student... even an electrical student with an iphone could mess up a zombie movie this badly. But damn.. maybe thats why Snyder is so ""popular"" now. He's done what no one else ever could.... make one of the worst zombie movies ever made, while having a hollywood budget. I personally couldnt make a zombie movie as bad as this if I tried.. so ya.. he def has a talent, can't deny that.My god, even the credits alone were 9-10 mins long, probably bunch of slow mow jump cutting there too.

Easily one of his strongest films to date. It's a clever blending of two classic genres. A suspensful zombie gore fest and a heist movie filled with banter and humor. It's so fun, action packed, epic and so damn bloody with a lot of emotional bits sprinkled throughout. It is very much a Suicide Squad zombie film. Snyder's new additions in an already oversaturated genre is brilliant. I love what he brings to the table with these new and improved zombies. They're clever, organised and fierce.

1024,barrywomb,Meh- Snyder needs to edit so much,4,23 May 2021,"I've watched a lot of Zack Snyder films over the past few decades. All of them with high hopes because the subject matter is stuff I like: comics, zombies, etc. I sat through this 2.5+ hour movie last night coming away with the same feeling I've had from ALL of them:WAY. TOO. LONG.And, No, it's not because I have 'The Millennial Attention Span(TM)'. I'm an older person that loves a good, well-told story. The basis for so many of Snyder's movies comes from some great sources- comics (great art in many of them, but well-edited stories, boiled down to their core to fit into a (usually) small format).As I look back over movies that bored me to death in this century, the first one had to be 'Man of Steel'. I was psyched to have Superman come back to the big screen and hoped for the best. There was a story there. Always was. But Snyder made his battle scenes so gd long. He has done the same thing in every consecutive comic book film. There's no need for an hour-long battle scene especially when it's just a mishmash of every CGI effect in the book. Batman VS Superman- same thing. Justice League (both versions) -same thing - and yet in the edited-down version, so much of the elements of the STORY are left on the floor. Don't even get me started on Aquaman.These films all are beautifully filmed. They LOOK amazing. But the battle scenes just go on and on and on.That brings me to Army of the Dead (finally). This one had a lot of character development at the start. That was ok. It got a bit slow in parts of that and kind of droned after a bit, but character development is important. Read any Stephen King book and you can see what I mean. Granted, I think the film had too many non-essential characters as the main hub of the cast, but ok- some are gonna get Zombie Wacked. Every Zombie film needs some Red Shirts in the cast.Once the team got into Vegas- it looked SO COOL. I'm a sucker for 'Destroyed City Visions'. It just looks great, kudos to the set and computer artists, they get a freaking 11 rating here. But once things start rolling with the Zombies, it just gets so tedious. I'm not sure if 'put a lot of super gory stuff in there to keep people's attention' was a mantra for the crew or not, but 'SGS' does not make up for pacing, and good story telling. Remember- people that're watching this have likely watched The Walking Dead and the George Romero films- Maybe not as maybe this is targeted to younger people that haven't seen those. Both of those also could get mired down with 'just killin' zombies', too, so...Who else sang the very beginning of 'The Lion King' when the Zombie King was by the pool about 2/3 of the way into the film? Anyone? I totally did. (Trying not to add spoilers here). You can use that, it'll help keep your family awake during this.As far as the cast, many of them I'd not seen before. They did better than I expected. Safe Cracker Guy actually came off better than I expected and Female Tom Cruise Helicopter Pilot (when viewed through that lens) also did. Why is there always the 'The Well-Toned Latina-Looking Chick with the Headband and a Machine Gun (TM)' character? Really? (See Jeanette Goldstein from Aliens). I felt this character was a direct 'borrow' from that film, headband and all. If you think about 'Ahole Cop Guy', he really wasn't needed at all. He added nothing to the story other than 'wow, I really hate this guy' - but as for the story itself? He was unnecessary. Same with Youtube Zombie Shooter guy. Brought nothing to this.I think this film had definite possibilities. Otherwise, I wouldn't have watched it. While I stayed awake, my attention did wander to deshedding my cat during what were supposed to be the climax of the film. It could've been a much better film had it been edited down.",Army of the Dead

Cool deaths, cool zombies. 0 logic. 0 plot. 0 character.I mean what kind of logic is there when you run off like people always do. A nuke is about to be dropped in 20 minutes, you run on foot, not knowing that the place will be CONVENIENTLY empty, to save someone. And then what??? What was the plan there? Run by foot, or run back on foot, to the chopper??? They literally get away by seconds. So what was the plan? I will save this one person who was dumb enough to do something like this in the first place and then die next to that person in the nuke. That will show dedication!At least at the end I expected them to kill the rich guy, but nah. Sad waste of money and potential. But then again it's a Netflix thing. So, mediocre garbage. Made to sell to the rich people that own Netflix and then run off. If you ever see a movie sold out like this to a big company, or if you see games given to Epic store exclusive, you know it's garbage and they don't care. They made the money and that's that.Oh yea, the zombie boss has a small piece of metal on his head so instead of using their (what seems to be explosive rounds, hollowpoint +++) guns to destroy or explode his body in half, or at least weaken it, they shoot conveniently into the mask. Also. One bullet from those super accurate shooters, in close range, should hit the eyes. But nah. Nope. I get shot in the eyes wearing super heavy armor in video games a lot, but not this guy, this guy has armor that invisibly protects the eyes.Really. Pathetic. No redeeming quality.",Army of the Dead

A flashy, good looking film trying to distract from the lack of a good plot, dialogue or character development.The cast involved could have made this much better if they were given anything to work with. The actors try, but ultimately they are hindered by the stereotypes that they were conceived with.Also, editing is another Snyder problem.

1058,odead82,Turn your brain off and enjoy the ride!,10,22 May 2021,"Watch the trailer if your unsure... It gives you no misconceptions of what this film is. It straight to the point, zombie ass kicking at it's best. I have been an avid Zombie fan since I was a young boy, (1987 I saw night of the living dead) I've seen all the good, the meh, the bad, and the what the fu#! Did I just watch, films that are available. George Romero was my god and this is not his type of zombie film, but you see ideas he dabbled with plenty. Nor is this the walking dead and that's a great thing. The walking dead seems to be what everyone sets its standards to these days and that's sad. There are so few zombie films released that are even worth 10 minutes of viewing these days. Army of the Dead felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Snyder knows how to build a world and put together a great story even when that story has been done countless times in the past. There is a method behind his madness, purpose behind everything he shoots. I'm so happy this was released on Netflix and not with some big Hollywood studio interfering left and right. With a 2.5 hour run time it didn't feel that way, it's starts with a bang and just continues full force. Don't believe the negative reviews, if you took the time to watch this and love zombie/sci-fi action horror this is the film to watch. The trailer let's you know what kind of film this is gonna be and maybe it's not for everyone but it's a damn good time if you strap in for the ride. Let's face it, Resident evil made 6 films with no cohesive story after part 3 and people still flocked to theaters to watch them. Zombies are popular these days and TWD is probably to thank for that but not everything needs to follow that script because honestly that sh#% got boring years ago.

1065,simonebeg,Army of the Plotholes,3,27 May 2021,"I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and series. I don't care if they're serious or comedic or both, as long as the characters are engaging, whatever happens is logical within the established universe and the action is fun. This movie didn't give me any of that. I like anything from Walking Dead to Z-Nation, from Zombieland to Train to Busan, from 28 Days later to Warm Bodies... yes... WARM BODIES!Army of the Dead was awful. It was way too long, had awful pacing and characters I just didn't care about. I am seriously upset I can never get those 2.5 hrs of my life back. After watching some high profile yt reviews and read some high rating reviews here on this, it is pretty evident to me some serious ad money on this project was dropped and early viewing access must have been connected to a pretty restrictive contract. There's no other explanation for known cynical reviews to be so flattering about this.Besides being just an endless list of massive plot holes i didn't really connect to any of the characters - despite being a huge fan of many of the cast, mind - i didn't care for any of their supposed emotional conflicts cause they all just served like cheap plot devices and the only fun action time I got from it happened within the last half hour, just by that time I was already half asleep. All I kept thinking during that movie was of how sorry I felt for Dave Bautista, cause he can actually act and he deserves much better scripts.Anyway,here's a list of the worst plot holes imo:////////////SPOILERS////////////////How is a massive elite troupe high security army convoy brought down by one measly car that accidentally crashes with them?Why do the elite soldiers of that high security convoy not know how to follow orders?How is it the army and its secret service have no apparent interest in being active in and having prime authority in a containment zone of one of their secret projects?Why do you put up a refugee camp right adjacent to the containment zone when there's so much free empty space around it?Why doesn't Tanaka just give them the code to HIS safe?How do they plan to transport literal tons (as in multiple table high stacks of bills) in one helicopter along with an entire team?Is the only barrier between zombie zone and quarantine zone/the outside really just one shipment container door? Btw. Fun side fact, we never see them closing that door behind them after entering the contaminated zone.A team member is fighting for her life and attacked literally three steps from you, all of you have guns, nobody bothers to at least give some of the attacking zombies head shots... like at least out of courtesy for your dying team mate.If the actual plan was just to get a sample of one of the alpha zombies... why would you not just hire a team to get that? Seemed easy enough as a side mission for TWO PEOPLE. The entire heist team is literally shown to be superfluous in that scene. Suspicious dude and blonde lady could have just stepped through the container door, lured zombie queen and everyone could have gone home???Connected to that WHY DOES suspicious guy go back to the casino with the zombie queen's head in the bag? Why doesn't he just turn and go back through to the refugee camp the exact way he came as his actual mission is done and it never was about the money to begin with? It makes zero sense. Well, for the director it does, cause he needs the queen's head to be in the casino as a plot device in the conflict with the male alpha zombie.If zombies are attracted by body heat, how would they not directly attack you rather than one microwaved hand, also why don't they just toss a zombie onto the floor sensor... ah well... that scene I'm giving a pass, because despite being utter nonsense at least it was hilariousHow do you quickly find three people in a high rise building without having any clue which floor they might be on?Why do the alphas only turn one victim at a time while letting the others wait their turn in a hotel room? They also turn the mean camp dude right away while the three females they caught much earlier are kept for later. I mean of course it's so the main characters gets enough time to save them, but that's literally just dumb sh that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.How does a zombie who needs to make his way down an entire highrise building, mount a horse, get back up another entire highrise building catch up with a helicopter which travels the same way directly via air?Btw. Where is the initial bulky broad shouldered zombie from the military convoy that started everything? Why do I suddenly have to accept run down death metal alcoholic dad bod trailer park dude and his exotic dancer gf as the alphas?Also, robot zombies, never explained... not even hinted at... just shown matter of factly in the final stretch of the movie without further explanation... and no... if this has a sequel I'm not going to watch it. I'm done with this.Where did indian lady vanish to after the heli crash? We don't even get to see her death or the corpse. That's of course a rhetorical question as she existed in the first place only as a plot device to make it possible to write that annoying daughter character into the plot.The second laugh in this movie for me btw. That falls a bit under the table for many i guess, that they legit nuked the refugee camp that is directly adjacent to Vegas along with the city. So maybe it's good Indian lady vanished cause her children got evaporated in the nuke explosion most likely anyway. At least a few hours earlier before the mission started it didn't look like they were going to evacuate any time soon. Well...How does black dude who survives the nuclear blast in the safe not die of fallout before even the bite gets to him?The most permissible plot hole is the difference in time it takes people to turn. While the main character turns pretty quickly after the heli crash right after getting bit, black dude has time to survive the nuke, make his way out, get a car, go to an airport, rent a plane etc before even developing first symptoms. But that is a pretty common inconsistency in all zombie movies, so, forgiven...",Army of the Dead

1075,sachin-73003,DEAD DEAD DEAD!,4,19 June 2021,"Army Of The Dead, the newest film from Zack Snyder is a zombie-hiest-thriller-action movie. But Its got big Twists to it!It doesn't have the horror or tension of the zombie genre, cleverness and smartness of a heist film, the action gets old pretty quickly, the characters aren't funny, witty or likeable! So what does it offer??Absolutely Nothing!This time there's no one to blame but Snyder, as the guy wrote, directed and was the director of photography as well. Which becomes apparent as the terrible dialogue, boring , redundant, contrived story, gaping plotholes, awful camerawork plague the whole film and never let you enjoy anything.The moments that are supposed to be shocking turn out to be unintentionally funny and you see them coming from a long distance. There is no tension or enjoyment in most of the action scenes as everyone is inexplicably amazing at getting headshots but inevitably miss when the plot needs it to happen.The plot starts out dumb and rushed and keeps getting worse and worse, ripping off from obvious films (ALIENS) but tinkered enough to be different to be called an original concept. I guess Zack wanted to feel what Whedon must have felt during the Justice League fiasco!The actors do their part, the humor is a hit and miss, the characters are once again either mildly interesting or wafer thin like his previous films and they make weird, out of order, awful decisons which make you cringe and laugh at them at the same time. The pacing is awfully slow, for a simple plot that should be over within ninety odd minutes the film slogs for a good two and a half hours. Somebody needs to tell Snyder to get a friend with good film making sensibilities, who might advise him to try hiring a capable film editor.Zack Snyder gave us Dawn Of The Dead,Watchmen and showed potential with Man of Steel but it's getting clearer that the guy is obsessed with himself
and his so called vision, making constant misses instead of hits and severely compromising his stories which always boast a great concept and potential but fail to live up to their promise. The Snyder Cut made it clear that his fans are going to like whatever he does, be this mess of a film or Justice League.The Zack Snyder who made Dawn Of The Dead is clearly gone and now we have a self indulgent, self obsessed director who couldn't care less about any constructive criticism of his films.

Also the run time was excessive they can cut 30 minutes.,Army of the Dead

He only cares about flashy images and big explosions. Army of the dead has nothing but plot-holes and scenes that are literally lifted from older and better movies. Its a retread of a genre that has been beaten like a dead horse. I don't even want to spoil the films for people that haven't seen the film yet because I don't wish for them to lose their faith in humanity, knowing that this man gets millions of dollars to come up with half-baked material that only could come from the brain of a 12 year old boy on a sugar rush.

It has also been a long time since a movie made me laugh out loud spontaneously (that vault scene killed me). Like I said in the title, it has a lot of references to 80s action and horror movies. Like the movies in those days, it's self-aware. It knows exactly what it is and it doesn't try to be anything else. It's a plain and simple badass action/horror movie. I really don't understand the bad reviews. It's a Netflix movie, not a blockbuster with a 200 million budget. It follows the same premise of other action/horror movies I love, like Predator (or have you forgotten that cool but cringy opening scene with Weathers and Arnold?). I really loved how the Director mixed several genres, the references to Greek mythology, the reference to the great Joseph Campbell, and of course, the reference to several of my favorite 80s movies. The use of the vintage lenses with such narrow aperture was also pretty cool, because not only it made the movie more claustrophobic, it also gave it a unique style. Also, if you're looking into an explanation for the alpha zombies, you might want to check out carefully the opening scene when the trucks are leaving Area 51. The answer is there.",Army of the Dead

The writing was embarrassing and insulting to our intelligence, the acting was even worse from almost every actor, and the casting was so politically correct and factually incorrect that I almost shut it off immediately after realizing that this too, a zombie blockbuster for morons, has become political. You can't say it's typical of zombie movies not to be good or interesting or Oscar worthy, because 28 Days Later and The Crazies gave us all that and more. They are some of the best movies ever made, with or without a zombie horde.

I absolutely love zombie movies, but this one is just not very good, and it surprises me considering Zack Snyder has done some great movies over the years, and one would think he has experience with the zombie genre considering he directed Dawn of the Dead back in 2004.This movie often has schizophrenia, one can't tell if it's supposed to be a comedy, a drama or an action movie, it has a bit of everything but falls flat on all of them. You could remove half the scenes and it will still be the same movie, that's how inconsequential most of it feels. Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining movie, a little bit too long, but worth a watch if you have nothing better to do. It has a very predictable plot and tries to convey interesting ideas that are never really developed on a meaningful way. It's slow where it doesn't matter and way too fast where you don't expect it to be.I think it says a lot that my favorite scene on the whole movie is the one where the first character that dies goes on a beautiful rampage and shows more resilience and skill than all other characters combined, won't say further to avoid spoilers.",Army of the Dead

The 2nd to last shoulder had his jaw ripped off but was never bitten. So he couldn't of been infected and became a zombie.3. A bit seems to take only a few seconds to effect the person yet in the ending the guy was able to yell for others in the field walking away from a nuclear explosion with high levels of radiation that certainly should have killed him. That could of slowed down the effect of that bite but not likely.4. If they really only wanted the blood of a alpha then why send multiple teams in before they got to the safe. Why leave the map on the table in the casino considering they probably needed it when at the vault.5. How did the guy survive the nuke and make it out of the safe? Why wouldn't the alpha zombie just open the safe after it was closed considering it wasn't locked. And if it was then how did that guy get out?6.

1135,thewoodmeister,A zombie tiger? Go on then...,7,23 May 2021,"I'm a zombie film fan... I went though a phase early on in lockdown searching out what offerings were out there that I might have missed. ""Night eats the world"" was probably my favourite from that period. My all time favourite has to be the original ""Dawn of the dead"". The remake.... not so much. For me zombies need to be slow and shuffling, the slow threat that you can easily dismiss as not being a problem until you're surrounded!So I wasn't sure what I was going to make of this film having watched the trailer, but I gave it the 2 and a half hours of my life that it needed. So what are my thoughts? Firstly the positives...I found myself actually warming to the idea of different types of zombie all occupying the same space, with a hierarchy and different levels of ability and intelligence. It reminded me very much of ""I am Legend"" in that fact. I liked that fact that the head ""honcho"" zombie had a head plate to protect his bonce. Could have shot him in the eyes though? Hmm no?Great action and gore... I particularly liked the zombie tiger attack... I think someone had been watching ""The Revenant"" recently. I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Dave Bautista post Drax, he's a credible action star in his own right and carries the film and its ensemble cast.I had no issue with the plot, it's a zombie film I'm not too fussed about plot and character development, however as we move onto the bits I could have done without, the attempts to shoehorn character moments in there, in particular the father / daughter relationship felt forced and out of place. They also hampered the pace. I could have taken a slimmed down film at something more like under 2 hours long. I'm also not sure that doing a ""Reservoir Dogs"" and pretty much killing everyone off in the end was the right way to go. I could have taken more of the ""Coyote"", one of my favourite characters... maybe she survived?? Then again maybe not.... I guess the nuke got her... or the radiation... shame.Anyway a solid 7 out of 10 from me for originality, yes this film takes many elements of other zombie films and throws them into a blender, but overall I felt like I'd been transported into a credible new zombie world that I was happy to spend the 2 and a half hours in. The opening credits and Richard Cheese version of ""Viva Las Vegas"" has got to be worth more than the 1/2 stars that some people are mustering. Echoes of ""Zombieland"" for sure, but that's not a bad film to be ""borrowing"" from. I look forward to where this narrative takes us.",Army of the Dead

1138,vango_al,Is there a limit on how dumb a movie can be?,2,12 June 2021,I have seen my fair shair of stupid movies with stupid characters and a plot that does not make sense. But oh boy this one must be close to the top. 2 and a half hours of my life i will never get back.,Army of the Dead
1139,simianfriday,The premise was promising - but the movie did not deliver.,2,4 October 2021,"The best thing I can say is that this movie starts off with a decent premise for a zombie action flick. Long story short, Vegas is the center of a zombie outbreak and the entire city has been overrun and quarantined. Scott (Bautista) has been hired by Bly (Sadana) to assemble a team to infiltrate Bly's own Vegas casino, crack into the vault, and make it out with all the cash before the government drops a nuke on the city in a few days. Bly wants Scott to do this because according to Bly, all the money is insured and already paid out by the insurance company as it is considered non-recoverable (and is about to be nuked anyway) - meaning whatever money they get out of there is free and clear, untraceable cash.Sounds like a decent bit of fun for a zombie flick, right?Well, it's not.The movie is full of things that just make no sense at all.First off... they've been hired by Bly to break into his own casino and yet, for some reason, they need a safe cracker to get into the vault. Tell me, why would they need someone to crack a combination vault when *the owner* is the one sending them on this mission? He should have had the combination to simply give to them.Furthermore, the vault is guarded with Indiana Jones-esque booby traps that fire darts, shoot machine guns, and have crushing blocks (no, I'm not making any of this up) - and this is *AFTER* you swipe in with a key card and get through the first two locked gates. Why on earth would any vault be designed that way? On top of that, all of these boobytraps are set off in the same way - a pressure plate on the floor triggers them. So for 10 minutes we watch the would-be heroes try to figure out how to trigger the boobytraps without dying - so they repeatedly get zombies to walk over the pressure plates in order to trigger the traps. They're *literally* just pressure plates. All they had to do was roll something down the hallway and it would set off each of the traps - there was no need to coerce zombies to walk down the hallway at all. The entire scene was ridiculous.One more completely nonsensical issue is near the end of the movie. Scott (Bautista) is on the roof of the Bly casino getting ready to jump in a helicopter and fly across town to the Olympus casino because his daughter ran off to go save her friend that's being held captive by the zombies over there (don't ask, it doesn't make sense). While he's up on that roof the big bad king zombie (who wears a bulletproof mask so you can't headshot him) is *also* up on the same roof. There's a bit of a fight there - not worth detailing to make the point - and Scott escapes in the helicopter and flies over to the Olympus to get his daughter before the nuke drops, leaving the zombie king on the roof of the Bly. Somehow the king zombie manages to get off the roof of the Bly casino, onto his zombie horse (because of course he has a zombie horse) and rides it all the way across town back to the Olympus - and he gets there *BEFORE* Scott is able to get there by helicopter. And to make this even more ridiculous - the moment Scott leaves the Bly we are told there is only 9 minutes before the nuke hits - somehow the zombie king not only gets to the ground floor of the Bly, hops on his horse, rides across town, and gets to upper floors of the Olympus before Scott does - but he manages to do it all in well under 9 minutes because there's time for a long drawn out fight after Scott gets there.This entire movie is full of ridiculous things like this that make precisely zero sense.The only way I can see anyone actually enjoying this garbage is if they themselves are a zombie - because you'd have to be mindless to think this is a good movie.Also, Zack Snyder is a terrible director and needs to stop stuffing random licensed garbage music into his movies without any purpose for it. It's like he just thinks ""oh I like this song let's put it in here somewhere no I don't care where, just shove it in anywhere."" He has no idea what he's doing and that anyone bankrolls this guy is crazy to me.",Army of the Dead

Anybody who can ignore how bad the story is, I can only imagine regularly drools on themselves.The plot starts well. Military secret causes Vegas zombie outbreak. Cue zombie Elvis, zombie Siegfried and Roy tigers. Awesome!...right?Sadly, nope!The villain of the piece. Is visible from space...to Stevie Wonder, right from the get go, (and in case you didn't spot him. He conveniently, and totally needlessly feeds a crew member to the dead, to let us, the viewing morons, know he's a bad dude) and this villain's ""plan"" and reasoning, are so poorly thought out and outright dumb. You have to question whether, perhaps Snyder let his 9 year old nephew have a crack at writing?Had said villain, just allowed everyone to get what they wanted/signed up for, and let things just pan out, everyone could have escaped a winner, including the villains. (Who could have later disposed of witnesses, if necessary).Possible spoiler ahead, but not really...But no, in order to shoehorn in a double cross (because every movie is 'more cleverer' due to a double cross, duh!), the writers made everybody in this, dumber than a brain damaged hamster. Not to mention all the other stupid plot holes, (some of which are the biggest in cinematic history, no joke) and all the nonsensical decisions the characters make.I've also never been a fan of what I like to call ""dance hall zombies"". By which I mean fast, agile, rhythmic, Z's, who are clearly played by dancers and acrobats, jigging and writhing around, as if they are auditioning for a Madonna music video.Running...fine. But this BS bouncing, jumping, scurrying nonsense. Nope, I'm out.Negatives aside. Bautista is his usual likeable self. Ella Purnell is great (though her character stinks). In fact everyone puts in a decent effort, even in spite of the frequently diabolical script.And if you can totally switch off your brain for the unusually long running time, it is kinda fun. In a dumb, OTT, gory, zombie killing way.And there is also a nice drinking game hidden in this movie...take a shot every time you see a line or scene stolen from another movie (particularly ""Aliens""). You'll be hammered by the half way point.But wow...WOW, that plot. It's so stupid. You'll need an almost zen-like ability to silence your capabilities of sense and reason, for any chance at fully enjoying this. Or you need to be a clinical imbecile. Either might work?Sadly another fail from Netflix. I won't watch again, unless I'm having trouble getting drunk!",Army of the Dead

1149,nexusbrivers,Wow... just wow.,1,1 November 2021,"So the premise of the movie is people motivated by money go into a zombified Vegas and ... dies.Oh not to mention, the crying daughter gets sympathy when she got three people killed. If she didn't stray off to rescue a woman who ended up dying anyways, the helicopter could have flown off the safety...or maybe, not go at all?I am just confused by what the point of the movie was. There were no winners because even the guy that got out didn't survive. And how the heck did he stay alive so long without turning into a zombie? How did he escape and nuked zone without dying or radiation poisoning? HOW DID HE GET OUT OF A LOCKED SAFE!?! Out of every one, not even the leader lived, but a random character?And what's up with the zombie robots?! Who made them????? Did zombie scientists make them?How did a zombie get pregnant? And how did she know? Did she miss a zombie cycle and took a pregnancy test?So the first character that died in the hibernating zombie scene... when she was getting eaten and was talking to the guy before being blown up, WHY DIDN'T SHE SCREAM ""THAT GUY SET ME UP AND HE'S GOING TO SCREW EVERYONE""? And couldn't he shoot the few zombies who had her? After all, he's an expert shooter that blasted hundreds at the end of the movie...If the guy in the safe lived.... Then why didn't everyone get in the safe? I mean, zombies couldn't get them unless King Zombie was also a master safe breaker... they could have all lived, had the money, survive the blast, and the blonde woman could have revealed everything there - ""yeah, dude just wanted Queenie's head and didn't want the money."" So Yey! Everyone gets money! Then they could stroll out easily because all the zombies would be dead! Except the zombie cockroaches maybe. Hey! A plot for a new movie ...This was horrible with a horrible ending.A girl got everyone killed rescuing someone who died anyways, and the guy who won the money, died anyways after he turned into a zombie.The way it ended, you would have thought that there would be a sequel!

1155,CMTempest,Romero would be proud,7,18 May 2021,"As a giant fan of zombie cinema, I'll be the first to admit that most recent genre entries have been terrible. I'd chalk this up to how the focus has shifted away from the more thought provoking themes explored in the classics like Dawn of the Dead (1978), and instead been placed almost entirely on the gore and other superficial ""jump-scare"" type horror elements. That said, I'm happy to report that this streak has now finally been broken, and with entertaining style. Army of the Dead is a good movie. Sure the film has its flaws. Tonally it's all over the place, and it's poorly paced/edited (every scene plays out much too long). There are a plethora of plot wholes and major contrivances (such as the questionable logic surrounding the necessity of the heist itself XD), the concept is much better than the execution, and it squanders a bit too much of its potential to be a truly great movie. However, Zack Snyder's heart is in the right place, and overall Army does deliver the hectic and gory fun that the trailer promises, toying with just enough political/social commentary and broader ideas to satiate most reasonable and patient zombie cinephiles. IMO the film also manages to thread the needle between genres like Romero used to do; working efficiently both as an action vehicle and horror/heist hybrid, and the opening sequence is enough to put a grin on even the most cynical viewer's face, as it's hilariously over-the-top and ludicrous in the most delightful way. Perhaps best of all, however, is the way the movie actually manages to feel like a thematic continuation of Romero's classic original trilogy. In fact, between this and his highly enjoyable, although still far inferior, 2004 remake of Dawn, Snyder is really building a case for himself as arguably the most compelling and qualified successor to the throne of zombie filmmaking (certainly the one most inclined anyway). Sure there isn't that much competition. Who at all aside from Danny Boyle and Edgar Wright? And while admittedly these may be far better filmmakers, they don't seem to share the same passion/devotion that Snyder does for the genre. So Zack may still have a lot too prove, but after experiencing the sheer fun and energy of this film (flaws notwithstanding), I'm definitely excited to see him keep trying!To start, while Army of the Dead boasts many of the hallmarks of the George Romero classics, including fun social commentary, class conflict, and a diverse set of mostly no-name actors and a kick-ass black dude who (SPOILER) outlasts most everyone else, it still boasts a relatively original concept. It even introduces several elements I'd never seen before in the genre, such as the zombie tiger prominent in the marketing. The closest comparison I can think to make is that it in many ways evokes James Cameron's Aliens (in fact, if I'm being totally honest it might borrow a little too much from Aliens). Both are sequels that build upon the original (in this case I'd call 2004's Dawn the original, even if it's perhaps only connected in spirit), but then forge their own paths by broadening the scope and upping the anti. The films also share many similar themes, such as utilitarian government corruption, selfishness and cowardice leading to losses, frequent double-crossing, and constantly shifting power dynamics which converge to elevate premises built around interspecies conflict and survival (oh, and there's even a small moment in the new film's opening that plays with the idea that the zombies may be of alien origin XD). Of course it goes without saying that Aliens pulls this stuff off better on all accounts. Also interesting though, is that rather than falling back on a deadly virus, voodoo, or witchcraft as the explanation for the outbreak, Snyder's film instead keeps the nature of the threat more ambiguous (apart from the aforementioned first scene). This approach to the undead is a good example of the how it provides a refreshingly ambitious spin on the genre. By daring to make the zombies more mysterious, intelligent, organized, and even hierarchical (and not simply slow and mindless), Snyder is able to generate an ominous tone around the creatures once it's made clear that they're not just your typical run-of-the-mill zombies. While obviously a gamble, it was a worthwhile one, as it shifts the style and pacing of the film to something more akin to a serious war flick, with higher stakes and somewhat realistic strategizing (such as hostage taking, stealth, negotiation, etc.). Better still, by tackling the genre from this untapped angle, and establishing such an elaborate, ""lived-in"" post-apocalyptic setting, the writers also free themselves up to go in all sorts of new creative directions in the future. This level of promise is what excites me most about the film and any potential follow-ups, and I really hope they capitalize on its (likely) success by continuing to take risks and go all out for future installments. The execution could of course be improved, but I think that if they aim for this than it might just have the potential to become a Bond-esque series, and get remade/reimagined anew every decade. It's high time the Zombie genre was given some new life, and I'll be supporting Snyder so long as he's trying new things.Ultimately, Army clearly stands out as the first action/horror film in awhile which isn't afraid to take some risks and at least aim for originality. Zack Snyder must have some sort of green card in Hollywood also, because the budget feels enormous for a concept so bloated and experimental (which is awesome!). It all mostly comes together and pays off too, resulting in a satisfyingly engaging, frequently surprising, and ever kinetic thrill-ride, filled with an ample amount of fun twists and turns (even if more often than not these are predictable or don't totally make sense). I have little doubt that Army of the Dead will do wonders regardless, and as far as re-popularizing the more serious zombie flick (which we nearly lost due to garbage like The Walking Dead), I have high hopes that it'll come out a winner. So congrats Mr. Snyder! Despite never really being all that impressed by your DC movies, you've certainly earned my fandom with this one, and I'm now eagerly awaiting what other surprises you've got for us. Bring on Army of the Dead Parts 2 & 3!TLDR - Don't miss this one. It's not perfect, but it's easily the most innovative and fun zombie film in ages, and though it doesn't fully live up to its potential, it's still a blast and absolutely deserves its own series. 7.3/10.",Army of the Dead

I feel as if Snyder does better with original stories that dont have too much fanfare or background already (300 and Watchmen).That being said, Army of the Dead is good addition to the original Snyder collection. The story is a fresh take on the zombie apocolypse that keeps you interested all the way through. The characters do very well in this and the emotion is definitely there too. Im also happy we get to see a more serious Dave Bautista because he really carries the film.To keep it short and sweet, this film was entertaining from start to finish and the ending was a bit of fun as well.

1175,siriusly1986,Another Dumb Zombie Flick,4,21 May 2021,"The intro segment of having paratroopers dropped on a zombie infested city with a hacky Elvis karaoke music playing in the background was a dead giveaway. Yes we get its Las Vegas. I was always a Snyder fan though his movies are centered around pop-culture subjects - comic books and superheroes - he always made the deep stories out of them. This movie is not. This is a mix of Zombieland, those terrible Resident Evil movies and many more cliche action-packed zombie movies that present themselves as ""cool"" and ""awesome"" that's aimed for young audiences that just wants to be entertained by flashy effects, gore and loud explosions - good story sacrificed.There's also hints of political satire here as well which they manage to inject like immigration. People quarantined in cages who are detained to avoid another zombie outbreak. Strong feminist characters that come off more like women playing a male role lecturing to a character she shot because he sexually abused women by translating it as a very generalized phrase, ""disrespecting women"" instead of the obvious crime that he committed that he is a r-pist. She is also bothered that one of them used a female zombie head as trophy. Despite all that tripe one thing I liked though was that the zombies here gained somekind of sentience. They ride horses which looked cool and reminded me of dark fantasies from the 80s they used in metal covers. Unfortunately this too isn't really explored or shown much because the running and gunning and yelling scenes has to occupy the movie itself. Honestly this is really looks like a generic zombie action movie with a lot of budget behind it. Most of the characters are unlikable and they look like stereotypes and wannabes.",Army of the Dead

The movie is only about 30% watchable, most of the scenes are blurry, too much close up and there is literally out of focus background. Often times the camera is even shaky. The characters always talks non sense like unimportant stuff, speculations, and trying hard to be funny. Logic is a bit out of touch and they even try to make small stuff overly dramatic when it's not.

But maybe it says more about James Gunn writing DotD rather than Snyders directing.I thought it was an awesome concept to start with, the brutality was great but it was let down by 'Alpha Zombies' and the fact they 'think' and have a hierarchy. Zombies done right shouldn't have to rely on them being smart for the scare factor, just flesh eating and fast like in 28 days later.Obviously zombies aren't real, but I thought it overstretched the imagination too far to the point you don't put yourself in these peoples shoes and you don't feel any suspense or fear. Visually it's a great film, but they should have kept it simple. With the subtraction of the 'alpha zombies', and a few more tense moments where you care for the characters or put yourself in their shoes, I think it would have hit the spot and whet people's appetite for this film more.Worth a watch but I'm glad I watched it on Netflix and not paid to see it in the cinema.",Army of the Dead

1187,dpincgk-04079,I wish I could give it a higher rating,3,26 May 2021,"Especially after watching the ""making of"" documentary on Netflix I am even more impressed with the technical aspect of this movie. There was obviously so much thought and energy poured into the filming process, the effects, the makeup, and post production, the crew. Super impressed by that. From that aspect of movie production I would say this movie is on the very cutting edge. I would also say Bautista was excellent in his part, and the actors did a good job given the script and writing, and production.The sound design for the alpha zombies went a little over the top for me with it sounding a little more like the layered animal sound effects from ""Jurassic Park"" than anything alt-human/dead. Trills, rasps, clicks, deep vocalizations and wheezes all on top of each other. High and low. Monster sounds. Wow. Too impossible, fake, unconvincing for me. Just because you become an alpha zombie doesn't mean the size of your vocal tract suddenly becomes 40 times as large or you grow extra tissue in your windpipe or extra sets of teeth, or that you suddenly can gurgle long and deep like a Lucasfilm creature.The photography was also unique with respect to the lenses, and focus and artifacts but I actually found the movie really not easy to watch. That said, I see what the director is trying to do here and give credit.The biggest issue I have with this production is the story. I didn't care about any of the characters, dialogue and action between them seemed artificial, the way certain events the actors carried out was not convincing, characters were easily killed off and it just didn't matter to me. Additionally the zombie heist idea has already been covered in a couple different films, most recently ""Peninsula"" (to a more interesting degree I might add). I found myself leaving the movie to do other things, and I am sorry to say that's the first time that's ever happened to me with any zombie movie especially one where it is obvious so much money, effort and love has been poured into.If there's a sequel to this movie, I hope that sequel can rescue it. It's a good technical execution of set, and special effects. At the end of the day the movie is probably worth a watch for very surface level entertainment but I am not going to watch it again. Which is sad, because I really liked ""Dawn of the Dead"".",Army of the Dead

This character thinks that the value of 1 person's life is much more than the value of everyone else's lives combined.Ironically this Character ends up being the sole survivor of the Movie.Cliche No:2 - There will always be a sociopath who is separately employed by the boss to be along with the team, Now this person will be Told to bolster the team to complete the mission smoothly but he will be secretly given an evil agenda to be fulfilled for the boss. This guy will be so evil that he will purposely let 1 or 2 people on the team die because they questioned him at some point in the movie and hurt his ego.Cliche No:3 - There will always be people who when comes close to death will decide to play the sacrificing act, even if this person has a window of opportunity to escape along with the others will not take it, they just will decide to be the bigger person for no reason and others will also happily watch this person sacrifice his/her live with emotion in their eyes.Cliche No:4 - The last scene of the movie will always make room for a few sequels to release a few years down the road.Apart from these cliches, the movie does have its moments ..

There are quite a few Easter egg 'homages' to zombie shows you may recognize as well. The cast has great chemistry and work together well. The main monster villain is pretty awesome imo; very imposing, athletic and at one point I found myself feeling more sympathetic to the zombies than the humans or at the very least empathizing with some of them.If you're looking for a great plot line however, lets not forget it IS a zombie film. There are some dumb mistakes in the film. The secret door in the wall to the walled city of zombies barred only with a board that has more holes in it than Swiss cheese. Then when they enter into the quarantined zombie city they leave said door open (really?).However, all the group of people I was with enjoyed the film and it had repeatability.

And not in an homage sort of way, but in a ""paint-by-numbers because I have zero original ideas of my own"" sort of way.I don't know why Synder decided to DP this thing. He isn't any good at it. Super shallow depth of field that he can't keep in focus, rack focuses so jarring they pull you out of the scene, Out of focus shots that never resolve, out of focus vignetting, garbage lens selection, lens flares that don't look as cool as he might think, bad lighting, bad green screen, and so on.The CGI tiger were video-game realistic, not film realistic. The zombie makeup was overdone.The script must have been written in a single sitting, because there was clearly no care put into it. People don't talk or interact believably. There's exposition that's not even needed. The villains are cardboard cutout, mustache-twirling caricatures. It's a train wreck.The music selection is garbage. If he had used original songs, I'd still say that the soundtrack is a tired collection of songs from a thousand other movies. But, again, with no original ideas, it makes sense. However, in this case he used mostly covers of these overused overfamiliar tunes. But the covers suck.

Oh she died who cares the important thing is everyone else died.5.- Shooting gas cans not only makes them explode they take some time to explode for dramatic purposes.6.- The best thing for facing a zombie army attracted by loud noises is not to use suppressor in your weaponry.7.- You don't just ask the owner of the vault for the combination but instead rely on a guy to crack the state of the art casino vault with ear techniques like is the 1800s.8.- Safes can and will be opened from the inside by somebody who doesn't know anything about them.9.- If a bomb drops on a city you can emerge from a basement in the middle of the blast zone and just walk away with nothing obstructing the stairs.10.- Nuclear fallout is not a real thing.11.- If you are about to die because someone who just betrayed you who is in hearing shot distance amongst the group of friends that he will most likely later also betray you don't call him out on what he just did, that's rude and snitches get stiches.12.- Is easier to cut trough a wall of concrete with a saw than a metal lock.13.- Trained army personal have to listen to an order at least 3 times before considering following it.14.- Trained army personal have to go on foot on the desert after being ambushed instead of driving the car they are sited on.15.- The apocalypse will be started from a whore giving head in las Vegas. (get it?)16.- If you want to get a zombie the best plan is to wait for years and then at the last minute send a mercenary group on a wild goose chase just so the leader convince his daughter to easily sneak them inside the quarantine zone while just being a volunteer on a refugee camp and some French lesbian that gives them exposition everybody should know by now and help them get the head of the queen zombie in 5 minutes near the entry zone.17.- Zombie bites take different time to convert depending on how important you are for the plot.18.- Volunteers in refugee camps will shift between a stupid girl that gets everyone killed without any kind of military training to a headshot machine between cut scenes.Tag Lines

In fact, weeks later is possibly one of the worst zombie movies ever made barring the exceptional first 10 minutes of the film. For somebody to laud weeks later so highly, a 9/10 mind you, one point from the perfect score, only to then give this equally dumb movie a 1/10, serves to prove absolutely nothing but the bias people have against a certain director. The director in question being Z. S.I'm in no way trying to say that this movie is great, but what I would like to do is just call out some of the blatantly spiteful bias reviews being submitted here, (some likely by the same few angry people under different accounts) for what they are. You don't like Snyder. That doesn't make his films any worse than the other dumb movies out there.9/10 for 28 weeks later is just absolutely insulting lmao. You guys oughta get outside. This movie is exactly what we needed after last year and is perfectly dumb, stupid fun. Which is more than I can say for 28 weeks later, which is dumb for sure, but without an ounce of fun in the mix.If you're giving 9/10 to that movie, you shouldn't be judging movies at all.",Army of the Dead

1232,magriffin-55369,Up and down movie prior to reading reviews!,3,23 May 2021,"First off the silly people on here that say this movie is so unrealistic are just bafoons.....why because it's a zombie movie your supposed to watch this for pure entertainment.....secondly this movie has comical parts that made me chuckle with action and gore so it does have that.....lastly this movie had some good characters you liked and I mean a very few you liked.....now that's the 3 stars it gets from me but the rest was bad.... I was excited to watch this movie all the way up till I hit play....the beginning of the movie was ok but I could not get past the fact that the soldier that is supposed to be driving the lead the vehicle is not even acting like he's driving...I had to see if he had the steering wheel in front of him he was bad....he doesn't even notice the bright light getting closer as ten seconds past which set off the chain of events in this movie....ok I continued watching just ignoring that then the action started cool right? Wrong this is when the daughter Kate is introduced after 15 mins of gore and action of the main team.... I hated her from the time she was shown until the end she's annoying, irritating, and down right stupid you were rooting for her to be killed...the only characters I thought was cool was the black dude, Batista, head zombie, safe cracker and the zombie gangster and his girlfriend.....the helicopter pilot I thought she was ok and a little comical....everyone else I could careless for if they lived or died....the stupid daughter Kate just messed everything up to include putting some lady's life over everyone else's you just wish she would die as she seemed like she was scared of nothing....getting 15 million would not push anyone to go into a zombie land....so the stakes were low which also contributed to many not connecting with any of the characters....the ending is so irritating because Kate lives and is unscathed while everyone else dies and I ignored the helicopter flying because it's an action movie right but everyone dies minus the worst character in the movie which makes zero sense.....it didn't make anything better that she had a pear shape with some ugly clothes on and her acting was super bad....she would have made a great golfer (which requires goofy pants and a fatass) she had a huge ass! The movie was mediocre at best and most of the characters are unrelatable and detached. I really wanted to like this one but these things I have pointed out was throughout the movie.",Army of the Dead
1233,metalgear-25259,Is It A Spoof?,6,21 October 2021,"Army Of The Dead (2021) directed by Zack Snyder seems to relish itself on screenplay that amounts to deliberate, deadpan, cringe. It's so bad and seemingly intentionally bad, that you wonder if Zack Snyder is actually spoofing these types of films in a subtle and dark way.There's a nod to Aliens with a Vasquez lookalike. She ridiculously takes on a horde of zombies that surround her whle wearing the symbolic red bandanna. She even carries over her suspicious, untrusting persona of anyone that is obviously untrustworthy to the viewer.There's the young daughter who can fire a handgun that lands perfect long range head shots everytime! A zombie tiger that only kills the really bad person in the most horrific way and leaves everyone else alone! There's the helicopter pilot who disappears momentarily towards the end after being told not to let them down. There's even a moment where the pilot asks why they have to go back with 9mins left before the nuke? To which the reply is they got to go back to rescue the daughter. The pilot then reacts with a damn, OK, OK just make sure you find her. It's total, crocodile cheese. It's why I believe this film is not meant to be taken as seriously as it is.If you look hard enough you can see the varying levels of dark humoured, spoofing from other films. Scott gives a (we have made it) nod to his daughter in one scene just before they take the money from the safe. Scott also talks of what food outlet he's going to run with the 15 million he'll hopefully have. It's subtle spoofing and quite amusing looking at the film from the right angle.The trouble is Zack Snyder made a grounded, absorbing zombie movie in the Dawn Of The Dead remake, so expectations are much of the same.I believe Army Of The Dead is something that is coming from a more humoured angle. It works on a Spoof, deadpan level but doesn't work as an immersive, tension builder like the Dawn Of The Dead did. So your expectations will be jolted. The more cringey or cheesy you find the premise, scene or idea in this film, the more Zack is laughing.",Army of the Dead

1243,shadowwalkerrock,Best of 2021 besides JL-Snyder Cut,6,22 May 2021,"If this was a big shot company production I would give it 5/10 ;but being a Netflix production I feel it deserves an extra star for effort, maybe even 2 extra stars as the FX both digital and practical were executed perfectly, far superior to any offering from WB and the likes currently.Is the story/plot a little predictable and a bit of a genre mashup? Definitely ;but I'd say does so with a Snyder twist and really raises the bar compared to other current offerings.Does it band together the usual group of misfits with questionable loyalty and motives? Definitely ;but I think the character arcs end up being a surprise as far as what you think will play out early on.Is it better or worse than Snyder's first movie in the Dead universe? While the visual FX, level of gore and intensity are cranked up to 11 in AOTD I'd say both movies are equally great and worth watching.All in all I'm very impressed with what ZS and Netflix have done, I would rate this my number 2 favorite Netflix movie (2nd to Bright, 3rd would be Mute).In the battle of Snyder versus Warner Bros in 2021 I score it ZS:2 WB:0 (all their latest big budget movies have sucked so bad, I'm taking shots at Mortal Kombat, Godzilla V Kong).",Army of the Dead

It was the trailer that raised expectations so it was disappointing to sit through this bore fest. Everything just felt forced, the characters were incredibly annoying to the point 1 hour in I was hoping that the zombies would kill the team of idiots and be done with it.You'd think it would be fairly straightforward to create a bit of excitement or tension or anything really but it just doesn't happen. It just kind of crawls through the minutes with predictable outcomes to random moments.The only character of any presence is big bad Dave but he almost gets shuffled into the background as if they have used him to gain an audience to sucker people in to watch it.The most disturbing thing of all is how Netflix have managed to make a zombie heist movie into a social commentary, it's more subtle than some but it's there in all its underlying themes.It's a sad tale of the times.",Army of the Dead
1246,ashnasmam,wasted potential of a great concept,5,28 May 2021,"There are only gangs of the dead with a boss.The plot is already revealed on the trailer and gave high hopes coz of the mixture of two different genres zombie and heist. The concept itself is amazing and the alpha zombies which means organized zombies, zombie tiger, robot zombies and etc there were lot and lots of new elements which should have made this movie a greater success.The movie starts off very well and gave the feel of it's going to be and excellent two and half of ride.The character establishment and grouping happened too soon there was no need for deep arc according to the plot.The movie started giving some wtf scenes from the moment they enter the Zombie area. The character were so dumb and forced into the plot to make emotional scenes and that backfired the movie at the end.The music, the concept, the VFX and the extra fun elements all were the positives of the movie.Zack Snyder tried something differently in the camera work which made it feel worse in my opinion.One of the main other problem is run time the movie start to feel drag coz of the dumb characters and the climax in which there was no point in the whole heist.One other thing I felt was action scenes in the movie. There were lot of logical loopholes and expected high intense action but there were no such sceneOverall wasted potential of a great concept.

The actors try their best to give the characters some life, but they stay two dimensional. Everything is spoken out, no deeper levels anywere to be found. 'It's just a zombie movie, relax.'

They don't take hostages. They're a big block of rage and power.I haven't seen any good zombie movie or show where they show any sign of intellect. Resident Evil, Dead Snow, Land of the Dead... It even killed the ending of I am Legend (which was decent until the last 8 minutes).Walking Dead (I'm talking about the first 2 seasons) showed that you can have moral problems, human relations, drama and zombie apocalypse at the same time. So what went wrong?Everything? I like the idea of a heist movie with zombies, but decide the mood please. Is this satirical like Zombieland? Or drama?

Then they're about to make it out before predictable movie endings so you get almost no drama.There's also just huge amounts of the plot that are ignored and never explored. There's a zombie hierarchy that is just there. Never explained. Certain zombie have higher intellect. Never explained. Originally bank heist but needed zombie head. Could've been done early on. Geeta.Overall the zombies look brilliant but the chracters are idiots. The story could've gone for a fresh angle with the zombie hierarchy element.

Second thing noticed is that all the music is way off, and that combined with annoying slow motions in some wrong places really bugged me. Then we have another classic: the characters having lengthy discussions all the time when they should focus on the mission at hand. Please don't talk about your family relationship in a tower filled with bloodthirsty zombies and only minutes before the entire city is nuked. And ofc the worst of them all, the daughter herself.

The pilot and the daughter were the most cringe characters. Although, the daughter of Dave in the movie is beautiful, one of the only nice things about the movie, lol.

He visualices movies as if they were singles static shots and do not understand cinema needs much more than that.Another proof of this is that he casts actors for their looks, but most times they fail to be able to portray their characters.You can swap your brain for a watermelon while watching this movie, you won't find any difference.",Army of the Dead

There are emotional scenes and emotional cores put to many characters (although there are really many filler characters), for example to Kate and Scott, but the zombies themselves got some character arc and emotion, which was interesting but in the end it felt a bit random, because they introduced that, but never relied on that in the end for any twist.All in all, this zombie-film brings three new aspects into the zombie-subgenre: emotion, heist and epicness (in terms of being a 2 and a half hour long movie). The plot itself is a bit underwhelming in terms of what you might expect, but the visual stunning sequences and the emotional aspect make this epic a little better than it would have been, if it was only a zombie-heist-film.",Army of the Dead

1345,ayappareddy,"Terrible acting, weak plot and meh zombies.",1,21 May 2021,"Now. Where do I begin?The story and the plot is weak and lazy. The whole premise of the movie is also incredibly stupid. But those are not the biggest problems with the movie. Personally, for me, that honor goes to the acting. It was really bad. It just kept annoying me. I could not concentrate on the plot, however weak and lazy that plot was.The characters do stupid things but that's to be expected in genres like this. It's just a feature, at this point. A genre cliche, if you will.Combine all of that with the unnecessary extra runtime and extremely weird song choices at wrong places and you will surely wish you were a mindless ""beta"" zombie yourself.Now, about the zombies. I did not care about the ""intelligent"" zombies or the ""valentine"" tiger or whatever. I would have taken the zombies seriously, if the human characters in the movie were any good. But that was not the case. So, when they did die eventually, it all felt meaningless.Zack made a very good movie with the Justice league: Snyder cut.

There was action, an effort at humor, and some fun-filled terror in the process. The film appeared to implode around guaranteeing the presence of strong female leads and cultural awareness. When will Hollywood and studio execs stop cramming all the right people into every film? White males, for example, are nasty, arrogant, and uneducated, whereas women are clever, powerful, and all minorities are unique. Please quit trying to indoctrinate people and instead start writing, performing, and producing movies with all the indoctrination.

It starts out with Richard Cheese's Viva Las Vegas in this epic slow motion entrance after a zombie escapes a military convoy and they start tearing up Vegas.And thats about the last time I really liked this movie. After this, it turns into this giant jumbled mess of storylines/cliches/ and a lack of any coherent storytelling.They needed to pick a subplot, either they are stealing from a vault, or they are rescuing his daughters friend. I'm of the opinion the ""friend"" should've been left dead.There is a lack of cohesive storytelling, a serious lack of it, and its tremendously disappointing because I thought the acting and special effects were incredible. At 2.5 hours though, they 100% could have cut one or two subplots, cleaned up the ending, and really made an incredibly good zombie film featuring Las Vegas.I'm of the opinion that this movie was basically 4 movies blended together into one. And because of this, none of them succeeded.",Army of the Dead

For me it draws inspiration from 'I am legend' with some evolution of how the zombies behaves - watch the both films and check out the behaviours of some zombie characters. Outside of the zombie world, I feel this also draws inspiration from the more recent Planet of the Apes movies.Yes the story is full of weak links and fails, but I also think people are taking to movie too seriously... so disengage your brain, sit back and enjoy.",Army of the Dead

I haven't been a fan of most of Zack Snyders work, but I'll always have a place for his Dawn Of The Dead remake in my heart and I was hoping he would be going back to his roots with this one being another zombie movie. Boy I was wrong. This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I have seen so far this year. It was overlong, boring and so so cringey. Over half the movie is spent introducing the most boring and uninteresting characters I have seen in a film in recent years, they were so hollow and impossible to like. Also the acting was just bad - I couldn't stop rolling my eyes at everyone, the performances seriously were terrible. Honestly. Also the main issue is that it was seriously just so boring, I almost turned it off. Somehow Snyder made the zombies so bland in a film where it had all the set up to be a really fun ride. He added some strange mythology to them which made them really just uninteresting. I mean I don't think it's difficult to make zombies scary or menacing but he really made them the complete opposite in this.Anyway to sum it up - it's bad, it's boring, it's overlong, and it's so cringey.",Army of the Dead

SO MANY plot holes and weird timing and i felt no attachment to ANY of the characters cuz they are all equally dumb..spoiler:

The soundtrack didn't change much throughout.About the story? Well... same old pathetic character in the movie that makes the situation unnecessarily worse by doing what they were told not to do.And a few points in the movie that were just completely ridiculous, you'[ll know what i mean when you watch it!Other than that, some pretty good characters in the movie, Cannot fault acting by Bautista, Reguera, Schweighöfer and Notaro, however due to the movies lazy and illogical writing, you don't really get to know much about them aside from their basic roles.",Army of the Dead

For example, it's impossible for you to go to a zombie land leaving your children untended just to find money.Another disappointing point is nearly every character dies in the last 30 minutes, which makes the movie less suspenseful and lose the opportunity to build up characters of personae through their emotions.The only element I appreciate is Alpha zombies.

Personally I liked all the characters (except for Kate she's an idiot) Tig's character and Coyote were funny and badass. The bromance between Vanderohe and Dieter was wholesome. Mikey was cool, Chambers was hot and SO badass. And I liked Bautista's character too, just a nice big lug that has to kill zombies. Neutral on Maria, she was just kinda there.Martin was actually the WORST. Just such a stupid jagoff. First he hits on Chamber like a creep and then he sends her in the wrong direction into a hoard of zombies and she dies and then he cuts the head off a PREGNANT zombie queen (yes) and the king who's in charge is obviously pissed Bc that's his girl and then ensues a series of deaths one after the other all because of stupid Martin and also stupid Kate and it was all so avoidable. Like SO avoidable.So long story short the zombie town is getting nuked and everyone is dead except for Tig Bautista, idiot Kate, Gita the person went after, and the zombie king all in helicopter as a nuke is going off. Zombie bites Bautista and he eventually shoots the zombie king and kills him, but the nuke blast causes the helicopter to crash and it kills Tig and Gita either died in the crash or was shot accidentally by Bautista idk. So everyone's dead except for her and then Bautista turns into a zombie and she has to kill him. So ALL OF THIS HAPPENED FOR WHY?Cut to the nuclear wasteland, Vanderohe emerged from the nuclear blast resistant safe with bags of money and makes his way to a plane to finally go home and I assumed he was going to give some money to Kate and the other people's families and go Tanaka (the guy that sent them in there in the first place) and what happens?

They gave a man over as a sacrifice and in doing so the alpha zombies just let them go. Why is that even a thing? The zombies should have tried to take all of the humans captive. It's weird that they were content with the one and then let the humans roam freely through their city.2. The daughter was pointless. Everything in her role was there just to add the dynamic that this was a movie about a father trying to win the love of his daughter back. It would have been way more interesting if they focused only on the heist.3. It was way too predictable. You could easily figure out who would die and when they would die. There's only one character that surprised me in their death/survival.4. Seemed slow and then rushed. It never had a good steady pace. It went from nothing happening to everything happening at once.5. A zombie hit shot in the face to reveal it looked like a robot. Why? Why do we need robot zombies? Is zombies not enough?Things I liked:1. I give them credit where credit is due. The idea of a city of zombies and having to pull off a heist was a good idea. In the year 2021 it is hard to think of an original apocalypse idea, so I was excited about that.2. There were a few really intense action scenes. Even though they were highly predictable.3. They had a good dynamic of characters (excluding a few) that made it interesting!

Absolute classic. Sucker punch- convoluted, but I can get behind it.But what the absolute hell is this? The filmmaking subtleties are super overt. For the first half an hour I had no idea what was going on. Every character is the exact same because the development is garbage.The premise is stupid: get money from a vault before they nuke a zombie city. It's like the LOTR eagles thing but dumber: ""we're gonna send you in there with a helicopter pilot, who can fly you out once you're in there...but we can't fly you in"". What!?Which then begs the question: why did these people accept the offer to risk their lives on the premise that they might make money? There would at least be a deposit first, maybe some sort of vetting process. AND if it's (insert millions of dollars here) on the line, then why can't you just pay an abundant amount of people a normal salary to systematically accomplish the goal? I mean, they've already successfully quarantined/partitioned an entire city.Instead your left with a zombies version of the gone in 60 seconds remake mixed with ghosts of Mars. The first act was dumb and irrelevant. The visual effects...rudimentary. The creatures are too human for no reason. The second act is...nothing.

The soundtrack is great! There's some subtle humour here, lost on many reviewers it would seem. It's reasonably fast moving with a bit of gore, a bit of action and a couple of surprises. A lot of money was spent on this film as it was planned for production before corona hit and you can see that. There are some loose ends but if you have half a brain you can fill in the blanks. If you want something entertaining to watch with a few friends and a beer or six, you could do worse. Give it a go and if it's not your thing, try something else.Remember, when you leave a bad review about anything, you're downgrading the hard work that goes into films and businesses ....the years of training that stunt men, lighting engineers, makeup artists etc put themselves through. It seems there's a generation of people out there that find nothing good in the world and diss everything and can't break out of the circle of negativity. Try and look for the positives in life and have a bit of fun (like watching a zombie movie), stop taking everything so seriously. If you look at the negative reviews of this film and check out the reviewer profile, you will notice a lot of them have nothing good to say about any of the films they have watched. Maybe they need to try another genre. Think before you bash some words on a keyboard and click send - maybe you are a zombie?

1395,nincompoopian,"An ""okay"" addition to a genre that has run its course",6,23 May 2021,"""Army of the Dead"" delivers just about what you expect in a zombie movie: wall-to-wall violence, gallows humor, gunplay, and lotsa zombies. In Zack Snyder's new zombie pic (ostensibly his first for several years since his 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead), a motley-crew of highly-skilled pros (led by Dave Bautista) undertakes a million-dollar heist job of a vault in a zombie-infested Las Vegas casino. The undead in this movie are the same as the one in his ""Dawn"" redo, they're fast as hell and literally rotten to boot. One key difference is that in ""Army"" they're also capable of human behavior such as physical combat, dodging bullets, and following the commands of their ""Alpha"" leader, a unique type of zombie who's not only physically imposing but is also a loving spouse to his zombie Queen; one can expect that they will conceive a zombie baby.The heist plot is nothing to write home about; it's not as smart and groundbreaking as the ones in ""The Italian Job"" remake or ""Oceans 11"". If anything, it borrow its plot structure from Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"", which has characters who hatches a plan that is so good to be true that they're bound to fail. There's also a dramatic subplot involving the Dave Bautista character and his estranged daughter, though Snyder only uses that as an occasion to expand the runtime and divert our attention from the undead and to give us some breathing room from the movie's pacing.Snyder's muscular visual flair is littered are all over the film as expected, including a wonderful opening sequence punctuated by drama, humor, violence, and slo-mo. The script, which Snyder co-authored with Shay Hatten and Joby Harold, unfortunately lacks the necessary character arcs (mainly because it has so many characters) that will complement its incredibly diverse cast; though Snyder seems to make up for it with witty exchanges. And there may be a political subtext underneath its conflict concerning the US government's landmark decision of nuclear bombing Vegas on the fourth of July to obliterate the zombie epidemic (an echo to 28 Weeks Later, and by proxy the Iraq War of the Bush government).""Army of the Dead"" is an ""okay"" addition to a genre that has run its course. It has Zack Snyder's usual trademarks as well as the necessary ingredients of a good zombie movie, and a little more. But as far as Snyder's ouevre, his first hit ""Dawn of the Dead"" will always be the best.",Army of the Dead
1396,veksdave,Unexpected in a bad meaning,6,22 May 2021,"As a Snyder fan i like how he handles the visuals but there is nothing else here honestly, Batista going beast mode is far an example, it got some scenes with great suspense and worthy to watch fights indeed, the ending of the movie is the worst of all and gets even more disappointing every minute, when the first hour was used to show the characters i thought the simple plot would turn to a deep story on how this changes everyones lives (and some deads obviously) , but instead we get a heist that goes well and turns into a massacre with pointless sacrifices that lead to nothing, the worst charcter surviving and a mission that ain't changed absolutely nothing, maybe the film has an ironic meaning that those who understand would love or if you are someone who only wants to watch blood and smart zombies you would enjoy this after the first hour.

There is slow motion, little things drawn out in order to emphasize some artsy shot, cliches, plagiarism, storylines to nowhere, horrible soundtrack, etc. The writing was about average, but because it was just essentially taking parts from a bunch of other movies it fell rather flat.If some of the excess was cut the film would have been more enjoyable, but I have seen many, many, movies that are far worse. In fact with the trajectory of movies lately it is safe to say that there will many more horrible ones coming our way.This movie does not in any way deserve a 10 nor does it deserve a 1, I am giving it a 5 because I think it should be sitting at around a 6 and it is currently at 6.4.",Army of the Dead

But one does expect a fun campy horror/gore flick. The plotline seemed to have promise...Dave Bautista is recruited to build a team that'll go into the Zombie infested Las Vegas to fetch $200 millions dollars sitting in a casino vault. Sounds like it'll be fun to watch.The first problems comes when you see the team that is presented and you immediately hate every single one of them with the exception of Tig. You hope that these folks would bond at some point, but they never really do. When an attempt to create some bonds, it just falls flat and is not very genuine.The second big problem is the storyline splits off in several incomprehensible arcs which repeatedly breaks the flow of the story. The father reconnecting with his daughter arc is just silly and predictable.The action sequences are pretty good, though some are a little over the top, but enjoyable to watch. The Zombies themselves have are well done but they get lost in the mishmash of the story arcs. And the ending was pretty good though not great.In conclusion, this isn't a bad film, I just wished that Zack would have trimmed down some of the subplots and given us more Zombie action.",Army of the Dead

1403,chawk-76623,Reminds me of Left 4 Dead games. Fun Zombie heist action thriller!,8,22 May 2021,"This movie is supposedly Dave Bautista's first leading role. I really like his character in the film and I appreciate the story and the action as there are many things that separated from other zombie stories but he still has the usual cliches and tropes here and there. *SPOILERS AHEAD!* Dave Batista and another lady hire other people to pull off a bank heist for millions of dollars before Las Vegas is nuked. Zombie infection has only spread across Las Vegas, Nevada so far in the.So there was one part of the movie where they explained that some of the zombies are alphas and not a zombie like, then we see that there is a king zombie and a queen zombie and the queen zombie was pregnant. Our team of zombie killer mercenaries for hire kill the queen zombie (which reminds me of the screaming witch from the Left for Dead games) and the king zombie finds her beheaded corpse and breaks down crying over her then he checks her stomach to see if what turned out to be a zombie fetus was still alive. There's an interesting dichotomy here because it is like what side is actually good or right? Are we supposed to feel bad for the zombie baby or are we supposed to root for these people that are pulling off a heist for money. Are we to be sympathetic for flesh-eating monsters that hold some semblance of what it is to be human, or a wild animal at the least? *MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!*One part of the film that I am seriously questioning is that; how in the world did Dave Batista's character die so fast after being bitten but the guy that was left in the bank vault that survived the nuclear explosion at the end survived for a very long time after being bitten and scratched!? I mean the guy had enough time in between being locked in the vault after being bitten getting out of the Vault with all of the money finding a house that happen to have a car that he probably had to fix and then he drove all the way to Utah rented out a private jet and only then did he find the bite on his arm and still hadn't turned yet! That's probably the dumbest part of the movie that I saw. Overall I enjoyed the film though. I liked the cast choices and Dave Bautista did his thang!

This is truly garbage that should never have been released. If there's anything on earth that this movie will be remembered for that is how to waste 70 millions of dollars. The visuals with the retro lenses are too blurry and out of place. I cannot believe that Snyder wrote this a decade ago and ten years after they made it into a movie.

Bad scripts is better than no script. Look at all Netflix original movies. Something or everything misses all the time. Sometimes they don't end; they start good but don't escalate.

Dawn of the Dead (remake) was one of my all time favorite movies and one of the three modern zombie movies along side 28 Days and Weeks that stood head and shoulders above everything else. Dawn if the Dead, helped to reinvigorate the horror genre when it was on life support like other movies during its time period (The Conjuring, etc.)Zach Snyder is a very good director and this movie isnt poorly shot or directed, no...its the storyline that is atrocious. Characters are not believable or likeable. The one character that survives is a whiny spoiled brat that basically gets multiple other people killed and doesnt even succeed in her attempt at a righteous quest.I knew it was going to be over the top from the trailers and I tempered my expectations. But holy f the stupidity. When the ""Zombie-toothed tiger"" is the most realistic thing you know the movie is cringe. From super zombies entering the matrix to dodge bullets, to a zombie/skeleton horse mount, to a metal helmet wearing juiced alpha zombie I was shaking my head in constant disbelief. Glossing over the fact that at the end of the movie, one of the characters walks through a freshly nuked Vegas strip (yea stuff is still smoldering and he walks through nuclear fallout like its nothing) with loads of cash, they just had string the movie along with oooo surprise surprise hes bit and just flew out out of the country. Whats next? Favelas of the Dead?.Beyond the incredible stupidity i just described is the utter moronic plot line that a team is desperate enough to wade through a zombified city to rob a bank. The movie doesnt even come close to selling you on the idea that these people are desperate enough to try something so obviously moronic. Well guess we are back to just making b.s.

And while she patches things up with her father, she has to kill him.

Not every movie has to be way over two hours in order to be good.Imagine this as a 'Predator' type experience... insomuch as 4 or 5 identifiable characters which we get to know along the way.Waiting for an edit which trims an hour, then I'll revisit!",Army of the Dead

Not bad acting lots of really well done special effects but the problem was it was to predictable. We took bets within 20 minutes of the start as to who was going to survive and even what order they would die and were not wrong on any of it. We even predicted the ending which shows Hollywood writers are getting lazy and hoping foe a sequel,.

1445,jeremywtfbbqsauce,This was a complete mess.,2,11 June 2021,"I'll start off by saying I enjoyed some of the action scenes. Nothing groundbreaking or even done that well, but I still got some enjoyment out of them. Dave Bautista really tried here with what he was given. That's all I got for positives.Oh boy, where to start? From the complete tone change in the beginning of the movie that tells us it's going to be a not serious campy good time, into the overly serious disaster we got, I was extremely disappointed in the choices Zack Snyder made for this film.Characters across the board make insane decisions that make no sense, or completely go against what little is established about them. Over and over again until the very end of the movie.Numerous things set up and never delivered upon. Characters teleporting around the city in mere seconds. Zombie power levels varying from scene to scene. Attempts at setting up emotional moments out of nowhere only to abruptly end as awkwardly as they begin.All in all, if you wanna shut off your brain and watch something, you could do a lot worse, but if that's not something you want to do or can't do; I'd say you're better off watching Zack's far superior film Dawn of the Dead.",Army of the Dead

Don't sound like zombies to me. Can't come up with a new zombie plot, I know it's hard cause their ZOMBIES!, but giving zombies thought process, emotions just makes them cold hearted killers/murders in zombie makeup.At this point Zack Snyder is 0 for 2 in the movie department, so is it going to be ""Third times a charm"" or ""Three strikes and your out"", I'm guessing the latter, so far his movies seem to be really long with a lot of time spent ""wasting screen time"" with long sweeping pans of the desert or some other type of ""No value added"" time wasting footage.Second half of the movie was all about ""finding Geeta"" a non-player in the plot up until she was lead behind enemy lines by Lilly, who quite frankly was a much more interesting character, only to be found and cost most everyone else their livesZack you owe me my money back!!!

1448,dannyreyntiens,"Been there, done that...",3,22 May 2021,"I love living dead/zombie films, but when a company like Asylum, who is famous for ripping off blockbusters, delivers more originality, better acting and better script in their films than the clearly well financed Netflix vehicle, then you wonder where all the money went.Let see....A CGI tiger that contributes nothing to the story and isn't a compliment to Siegried and Roy at all. Don't they know what happened back in 2003 and Siefried passed away ?Cover songs like bad moon rising are being used, a song usually associated with werewolves and since this story takes place during the day, it was rather pointless,Yes, the living dead make-up was actually very good. I'm sure, it must have cost a lot of money to make Las Vegas to look like that, although they could have filmed it around my corner in London which looks exactly like its set and many people around here could have been perfect for extras. The story is simple , it has been written very simple and delivered with simplicity. The problem is that the story has been done so many times and so, so much better, more developed with far better side stories, which, in this film if there are any, aren't really original either. Throw in a masked horse (is it supposed to be a zombie horse?) and the holes appear bigger than they are.Acting and characteristics are non-existing. Jokes fall flat . And did I miss something or hasn't there been no explanation why there are dumb zombies and intelligent zombies? Or why the smart ones can go outside, while the dumb ones sleep in the dark? The more I write, the more questions start occurring . And last but not least... what's up with casting Tig Notaro? I know she was cast after the other actor was cut, and she is great and all, but couldn't they have found someone else more suitable instead of making her look like Murdoch from the A-Team?So, do yourself a favour. Skip this film and put on a low budget zombie film, you will have more fun even if it is for the wrong reasons. This is definitely not a so bad it's good film. Just a very expensive looking bad film.",Army of the Dead

Well...it wasn't.The fun, over the top, action promised by the trailer was only in a 3 minute ""trailer"" for the heist inside of the movie. By over the top I mean chainsaws and spiked baseball bats. Not man unload 30 bullets blindly into a crowd of zombies and hit 45 heads, not man launches a heavy casino table across the room as if it were a bar stool.The story is a poorly constructed mash up of cliches and obvious plot points. The acting showed how the actors almost cared. Not fudged but not trying that much either. The attempt at emotional moments were as successful as a wet fart.Then why did I give a 4/10? I'm generous, of course!But there were things that I appreciated. Credit given where credit due.1 point for the opening - Where they show the concept of what this should have been.1 point for the production value - I liked the aesthetics, and the movie was well made from the technical point of view.1 point for being topical without being overbearing - POTENTIAL SPOILERS - One bad guy is the guard imposing his will and using a temperature measuring thingy to oppress people, while the other is the greedy corporate ""just following orders"" mercenary working for the big powerful rich guy trying to weaponize the zombies. If these were nods to current world affairs, trying to serve ""both sides"", I liked it.....or maybe it was just shallow attempt to cram everything in there.... but let's be charitable.1 point for nailing the re-shoots - If I didn't know beforehand that Tig Notaro wasn't initially in the movie, I wouldn't have noticed. Apparently they axed someone and brought her in to re-shoot all her character's scenes, and then she kinda stole the show.In summary, It's bad, not fun and a waste of a good idea, waste of a good production and wast of talented funny actors.....and the ending.....yikes!",Army of the Dead

Even if I did turn my brain off and tried to simply enjoy this movie for what it was the characters and storytelling offered were so dumb so often that it was too distracting to just roll with. I'm not going to waste my time here listing all the dumb stuff this movie does, but feel free to read through other reviews here and you'll get the idea; this movie could barely go 10 minutes without something completely idiotic happening or being said.My biggest gripe is probably the run time. I honestly laughed out loud when I went to watch it and saw how long it was. Snyder is either so in love with himself and his artistic vision that he finds it impossible to shave down his movies to more reasonable run times or he padded the hell out of this one because he thinks long movie = good movie. Either way he seems to be mistaken. This movie had SO MUCH fat that could've been trimmed off. Characters that could've been removed completely, shortened scenes, tighter dialogue, less time spent on useless distractions that go nowhere (the pregnant zombie queen, the nonsensical time loop theory scene.)There are so many other movies that have done everything this one tried so desperately to do, only much better and in less time. I would advise anyone reading this to just go watch one of those instead. Yes, there are movies that are just pure, dumb fun to watch and require little to no effort to enjoy... this is not one of those movies. This one is just pure dumb, full stop.

It made the movie slow and plodding with no real drama or tension and a complete disconnect from the throw away characters.They could have just cut footage from Last days of Mars into the movie and saved on the costume and makeup for the supermutant zombie tribal scenes.

I found this concept quite interesting, and would've liked to have seen this explored more. Alas, it was not to be. Instead, this film has created some zombie King and his bride, who are capable of pretty complex thought and riding horses (!). Zombie animals are a thing now, yet we see no zombie dogs or cats despite there for sure being tons of stray dogs and cats in Vegas.On the other side of the spectrum, the daughter is an idiot seemingly incapable of complex thought. She puts the whole team in jeopardy to save a woman who's completely irrelevant for 98% f the movie.Not to mention, these characters escape Las Vegas as a nuclear bomb goes off yet they survive the bomb and instead die of a shot to the head & a plane crash? The daughter is A OK, no need to consider radiation, I guess?There are so many things wrong about this film.

But they didn't really use those parts of the story much and it didn't seem clear why they decided to include some of them at all if they wouldn't use them (like the zombies hibernating and there being a king and queen etc).Also the characters were pretty unlikable and their relationships were either boring or stupid.",Army of the Dead

But of course, I enjoyed Bayformers and Fast and Furious sometimes, so I wouldn't say no to a fun, dumb, cheesy zombie-flick - but what is this even? It's too ridiculous (as in a heist in a middle of a zombie apocalypse) - too littered with bad reasoning, questionable logic, and truly mind-blowingly idiotic decisions by some characters to be taken seriously; and yet at the same time, seems like it tries to take itself too seriously by slipping in so-called profound meaning like the time loop, the alien and robozombie to be enjoyed as a simple, turn-off-your-brain popcorn-flick. This movie nearly made me think the dagger from The Rise of Skywalker makes sense. Nearly.A military truck blew up after a head-on collision with a '70s Cadillac or something; Only one person to my memory was smart enough to ask for a suppressed weapon; Everyone shoots exclusively at the armoured part of the zombie instead of trying to sever its limbs. We could be here all week talking about this. Dieter sacrificing himself where he could've jumped in the vault and pulled the door. And of course, Kate. Oh dear, Kate. At least 3 people could've lived if she weren't so adamant on saving this random woman who might as well be considered dead (and died anyway in the end). She really makes kid Carl from Walking Dead who always do the opposite of what he's told feels bearable. That's a massive achievement.I tried to read into the time loop theory etc just to try to justify this - that maybe I'm not watching it right, and apparently, some ""experts"" say you should do a second rewatch to put it all together. I just couldn't care. It was a painful experience the first time around. And it's a shame, because - smart zombies with a sense of hierarchy, one that ride horses and take prisoners? That is an interesting idea that this movie absolutely left behind for some reason. Why did the leader kidnap Geeta and let her live? What happened to the refugee camp? And no, I know a sequel-bait when I see one. I would rather not have this answered if it means watching a sequel of identical quality.And that wide-open f/1.2 DoF was used on way too many scenes, I'm sorry, it's simply nauseating. I envy such fast lens for photography (and even then, I think the application is really limited), but unfortunately, when used in cinema - especially like the way it's used here - it made what would've been a good shot looks like cheap CGI. That, or some of the CGI are just shoddy. Reminds me of Aeon Flux. Especially the bloom, see?",Army of the Dead

Guy has shown that he has no clue how to have a proper pacing in his movies and you can see the best/worst example in this one.Snyder also seems to get aroused to putting cliches in to his films, because the movie was the biggest collection of cliches that you can find. I would list them, but my review will take up a page if so.The writing in the movie was bad. From dialogue to plot. Characters reached new levels of stupidity that zombie/horror movie characters have tried to reach from centuries. Snyder also seems to hate Chekhov's gun, because he did the plain opposite. Two examples that frustrated me the most:
First: One of the crew has a chainsaw that's a core part of his identity/ uniqueness, but he never even used it during the mission...
Second: Another crew member mentions that the dried out zombies on the streets come back to life when it rains. You can guess what happens next or even better: what doesn't happen.

Was it Shaun of the Dead? Was it John Wick? It went from a heist movie to a brutal action movie to a comedy movie at various different points. It tried its best to imitate Zombieland with its intro, it pretended to be Now You See Me with its heist feel, and it took a book straight out of I Am Legend with zombie love. I've come to expect far greater things from Zack Snyder and this just didn't really do it for me. It didn't feel creative, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters, and I wasn't ooed and awed by any piece of the action.Still a semi enjoyable movie if you have really low expectations, but I wouldn't expect this day's Train to Busan or anything like that.",Army of the Dead

1539,roverite1970-682-875506,What happened here???,5,22 May 2021,"I, like many others were looking forward to this film. Zack Snyder is not for everyone. His films can be overlong, but there is no doubting he can handle actions sequences and he has a real visual flair.Sadly, this film is lacking in many of these traits, apart from 1, that is is far too long.The opening was brilliant. We didn't know what was happening, or what the army were transporting and the whole sequence was engaging. That is where it went downhill. At no point did we find out WHY they were transporting this creature, and why send it by road at all. Surely a transport helicopter carrying it underneath would have made more sense.We then go through multiple character expositions, but at no time to we actually care about them. To be fair, Dave Bautista was okay, but Ella Parnell and the rest of the 'crew' were just annoying. You didn't care whether they lived or died.Add into this the ridiculous 'plot' of the bank heist, which was so far fetched it made a mockery of the actual reason why they where sent in. If they needed the zombie dancer, why didn't they just go in and grab her as it would have only taken 2 minutes. Add into this the 'pregnancy' and the ridiculous 'smart' zombie leader, then you can see what a mishmash this was.HOW did the zombie leader get so smart, HOW did a dead zombie get pregnant, HOW did he control the rest of the zombies, WHY did this movie get made????I gave it a 5 but I am being generous. George Romero did a better job with Land of the Dead. At least that answered some questions, and was a lot shorter.The only standout for me was the character Dieter played superbly by Matthias Schweighöfer. He was at least partially likeable, and probably the only character I was upset about how his arc ended.There are a lot better zombie films out there, and I think Zack Snyder needs to go back to the drawing board, and make something around 2 hours long, story driven, and engaging.

1542,Fridaythe13th12463578,Little Dieter needs silence,7,21 May 2021,"Zack Snyder is good at spectacle and broad good guy/bad guy characters. Those strengths work OK in a zombie movie. You don't look to him for nuanced plot or complicated characters. He's given us his what he's good at, and that's not bad.The scenes of the unfolding apocalypse and post-apocalyptic Las Vegas are done very well. The action scenes are over-the-top, just what you'd expect in a movie of this type.Tig Notaro's character, Peters, gives a little speech about the relative importance of the members of the crew assembled to steal millions of dollars from a casino vault. She emphasizes that. Martin (Garret Dillahunt) is not what he seems and they'd all do well to make sure he doesn't leave with them. We know that Martin is a bad guy the moment he shows up. Only two of the characters in the movie as as basically perceptive as us, alas. Notaro and Dillahunt both did fine jobs with their characters, what they were given to do with them.Dave Bautista, as Scott, did what he does best: playing an earnest lunk. Ella. Purnell played his daughter, Kate. She's the weakest link in the main casting with a character who's annoyed much of the time and annoying just as much of the time. Kate makes several irresponsible choices. The worst, if we're honest, cost the lives of most of the crew. Including the one person who motivated her worst decision, the zombie-napped mother Geeta, played by. Huma Qureshi.The unlikely duo of muscle/philosopher Vanderhoe (Omari Hardwick) and nerd/artist Dieter.(Matthias Schweighöfer) offer the most fun. Their unlikely bond is the movie's most satisfying bit of character development with both actors giving more than the script provided.Nora Arnezeder, as Lilly, gives a fantastic action performance as the coyote guide who takes the crew into Las Vegas. She should be given more roles, she's one to watch.Ana de la Reguera, as Maria, had the thankless task of being aboard just to reveal a late love interest in Scott, only to have her head treated like a twist off cap. A bit of contrived pathos that did nothing for the plot except give Dave Bautista a reason to gape and look upset.Amazing work by zombie king Zeus (Rich Cetrone) and his zombie Queen (Athena Perample).When you ask yourself questions like:How did that little bit of gasoline power an entire casino and for so long?And, how can a helicopter still function after years of neglect on a rooftop in Las Vegas?And, why didn't Mr. Tanaka and the military and government people in cahoots with him simply give the crew the combination to the safe?And so on.Just keep telling yourself, it's a fun action zombie movie. Relax and enjoy your time in Las Vegas.It just occurred to me. This movie neatly fits into the world of 2016's ""It Stains the Sands Red.""

In fact, I'd probably put Watchmen in my top 20. Having said that, not every movie he makes is good and Army of the Dead is one of them.I was hoping for more but unfortunately I was extremely bored watching this movie. I honestly don't know why I even finished it. How could I possibly be bored watching an action packed Zombie movie? Good question, well, the story is very predictable and it's blogged down by a bunch of unnecessary side stuff. You could cut an hour out of its run time and it'd probably still suck. Like the zombie horde in this movie, it's a big mess. I'm not going to get into the details of why it sucked. They are many and they've already been addressed in previous reviews. But I'll say this, that Kate character IS very annoying.It's my understanding that Zack not only directed this movie but he also wrote it and I think that's where the problem lies. He doesn't seem to be a very good writer. He usually does well when he's shooting material other people have written. But I'm not going to hate on the man.

Without already firmly believing inside yourself that real world right-wing governments are rounding up and/or persecuting everybody they don't like (a major part of the movie) - and that having borders on a country is fundamentally wrong - the characters here are paper thin. The only likeable trait to be found for our main hero (the 22-year-old daughter of Dave Bautista's character) is that she is singularly and stunningly brave and fearless in the face of the big, bad, patriarchal powers-that-be (the Republican Party, as stated by Zack Snyder whilst doing Press, the early appearance of Sean Spicer, the satirical content of the movie itself) that controls America in this movie. Without the personal belief of you, the viewer, that illegal immigrants should never be detained or deported, this character has nothing to offer you and is nothing. ""One-dimensional"" would be an overstatement.At no point in the film is there ever suggested a reason for our main character to be so compassionate, enlightened and valiant other than she's young, female and is clearly opposed to real world, right-wing policies (all of this being satirically present in the film). As such, most people watching this movie will have, at best, no connection to this character whom we're to see as the ultimate hero, and, at worst, a loathing of simply how selfish and irrational she is portrayed.Not a good movie. At all. More of a lacklustre, partisan attempt at misguided activism - and lacking much of what moviemaking actually needs to be enjoyable and rewarding.",Army of the Dead

The whole bit about the group being saviors at the beginning and then trying to go in for themselves would have been enough of a storyline to be believable. Then have the intelligent zombie see a news scene about the nuke coming and realizing he needs to get out, the group then fights to keep it in because that's what they are, saviors, and then stay until the nuke hits, ala Rogue One.

It has completely transformed the overepititive concept of survival in order to escape from a zombie apocalypse, into cashing from the latter, which by the way could have been done by 4 rookies in Hazmat suit after the planned nuking of Las Vegas.But such shortcuts aren't a cup of tea for our brave and intelligent expendables who anyways fight their way through a heap of brainless creatures, in order to live a good retirement life ( which, ahm...they already were living).

The finale was quite predictable, but nevertheless spectacular. The only downside of the movie was the opening: this is used in the trailer and it would have been a great part if it was edited somewhere in the middle of the movie and not in the beginning with no actual sounds of the action but an opening song.

This thing is just terrible at every level, everything is a waste from the writing to the extremely ridiculous zombie acting that feels a lot like a mix of novice parkour with amateurish ballet. It's astonishingly pathetic, it's so bad it makes House of the Dead look like a horror masterpiece.Furthermore, the cinematography, proudly signed by Zack Snyder itself, is insane. But in a very bad way. There's no doubt that we're living in the era of the worst cinematographic work of all time. Even so, this blurry crap still manages to be way worse than any today's bad cinematography you can think of. It's horribly filmed, poorly planned and the color grading is beyond horrendous. They were probably trying to make it look like a fake domestic cheap flick, but they went so far that they turned it into a genuine mediocre production.Overall it's a really, really bad and uninspired movie. There's nothing good to point out, even the song's placement is bad. It's all pure trash. It's not even one of those cases when a movie is so bad that it's funny.

1593,MJC_42,Mostly entertaining but failed to stick the landing so hard that it completely ruined what came before.,4,23 May 2021,"The basic premise is that the Army was holding a super zombie in a container and was transporting it. After a collision on the highway, the (poorly built) container popped open, and the super zombie started killing people. This was just outside Las Vegas, so Las Vegas became zombie-infested. The city was walled off, and the government plans on nuking it.A rich dude talks to a down-on-his-luck soldier and makes him a deal. There is $200 million in a safe in a casino. If he puts together a team and collects the money, he and his team will split $50 million.Added to this team is a guy representing the rich dude. We know he's shady and will betray them because there's something else the rich dude actually wants, and the team knows he's shady and will betray him, but for some reason they do not immediately murder him and go about their business. If they had, it's likely that everyone on the team would have survived.On top of this, the main character has an estranged daughter. He asks her to help them get into a volunteer camp area outside of the walled city. She had a friend in the camp who had two kids. Her friend wanted to go into the city in order to try and steal some money. She does and goes missing. The daughter of the main character insists on joining the team so that she can find her friend.As you can imagine, this daughter is the worst, just the absolute worst. Not only is she the worst character in the whole movie, but she just sucks. Lots of movies have these characters who are total morons and insist on doing something really stupid despite everyone saying it's really stupid and despite the likelihood that their stupid actions will hurt others. I so very much hate that this character is in the movie. It's so damn lazy and annoying. And guess what? Spoiler alert: She's only character to survive.Before they go into the city to get to the safe, they are told that they have a certain amount of time before the nuclear strike. As they are in the process of trying to get the safe open, they discover that they will have 24 hours less than expected, which gives them 90 minutes to open the safe (which is expected to take 30 minutes), collect the money, and get on the helicopter and leave. There's time to do it, but not a lot to spare.After they get the safe open and start collecting the money, they discover that the daughter ran off. That's right. Without telling anyone at all and with a very short bit of time available, she leaves to go to another casino where she suspects her friend might, if she's lucky, still be alive. How exactly she expected to make it through the zombie-infested area to the other casino, which is also infested with zombies, rescue her friend, make it back to the first casino and get on the helicopter in time and without any help is anyone's guess.At this point, all Hell breaks loose because of the shenanigans of the double-crossing guy, so everyone is fighting zombies, and some people are getting killed. The main guy, who is not carrying hardly any money at all for some reason, goes after the daughter. He is able to find her and rescue her. Now, he has an opportunity to take out the zombie leader or at the very least trap it in a room, but he fails to do that, and they just run. So this guy, his stupid daughter, and her stupid friend, make it to the roof where they eventually board the helicopter. As they are leaving, the zombie lord jumps into the helicopter and fights with the main character and eventually bites him. His daughter sits there, useless. Although her friend boards the helicopter, it's unclear what happens to her as we never see her alive. The helicopter crashes, and the pilot is dead, and the dad is lying there dying, and this stupid woman has barely a scratch on her despite a violent helicopter crash and not even having been strapped in. Again, who knows what happened to her friend. She ends up shooting her dad and survives.There was another guy who got locked into the safe. He was fighting a zombie with another guy, the safecracker, and the safecracker through him into the safe to protect him and closed it before getting killed. Uh, how exactly was he expecting this guy to ever leave the safe? But hey, he did get to leave the safe! I don't know if the door could be pushed open from the inside, or if it cracked open as a result of the nuclear bomb, but he makes it out with a ton of money. He finds a car and drives to an airport and gets himself on a private plane. Sounds good. Oh wait, he was bitten, and apparently this is the slowest-activating bite in zombie history. Most of these people turn within seconds, maybe minutes. It must have been hours at least for this guy.So yeah, a fun and entertaining movie ruined by having the absolute worst character be the only survivor. This was some seriously sadistic crap. This could have been an entertaining and satisfying zombie heist movie, but instead it turned out to be someone's sick joke where he gets to torture us with this horrific ending.",Army of the Dead

1605,robertghall,Watchable but too many plot holes,5,23 May 2021,"Was really excited to watch this film as the trailer made it look awesome. Sadly the actual film was mid tier at best with many plot holes, annoying characters, obvious story and random camera shots.I didn't understand why sometimes the shot would just blur, I though it would focus on something important. But nope just blur the whole shot for no reason.Spoilers beyond here**The characters could have been great, I liked some of them but they just weren't defined at all and I felt no attachment to them. When they died, which was like 10 minutes per character death for no reason, I just thought yeah next saw that coming.But the most annoying character is the daughter. Why is she even in the movie? Would have been better to not have her in the film at all. She gets everyone killed, makes stupid decisions and runs off all line to save someone she doesn't actually care about at all. At the end of the film she is in a helicopter crash and survives without injury (baring in mind a nuke cause the heli to crash too) and I completely forgot about the friend she rescued and she was never mentioned again. Literally just a plot filler.Everyone is insanely good at shooting, every shot is a head shot... until it matters and then they turn into the worst shot.Then the plot points come in... the biggest one being at the end the guy survives a nuclear blast in a vault which yeah maybe you can do. But to then walk out in the radiated zone straight after and of course he is bitten. People are shown to change in to a zombie with a minute or so, he didn't change for at least a whole day maybe two.Then there is this one scene in the casino, a zombie gets shot in the head and it explodes. However it's almost like he was a robot. I don't know if this is an Easter egg or something but it was a robot/Android.It's not all bad though I liked some of the characters though I can't remember their names in the movie. The zombies were very cool as well, loved the idea of the clever ones but again just wasn't developed as much as I would like.

Writing is obviously bad, & the daughter character was awful, 2 hours 28 minutes for a zombie movie was too long , plot wasn't smooth either like other zombie movies.... It wasn't thrilling at all, Snyder couldn't make an emotional ending by killing Bautista at the end ( What was the main catalyst in the Train to Busan) .. You can guess the plot easily if you have watched Hollywood movies...2. Positive points
Big CGI fights filled my hungry stomach, A new concept ( If the king alpha bites anyone he is going to be an Alpha, if another Alpha bites anyone they'll become a Shambler) .... Movie makers tried to mix Zombieland & the Ocean series together ( though that didn't work out) , , Tiger zombie, Horse Zombie, Alpha king & Alpha queen were the main attraction, Not like other Dark zombie movies, it was colorful ......

I didn't care about any of the characters. Far too many characters, the daughter couldn't be more annoying and predictable. Really the whole thing was pretty predictable and obvious. You knew from the moment she said she wouldn't run off that she would run off to save Geeta. Why should I care about geeta, also aren't her kids dead already because the bomb already dropped? So why did the dad(don't even remember the name) give her the money and said its for the kids? The whole story of kate is that she is trying to save geeta but we dont see anything of geeta or her kids its not interesting or anything.The ending is terrible. Whats it supposed to be? A setup for a sequel or what? Also how did he even survive the bomb? Pretty sure a metal vault won't save you against an atom bomb but I don't konw.Overall the worldbuilding and concept had so much potential also the connection you can draw between the characters in the story like the dad, the woman thats with the dad(cant remember her name either) to war veterans who cant find their place back in the normal world. That could have been a good premise to go off of.

While I do appreciate the originality of the story, which is something people seem to beg for nowadays amid all the remakes and spin-offs that eek out of Hollywood, this was good but not gold. You can easily spot who the bad guy is early on so there's not much of a twist there. The main characters are archetypes, soldier with a heart of gold, nerdy technical guy, badass brute, etc., so there isn't much to be said there which is a shame cause the movie tries to create these emotional moments between card board cutout characters and they don't land. However, the lore of the zombies in this was probably the best part. A little bit of the traditional mindless undead mass, but also a mix of cunning akin to those in ""I Am Legend.""

1639,bennett-10884,"Mindless Fun, Nothing Else",6,25 June 2021,"Zach Snyder was kind of the big man of campus after his Justice League cut got released and was show to be a huge improvement over what we got. When this film came out I thought it was gonna be bad, and I was kind of, sort of right. It's definitely a decent action film, and has elements I really liked and thought were creative, but it's writing is kind of bad. I like most of the characters, but there were guys like the safe guy and the ""bad guy"" who weren't very good characters. I don't remember the bad guys name so I'm just gonna call him Burt Chance, deal with it. So the Burt Chance twist was pretty predictable from the beginning, and it was pointless. I'm glad he got eaten by a zombie tiger honestly. I think the idea of it being a heist film is a good idea... if it had mattered in the end. The don't get anything out of it and all but two characters die. One of which is Dave Bautista's daughter, the worst character. She gets everyone killed because she's trying to save someone who she had no right to believe was in the zombie hotspot (Las Vegas). Even worse she doesn't even end up saving her. She gets her father killed, or turned into a zombie, and we're supposed to find her sympathetic? What a slap in the face. What saves this film is the action is actually pretty cool. The effects look decent and the zombies are actually scary, much unlike I was expecting. The zombie cult is a part of the film that's very polarizing, but I think it was a good idea, and it was well executed. It really makes them more than just mindless beings. However if I'm gonna say anything about this film is that it makes me wish I was watching Zombieland. Hell it makes me wish I was watching Snyder's other zombie film, Dawn of the Dead (2004). Just stick to those movies, this one isn't on the levels of other like these.

1641,simmans,A Beautiful Trainwreck,5,21 May 2021,"Army Of The Dead is okay, which is the best I can bring myself to say of it. I usually like Zack Snyder films, except Sucker Punch, so I didn't expect to be so un-wowwed by this. (Yes. I enjoyed BvS, so AotD seemed like a no-brainer. However, it really is a ""no-brainer."")Technically, it's excellent. Art direction, set design, cinematography, bursting heads, CGI... All perfectly fine. Top-drawer, even, for the most part. Unfortunately, the best of production values can't fix a script that is rotten at its core... a script that is a brazen retooling of Aliens (and which actually dares to tack on the worst elements of Alien 3, for good measure.) One character literally spews Ripley's dialogue about aliens not screwing each other over, verbatim.Mr Tanaka (essentially Aliens' Weilland corporation) hires Dave Bautista's Merc squad to rob the safe under his own casino, inside the Zombiopolis that used to be Vegas. Tanaka gives Dave the schematics to the safe, which contains $200 million, but urges Dave to hire a safecracker, rather than just giving him the code to open the safe. Now, spoiler alert, Tanaka doesn't actually want the safe's contents, but that doesn't mean Dave shouldn't have asked about that.""You're sending me into your own casino, to steal your own money, but you won't tell me the code for the safe, nor how to bypass the booby traps? Very good. I will take this job.""So Dave puts together a crew, analogous to Aliens' space Marines, and brings along his daughter, who will be playing Newt--but a much stupider version of Newt, and one who actively tries to get everyone killed.There's a nuclear deadline, as in aliens, and even an apparent last-minute betrayal at the landing pad. (Tig Notaro seems to be playing Bishop, at this point.)Instead of an Alien queen, the film gives us a zombified King/Queen combo. They ultimately amount to nothing.Everything amounts to nothing.The zombie queen's head is basically the equivalent of the alien embryos that Weilland coveted, and Garrett Dillahunt plays Paul Reiser. Like all villains set up in AotD, his ending is basically a tiny fart.All set up, no payoff, nothing of substance.It all ends like Aliens did, except, as I said, it continues into Alien 3, just so you feel like your time was completely wasted.But, it does look good.",Army of the Dead

This one is all that and then some.Plot holes everywhere. Not going to go into details but they are there and wide as the grand canion. No care was put whatsoever in the script to have a minimum amount of coherence.Dull, clicheic and poorly written characters. I can't possibly say I like any of them they can all die for all I care.The 2 stars is because it got an interesting idea.

1704,Reelty,The zombie tiger symbolizes the whole film.,3,9 August 2021,"The zombie tiger was the highlight of the first full trailer. However, it turns out that tiger's contribution was a metaphor for the whole film;
It had great appeal and potential, but ultimately accomplished nothing special.It made the movie look fun, when it's actually a dire drab bore.It made you think the Vegas setting was going to bring unique flavour to the film, but it barely mattered.It wasted Garret Dillahunt.It takes forever to do anything.It wasn't in focus.Everything cool about it was in the trailer.In fact, it's so uninteresting, that when you are done watching it, you wonder what it was you thought was so appealing in the first place.Oh, and let's go back to that trailer....90% of what's cool in the trailer either takes place in the opening credit montage, or during the hypothetical ""here's how the plan is gonna go...."" footage that plays over them discussing what they are going to do. Which makes the trailer 90% lies, since those moments have no real stakes.What would even be the difference between the actions of an actual living tiger and a zombie one? I guess a zombie one would be more aggressive and could take more damage without slowing down. But you don't really see that here. It just sorta force-punches a guy a couple times and he goes flying. You know that boring trope in movies where the villain keeps pointlessly throwing a person instead of killing them right away? Purely to prolong the fight? That's the one thing it does a normal tiger wouldn't. So they pulled in an unenjoyable cliche just for the sake of it, despite the fact nobody likes it when they do that. Just like they force in a pushy civilian character who insists on going on a dangerous expedition for selfless reasons, but also hates her father.What a massive letdown. I was really excited for this film. It has such a great trailer and premise, some great actors and a director who is perfectly capable of making great visuals and moments, but it's dull and cliche and has one good kill and one good joke and it's a Netflix original, which means countdown until everything takes place indoors. It thinks it's so clever, too. With it's smart and robot zombies and social commentary and meta humour. It honestly thinks it's going to be surprising when a character reveals a bite mark, or at the end of a long fight with an unstoppable boss bad guy, everything slows down for a headshot.

The fact that an actor was edited out of this movie is doing his career a favor. The story as much as there was one makes zero sense even when considering this is a zombie movie. So glad this was included in my Netflix subscription or I would have gotten up and left the theater. The end is the least surprising and reeks of a pathetic attempt to set up the Sci Fi Channel sequel as no sane production should waste another dime on this mess.

1728,christopherlauer-34222,I enjoyed this movie very much,8,30 May 2021,"So, I was skeptical when I read all the bad reviews here and after seeing the movie I have no idea what the problem of the people is writing this bad reviews.This movie is a Zombie movie. It is not supposed to have a happy end. Does it have holes in the story? Yes, some, but to be honest, Las Vegas overrun by zombies and this zombie outbreak contained within Las Vegas is maybe not the most realistic premise. So I wasn't expecting something realistic, I was expecting entertainment and I was very entertained.The movie has Heist movie elements, I it was fun to see if the group gets to the safe or not. Matthias Schweighöfer does a great job as safe-specialist Dieter. The whole steal the 200 Million Dollar from the Casino plotline was cool and has some unexpected plot-twists. But lets not forget that these people attempting to rob the bank are not pros but desperate people, who were traumatized by the events turning their home city of Las Vegas into a zombie-hellhole. You could argue that everybody on the crew has literally a death wish. But this whole rob the Casino thing is just the stage for the main plotlineThis movie is first and foremost a movie about the relationship between Dave Bautistas character and his daughter, played by Ella Purnell. And I have the feeling a lot of people are missing this when reviewing this movie: Zack Snyder himself was surely traumatized when his daughter took her live in 2017. So I was exactly zero surprised when a lot of this movie is about Bautista, who is completely estranged to his daughter and consumed bu self guilt neglecting her after escaping Las Vegas the first time. So I had the strong feeling in some way Snyder tries to cope with his loss doing this movie the way he did.So, at the end of the day this movie is about a father trying to reconnect with his daughter at the worst possible moment, brought together by the really stupid idea to steal from a Casino surrounded by 10.000s of Zombies.So if you like heist movies, zombie movies and movies about difficult Parent/Child-relationships, give this movie a try. Bonus: Zack Snyder knows how to shoot a movie and it shows. So even if you are not satisfied by every turn of the story, this movie was visually entertaining the whole time. The score as well as the soundtrack were good, too. All in all an enjoyable movie, would watch again because there is so much to see.",Army of the Dead

The review could stop right there, but it would pass the false impression it is not enjoyable; while it's great for grilling some juicy steaks, bringin' along your coldest beer and gathering with friends for some good ol' killin'-spree-enjoyable-shoot-&-run movie.The thing with Captain Black Jack is that, while he is a great director, he keeps falling into some really basic traps that, normally, he should be avoiding. Army of the Dead is no exception, since it's a highly enjoyable film with significant potential of a true blockbuster. See, after getting rid of the horrendous cliche of mindless brain-eating zombies, Jack dived into the wonderful aesthetic of the old Blade movies by enhancing his monsters with flexibility and moves that mostly remind me of those glorious days.Secondly, the super duper zombie is quite capable of inspiring more awe than any major villain on most zombie/vampire projects I have (personally) seen. The dude doesn't speak a word, but he doesn't have to, it is his appearance, his aura, and the interesting plot twist reminiscing of Blade and Alien that is both classic and guaranteed for decent bloody-fi movies.Action scenes are also great, captivating a lot of intensity in fast sequences and shady backgrounds. But the storyline is basic for the most part, especially since it could do better with some extra creativity (talking about the plot twist mentioned above), just like the characters needed some further development with some traces here and there. Just think abou it: when you gather a badass group in style reminiscing of Suicide Squad players, you oughta give them some room to let their skills out, no?All in all, it is not a movie to praise through the ages, but I had a great time watching it. And Dave Bautista was great once again, who remains a guaranteed choice for either action or comic roles.

They woukd be more concerned with getting ""cool shots"" and making ""sick edits"" rather than telling a competent story.Clearly Snyder read/skimmed Joseph Campbell at some point and mentioned it in the story...for what reason...I don't know.This entire film made me yearn for the Studio System where scripts are re-written a hundred times and pass through many hands before they're made. I love Zack but this film is a perfect example why you should stay in your lane and let writers write and directors direct. If you read Apologetics, the spectacle is the least important aspect of a story.I was excited to see everybody die in this film. The daughter was annoying and had no empathetic characteristics. Bautista kept talking about food and tofu as a weak attempt at some kind of through line. Dieter just disappeared and we don't know what happened to him.

It was shallow for no reason, and downright distracting once edited together with wide shots. Weeks later I discovered Zach shot this mostly by his own hand, with Canon photo lenses (roll eyes). Zach said it would be mean to try and give such a task to a regular camera man, so he held it himself (oh such an auteur). What he means is it's very difficult to keep focus when shooting shallow depth on dynamic action shots. He's totally right, but why bother unless it's fitting to the film? This is a running theme in the film: Let's do technical stuff that SEEMS awesome or LOOKS cool regardless of its contribution to the story. I mean, no one's watching this zombie flick and expecting Shakespeare, right?The plot starts rather simple, then unfolds into a boring cascade of differing genres, whilst characters die off - each one-upping the previous in heroism. There's some rom-com, some coming-of-age, black guy/white guy that learn to get along, a vault heist, MMA-fu fighting, pregnant lover lost tragedy (via Zombies no less), the pilot from Clear and Present Danger (1994) becomes a woman, and the list of boring cliches goes on.So, Hollywood has this thing where good characters usually live, but great characters usually die in the film. If they die in sacrifice, nothing beats that! Think Dennis Hopper in True Romance (1993). Well that paradigm is so overused now, it seems that actors want nothing more than to die heroically at some point in the movie, even if it requires a rewrite! I can imagine all 28 of the main actors in this film prior to signing on, telling their agents to make sure they die valiantly at some point. Instead of write, cast, shoot like every movie, I'm willing to bet this one was write, cast, rewrite, recast, rewrite, shoot. The deep pockets of Netflix, mixed with wanting to accommodate the great auteur Snyder, resulted in nearly every character getting a tailor-made death that they probably wrote themselves!Technology for CGI zombies, tigers, gorry deaths, etc. Are pretty well overdone. Again, the deep pocket culture on set was like: oh let's have a CGI cat kill the bad guy a la The Revenant (2015). Even the fact that it was done quite well, realistic as heck, and well deserved for our villain - it still somehow managed to suck. Sigh, clearly that whole sequence was meant to make the audience clap giddily for the ultra graphic death of the villain, but in my experience, we were like... MEH? He got his face bitten off... cool? Actually, no when you think about it. In Predator (1987) a graphic beheading occurs and it's quite unsettling, yet cool as heck. That was a better sequence from the damn 80's! SIGH!So, that's pretty much it. The film wants to be offensive in shock and gore, it wants to look cool with shallow depth, it wants you to like the main characters and hate the villain, but be somewhere in-between for the zombies themselves. It wants you to chuckle at the tongue-in-cheek comedy that actually isn't funny at all. It wants you to point at the screen and go whoa that was cool! But the 2 hours of movie that exists between a handful of obviously expensive scenes was a boring, crappy, inconsistent, unnecessarily confusing, overly predictable opus of trash, played out mostly in slow motion accompanied by contradicting music, which in itself is cliche enough to induce vomiting. I didn't watch the last 15 minutes because I tapped out. Those brave souls who actually finished watching this: um, did I miss anything? Didn't think so.",Army of the Dead

1783,cypeqj,A Zombie Heist that fails literally and in almost every other aspect.,4,2 June 2021,"I gave this movie a 4 because not everyone who made it did a bad job here, so let's be a little objective. Zombies look great, and cinematography is as expected from renown director. Sets and action are good as well but everything else... uh where to start. Being extremely brief, plot is bad, script predictable, and viewer leaves dumber than he came.Let's start with the beginning then. Movie opens up with a good 'outbreak setup' with great tension and action - 'serious tone'. Then it goes to city outbreak montage, which is funny, colorful and full of action that actually introduces few characters we'll see later on, cant forget big pink credits allover it. The weird thing is... this creates immediate expectation feeling that this will be light and funny take on a zombie movie. Right after that we see soilder who suffers from PTSD resulted from escape and fight in zombie infested city, and a sad story of survivors camped around ruins. For the next 20-30 minutes I've been seriously confused why is this movie serious when it opened up like that? After that bit of drama, heist movie plot begins with cheerful team assembly, I'm perplexed and more confused. What is this movie want to be?The answer is it wants to be a bad movie.Heist team assembly is like in every single heist movie you've seen, I was just waiting for lollypop ""You son of a b*tch I'm in"" line.Weirdly enough during that segment, nearly no one finds going on a suicidal mission too risky, everyone agrees straight up. Ever subsequent offer for a new team member comes with significantly less money, that seems to not add up at all to sum that was offered by sinister heist quest giver.I was thinking ok... this is kind of dumb, someone agrees to do god knows what in zombie filled city for 250k or 50k dollars, when they see the amount of money they have to take back out it will serve as a predictable point of conflict. No such luck.Nobody seems to care about money here. Not even the script writers, because they expected 10 people and 200 millions of cash fit inside a 6 seat chopper. Nobody cared to ask... it would be far more realistic if the sinister rich guy had some 'mysterious object' to recover from the vault, and said there should be about 50 millions cash in the safe that you can take. I'm not here to fix this horrid script though.Ulterior motives of the rich sinister quest giver guy are also extremely confusing because they are better suited for elite mercenary squad then rag tag band of 'heisters'. Since the heist team needed some muscle it made sense to offer them some small squad of mercenaries that would come with ulterior motive secret mission, nah there's one older guy and he's predictable pos and a coward.Well the movie is dumb I'm not going to talk about zombies... it's plainly idiotic what happens there, it's not a mysterious yet good type of story, it's not explained in anyway because the movie just wants to be dumb. The zombies need a reason to kill? That's a first.Just a horrid illogical full of predictable cliched outcomes script.That seems like without much effort could be done better, a lot better.This movie with runtime over 2 hours is guilty of feeling like complete waste of time.P. S. Don't forget the nerdy and weak safe cracker guy who could contend for 2nd place of best physique on the team. Dave Bautista is unmatched by most humans, he's from the muscle sapiens sapiens breed.",Army of the Dead

The daughter attempting to rescue one of her friends was just completely outlandish and took away from the storyline.

I just can't understand how some people had the guts to give a 10/10 rating for this movie. Maybe the quarantine messed up their mind so harshly they are ready to accept any movie thrown at their face as masterpieces now.So. Let's start by the story. Snyder has balls. Big ones. But not in the good sense of the term. He has the balls to not even try to hide he takes the viewers for being dumb and gullible. The story is full of incoherence and unexplained plot holes. Why ? For the sake of action scenes and ONLY for the sake of it ! One of the results ? This new Zombie Universe is VERY badly crafted and horribly uninteresting, as Snyder didn't take the time to write correctly its rules, stakes and time constraints.The Characters ? NO ONE. YES. No one is likable here. The humans ? Either you'll be completely indifferent to them, either you'll despise them ( especially Bautista's daughter ). It deeply break the balance of the movie, making it unappealing, as you cannot relate to at least a single human character. The zombies ? Never once you really feel they are more ""clever"" and organized than typical ones.In some video games, you have ""zombie classes"", so you can feel some kind of organization and strategies inside their group: The ""Tank"" zombie is very bulky and there for breaking doors, while the ""Scout"" is thin, patrolling or serving as first expandable defense, for example. Here ? NOTHING. You have the Alpha male, the Alpha Female, and the cool useless Zombie Tiger, basta. What is the point of telling us they are clever and organized if they never show it IN ACTION ? Another proof of the overall laziness of the script.The ambiance ? Snyder horribly tries to mix Sci-Fi with horror and adventure. And fails. The horror never delivers tension, The sci-fi part is so badly written you won't care ( Robot Zombies ? Time Travel Possibilities ? WTH ? ), and the adventure part is flat and boring. It's painfully indigestible.Well. Snyder is a visual director, they say. So, he saved at least the visuals, didn't he ? BIG FLAT NO. The CGI looks directly taken from PS3 cutscenes, the action scenes sport nothing visually memorable and you have all these badly cut and unfocused shots, ""à la Snyder"".Last but not least, the soundtrack. Bravo, Snyder. You are the VERY first director that made me hate ""Zombie"" from the Cranberries, a CLASSIC I actually really like. I really consider it as an achievement.To Sum Up: This movie is crap. Don't waste two hours ( and more ) of your life like I did.

Sadly it was not very engaging and I got the feeling of watching a movie, instead of actually being in the action with the characters; which is the true mark of a good story. Most of the character's were convincing, but Ella Purnell's character did not quite belong there.

Its not it's some escapist fun around a group of people taking on a bat shizzle crazy mission. In fairness the way it plays out seems like the most realistic results.Looking at Predator for instance some of the most terrible acting and cheese on film, and yes it was the 80's but there isn't many people who would argue it isn't a classic.This film has you feeling for the characters and while it still uses a muscle bound ex wrestler as the front man he acts well.There are cliche characters and you can probably guess who will die first, but that is fairly standard. It was only early GOT which subverted those expectations and still buckled by the end.Watch this movie for what it is was meant to be. If it was realistic it would have ended in the first 10 minutes with Batista telling the guy where to stick his mission.The film could have been shorter, but it's Zak Snyder and it comes with the territory.I watched Kong Vs Godzilla recently and that fell far below what I'd see as acceptable tolerances of realism in a film with a concept so ridiculously fictional.

No because it isn't a time loop. Eventually they all die, they have no money and all was for nothing. The zombies are dead and nothing great actually happened.

In addition to the most creative repertoire of kills seen in the genre, although it is not a film that I consider ""horror"", it is more a mix of zombie film more focused on action with touches of Ocean's Eleven.In every shot, you can perceive Zack Snyder's imprint without having the epic scale of his last three films, and in the final scene I thought the use of Cranberries' ""Zombie"" theme song was a fabulous ending.Highly recommended.",Army of the Dead

This movie spent dozens of millions to essentially make the idea of what an beginning filmmaker would produce if they had access to unlimited funds.It's not horrible, but it's bad enough to give a less than 5 star review. I'd say equivalent to getting a soup you love, and the only real good comment you can say about it was that it contained some of the ingredients you like and it was warm.The daughter of the hero was meh, Dave Bautista was meh, and I'm about to go off on Tig Notaro. They (according to the press) spent more than a million to digitally add Tig into the film to replace a Chris D'ella after he had some allegations about him. Don't know him, don't care, but Tig sucked past the first 4 minutes of her acting entrance. Judging from the script I doubt Chris whatsisname could have done better. She had a good intro followed by the rest of the film as someone who literally had no dimension other than ""I just read my lines off this piece of paper and have an unemotional face."" Either way, adding a mill or two to the cost was not worth it by far.Essentially this move added nothing to the zombie genre, the actors either did a bad job or weren't given a good script, and the ending was predictable and definitely not as cool as it could have been (The ending having multiple possible outcomes, the director led to one of the more sad, predictable ones}.",Army of the Dead

So why would you watch this? I can only think of one reason. But first, how to do it.1) Don't read any more reviews.2) Watch the movie, start counting how many things are wrong with the plot/writing, feel some outrage, lose count of the goofs, stop caring.3) Come back here and read other users' reviews, especially the ones which enumerate the absurdities in the movie (for example, the one titled ""Things we learned from Army of the Dead""). Have a couple of decent laughs. If you had a first laugh, keep reading. It gets better, since you'll find more and more F-ups you hadn't noticed before. But don't hate yourself for not having noticed all the goofs; it was a natural, self-defensive reaction of your brain to go into some kind of drowsy mode.Oh, the reason?

1862,jaredtonsfeldt,It.... just works. Plain and simple.,8,15 May 2021,"It's got a basic 3 act structure with a prologue and epilogue, similar to most movie's out there. The prologue is fantastic, chilling and darkly funny. Then the first act is... bloated, to say the least. Zack Snyder movies aren't known for great scripts but the dialogue in this section as we get to know our team in the basic generic heist setup can be pretty atrocious, and it's at this point in the movie that the pacing sucks. That being said, it is necessary, obviously, to get to know your team in a heist movie, so you power through. But when the heist begins in the second act, this is where it just clicks. The chills and thrills and dark humor from the opening sequence come back and it's phenomenal. Add in Snyder's trademark action and melodrama and you're invested, and it just doubles down on that when you get to the climactic third act. It also managed to add in some heart in the climax as well. The music, and I mean both the song selection and JunkieXL's score, is on point, the action is great, the kills and gore are gnarly, and I don't think it's a stretch to say that this is Dave Bautista's best performance: he's not just a source of machismo, he brings the heart and soul. Overall, the bloated first act and the dialogue hold it back from being as good as other Snyder films, but it's blast and just works so well as a smart new entry in an over saturated genre.",Army of the Dead
1863,ryanbailey-42227,Fresh concept with anti-climatic story,7,24 May 2021,"This film started off pretty good, even though it took some time to get going. However, we found it quite empty when fulfilling the plot; I think if they got rid of the planning part of the heist and spent more time developing the storyline and characters, it could've been a better movie, as we would have felt more connected to them as a whole.Also, having most of the characters die and not completing the story arc, gave it an unfulfilled feeling; the main reason Kate went into Vegas was to save Geeta and it left me unsatisfied that she wasn't even mentioned in the end. When most plot devices are thrown away, it can leave you unhappy with the story.Overall, this is a great action packed, humour inducing, action thriller that has some great set ups for a prequel and sequel, that leave you scratching your head and wanting more. It is definitely not worth less than a seven in my opinion - where it lacks in story, it is supported by everything else.",Army of the Dead

The director spends millions on scanning Las Vegas for adding it as CG in certain shots but then forgets how to create realistic gunshots and explosions. There's a car explosion early on that appeared to have zero effect on the zombies and people extremely close to it. Probably because it was an afterthought added in post production for cheap. Did I laugh at any of the jokes? Yes, but a few laughs doesn't make for a good movie. Also there is supposed to 96 million dollars in the vault. Nobody realizes we can't move that much actual cash on foot or in a small helicopter it will weigh too much. 1 Million dollars in $100's weighs 22 pounds. Times that by 96 is 2112 pounds. Helicopter pilots always weigh the cargo and people to know if their going to be over their flying weight limit.

It's as if the film was shot with the lowest F-stop giving about a 1mm of depth to the focus. Some shots literally have two things in focus at different distances and everything in between is blurry as heck. Sadly our eyes don't see like that and it makes for hard viewing.There are some real cringe scenes that are totally unnecessary and make little sense. For example the scene in the warehouse where they unveil the casino in a ta-da moment is dumb.There are so many lazy moments of convenience that are totally inexcusable, I was half expecting the characters to say, 'well that's a stroke of luck' around every corner.Also how people react is also unbelievable. The soldiers at the start who casually watches and doesn't struggle as his jaw is being ripped off was just poor.This film is nearly two and a half hours long and doesn't deserve to be, or deserve the budget.So many amazing scripts out there by unknown writers and this is what Netflix is choosing to make.",Army of the Dead

1896,alexxanderrdarth,"Big hopes, big disappointment",4,25 May 2021,"I am a very big fan of the zombie genre and I always enjoyed movies or tv shows of zombies, no matter how corny or bad it was, but this one takes the cake.The zombie productions usually rely most of their charm on tense scenes, while in Army of the Dead I only felt that in the scene where they had to crawl between ""hibernating zombies"" (also, who thought hibernating zombies would be a good idea? Hibernation? Really?).Army of the Dead has Suicide Squad vibes all over it, though this movie failed to keep my attention most of the time.The story of the virus/pleague/possession that turns people into zombies is not developed nor explained at all, as the concept of Alpha Zombie is not usually met in most zombie productions, so I think that it would've been reasonable for the public to understand the origin more.Despite the movie being over 2 hours long, the characters have very little development and, unfortunately, the main protagonist of the story is Kate. The only information we have about her is that she's Scott's daughter and she's a volunteer for the survivors from the camp. Despite all of this, 60% of the plot is affected by the fact that she insists to find a survivor that voluntarily left the camp in order to find money in the city. No matter how true and pure your heart may be, I don't think anyone would risk the fate of such a group of people for looking for a total stranger in the middle of the apocalypse.The mole sub-plot was expected, but I don't see the logic of Tanaka's plan to introduce a mole in a mercenary team that is preparing for a heist just to look for an alpha zombie, whereas you can hire a squad to do exactly this job with a much higher rate of success. Tanaka's plan is based on pure luck of his mole encountering an alpha zombie while the whole team is struggling against a horde of zombies.The alpha zombie queen being pregnant is also a thing I did not understand, but this is an issue raised by the lack of information of the virus or possession or whatever they label it. Though, being dead, I can't wrap my head around the concept of two zombies having intercourse and they successfully manage to impregnate the egg... This is just another ""wtf"" moment.Two other aspects that blew it for me was the planes crash and the survival of Vanderohe.It's inexplicable how the plane didn't explode upon such a landing. What is more mind-blowing is how Kate managed to survive the crash with superficial injuries, when she was not even strapped with a belt. Realistically, she would have been thrown outside or ripped to shreds. Meanwhile, Geeta, the survivor she was looking for, completely disappears after she gets on the plane.When it comes to Vanderohe, just remember that if a nuke hits your city, just hide inside a safe and then you can get out like nothing happened because... Logic?Zack Snyder didn't do a good job with this after the Justice League remake.",Army of the Dead

It is a pretty long film (almost 2.5 hours) but I didn't feel at any point it was dragging on. They could have used the time more efficiently though - a proper backstory for the main characters and an ending that wraps up the story properly. What you are left with is an action heist spin on a zombie film but no real connection with any of the characters.I wouldn't say this is a spoiler because I don't think anyone watching a zombie film expects no one to be killed off, but when any of the characters do get killed, you don't have any sympathy because no time was spent getting to know them.If you have 2.5 hours to kill and your brain is having a day off, there are worst films out there.",Army of the Dead

She could easily tell about the security guy who screwed her up, but the dramatic stare down was more important apparently.2. At the ending part, instead of jumping immediately on the chopper and leave, they decide to stare at each other untill the zombies comes. Like wow.3. Geetah could easily jump on the chopper, but it is cooler to sacrifice yourself.4. The german kid could also lock himself up with Van, but again, sacrificing yourself when not needed is cooler.5. At the end, the daughter doesn't even care about the women she 'saved'.6. The women confessing her love was so cringe and misplaced. What's also misplaced is how they froze up before the elevator. Like, dude.. you're an experienced zombie killer in a smart zombie town. Come on!7. I might be wrong about this, but is it possible to survive the aftermath of the nuke so easy? Won't the effect of the nuke still kill you. The guy just takes a stroll back to home.8.

Basic plot and bland dialogue lend well to the 'pointless' vibe the movie emanates.

The CGI on this, especially on the tiger Valentine, is amazing. The plot has a lot of holes in it, really. Like for instance, the guy who was on a secret mission didn't need to kill the first girl who died. Kate trying to save Geeta and compromising the mission was obviously a give even before it happened.

Enjoy.",Army of the Dead
1930,waynewashington,Not the worst Zombie movie but not the best,5,23 May 2021,"This movie does have a really good concept for Zombies with the whole alpha zombies and scramblers. Reminded me of 'I am Legend' a little bit. I was caught off guard by a couple of unexpected character deaths and the zombie action was pretty decent. The German safe-cracker and Vanderohe's chemistry was on point too. That's everything I can say that is good.The movie follows heist and zombie survivor character cliches but nothing much is done execution wise to make it feel fresh. The worst character is Batista's daughter and it's a shame she survived the whole movie. What makes her character bad is the actress portraying her as annoying at times and her motivation is a bit inconsistent. For example, the daughter's motivation for going on the heist with Batista is to get a mother of children the daughter babysits at a survivor camp. The mother's name is Geeta. The daughter constantly reminds Batista that they need to Geeta. But at the same time the daughter is having some daddy issues with Batista and it gets in the way with the daughter's motivation. So much so that when they finally rescue Geeta, she is one of the final people to die in a helicopter crash. You would think the daughter's first reaction would be to check on Geeta since she was the prime motivation in the first place. Nope. Not a single mention. The daughter of course has a heart to heart with her dad Batista before he dies. It was a sweet moment but I was heavily distracted by the fact that Geeta was neither mentioned nor checked up on by the daughter.Certain aspects that bothered me was the lack of tension, time management, and pacing issues throughout the movie. Especially when a timed nuclear bomb, set to go off at the casino, got pushed from one day to one hour. Every character was not acting like they were in a rush and just played it off like they didn't care. I was surprised not one character freaked out. They even wasted time when characters stopped what they were doing to have conversations. I was like ""There's a nuke about to go off in less than a hour. Why are you stopping to talk to each other?"" Also 1 hour suddenly went down to 20 mins and at one point they had 9 minutes left. Again with 9 minutes left no one was acting like they were in a rush. If the characters don't emote that they care then that makes me don't care for them and the movie's situation.Overall, this movie would've been better had they gone full blown tongue and cheek like the Evil Dead movies. The whole concept is more suited for a video game. But other than that you're not missing out on anything groundbreaking from director Zack Snyder on this recent picture of his.",Army of the Dead

I loved that it was set in Las Vegas, it was a refreshing choice for setting and I just wish they'd played up the Vegas campiness a bit more. I do agree with other reviewers, the character of the daughter is the absolute worst. Her storyline could have been omitted altogether which would have allowed deeper focus on some of the other characters. Tig Notaro was a quirky, out of the blue casting choice and her character was easily my favorite. Overall, yes, this movie has many, many plot holes. But, I went into this movie expecting a mindless action movie about zombies and that's exactly what I got. The soundtrack is phenomenal and was part of why I rated this movie so highly.

Zombie movies are very common but he showed something different as an alpha lost a child and started fighting for it. There is always a story behind how the alpha was created as he was being carried on truck guarded by the military.

Close-up has its purpose. It should be used scarcely.

We have Vasquez's badass female Rambo scene, to Burke's I locked the door on you so I don't get eaten scene, and the empty flight pad where the pilot takes off scene only to come back for the rescue scene, and the going back for the kid into the alien stronghold scene.There are others, but if you re-watch Aliens before seeing this you will be surprised how many cut n paste scenes there are.Not that there's anything wrong with recreating good content, but this is blatant.",Army of the Dead

1982,lawrence-mahmood,Release a Snyder Cut!,3,24 May 2021,"I couod be convinced that Zack Snyder maybe directed the first few minutes of the film. Maybe. But I'm not sure he had much to do with the rest of it. It's not well shot or directed, there's no tension or excitement, there are none of his usual directorial flairs/clichés (excessive slot mo, etc.) and the film doesn't feel finished. Parts of some of the scenes look like rehearsal footage. Everything about the film, including the action, is completely flat and unengaging. I like Dave Bautista and one or two of the other actors, but apart from a few mildly funny lines they aren't given much to do except pull off endless impossible Zombie killing headshots. It's like watching a zombie shoot 'em up game, but without the thrills.Every single plot point is utterly predictable, so there's no spoiling the plot. If you've seen Aliens, you know every story beat, even if they are spread around multiple characters rather than just Ripley. There are even faux Vasquez and Gorman lookalikes, and several lines of dialogue lifted wholesale from the script of Aliens. Overall, is too long, unconvincing, unengaging, clichéd, occasionally boring, but ok for passing a couple of hours if you like zombie films. It's not the worst film with Snyder's name attached, because nothing is as bad as Suckerpunch, but it's pretty low on the list.

If you look at it with a general view, the dynamic among the scrappy band of misfits makes for an interesting team and that's good enough to keep up your attention.I liked the pace and the sustained tension all throughout.

Maybe it's the zombie virus, as the leader had loads, but I was expecting some sci-fi twist as it looked like electrical discharge (and sounded like it).

2025,masterbadger,A watchable but disapointing entry for Snyder,5,15 June 2021,"Oof. I went into this with reasonably high hopes. Dawn of the Dead (2004) is one of my favorite zombie films. That is a fairly solid mesh of Zach Snyder's directing with James Gunn's writing. Army of the Dead is a pure Snyder project and it is clear that he simply does not have the writing chops for a project like this.The film does start reasonably promising, with the fall of Vegas actually being fairly well done an compelling. THIS is the film I wish we had gotten, but after this promising introduction we transition to the main heist story. It is best to not really spend too much time thinking about it, because Snyder really didn't.At a 2hr30min runtime you would expect some fairly decent character development and world building. There is some talent in the cast, but there is only so much you can wring from one-dimensional character writing. Batista's is the best developed and the big guy delivers a solid performance with what he is given. You probably could have trimmed the whole daughter subplot and lost absolutely nothing.You can sprinkle in a little dense 'social commentary' with the occasional spectacle and you have Army of the Dead. An excellent opportunity that was sadly missed. I was never bored though, so I guess that is something. The film strongly sets up a sequel, but it is hard to really be too excited given this entry.",Army of the Dead

The daughter tagged along with her unbearable attitude to find another stupid character who would rather go into the zombie kingdom for 5 grand and leave her children, without realising that the chance of surviving is below 10%!!!!

They make more sense to me because newly turned zombies would have fresh muscles.This is the exact end of the spectrum.

2031,spydruler,Leader of the dead.,4,5 June 2021,"The makers of this movie spend 2.5 hours to prove that Dave Bautista's character is the worst mission leader in all of cinema.He puts an entire team together to retrieve cash from a zombie infected zone. Literally none of the team members survive the mission. And the only person who survives from the team - his daughter - is someone he didn't even select for the mission in the first place.At one point he decided to abandon the mission to go look for his daughter. And his closest friend on the team decided to follow him into this side quest. So, for the second time in the movie, he lets a young lady follow him into further danger just because he is too nice to say no. And that's not all. After thanking her, he conveniently lets her lead the way into an elevator full of zombies and watches as the sweet lady's head gets twisted like a soda bottle cap. Chivalry isn't dead.But what about the mission? Did he at least accomplish what he was being paid to do? No. He came back without the cash. He brought back a handful of dollars, not even enough to break even on the mission. And oh by the way, he failed to realize that the cash wasn't even the real motive behind the mission.What's more? He nearly flew the king of the zombies to safety, outside the nuclear kill zone. Thereby nearly dooming all of humanity.Lost the cash. Lost the team. Lost his life. Meanwhile, his daughter also failed her mission of protecting some random woman. That's one father-daughter duo that cannot be trusted with missions.4 stars for an incredible action sequence involving a valiant fight till death by a woman on the team. She fought more valiantly than the entire team he put together, including himself.",Army of the Dead
2032,megsthomo,Plot Hole after Plot Hole,3,25 May 2021,"This movie had a lot of potential. I was intrigued with the different take on the undead and the visuals really are great at times. There are just too many plot holes! Great CGI and action sequences don't deter from the story line being questionable.The most irritating part of the entire movie was the end. This was the point where my review went from about a 6 to a 3. Kate's entire goal was to find Geeta. She breaks from the group and this ultimately causes the death of her father Dave and Marianne (the helicopter pilot). Once Geeta is found and the helicopter crashes she is never seen again? We didn't even see if she survived. For a story line that drove one of the main characters it is just never resolved and if you're going to sit through a 2 and a half hour movie it's just so annoying when loose ends aren't tied up.When Dave is bitten he's turned within what seems minutes. When Vanderohe is bitten he managed to stay human while he hides out in a safe, walks however far to escape, drives to an airport, hires a plane and even manages to have a glass of champagne before being affected at all. I do understand I am watching a movie about zombies/alien creatures but there is just no consistency.A lot of time and money wasted on creating this. I just wish they had spent more time combing through the plot and the script before they started production. The ending also sets up a sequel which I won't be rushing to see.",Army of the Dead
2033,anorexicpickle,Can somebody please turn on the lights?,2,31 May 2021,"So, this movie is worse than I expected. First of all, dialogues are so bad that they're just feels like translated from another language poorly. Or like it's written for the final exam to just pass the class and nothing else matters. Writing is bad, directing is bad, acting is average and cinematography is bad. The plot is promising but that is all i can say positive about this movie-ish thing. So many things are out of logic in this writing that you almost feel like Zack Synder is messing up with you.There is so many points that I just want to point out. Is that daughter really needed for the story? She is only here to put the team in danger just to save a woman we don't told why is she important for her in 148 minutes, and don't saving her at the end. Really? But by far the sharpest ones are; first, how can you be so dumb to need a safecracker to open your very own safe? Second, let's say you did. You have to be dumb to take part in Synderverse after all. When the safecracker (the guy who needs to open the safe, the only guy in the team that can open this safe, who's only aim is to open the goddamn safe) opens the safe, everybody celebrates like it's an unexpected thing to do. Bro, you're here to open this safe. What the heck? And how the alpha's who are techincally dead, can breed each other? How can you get hard when you have no blood pressure? Why do I bother asking? All of this happened because someone get hard! Not seeking logical explanations about this screenplay anymore.So, in conclusion, what i learned from this movie is one of my biggest fantasies can lead to zombie apocalypse and i really don't know if i should be happy or sad. Don't watch it if you have only time for one movie. Watch it when you you're in the mood of don't respecting yourself. If 2020 was a movie, it would pretty much look like this one.",Army of the Dead
2034,ctimmons-20908,Lacking Style and Substance,5,27 May 2021,"Between Snyder and Bautista, I had decent expectations for this movie. After all, I really like Snyder's Dawn of the Dead. However, despite a promising trailer, Army of the Dead offers nothing new to the genre and doesn't even offer much excitement in the unnecessary 2.5 hour run. It was made to seem that this was some elite team put together for the heist, yet most of the characters seem pretty useless and make annoyingly stupid decisions. It's also amazing how seemingly unprepared they all were for once they got into Vegas. I thought this movie would at least have some stylistic action, as it was clearly lacking in substance, but most of the action was just cheesy (and not in the good, fun way).I won't even get into the plot holes, basic logic/physics and other similar issues, because I didn't go into this movie with high standards on those factors. But as others have said, a lot of things just don't make sense with this movie.The trailer and the opening credits were probably the most entertaining part about this movie.

2038,dlynch-58005,Just plain Frustrating,6,24 May 2021,I was very excited for this movie because i loved Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and this movie seemed to be so crazy that it might have worked. I won't say that it doesn't work but i won't say that it does because this movie is very infuriating in its execution.I am completely fine when movies are able to make the tough decisions and kill their characters but when literally every character but 1 is dead at the end of the movie it leaves a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. The only reason why it does is because this movie was completely marketed as an action comedy with some horror elements but not only was it not that funny with its jokes but it gets way too serious at points when i thought i should have been laughing at the drama. I love Dave Bautista he seems like such a nice guy but he just cannot play drama that well which is what was needed from his character.I am being harsh because to be honest the action was great and i really did like a bunch of the characters until they make stupid decisions and die but up until the last 45 minutes i truly did like this movie a lot. I completely will watch this movie again in a month or two because i want to see if i just had my hopes too high and they couldn't be met but as of right now i don't hate the movie but i have many problems with it that just shouldn't piss me off this much when it's a movie about people having a heist in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.,Army of the Dead

It also had some quite memorable Zombiefied animals (a horse and tiger) and I love a well animated animal coz it aint done too often.I went in with a sigh seeing the 2hours and 28minute runtime, but believe me, it isn't one of those films stuffed with fillers, every minute is well used by the talented team. Dave Bautista was also surprisingly good, coz I hadn't previously seen him as a great actor, but he held the role up pretty well. The rest of the cast was also excellent save for a few stereotype tropes, but this is Hollywood and a Snyder movie, you get what you ask for and more. In a genre that is ultimately oversaturated with copy pastes, this manages to feel new, and I'm looking forward to the prequels and spinoffs.First time I've given a Netflix movie five stars, but if ever this is the best time to start.Disclaimer: watch with caution if gore and gratuitous violence is not your thing, coz this movie is pushing the boundaries for the genre.",Army of the Dead

Again, I appreciate there was more to it than her just being upset by him killing the mother but it just seems like she's being childish overall and it's nothing to do with what he done, maybe next time he can just let the zombie mum free roam for the banter?Due to her chasing after a character that we literally do not care about in the slightest constantly, it allows his possible new lover to have her neck snapped as they were about to go looking for her, the vault breaker sacrificed himself, this could have been easier if the woman did not die as therefore they'd have more man power, and eventually due to the numbers decreasing everyone else more or less dies, the pilot was semi funny but what a waste...literally spends hours trying to fix the helicopter just to be impaled by a blade and nothing else is actioned on...So many ideas just wasted too, we see this big commotion around this Saw weapon yet it's used once...to cut through a wall, brilliant. When the first woman dies. She literally John wicks at least 100 dead on her own in a confined space of about 5 ft yet when she jumps through he window she's taken down by 4 zombies which she could easily defeat and her friend literally watches her struggle for about 5 minutes, also I don't understand why she didn't tell him that the undercover bad guy betrayed her and misled her path and locked her in? They literally engaged in convo for about 50 seconds she couldn't easily have told him? What happens to the main villain who orchestrated the entire thing?? He literally just carries on as normal whilst everyone else died. What even happened to the woman his daughter was trying to save? Lara or whatever? They crashed the helicopter and we never see her again? They literally ended the film with the worst character surviving, no money other than some bloodied bank notes from his back pocket and the girl she risked literally EVERYTHING for has done a runner? Also at what point did the character at the end get bit? I'm sorry but if he survived a nuke in a bank vault (Crystal Skull anyone?) surely no zombie would have penetrated it so at what point did he get bit? Why did Dave also spend so long at the end looking at his daughter in a helicopter before boarding the bloody thing? God knows.Overall I think this is a rant other a review but I enjoyed it none the less it just felt like it may be rushed and plot points kept falling through.",Army of the Dead

The trailer is very misleading. Going into this movie I was expecting something like 2009 Zombieland. Something with good action, comedy, horror, gore and fun characters. This film is not like that. It's way to serious, bleak, unfunny with mostly cliche wooden and boring characters. There were two or three good action scenes and a few characters I liked but they aren't enough for me to recommend this movie.

The premise on a Zombie Heist in itself in brilliant, but is also helped by an unìque take on the zombies with added competancy.To start things of, the movie is marketed to be somethung it is not, by choice or mustake. However it is truly unique and very well directed.The story goes for style over substance but the stylish psrts are amazing. They range from impeccable humour to excellent suspense. Zack Synder flexes his amazing skill as a movie director usung all the modern instruments to their atmost brilliance.The photograhy is on point and is clear about it's messages. The acting performances are purely sensational wit malleable characters as well. Little was left to be desired from the set desugn and actors.However, the overall story lacked a direction or idea. It felt like an attempted Tarantino in parts but was in complete disconnect with everything else. For the parts it did well, the story felt extremely on point and brilliant butsuch parts were few and far apart.All in all, the movie is definitely an unique experience not to miss out on, but I am sure more is expected from such talented cast and crew. Alot of elements are purely sensational and would definitely recommend watching it.",Army of the Dead

The movie was not that trailer, but good in parts. The team gets betrayed and, as typical in a zombie flick, get taken down, one by one.

Extremely uninteresting characters whom you have absolutely no warmness to. Other than Dave B the main protagonist, you could not care who dies - especially the daughter...

There is an element of intent which is obviously lost on some people.And a younger audience definitely won't enjoy the slower pacing of the first hour.Also, the horror elements needed to be toned up slightly.Turn your brain off and enjoy.

No. Was it Train to Busan? No. But what it is, is a zombie action movie that takes the genre down a different tangent, where all the zombies actually do get contained in one area: Las Vegas. Then there are ""alpha"" zombies and the more common ""shamblers,"" so what you have is a segment of zombies that move like the World War Z zombies (as an aside: read the book, it is way better) and a large mass of common zombies. My first thought when they re-entered Las Vegas was that it looked very much like a video game, which works well for me, given the focus on action. I won't lie to you and tell you that the movie doesn't have plot holes but...who cares? Picking it apart for that would be like going to McDonad's and complaining that the Big Mac doesn't use 100% organic beef and that they don't offer a gluten free version.

2122,spoonman-33022,"This is NOT a Zombie Film! Stop trying to ""reinvent"" the genre!",2,21 May 2021,"Gonna pull the semantics card out of the gate and state that this is not a Zombie movie. Snyder and the writers wanted to push the envelope on *what* a Zombie is; what they ended up creating is a flesh-eating mutant horde. After a while, with directors and writers playing fast and loose with the definition over the years it leads to confusing portrayals like this that folks just kind of accept over time. Hear me out: you have some sort of evolutionary hierarchy (""Alphas"", ""Shamblers""/Drones), they're able to communicate with each other, they can establish habitats and work within set borders, they can fight back effectively and anticipate enemy reactions to even dodge bullets (?!?), they can hibernate (?!?), they can ride horses, they expect tribute when entering their ""area"", they're able to establish relationships, they display emotions, they take prisoners, they have ritualistic-style gatherings, hell they're even able to frickin' reproduce! Zombies are simply reanimated corpses that feed on human flesh, through this desire they can spread their disease/curse that in turn creates more zombies-there could be a very long argument about how fast zombies should move, but that's more or less it!*Deep breath*As for the movie itself, it started out great but lost its way very quickly and once the mission started it got REALLY boring REALLY fast. I got all the way to the part where the tagalong daughter character ended up doing the ONE thing she swore she wouldn't do with the predictable results of putting everyone's lives in needless danger. After this point I just skipped ahead to see how it ultimately turned out and wasn't really impressed.To be fair this movie seems to have gone through several levels of production hell giving me the impression that the studio suits just wanted to try and make as much of their investment back as they could by pushing what they had out the door and onto Netflix. Dunno if many folks know this but Tig Notaro was edited in after the fact because Chris D'Elia had shot all of his scenes and was then booted for supposedly harassing underage girls. According to reports she still hasn't met Dave Bautista in person, haha!. I point this out as it seems a lot of folks had issue with her acting. I'm giving her a pass, blame the editing.Kind of sad considering the setup was solid (first star) and they even had a Mutant/Possibe Zombie(?) Tiger (second star).",Army of the Dead

I couldn't wait to see it and the first couple of minutes were really promising....even a bit further on I was still intrigued.Unfortunately the movie regresses in too many ""meh"" choices on charachters and storyline...but what really got to me was the blatant ""borrowing"" from the movie Aliens.....I won't count, but on the age, the automatic weapons with grenade launchers...The saw to open the wall, and kick it open, used the same sounds, and was overall similar.The traitor bringing the head and locking them out (burke closing the door anyone?)
The helicopter leaving, going back, waiting on a platf...eehh...the roof...and not being there because it was getting too dicy, but of course coming back on time..
The queen getting onboard.....sorry, king getting onboard.There's more, but I think the picture is clear...I am just overall disappointed. I was looking forward to the movie, love Snyder and Bautista is also on my list of people to follow.It does have some good things, Dieter for the comical note is good, Bautista is really doing his best...it's just too many stories that are too superficial and too soapie to really be impactful...and actually are a bit annoying.Overall, you can watch it and not have wasted your time, but you won't finish it and feel fullfilled....",Army of the Dead

Overall a fun movie though, definitely worth a watch with popcorn and candy a Friday night! I liked Bautista in the role. The guy isn't a great actor, but I love his ""Rambo roles"" he is a great stuntman, and got the looks of a real super hero, but he requires a good supporting cast, I don't think he got it here.

I m only giving this 2 stars due to the 2 well done action scenes that are in this movie. The first one with the Vasquez from Aliens rip off fighting her way thru zombies in the kitchen bit and the end sequence in the casino with Dave Bautista blasting away at zombies and slot machines. Those are fun and there should have been more of those scenes throughout the movie. The rest of this movie sucked. Why is Zack Snyder so obsessed with nihilism and tragedy? Does he not know how to have fun? Why is it so long with absolutely no payoff? This is a premise that should have been a home run full of campy humor and over the top action. Instead it s dark and depressing where everyone dies except Bautistas whiny unlikeable daughter. Snyder should have taken a page from Deep Rising to see how to do a great and highly entertaining casino heist action horror movie. Also the cinematography blows and makes it look like a bigger budgeted SYFY channel flick. I m done with Snyder I m never watching anymore of his films. Zombie movies also need to go away as well. Bring back vampires and werewolves.",Army of the Dead
2145,joshuamellettediaz-82814,Shockingly Bad,1,21 May 2021,"As an Art Center College of Design Alumni myself like Zack this critique is truthful.If the Walking Dead's first two seasons were an eleven on the scale of awesome rich character development this is a one. I can't say zero stars because I did enjoy the convoy scene and was legitimately excited thinking this was going to be the best movie I had seen in a long time. Boy was I wrong. Post convoy scene where the hell Marine character from 1990's DOOM has broken out of the animated world and is now a whatchyamecallit something HULK monster I quickly lost my enthusiasm and what a bad show it nose dived to be.There is literally ZERO character development to the point you care about NONE of these characters. You only want them to die because all you can think about is how WOKE they must be to have gotten their roles. Nothing pays off. If you are going to make a heist movie have the decency to at minimum be aware of Michael Mann's work and attempt to compete. Movies, their depth and the mirror they hold on the human condition tells the state of a culture. Our culture is dead and lifeless like the characters in this movie that might as well have been mannequins moving and making less than cliche grunting noises with their mouths.This movie sucks.I rarely write reviews if ever, but when it is with a genre and sometimes great director like Zach Snyder I get really upset because it is a massive missed opportunity where the rest of us who are still self actualizing working toward getting our own stories out there are asking WTF? You had a hundred plus million dollars to make the best Zombie movie ever made when you really made the worst.The last time I was this pissed I wrote a review for Kingdom of The Crystal Skull that was never accepted because of course language.This is not only a failure in delivering on a promise it is a fantastic waste of money and resources that would have been much better suited in my hands.@joshdiaz777 (Instagram)",Army of the Dead

2148,weatheringawaywithrain,A Zombie Renaissance - this film has more to it,9,21 May 2021,"Avant-garde director Zack Snyder once again brings a fresh feel to the walking deadHis new filming style with a shallow depth of field , doesn't take you out of it , you see what you need to see , what the director wants you to see , it has an intentional claustrophobic effectThe cinematography , the visuals , we already know what we're in for , I have almost 100 screenshots from this filmThese zombies , aren't your typical zombies , the alpha , Zeus , is like a super soldier , can think , can track , isn't just mindlessly animalistic , there's so much more to him and them and the film establishes that throughoutSomething I saw another reviewer pointed out about those 2 remaining soldiers in the beginning - they clearly drove into a ditch , they couldn't just drive awayZack embraces a number of tropes like one of them thinking they're in the clear and the other saying they're absolutely notThe following montage of the fall of Las Vegas , I could easily write a whole essay about itI wouldn't yet compare it to Zack's 'Watchmen' or say that it's better , 'Watchmen' is an IP that's much more familiar and accessible to audiencesFor now , I'd say that it makes me think of the opening sequence of 'True Blood' , both give off similar vibesThis Las Vegas opening sets up so much , from the world , to the class of the zombies , to some of our main characters , it's so well-made for how the music matches up with what you see if you look and listen closelyThe opening is very much self-aware , one thing I've seen some reviewers nitpick is why the military would parachute into the area , guess those reviewers weren't actually looking or listening , because if you do , it's easy to see how meta the opening is and put together that the military was on like a suicide squad mission and were way in over their headsLike I've said , there's so much to take apart in this opening , what needs to be mentioned in this review is how you really feel for that mom and her child , and how brave that child was to willingly run towards her and die with her , I've watched the opening several times now and it still gets to meIn going into this movie , you'll try to be that person who tries to find some fault or lack of logic , but majority of those times the film does give you your answers of the why of it all , again , if you're really looking and listeningThere's more than meets the eyeLike Zack has been saying in interviews , this film can be looked at through the lens of political , or you just having a good timeDave gives such a stellar performance , like how this film has more to it , he has more to it as an actorHis character , Scott , and Kate's theme , is truly something soul-stirring , Junkie XL goes all inScott's haunted by his past and just wants to make things right with his daughterWe start to gather the crew , the reshoots with Tig is seamless , if you didn't know before , you wouldn't even be able to tellEvery character on this team has their moment to shine where you either care about them or hate themLots of twists and turns that you won't expect , and unless you're a zombie purist , this film is not for youYou really do feel for this army of zombies , they just wanted to be left alone in their kingdomThere's all the action and thrill and suspense you expect , and nobody's safe , Samantha Win's character has one of the best sequencesThere's a cyclical nature to the film , like the cycle of life: birth , death , rebirth , from how they were others that Bly sent into Las Vegas to how the zombie apocalypse starts off again at the end of the filmBly , and the government , have been scheming , and we're most likely to learn more about this in the anime prequel series and why they want to capitalize on zombiesThe 'Coyote' , Lily , is such a standout character and I could easily see her being almost everyone's favoriteClever and funny usage of the zombies to get to the safeA lot of the film's humor feels natural , but because it isn't in your face like most action movies , it might go over some people's heads , and most of the humor comes from Dieter , who is very likeable , excited to see his prequel filmThe only flaws I could see in the film's narrative is why Bly didn't just give them the code for the safe , though then again , for him , it was never about the moneyThe other flaw I see is how the crew conveniently were watching the news and get updated on the nuke's new launch time , and so the end beginsThroughout the film , it's remarkable how much I cared about Zeus and how he just wanted to be left alone with his 'wife' and 'family'However , like I've said , if you're a zombie purist , I don't see you taking well to the idea of a zombie baby even though it's been set up cleverly if you're looking closelyAgain , like I've said , if you're open to reinventing and elevating the zombie genre , you're in for one hell of a rideThe zombie tiger is glorious and Bly's scheming guard meets a satisfying demiseZack takes full advantage of the Las Vegas setsI can't talk enough about how I felt for Zeus when Athena died , we see so much humanity in himAnd we see the best of humanity in Peters when she could have easily just left them but her good conscience made her go back for Scott and the remaining crewIt's heartbreaking and cruel how Scott had to kill his wife and now Kate has to kill himDave truly gives a nuanced performance and his best yetThe movie does not overstay it's welcome like most critics would tell you , and unlike most zombie films , the runtime allows for us to truly know and feel for these characters and this worldMy one confusion is that wouldn't Vanderohe be exposed to the radiation of the nuclear blast ?Although , I guess because he's in transition to being a zombie , maybe all of that doesn't even matter , because we do see him healing in the plane , and perhaps the radiation has also effected and maybe even evolved zombies even further than they already are'Suspicious Minds' closes us off as we beganThis world that Zack has created has the potential to rival other IPs like 'The Walking Dead' and 'The Last of Us'In terms of zombie movies in general , only 'Train to Busan' comes to mind in being just as good and leaving a great impression on meI'm excited to see where this all leads to and if we'll get more answers that the film intentionally leaves openZack Snyder is 2 for 2 this year , it's a shame some critics will still not treat him fairly , and the ones that seem to do can't help but have underhanded compliments and jabs at him , it is what it is , I supposeAs always , with any Zack Snyder film , I implore you to think for yourselves and not regurgitate hateful hiveminds.",Army of the Dead

Even though most of the characters dont have multiple layers (I mean what would you expect, the crew has +10 members, you cannot give them all great characterization in a 2.5 hour movie).The action is great, and most scenes are really well made.The movie feels like a fresh installment in the zombie genre.The zombies are actually pretty terrifying.The movie has no feel good ending.The gore is amazing.Zombie tiger.Cons:
Some parts are a bit vague. For example, why did one zombie look like a cyborg after they blew off his head, and when did the remaining survivor get bit, and how did he not notice it. (The first one will probably be explained in a prequel, and the other issue exists because of potential sequels.)
How strong is zeus? He survives multiple explosions and AR bullets, but dies by a pistolshot in the head.Why couldn't the main human antagonist just take the queen's head, go up to the roof, pay the pilot 10 million to fly him out of there. He had everything he needed, and he had no reason to wait for the others to finish taking the money out of the vault (because he will betray them later, which results in his death).THis movie isn't for everybody.

2176,ppxdndg,4/10 What. A. Mess.,4,5 June 2021,"If I were to say anything actually cool about Army of the Dead, it went be the opening credits. There's the Zack Snyder I know. Beautiful shots of buildings being destroyed, awesome scenes of people getting eaten, and done WITHOUT being unfocused and hard to look at. That's the only thing that warrants its 4/10The rest of the movie of the movie is a badly written, infuriatingly bad shot, and annoying bad directed dumpster fire of a movie.First of all: Why out of all things, does THIS get a cinematic universe. (I'm not joking, Snyder thinks that there's a bigger universe inside Army of the Dead) In fact, there's at least 3 more projects that are being made for this universe, including: An anime prequel, another prequel following a few thieves that tried to get the money first, and a sequel that will take place in Mexico. WHAT? I mean, this won't be the worst thing to give a cinematic universe to, but it will be the most MEANINGLESS thing to give a cinematic universe to.Second of all: Did anyone else notice that nothing is Accomplished in this? (Spoiler Warning) In the end: The money wasn't stolen, and head of the Queen that apparently is worth more than the money They're trying to steal falling down being crushed, everyone dies (except Kate), they didn't save Kate's friend that was captured by the zombies they made a big deal out of, and in the end the black guy that got bitten survived because he was locked in a vault, on which he got out of which will then set up the sequel. So they didn't won anything, they died for nothing, and brought about the end of humanity. So this movie pretty much has little to no value and isn't even worth your time to watch it. Pathetic.Third of all: I think was is the movie in Zack Snyder's career where he was given little to no studio interface and did whatever he want because he's an infamous director and then used that chance to do whatever he want to make something stupid. It happens to some great directors from time to time, Patty Jenkins has Wonder Woman 1984, M. Night Shyamalan has almost his entire career, and James Cameron has Avatar (2009).

I suppose if you like wrestling or just seeing a huge beefcake act ( I use that term lightly) like every other jarhead, you may enjoy this more. The traitor point was too blatantly obvious too early to be anything more than expected. Overall it's just something to stare at for 2 hours and to be glad it's new. Also did Michelle Rodriguez stop acting or something because I had gotten so used to seeing her in every badass military woman role that it felt like they just added (bland character here) to replace her.",Army of the Dead

Zack Snyder does a great job at creating zombie-filled Las Vegas with great characters and plot! The opening sequence was amazing and the zombies didn't disappoint, including the Zombie Tiger and the Zombie Queen. Netflix should make this a franchise since Zack Snyder isn't too busy now and there is a opportunity to take this somewhere with different ideas. The only bad things were, the characters don't have such a great ending, not going into anymore detail! Overall, Netflix has got a hit for them, and the fans are pleased to see another Zack Snyder movie shine! It is worth your time.",Army of the Dead

My son and I were waiting months for this excitedly and both of us were left gobsmacked at how terrible it was.

This film is what Hollywood should be not all amazing writing. All this film asks from the viewers is to relax and jump into the fictional world of zombie Las Vegas.

And i really don't get it! This film is funny, has much gore, doesn't try to be to serious, and delivers all the classical zombie tropes i could hope for! Some of the characters were anoying for sure, but they all died real graphical deaths. The pacing was ok, the action was good. I liked the soundtrack. Some new zombie types to shake things up. What's the big deal people? This is no masterpiece by all means, but it sure is a real funny wellshot zombie extravaganza. So get yourself some popcorn and just enjoy it for what it is.

2219,roadkill6,What if we combined a generic heist movie with a generic zombie movie?,4,3 June 2021,"It's a bit ironic that Omari Hardwick's character quotes Joseph Campbell at one point in the film, because this is not a hero's journey story; this is simply Dawn of the Dead meets Ocean's Eleven. On the upside, the cast does a great job and the cinematography is exactly what I expect from a Snyder film; it's very good. There are some serious plot holes though, and it's obvious that realism with regards to weapons, tactics, and government/military policy took a backseat to cool special effects.So, if you want to enjoy the film, go ahead and suspend that disbelief right now, ignore the warmed-over, clichéd tropes, and just watch the zombie brains splatter.Zombie movies are great specifically because they have the ability to shine a light on human nature in the darkest of times, and Snyder's Dawn of the Dead did that, but Army of the Dead doesn't. You hope for a twist, a variation on a theme, a revelation, a bit of an ""aha"" moment, but it never comes. Instead, there are homages to classic films, but they are so on-the-nose that they distract from this film and only serve to make it seem more derivative.I also couldn't unsee the fact that Tig Notaro was greenscreened in after principal photography was finished. It's distractingly obvious that she was added in, and it's a real shame because she's a good actor and it would have been nice to see her play off of Bautista and the rest of the cast.I wish this movie was better, but sometimes you roll the dice and it comes up snake-eyes.",Army of the Dead

If you happen to care about such lofty things like coherent storytelling or character development, I'd wait to watch this lazy entry into the zombie genre until you're either drunk or stoned to overlook its many problems.And while Zack may have gotten some kind of personal thrill out of manning every major job in this project, the outcome has clearly suffered as a result. What could have been an otherwise outstanding zombie action flick, given proper attention to detail and an avoidance of lazy tropes, is instead no more than another sparkly yet mediocre piece of cookie-cutter movie confection.The fact that more movie goers aren't outraged by the significant and apparently permanent drop in quality/intelligence of most these blockbuster Hollywood productions is what bewilders me. Apparently, just shoveling an old retread of a story into a production-line CGI machine is enough to satisfy most of today's audience, who blithely flock to, praise, and subsidize whatever vapid POS comes out.

The camera shakes, and slides all over the place. Even the focus is off sometimes.This is especially noticeable in quiet and calm scenes, with no action going on.I swear if i didn´t know better i would have thought i was watching a pirated cam-version filmed in a movie theater.If you are okay with getting a headache from the shaky camera, then this is a decent movie.I just wanted to turn it off.

Granted, this film has many inconsistencies within the plot and some of the characters but the film overall is a fun, action-packed zombie movie, exactly how it was advertised.Only quarrel I have with this movie is the Geeta situation. She is a random person but most of the reviews I have read on here have stated that Geeta is just a random person. I don't think half of the people that have said this understand the principle of saving her. It's not the person that she cares so much about, it is the principle that she didn't do anything to prevent her from dying.You get all of the character development at the beginning of the movie, short and concise granted, but it is all the backstory we need to establish some great fundamental characters.Without the inconsistencies and the plot holes that everyone rambles about we wouldn't have had this movie.

2241,chiragbishnoi,A pathetic movie from an average & unoriginal director with a big ego,3,24 May 2021,"By now, a lot of people have already explained in great detail just how ridiculous and garbage this movie is. So I wouldn't get into that again.Instead, I would like to point out that how over-rated a director Zack Snyder is. Out of the 9 movies that he's directed till now, this is only the 2nd movie that is actually based on an original story that he wrote. I love most of his movies, but they were all great because they were based on outstanding source materials. It wasn't his direction which made these movies great, but the amazing story and characters written by others. His direction, although not bad, isn't anywhere near being visionary. Most of it involves over-stylizing everything and an extreme use of slow-motion which doesn't look as cool as he probably thinks. The lack of original content in his movies is evidence enough that he's not a ""visionary"" and not at all worthy of the hype that braindead fanbois create for him.The script writing in this movie is so lazy, frustrating and devoid of any logic, the likes of which you don't even expect in C-grade movies with 20 times lesser budget than this. And the worst part is, Zack himself seems to be delusional enough to believe that he's a good director. Why else would he create an utter trash like this that runs for 2.5 hours? How egoistic and air-headed someone has to be to not realize how bad the stuff they're making is, AND then drag it for a duration that doesn't seem to end?FFS even Zack Snyder's JL was overrated as hell, riding on the cacophony of his dumb and blind followers.

2246,sr-w,Dave Bautista deserves better movie scripts,2,21 May 2021,"Everybody dies because Kate tries to save some person who isn't part of the movie.Kate doesn't get the money in the end either. She gets a ""small amount"" to get the kids out of the camp. THE CAMP THAT WAS JUST NUKED?! Did I misunderstand this or what?Kate survives a nuclear blast and seems fine after the chopper went down. And a US Air Force chopper comes to the rescue - wayyy too close to the nuclear blast. I'm pretty sure they would've died.Anyway. The movie focuses on Scott who tries to get this money for his daughter, but that doesn't go well. The money ends up with Van who spends it on a private plane ticket (why?) but he dies... Not from literally walking through the radiation zone hours after a nuclear blast, but from being bit by a zombie.Who wrote this? And who decided to fund the script? I have never given a movie a rating this low, because I feel bad if I do. People have put in so much work into this project so I don't want to slam it. But come on. This is not a zombie movie. It's a fantasy movie.On the other hand - I have some positive feedback too:1. Dave Bautista. I really like this actor and I loved him in Bushwick. Great and underrated movie. I think Dave is a very underrated actor who deserves much better scripts than Army of the Dead.2. CGI etc. This movie looks great. The zombies are pathetic (a king and a queen with super powers... lame) but special effects and stuff look great.3. The splatter stuff. I loved that. It was very well made and when the head of the ""queen"" falls to the ground in the end, I laughed because it looked great. SPLAT!",Army of the Dead

The zombies are huge step back too, gone are the shambling decaying horrors of the 90s which were an impressive practical effect and in are the crossfit doing, parcour jumping but completely boring looking new breed of zombie.

2262,therealjustjakenit,10?! Are you out of your mind,2,15 May 2021,"Zack Snyder had some dope visuals in his films, but his storytelling and characterization always leaves some to be desired. Problem is this movie isn't even that visually interesting. The credit sequence is the highlight of the movie!! What's the point of having a movie in Vegas if you do nothing with your setting and reduce it to crumbling soft focus background details. Oh but there is one scene with slot machines!! Literally a one minute scene when they are in a casino the rest they are in dark corridors or piles of rubble. Are we supposed to believe that zombies completely eradicated Vegas and reduced it to rubble. Literally looked like a meteor hit Vegas.My biggest problem are with the characters. There are way too many it reminded me a lot of suicide squad the way they introduced them in this montage. They literally hire one of the team members because he made a YouTube video shooting zombies.. like really.. aren't there some more soldiers you know? But seriously who cares who makes it out. And you made a 2.5 hour movie with a story that could have been told in 70min and couldn't figure out how to make us care about any of the characters.I could go on and on. I used to love zombie movies (original Dawn one of my favorite movies.. Zack remake was..) but they have been reduced to nothing more that pointless monster movies that are a shell of what they once were with absolutely nothing to say other than here's some gore!

2265,rahonejm,Another dumbfest from Snyder,3,28 May 2021,"Zack Snyder continues the trend he started with Batman v Superman, where he turned Batman into the world's worst detective, that consists in making every character as dumb as possible and their actions either senseless or incoherent. I'll just give a few examples (no major spoilers):-Highly trained army men take their eyes off a straight road for long enough to not see a car coming their way, all while transporting what could be (as far as they know) the most valuable thing on the planet, resulting in an accident.-Highly trained army men can't hit a single target with machine guns, either on the body (for a stun) or the head. Said target is no more than a few meters away and uses break dancing as a dodging method to approach army men.-Girl decides to go into zombie infested city to try to find some kids' mother because she (the girl) is responsible for taking care of the kids (in her own words), while she and everyone else completely neglect the fact that it would be better for the girl to stay and actually take care of the kids instead of risking her life for their mother that is, realistically, dead.-Government employed (and probably very well paid) security guy decides to go on a suicide mission for a chance at getting a measly $15k, without even asking for any details beforehand.-Guy digs chainsaw out of the desert sand, takes it into zombie infested city, makes everyone carry gas cans for it, but never uses the chainsaw. You don't even see him carrying the thing. Not even once.-Group of people that should ""stick close"" while walking around zombies get so separated they don't even see where each other is going.-No one, and I mean no one, covers each others' backs. People just watch their friends get surrounded by zombies but never, ever, shoot their guns to help.-Girl decides it's a good idea to go into zombie headquarters on her own, armed with a single pistol, for a chance at finding someone who is most likely dead. How she would have entered the place, searched for the person, and got said person out (if she found them) are the real questions.And these are just a very few examples of a movie that is comprised almost entirely of brain-dead actions and decisions. And these just cover what the characters do. I won't even get into the actual movie details, such as how one of the best, most secure safes in the world can be opened by gluing your ear into it and listening really closely, or how knives can go through zombies' skulls (they don't even have the terrible excuse of ""their bones are decomposing"" for this one), but bullets can't go through thin, makeshift metal helmet (and people can shoot zombies in the head but not in the mouth, where the helmet doesn't cover), or even how a character just vanishes.This isn't one of those ""turn your brain off to enjoy it"" kinda movie. This movie surpasses that. Everything is so completely senseless that it's impossible to ignore. Between that, Bautista's awful acting and the ridiculous-looking cgi imposed helicopter pilot (I guess Snyder has his own Superman's mustache now), this is the worst high profile zombie movie out there. It's also the most out of focus one (I mean literally, like the cameras are out of focus). At least it was done on purpose, I guess.On a side note, I want to quickly mention Matthias Schweighöfer, who plays Dieter (the safe cracker). His performance is the absolute stand out of the entire movie.",Army of the Dead

Zack Snyder should stick with the superhero movies, he has no talent in original writing or directing. I almost puked when I heard the dialogues between the characters. How did this film get approved? Did anyone even read the script before giving it a go? A 15 years old teenager can write a better script than this one, no character depth in any of the characters, not a single thing interesting about their personalities, just same old cheesy stuff. I will not call this lazy writing because calling this script lazy writing would be insult to real lazy writings, this is absolute garbage.

If your waiting to see this but have those fears and expectations for where it may go wrong then just walk away and avoid the disappointment because it does exactly that. Pretty much ""I am legend"" but without the effort and with some very questionable SFX thrown in. Netflix upped our subscription with the promise of better content?

The performers do the best they can with the script they are given but the script is low quality and sounds like a high schooler wrote the conversations.

Despite numerous actions scenes the overall pacing seemed slow, a lot of scenes dragged on and there was so much unnecessary chit chat between characters you couldn't care less about! Most of the characters were completely unmemorable and all of them made bizarre decisions throughout. The action scenes were comics but not in a good way and the zombies were stupid - the screeching and costumes were annoying and ridiculous. The plot went something like...bio weapon escapes army convoy (due to stupidity) billionaire recruits random soldier to put team together to retrieve his millions from a safe (his insurance had already covered the money and he knew everything about the vault except the combination???) movie spends ages introducing random characters and planning heist (of which we end up seeing very little) team enter Vegas with annoying volunteer girl from refugee camp who wants to find a missing woman who she ends up not even caring if she lives or dies. Then there's screeching fancy dress zombies, a bad cgi tiger, some weird zombie congregation to turn the perve guy who was offered as a sacrifice into a zombie who makes a 10 second appearance towards the end. Most of the characters die pointless deaths and then a helicopter crash which the annoying girl survives without a scratch and a man emerging from the vault into a nuclear zone with no problems...

2317,Vlad_the_Impala,Toothless,3,24 May 2021,"I really liked Dawn of the Dead, so I was looking forward to this one, but it's just a mess.Dave Batista is usually entertaining, and he could have worked as the lead, but as soon as the group hits Las Vegas the characters scatter, and we get disjointed individual stories, that often make no sense. The instantly forgettable characters are left to wander off on their own, no one is looking out for anyone else, there seems to be no plan, no leadership and no urgency. Strange for a small group of allegedly highly skilled individuals in a city filled with undead predators.The film is riddled with goofs too. I generally manage the suspension of disbelief, and don't pick up on them, but there were so many it got distracting. How did Zeus manage to get from that rooftop back to the Olympus before the folks in the helicopter!? Why is everyone so laid back when they have seconds to go before being nuked. Forget sharing your feelings, get in the damn chopper!Worst of all, the zombies weren't scary, at all. I saw a few nibbles, but did they even eat anyone?! With all their stage school leaping they looked more like try outs for a new staging of West Side Story, or a YouTube parkour video, than flesh hungry ghouls. And don't even get me started on the smart zombies.Even the idea of an armed group infiltrating an undead filled Las Vegas isn't new, Resident Evil Extinction did it, and did it better.All in all it's Escape from New York with a dash of Land of the Dead, but not as good as either of those films.

2336,ramonfarro,The New Zombie Movie,8,16 May 2021,"First of all, I'm not the biggest Zombie movie fan, I enjoy them, but nothing more. They tend to be stupid and nonsense. But they're great when they know what they're doing, and there are very different kind of Zombie movies. Train to Busan, I'm a Legend or WWZ are three great zombie movies that are very different and are great because of different elements. Train is an exaggerated but funny and very entertaining piece, Legend is an emotional and deep story about loneliness and loss and WWZ is an dumb action blockbuster but very entertaining. I went to see this movie because Snyder is one of my favorite directors and I'm very glad I could see the movie in theaters here in Spain, the only other country besides the US to show the movie on the big screen before it's release on Netflix a week later. So being one of the first to rate and review this movie is great.Zack Snyder's directional debut in 2004 Dawn of the Dead was a great zombie movie, remake of an old film. Who took the story in a very serious and dramatic way, one of the best Zombie movies. And now, in 2021, after his success with Justice League, Snyder delivers his more personal project yet. As everyone is saying in their reviews, it mixes genres: Zombies, action, comedy, drama, heist and horror.The main themes of the film are many, but it brings a big emphasis on loss. That reminded me of Snyder's first zombie movie. We see some ""realistic"" consequences of such an event. That side is very well portrayed. We see how the world would react and the performances by the cast in showcasing the emotions are great. But next to its seriousness we have some comedy elements that come close to parody (for example the news coverage, those who've seen the film will understand). And normally I don't like when serious plots crack very stupid jokes but it wasn't a problem here. All Zombie movies have some sort of parody elements and it didn't bug me that much. And we'll, they were funny. Another element of realism is how the movie ends for it's main characters. I won't spoil but if an event as sketchy as am intrusion in a zombie dominated Vegas was real, what happened to the team inside is what would actually happen. Real consequences and unexplained outcomes. But not to worry, all that it's mixed with craziness and top action, some dumb and maybe overexagerated, but it's cool. Being a Snyder fan, I would have expected a deeper story, his movies have a lot os symbolism and very powerful meaning, this one may be weaker in that aspect, but it still had some great messages and it goes beyond action and zombies, I assure.The cast was magnificent. Before this movie, the only actors I knew where Dave Bautista, Theo Rossi, Hiroyuki Sanada and Tig Notaro. All the rest were new to me. And I've got to admit I was pleasantly surprised, We got cast members from all over the world, and the inclusion of different characters is made in a very natural way. I thought the performances were great, specially Matthias Schweighöfer who surprised me very much, and I can't wait to see him in the prequel Army of Thieves, set to release next year. And Dave Bautista was stellar, as many people say, he is the best wrestler turned actor out there. He is obviously great in action scenes but he is certainly amazing in the emotional parts of the movie and his performance is really good.Lots of elements in the movie came as a surprise, the story tries new things with zombies. Some elements are things we've never seen before. There are lots of ideas and concepts mixed, and some may be over the top but the mix worked. Very original takes and sequences all over the movie. One could fear so many different elements could not blend together in a natural way, but Snyder managed to deliver a self-contained story mixing all of his ideas and themes he wanted to explore in such a movie as explosive and charged as this one. It really looks like his dream project.Visuals were great. Everyone wants to talk about Chris D'elia being replaced by Tig Notaro in post production. And I'll just say that it worked, Notaro delivers a fresh performance as she always does and the fact that she was added to the movie through cgi and green screen is barely noticeable in a couple shots and it looks totally natural in the rest of the movie. But great special effects in this movie go beyond that. Effects were amazing, both computer and practical worked very well. Cinematography was beautiful, many shots were a wonder to look at, specially in the opening credits, a very powerful sequence (with an amazing ""Viva Las Vegas"" cover by Richard Cheese and Allison Crowe). And all that worked even better with a great score by Junkie XL, who composes again for Snyder after Batman V Superman and ZS Justice League, and some cool songs added throughout the movie.I've got to say that even if I praised the visual aspect, it did feel more TV than cinema. This is not a bad remark about the movie. I'll say that some shots and scenes looked more like it was made for TV, the zoom and the camera approach maybe. Perhaps if I had seen it in my TV at home I wouldn't even notice this. But it's natural as this was a Netflix production and it's release in theaters was more like a love message to his fans by Snyder after all the support he received by film enthusiasts.And about that, thanks to all those campaigns about his DC movies and all support Snyder received online he may have become an auteur (or experimental) film maker. It's curious how a blockbuster director can be seen this way. And I think this movie, made after his departure from Warner Brothers, made with Netflix who gives him total freedom over the story and creative choices is the evidence of his new status. All the Justice League situation and this new Zombie universe he is creating is a new step in Snyder's direction in film making. Netflix has confidence in this new universe as spin offs, prequels and more projects are already being made. Snyder is happy with this movie, he does what he wants with the story, Netflix produces and audiences are content. No one knows if he will ever come back to Warner to finish the DC superheroes Snyderverse but for the moment, the Zombie Army-Verse is a new step. And Army of the Dead, without being a masterpiece of any kind, is a triumph in filmmaking, originality, creative liberty and most of all, a triumph to Zack Snyder and all his fans.",Army of the Dead

The crew collection and mission planning was bland, boring, cliched. You could skip it with no effect.

Pretty everyone has been talking about the plot holes but no one has mentioned the few I was thinking if while watching the film:why would a zombie play with their food. Ok so maybe the alphas can think. So did the tiger get more intelligent after zombifying? Big cats don't throw their prey about although they are totally powerful to crush a skull (that was cool).-these people are meant to be veteran zombie fighters. Did not one of them think chainmail or biker leathers? I would have been wearing full biker leathers plus helmet. Sure it would get hot in Vegas but I would pop some cooling packs into my boots etc.-why didn't they use the exploding fire grenades earlier?why didn't they have bigger caliber and exploding rounds? I think we saw him use a grenade launcher once. Super fast zombies aren't so fast when they don't have legs...just saying.Now onto the things that others have said but really not enough:-where the heck is Geeta at the helicopter crash scene is she dead? I presumed her kids were on the bus going out but confirmation would have been nice.-Kate (Scott - Batista - daughter) surely she would have been a zombpocolypse surviver too so why didn't she take more guns from her dad?why didn't Dieter also go in the safe?how does a dead woman (zombie) get pregnant?why does the infection seem to be seconds for some people but like a flight to Mexico City for others?So the safe can survive a nuke but conveniently get busy open? I suppose they did say low yield but he would probably still fell very ill. Maybe that's what delayed the zombification?if it was Tanaka's safe why didn't he just give them the combination? Why the deadly protections? Also why not rob a few more casinos while you're at it as surely this would not have been the only one?if the USA government just wanted the zombie blood they could have covert dropped a commando unit by helicopter and been away in 20mins.so I nuke has just dropped. Why would anyone be expecting or noticing a helicopter crash in all that mess to send one out to Kate (and I'm going to presume Geeta)?So, I'm also going to say that I didn't even notice android zombies. Or androids masquerading as zombies should I say. Noticed blue glowy stuff out of the heads of the alpha - whatever makes them alpha I suppose and presumed this was just that?Anyway, not horrendous, I have seen worse films but plot holes big enough to lose a film in. The action was pretty awesome though and I quite like Dave Batista.

As die hard fan of the horror genre I really couldn't fault this in any major way. Sure it's cheesy as hell and sure the characters were completely exaggerated- it's comedy horror and don't go into it expecting anything else. It in no way takes itself seriously, it's just plain fun. Was actually pleasantly surprised at how great the actor's were. Considering I only recognised three of the actors, which usually leads to a B-grade acting feel, I can't fault the acting.Don't go into it expecting a revolutionary new take on the zombie genre, it kinda tells you that in the name.

There were in fact hordes of undead, but it felt more like characters from a world of warcraft game than what most would expect from a zombie movie. It felt like it was marketed incorrectly.There were also a lot of unanswered questions at the end that I guess just didn't matter? So strange. The movie felt scattered and didn't seem to know if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama or even something in between.I tend to be a Zack Snyder fan and this didn't give me the feeling that it was a Snyder movie. I'm no film buff and wouldn't be able to analyze why, but the quality of it didn't seem to belong with the big names and - i'm assuming - budget that it had.Added note: user mitchellkendrickwhite has an amazing review actually.

The recruiting scene was basically taken from oceans series.I really wanted to see what Zack would do when he is given complete freedom to show violence and bloodshed but then he just didn't do it the right way.Zombieland which is more of a comedy movie was amazing, where as looking at this one was just bland and boring. It could have been wayyyy better, also the screen time makes absolutely no sense. Its basically wasting your time.Characters in the movie do stupid stuff for absolutely no reason and things just happen. Like other Zack Snyder movies don't expect that their would be some hidden meaning to places or things. It just doesn't.

As everyone else has already shared; The daughter is absolutely annoying, selfish, unnecessary, added dead weight. I'm really bummed that we don't find out what happens to the Zombie Fetus, although the term sounds like a great name for a Death Metal band. Pretty sure at one point Spawn was wearing over the ear headphones, and during a zombie apocalypse the last thing you want to do is prevent yourself from hearing the environment around you.

Some actors did good, some not so much - but with this material, it would be impossible to do a brilliant job.Blandest visuals I've seen in a while. Mostly nothing but dark, narrow corridors and close-up shots of dark silhouettes (maybe the joke is that the characters are silhouettes?). Zombies looked very much like they were from an 80s b-movie.Also, there really isn't much of a plot, and the movie is an hour too long. Too many characters for such a simple basic concept.

Army Of The Dead is an exciting action movie for the summer to watch with friends and family to laugh and enjoy as they eat popcorn and drink soda; it's a typical blockbuster movie to watch and become excited with.The characters were incomplete and could have had better background, as well as their actions in certain scenes that were illogical and tame.The ending was disappointing yet intriguing, for there is a hint for a possible sequel.This movie sets the bar higher than other action movies like Extraction, for there is more story than other movies like The Fast And Furious Saga and Transformers, yet we still watch them because we enjoy action and entertainment.This movie isn't a masterpiece, but it's an enjoyable movie to watch and expect excitement and action, not cinematic excellence, but to laugh and shout as we enjoy on-screen violence, CGI, weapons, and elements that we enjoy.",Army of the Dead

So in the result of it US government changed the launching time a day earlier(not to mention the survival of Vanderohe in the middle of radioactive zone). I mean for real it's almost impossible for somthing with this dimension they just decide to reschedule it perfunctorily.

The only thing I would have changed was the annoying daughter. She could have been cut from the whole film and the film would have been better for it. It would have felt more streamlined. I feel like she and the people in quarantine took away from the pacing of the film. The time wasted on them could have been better spent fleshing out the other characters, notably Dave's character's love interest. I would have like to see them two survive at the end. Her in the place of the daughter. Of course leave in Dave's death. The daughter surviving was really irritating seeing as she literally contributed nothing in the grand scheme of things. People griping about bank vault guy surviving at the end need to suspend belief for a bit. The news did say it was a low yield nuke, and he was bitten which could have made him somewhat immune to radiation sickness. Cinematically I enjoyed the majority of the film. The colors and slow downs seemed fairly appropriate and did add to the aesthetic. Just enough gore, would have liked to see more practical effects and less reliance on CGI. I will hand it to them, the CGI was pretty good in 90% of the scenes.",Army of the Dead

Good action but very basic story.The daughters character was very irritating. I feel the character didn't really bring any purpose to the story.

2493,ydjfdx,Fun World Building,10,22 May 2021,"The movie is an absolute win for the Zombie genre, while not in anyway a revolutionary movie it does offer for some fresh and original zombie entertainment. The movie takes itself seriously enough to not fall into cynical mindless pop corn movie but doesn't forget to be fun.Don't come to this movie expecting anything more than a clever twist on a B movie genre, it is still a B movie streaming blockbuster.Zack Snyder visual direction is still on top of his game and this time he acts as director of photography and has made a unusual choice, he is used to shoot using films but the budget of Netflix only allowed for digital cameras. In order for his movie not to look to clean and precise like digital would do he puts a very shot focus distance so most of the background is blurry and the characters get in and out of focus often. This give the movie a kind of war documentary feels to it that is in line with the very anti war message of the plot, a message strengthens by the clever choice (but a bit on the nose) of Zombie by the cranberries at the end of the film.The one cherry on top of the cake is that even with a satisfying self contained story the movie plants the seeds for a mysterious and crazy world to be explored in the sequels and prequels to come, the fact that this craziness is not fully explored in this first movie would actually be cause for me to only give 9 stars to the movie but there is currently a petty attempt to bomb review this movie so I will put this complain aside to balance out the current reviews. The movie is telling the story it wants to tell and is doing it well.Very intrigued to see where this franchise is going to go with the robots and aliens, hope it really embrace the craziness of B movies with bigger budget.",Army of the Dead

So I never found myself really caring who dies or not.The positives are that this movie has fun action and the world itself is interesting. But for every cool action scene there is another cringe drama scene following it Like clockwork.I am not a person who hates all drama in action movies...but this was not helping it.Side Note: I never Felt that the ""TEAM"" feared anything. It's like they were only scared when they are about to die. Without spoiling there is a moment in the film where the teams plan gets ruined and instead of being worried they are like....""oh wow this sucks"". Guess our chances of surviving are even worse now. Oh well. Like I don't get it.",Army of the Dead

The way they walked was so unconvincing and cringe i mean jeez. The indoor sequences will have you rolling ur eyes. The main infiltration team is average at best. Batista somewhat tries to carry this project but to no gain. The CGI is average. You can almost always tell that these are actors in front of a green screen. Netflix just capitalised the success of zack snyder's justice league with the immense following of snyder cut movement. This seems just a cash grab project for zack.

I've seen complaints about one character in particular and her impact on the story, but you can't tell me that the situation leading into the third act was entirely one characters fault.

The mother that Kate risks her life for and everyone elses life seemed off to me. We have gotten to know these characters and i was kind of annoyed that we risked our lives for this mother only to see her die in the end anyway. She was the wrong character. The first wrong decision was to make her a central motivation for Kate in this movie. The second was having kate run off like an idiot for a character no one cares/d about.

2535,mitchellkendrickwhite,Major Spoilers - Everything wrong with this movie,6,19 May 2021,"This movie is for those who can turn off your mind and just enjoy things being destroyed. Here's why:
1) Every character death was annoying and pointless. For example, the first girl to die was betrayed and left in the kitchen. It would have been fine if they left her there to die and maybe it would create some tension in the group. Nope. She comes storming back into the hallway and then dies in front of anyone... without pointing out that the dude betrayed her. Also, why didn't anyone shoot the zombies around her? They just watched her die. Example #2: the German dude... finally uses a brain cell and decides to go for the vault. This was obviously the smart move... but he closes his friend in there and dies outside. What was his plan? To lock his friend in and just wait out there with the other zombies? What a moron. Hop in... then pull it in to close it. Example #3, the chick holding the head. Why not set the head on the floor, aim at it and walk back into the chopper. Nope. She decides to sacrifice herself. For no reason. Nice. Also, why was she carrying it around?2) The daughter is insufferable. Her reasoning for even being in the movie is a joke. She cares soooo much about this random mom that she just has to go back in there for her. False. When the helicopter crashes, the chick doesn't look for the mom or care about her at all. She only goes up to her dad. The script just forgets about the mom. I honestly was hoping the daughter would die because she only complicated things and makes bad decisions. Why assume the people are in the Olympus? Why not ask your dad to go with you? Why not bring more than a pistol into the quarantine area? But apparently we should care about her because the main character does.3) Every shot is a headshot. Even the daughter shoots the main zombie in the head twice from 50 yards. The zombies decide to not bit when they are clearly in biting distance. This basically made the movie boring because you knew the main characters weren't in any danger until a scene was coming to a close.4) They leave the gate wide open when walking into the quarantined area. This killed me. I guess I should have stopped thinking at this point in the movie.5) If the bad dude's plan was just to get the vile of blood, then why not shoot the scout. Take its blood and leave. Tell the group they will get paid and let's go back now. Nope. Betray everyone for no reason (tell them you'll kill the helicopter pilot for no reason) and go for a head of the main chick. Cool.6) Why did the zombies keep some people for a few days? No explanation... just need to keep the mom alive so the girl is justified in ruining everything. Actually.. why would the girl even assume she was alive. What a dumb character.7) Robot zombies? What? Why? I assume the Mexico City sequel will explain that the government created the alphas to control the others and use the zombies as weapons. But IDK. Cause it seemed like the government wanted zombie blood, which they could have gotten if that was the case. Makes no sense.6/10 is generous. Only points given are for... releasing a movie during covid. At least it made me go to the theater.",Army of the Dead

It's a zombie movie. There are holes in the plot and stupid parts they put in the movie where they could have added more substance. The movie was meant to be fun and it was in my opinion. The visual and special effects were great and most of the actors were good, some worthless, but others good. My one big negative is that the daughter in this film ruined parts of it for me and would have been better without her. She's kinda cute sure but she is plain stupid, wastes so much time, and her acting isn't that great...o and she is a pain in the A**. Every time it cut to a scene with her I rolled my eyes and said to myself here comes a worthless annoying scene. Literally worthless. She had no need to exist in this film. She brought nothing but annoyance. I feel all the stupid nonsense they wasted on directing those parts could have been placed elsewhere and filled holes in the plot. The beginning of the film felt rushed and the relationship between the main guy and his daughter was pointless. I know I sort of repeated myself but I'm so serious that her presence sucked that bad. I couldn't help but hope she got eaten so she would be gone from this movie. Aside from that stupidity I thought it was cool. Def something different, the zombies kind of reminded me of the turned people from I am Legend.

The grenades later in the movie are also like mini-nukes, even more so than your usual grenades in action movies.Shady character that the protagonist doesn't like approaches with a deal, deal is obviously too good to be true but the protagonist takes the deal anyway. A character is betrayed and ends up dying, but in the plenty of time she had before dying she said nothing to the team about the traitor standing right beside them. The team also just watches as she dies, nobody even shoots the 6 or 7 zombies that are taking forever just to bite her. Her death is there just to be dramatic.Protagonist's daughter is poorly written, she really only exists to have this parent and child with a broken relationship trope that eventually leads to the daughter realizing she took him for granted.The ending of the movie is predictable, father dies, daughter finally values him because of it, blah blah.

The actions sequences are fun and at points intense. I thought it was super fun and I can't wait to see what Netflix and Zack decide to take this franchise moving forward. Army of Thieves will be coming out as a prequel and as Zack stated it will have few zombies, but that to me just means this franchise is going to be something unique and fresh.

I'm dying to know the ufos in the beginning sequence, zombie cyborgs in the casino shootout scenes, the Omega and the destruction of Mexico City.

All of Snyder's loyal subjects are bound to start babbling about a Snyder cut of this movie. Batista and crew are fun to watch but that was about it. Usually I can forgive a few plot holes here and there, but they just kept piling up. The the technical mistakes with some of the weapons is unforgivable. Most notably when the daughter fires her glock at helmet/cape/zombie horse rider main bad zombie towards the end and I guess because it looked cooler on screen?? She pulls the trigger, no round is fired but yet the slide is forced back and then locked in position. Now this would normally happen when the last round is fired from the firearm. Last round is chambered, trigger is pulled, round forces the slide back to chamber another round, if there is not another round in the magazine then the slide is locked in the rear position. That's how a normal firearm would work but I guess because we are dealing with zombies, the movie doesn't have to obey other realizms (no that's not a word) like.

It's a zombie movie. That's how every zombie movie ever made has always been. You're not supposed to break it down. You're not supposed to expect the Shawshank Redemption. I mean there's a zombie tiger...I enjoyed the hell out of it. Super fun, great pacing, great setting, awesome effects, good twist on the zombie format but exact same formula/structure as the classics. You're just watching a bunch of dumb humans descend into chaos. Felt very Romero-esque to me.If you're not gonna just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride, you're doing it wrong. If you like zombie films, especially the Romero ones, it's a fun time.Don't be put off by snarky reviews. It's great. Better than any of the more recent ""of the Dead"" movies, even George's last 3.

2560,christianpulman,"A cross between a Zombie themed B movie, Smoking Aces and Oceans Twelve (Yes I mean Twelve) Army of the Dead falls short of expectation",2,22 May 2021,"In his second big screen attempt at a Zombie movie, Zack Snyder directs Netflix's new originals movie ""Army of the Dead"". The film follows a group of mercenaries tasked with breaking into a Vegas casinos safe to steal $200,000,000. The only issue being, Las Vegas has been taken over by Zombies.Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) stars as Scott Ward, the grizzly ex mercenary turned fry cook who is tasked with pulling a team together to complete the heist, Ella Purnell plays his estranged daughter ""Kate"" (Churchill) who is stuck in a camp outside of Las Vegas. The father, daughter storyline feels forced and unneeded, as do many of the subplots within the film (Zombie baby anyone??). In a scene where Kate opens up to Scott, subtle music is played over, reminiscent of a midafternoon soap, which made me cringe rather than empathise.The film opens with a cross scene between an armored military convoy carrying precious cargo and a couple driving in the opposite direction. I could tell this was going to be a long one after a military vehicle and the car collide which causes the both vehicles to explode. The precious cargo kept inside a secure metal cell suddenly and magically unlocks?At a run time of just shy of two and half hours, Zack who also had a hand in a screenplay feels the best way to beef it out is too shoehorn characters into it. All, apart from the German safe cracker Ludwig (Matthias Schweighöfer), fall flat and are around to be Zombie food. The humour that does land is delivered by Ludwig, who becomes the most interesting character in the movie. As the safe cracker, he is tasked at cracking the proposed difficult safe, however aside from a few booby traps, the safe opens without issue....It lacks a bit of consistency, with the Zombies abilities being the biggest culprit. Now there are two types, the braindead, grab and bite type or the intelligent, dodge bullets and blades type. Depending on the scene the super intelligent ones could be nigh on impossible to shoot to being literal cannon fodder.Some Scenes are really let down by special effects which screamed a movie late at night, on a channel you've never heard off. The ""King'' of the Zombies looked more like Blanka from JCVDs 1994 Street Fighter, Tig Notaro who filled in for allegations hit comedian Chris D'elia does look superimposed in some scenes.To squeeze in more bullets, some plot lines are not fully explained. For example, Vegas has restricted airspace, you can't fly into it, but you're fine to fly out of it? Again, it feels if the plot line goes against what Zack was trying to do its skipped over.Overall, I feel it falls for the Snyder trap of style before substance. If more focus was given to the story rather than making it look cool, there are the bones of a good film.If you like cheesy lines, lots of gore, lots or blood, flying bullets with little story, this film is for you.",Army of the Dead

2572,ScreamHR,Not worth watching,3,24 May 2021,"I give it 3 stars because of the actions scenes, which I thoroughly enjoyed; everything else about the movie is trash. No logic, no plot, no character development, no reason this movie was green lit.The movie begins with a military convoy transporting a top secret container from Area 51 to somewhere. Along the way a newlywed man is received road head from his wife, and closes his eyes not watching the road while speeding. For some reason he does not notice the many bright headlights of military vehicles approaching him. On the other side of the road these two highly trained soldiers in the front of the convoy are so caught up in staring at each other while talking they don't notice the car headlights coming straight for them. This is on a long straight desert road at dusk.On top of that the first Humvee swerves and this 1980's four door has a head on collision with a military transport truck that appears to be a HEMTT. It explodes instantly causing the cargo container to launch of the truck, and bust open. Car crashes do not lead to instant flame ball explosions, and if a car like that hit a truck like that the truck would probably be undamaged while the car would be a pancake. Also a container with a dangerous zombie inside would be so secure that a nuclear explosion would not open it, much less a car wreck.Then after the wreck the leader of the convoy radios in what happened while several soldiers slowly approach the shipping container. The dispatcher tells him to get all of his men out of there, and get as far away as possible in a panicked voice. He proceeds to take his time, and casually say, ""hey guys leave it,"" like there is not a care in the world. In real life the military would know the protocols for all situations that might arise on their mission before hand, and would already know not to approach the container. Also an officer would take the threat more seriously, and scream at his soldier to back away, and run. On top of that when the zombie attacks the soldiers he watches them all die then he grabs his injured friend, and starts walking away into the desert, and after 20 yards his friend is like ""this is far enough"" when they walked away from a perfectly functioning fully armored Humvee.Notice this is all the opening scene before the movie even starts so imagine how the movie is. I'll make the mid movie complaints shorter:
A guy gets his jaw ripped off and turns into a zombie when all other zombies have to be bit.The military parachutes soldiers with pistols into the middle of zombie hoards, I guess to make sure the zombies can grow nice and healthy.Girl betrayed by bad guy finds the group and doesn't tell them what he did.Team watches girl getting attacked by zombies, instead of helping her they watch until the zombies overpower her then leave.Nuke is going to land in 20 minutes so girl decides to walk across town to save her friend that is most likely dead.Zombies turn everyone into zombies except the people idiot girl wants to save.Bad guy gets what he came there for, and is standing next to an exit so he decides to go back into the heart of the city for no reason. Same guy says he's going to the roof to kill somebody, but instead goes out of the front door.Hovering helicopter nose dives towards the ground instead of going higher in the air when a zombie is trying to get on it.People knowing a nuke is about to hit them take time to celebrate and toss money around.Guy cracks a Vegas vault by putting his ear to it.Vault has deadly Indiana Jones booby traps outside of it.Coyote offers human sacrifices to the zombies, but nobody who returns ever warns the others about it.A zombie goes from the roof of a tall building to a horse on the ground, and gets across town before a helicopter does that left before him.Zombie bites turn people in convenience seconds (which sometimes takes up to convenience hours).The whole movie flip flops from a heist movie to a rescue mission, but they don't even tell us if the person they rescued survives.The whole point of the mission is to get a blood sample of an alpha, and Mr. Tanaka is collaborating with the US military, which makes no sense, because the original alpha was in the possession of the US military; meaning they would have countless blood samples from the original, and would have no use for samples from secondary alphas. Plus if the military did need samples they would send in a special ops team to recover one of the alphas. They would not pay a businessman to hire random people to send in teams under false pretense hoping their goal would be achieved, and since there was at least one other team before Bautista's the military would have went with a better plan instead of trusting a bunch of random people; especially with a deadline of a day.At the beginning of the movie this zombie takes out half a dozen highly trained soldiers with assault weapons taking countless bullets, and obliterating them. At the end of the movie he struggles to over power a couple of muscular guys, and dies to a single shot. Not to mention he wears this half face bullet proof helmet that draws every bullet fired at him to it, but then the next scene he takes it off, and then the next scene he puts it back on, then he takes it off again.",Army of the Dead

2575,ceeivygreen,Satisfyingly gory...dreadful storyline,6,25 May 2021,The actors did a wonderful job considering the kind of characters they had to embody. The movie is lined with many revelations that eventually reach a dead end. The most annoying character (the daughter) manages to make it out unscathed and it was the most unsatisfying ending one could imagine. The nuclear blast alone would've killed her. And the character who makes it out of Nevada before he starts turning into a zombie doesn't match the timeline of how quick the team leader turned after being bit on the helicopter. Just seems like they were setting the stage for a second movie. All in all the action is pretty good and there are entertaining characters. But the movie would've been much better if they cut out the father daughter relationship.,Army of the Dead

2577,daryl_antenor,Non Spoiler Review: Army of the Dead (2021),6,26 May 2021,"The movie had some ups and downs. I love the concepts of how this movie provided some new twist to Snyder-verse zombies since Dawn of the Dead. Batista has been a giant for how he acts in movies on many roles as the strong guy! This movie did not disappoint for gore value. I still need a moment to wrap my mind on how the zombies in this movie break new ground from a point it was like George A Romero's Land of the Dead 2005 smart zombies.The only problem with the movie was it was casual, as if they were walking into some party. No prior preparation, Everyone is wearing sleeveless (Atleast cover your arms properly or wear some armour ) with no proper team work and eventually dying in vain. In Every movie there is some dumb actress who wrecks up the plot, in this movie its the Batistas daughter and Huma Qureshi (Mom). It's like bringing Suicide Squad to do a Heist movie. But yeah, I love Zack Snyder, he is truly a gem, I admire his work . I hope he can make it a better sequel. Next time less drama more action.

One cannot feel any empathy for them in the slighest.Almost 20 years later I still remember the Dawn of the Dead characters. They were relatable, they behaved realistically, like your average Joe/Jane would in such a horrific situation.I don't think I will remember the Army of the Dead characters two months form now. Most were there only to die goofy and illogical deaths.At the end of the day I just have no idea what was in Zack Snyder's mind.I can only imagine he wanted a ''turn your brain off'' action-comedy like Fast and Furious.But that just doesn't work when you go for a plot as grim as this.Fast and Furious was a good ''turn your brain off and chill'' movie because it had such possitive vibes to it.This one just doesn't have such a quality.At the end of the day it's a really bad and long movie and you would do yourself a big favor by just not seeing it.While the movie does have some (very few) good moments, these good moments are like a handful of oasis scattered in the Saharah.

2588,utomoganjar-61564,Is It Worth Watching !?,6,4 June 2021,"In a lot of his movies, I think ZS has a bad habit of throwing a bunch of small detail or mystery that isn't important with the movie is played, the reason must be to foreshadowing the next sequel who might be or not happening. For example like The Flash scene in BvS, The Post-Apocalyptic & The Manhunter scene in Justice League. In Army of the Dead, there're a lot of theories about Robot Zombie, and Timeloop that people think they saw in the movies, I think the scene doesn't really important because even in the movie they didn't explain it, and even if we cut out that scene, it won't change the plot in any way.The second thing about the movie is that I found a lot of plot holes in it, I don't need to list it here because there's a lot of people who also mentioned it before in another review which means that the plot hole is very easy to spot.The last is the characters, the majority of characters in this movie are stupid (especially the daughter), a lot of characters made terrible decisions leads to a lot of plot holes. The Daughter character played by Ella Purnell has a goal to save a mother that traps in a zombie quarantine area that she doesn't even know whether she still alive or not, and with that knowledge, she endangers her team in the process.Well, in the end, it's still a watchable movie if you're not taking things seriously, the visual is stunning like any other of ZS movies but that's it.

Here I get huge feeling, he didn't.Relations between characters are blunt and irrelevant. That showes you, that Zack shouldn't write dialogs. Every scene with main character (whose name I still don't remember) with his daughter is so boring, that you are tempted to skip the scene.Everyone in the movie agrees to go to zombie filled town to steal some cash, cause... you know... its... normal? It's really off puting when everybody is on board just to skip this sequence of the movie (it's not a spoiler, this is like 5-10 minutes of the movie).Some things blow that shouldn't blow. Characters forget what they were going to do, they go 180 and do something completely different, just for the movie to end quicker. Zack even bends time in one sequence of the movie, and I can't say anything else. It's laughable.Blurry CGI, weird shots, dumb plot, and blunt characters.

2594,tarkeshwarchatterjee,ohk ohk,5,25 June 2021,"A hardy team ventures into the zombie-infested quarantine zone in Las Vegas to pull off an impossible casino heist. Army of the Dead starts off in a more comfortable place than most on-screen zombie apocalypses. For starters, the flesh eaters in question have already been contained within the city of Las Vegas, not long after the opener. The government has also planned a nuclear strike that will clear out the infected once and for all.And so survivors who stay behind aren't doing it out of desperation. Former mercenary Scott (Dave Bautista) makes that choice willingly when casino owner Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) tasks him to recover $200 million from a highly secure vault. In the diverse team that Scott puts together for the job, they come aware of the risks to varying degrees and ready to rush swarms of zombies for their share of the reward.What insane and stupid things Man would do for money, though not all is in it for the greed. His daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) has a different quest in mind, setting her heart on rescuing her missing friend Geeta (Huma Qureshi) along the way. This isn't Zack Snyder's first foray into the Z wars. In 2004, he had directed an exciting remake of Dawn of the Dead, written by horror vet James Gunn, which impressed a number of George A. Romero fans. This time, Snyder takes over writing duties too and goes in a fairly different direction, favouring flashes of colour and a much brighter atmosphere than his gritty resumé.On paper, the light tone should work for the concept of a Danny Ocean heist in the middle of a Dead apocalypse. But the fun just wasn't enough to keep things interesting. The heist isn't a particularly clever one, with the team going through their tasks perfunctorily.At 2 and a half hours, even good banter can't prevent the drag of the long-drawn mission. Scott's arguments with his daughter feel more obligatory than emotive, setting back the limping pace. His brooding soldiers are hard to care for, with neither credible bond between any of them nor any common goal beyond money. Fortunately, at least two of the recruits come armed with much needed humour and personalities. Genius locksmith Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) comes with his relatable anxiety and ineptitude in Zombieland rules, while helicopter pilot Peters (Tig Notaro) gets her cool moments as she spews one-liners and smoke beside cans of fuel.Replacing a certain someone that shall not be named, Notaro's performance is impressive, on account of her acting entirely against a green screen. This expensive decision turns out worthwhile as Peters fits right in the rat pack, becoming easily one of the best characters in the army. On the zombie front, the alphas attempt to make their mark too. This new species runs smarter and faster than the usual shamblers, sharing closer DNA with the steampunk residents of Mad Max than the dreadful dead that Romero raised.The novelty, however, soon fades. Despite the dangerous implications of speed and heightened intelligence, the threat just doesn't seem that real when the alphas are open to bribery and negotiation.What's left then is a few memorable sequences that rely on its well-chosen backdrop. Cue the CG zombie tiger, whose feast almost rivals the Jaws cameo in Zombi 2. There is also the much anticipated heist escape that utilises the casino setting at last. If there isn't a better place than the city of sin for some fleshing-ripping carnage. Hell yes Vegas, for saving the day from complete tedium.",Army of the Dead

A girl with literally no idea on how to pull a trigger (Ella Purnell) decides to go alone into the DEN OF ZOMBIES leaving the protection of 'competent soldiers'.The performance by Bautista itself was so traumatizing to watch! Hardwick seemed like some cheap mimicry of JAX from mortal kombat. The rest of the characters get such less screen time that you dont even bother to register them.The movie can be seen as a cheap comedy with some action that is all. It was so bad that they decided to kill every single character that appeared on the screen so that they will never again have to even IMAGINE making a sequel to it!",Army of the Dead

Countless scenes felt super predictable, there still pieces I find myself going ""wait what was that for"" (hint, blue eyes, you'll know if you see it), they might as well just left out instead of having us scratch our heads. The film felt so poorly written, like they were banking on the fact that ""here's a new spin on zombies"", as well as ""let's make this feel more modern"" to sell it.The ending was awful, left some unanswered questions, and of course, left room for a sequel.Also, typical of Hollywood, stuff doesn't make sense in the film, and throw logic out the window.Oh and let's just say the ending, well I might as well have just watched Resident Evil Apocalypse (the 2nd one)",Army of the Dead

Snyder is not one.Army of the Dead is an overlong mess of bad scriptwriting, cinematography, editing, casting and everything else. If this is Snyder's ""unique vision"" it is fueled by completely misplaced hubris.Incoherent and just bad in every way. There are hundreds of (bad) Syfy channel movies that manage to be at least somewhat watchable in a technical sense. This one is pure garbage and someone needs to tell this to Snyder too.

But what you get in this movie is an interesting take on the entire zombie scene, this is not your stereotype zombie, an interesting deviation is always a boost.You get blood, you get action, you get an interesting twist to what the word Zombie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, its a nice no-nonsense zombie movie, dont watch this like a TWD fan, watch this as a zombie fan.Dont take it too serious either, this is not a movie for the artistic and/or dramatic or up-tight award-critic audience.",Army of the Dead

It took the long standing tradition that humans are much more of a threat than the zombies and bungled it to the extremes.

Her stupid antics not only jeopardize (and ultimately lead to the demise of) all the other characters, but even after all of that the friend she went to find is killed in the getaway, too.Basically, the ending is such a WTF moment that all the tension and story that preceded it felt like a waste of time.

From her reasonings to her decisions, she single handedly ruins the plot, and the movie would be better if her character was completely cut.Lastly, I don't know if certain scenes were existent before the Chris D'Elia scandal, but either way, they came off as preachy, unnecessary, and over the top to get a point across.",Army of the Dead
2694,MCruz21,Army of the Dead - Should have been a lot more fun,7,5 June 2021,"Army of the Dead, where to start... I'll say my expectations for this movie were considerably high, at least ""entertainment level wise"" high and, in that sense, it left a bit too be desired.In typical Zack Snyder fashion, Army of the Dead has some really great shots, Snyder sure does his best to make things look cool (the opening sequence is a great example of that) - which some other times ends up being his flaw, some scenes/shots feel a bit too ""forced"", essentially, sometimes he tries too hard to make things look cool.The cast and their perfomances were solid, nothing incredible that stands out (although I'll say Batista was a pretty good choice for the lead), but nothing too bad either.The overall story is a bit too nonsensical though, mainly the motivation (or lack there of) that the cast of characters have towards the goal that is the main story plot point. While some characters show potential to be interesting and remarkable, their motivations just end up being inconsistent or unrealistic.Naturally the more dramatic scenes take a backseat to the action/suspenseful scenes, one of the aspects where the production values show up in strength. Most actions scenes are at least solid, athough I'll say I wish I saw some more and it had a lot more potential to deliver in that area (I really wish Batista just wrestled some zombies).And speaking of zombies, the whole plot point of ""better"" zombies was a risk that did not pay off in my opinion, it just ended up being another very nonsensical plot point (also, zombie babies... what?).Now to aproach the strong points of the movie, I'll highlight the sound design and soundtrack, very solid overall. In the same way, the special effects were mostly very good (the fast zombie movement was a bit strange at times but forgivable) and, last but not least, the whole Las Vegas overrun scenario was very cool to see, it almost became a character on its own.Overall, the movie doesn't deliver in many aspects but also doesn't fail miserably in anything, still, it's a shame since it had potential for so much more and such great production values.Rating: 6,8.",Army of the Dead

CGI is regular, the zombie tiger, well, I have seen better, but the zombie horse was already too much ...On the other hand, we have already seen the same themes before: the plot of the father and daughter with a tense relationship, the mysterious character who sends them on the mission and his accomplice is the spitting image of the one who has a secret plan, the girl who has to go find her friend and separates from the group, etc ...And the way Znyder films is starting to get boring and it doesn't look new: lots of slow motion while music is playing (like a video clip), reflections and glare, very annoying blurring ...

Every thing they do is stupid and usually makes no sense. Daughter of main character is most annoying idiot I've seen in movies for years - think 90's teen horror stupid. During whole projection I was not able to focus on premise or visuals on great zombies as EVERYTHING they did was driven by them being literal morons effectively committing suicide by stupidity.Some people complained about it's length, and when I approached movie it was strange - as longer runtime usually means more story, more character development or at least some more cool visuals - in this one it only meant - more stupidity.Maybe if you are ""under influence"" it can pass, but other way I would steer clear from this morronfest.",Army of the Dead

I'll just never understand the corniness of some of these Hollywood writers/directors. Watching a movie like this made me think I could do a good job if I were given an opportunity to direct a movie because clearly talent is few and far between.To give insight to my opinions, I am very familiar with firearms and shooting tactics so it's often painful for me to watch movies where the director clearly had zero knowledge and gave no effort to portray competency with weapon systems. When Ana de la Reguera picked up her pistol in the opens act when they all decided to do the job, it was so blatantly obvious that she has never touched a real gun in her life and had absolutely no idea how to handle one. All the director had to do was have someone step in and take 5 minutes to show her how to make it at least look like she knew what she was doing but I guess that's to much to ask.Moving on, there were multiple moments in just the first quarter of the movie that I watched that were so cringe that it hurt but the one that took the cake was when the girl was asleep on her bed holding her rifle. That was probably the stupidest thing I've seen in all of 2021 thus far and was what ultimately lead to me turning the movie off.This movie is awful, the acting is awful, the writing is awful and the directing is awful.

That's new and fun. A zombie ""king"" and a group of zombies with a hive mind? Also fun. Do we get to explore any of that? Nope. It's there as purely plot movement but seriously this is far more interesting than a heist movie.All of the characters just fall flat. They all feel unoriginal and you don't connect with any of them. And backstories are only barely touched on which doesn't even help develop them anymore. Tons of cliche plot points and an ending you see coming from a mile away.In the end it just ends up being another typical zombie movie and it's too long for being a generic zombie movie. I would have preferred the humanization of the zombies to be the focal point and the heist the device that advances the main plot. I feel like there was an attempt here but it falls way short.

She already lost her mother, and now she wants to risk her life and HER DAD'S LIFE for a random mother at the camp? She's supposedly courageous but who is this stupid girl to go off on her own surrounded by zombies -- in a sleeveless t-shirt with ONE gun.BTW, what's up with the exposed torso, large earrings and puny t-shirts on the women---ooh yeah, right. We're supposed to think that's the reasonable way of dressing yourself going into a zombie infested city...I'd have more luck with duct tape on long sleeves.Bautista's character is in full gear with kevlar, the women are pretending they're going to the local fair. Don't worry about the long ponytails either, no zombie will ever think of grabbing them.The teen daughter again in that hallway shooting at the high speed running-toward-her zombies like she's some sniper marksman. All down from head shots, 'cause she's THAT GOOD.The first woman who is betrayed getting locked in, smashes through a window only to die in front of the bad guy and her friend, her friend standing there like a big pile of DUH. She not even screaming that the other dude locked the door.Also, they're in a group but no one seems to be paying attention/looking out for the others as they move through the building. WTF.The helicopter pilot telling everyone downstairs everything's ok as the engine's fried. Wouldn't you warn the others there MAY BE an issue with the ride?? Right, she was able to fix a burning, smoking engine in half an hour with no extra parts and a wrench I suppose.Did you care about any of the characters? I didn't. I wanted the daughter to die she's so dumb. She causes her dad to look for her --wait--9 minutes before the blast while he's flying in the helicopter. AS IF he would have time to find her and take her back to the ride. But he wants to, and he FINDS HER, and she FOUND the mother. In a building that's what, a hundred stories high? How many rooms did she go through? It's as if the characters really have no concept of time limits and their decisions don't reflect URGENCY.The helicopter crashes but the mom is not even mentioned LOL. I thought the whole point of the trip was for the teen to save her. She didn't even look for her to see if she's alive.The cash in the vault. $50,000,000 shown as a HUGE pile of cash. You know how much pallet loads of paper weight? A LOT in fact. How were they able to come to the decision they all would fit in the SMALL helicopter, WITH THE CASH, the weight of it all and how to transport all of it. I guess 4 duffel bags are enough LOL.The greed of the main character at the beginning, as new crew members are added each one gets less and less. Just $2M for the pilot who seems to be a good ""guy""? Are we supposed to feel good about that?The whole conspiracy about getting a vial of blood from the alphas. Sorry but the army was so dumb they decided to transport the zombie on the road and NOT collect samples of his blood first?Nuked Las Vegas and the guy stuck in the vault comes out with irradiated ambers and dust flying all around him but he's OK...ok...There's so much more, but any sentient being watching this movie should catch them all. There were some cool action and death scenes but it was all so ridiculous.

Too many plot holes, too many typical tropes, characters were stupid as in their decisions or just stood there and did nothing while zombies attacked.Zombie society made no sense and was given no explanation.It will make your blood boil or you'll be shouting at the screen, guaranteed.Locations weren't used for any really effect, could be set anywhere with and underground safe and story would be exactly same.Nuke and actions timing made no sense towards the end. 9mins really?By the end you'll wish a bullet strayed from one of the guns and went through your head.",Army of the Dead

I mean...the Glock locked back into the empty position...WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT. That's not how it works at all. Hey prop master? Having to jury rig a prop firearm to do that should have been the first clue you were doing it wrong.",Army of the Dead
2811,danieljbarrett-56867,Homage taken too far.,4,23 May 2021,"I'm a fan of most zombie movies, which is why I rated this a 4 and not lower. One big problem is how many scenes were just pulled from 'Aliens'. You have the Burke character sent along for a secret mission. He gets the McGuffin and locks the team up with the zombies (aliens) before running off and meeting his horribly telegraphed fate at the claws of the creature he made sure to mention his fear of. Then Lily has to cut the door open while the rest of the team fight off the encroaching horde and characters meet their end, just as they did in 'Aliens'. Unfortunately, there wasn't a single character in this film that was as memorable as Hudson. Then there's the scene with the helicopter, where Scott (Ripley) tells Marianne (Bishop) not to leave and goes to rescue Kate (Newt). He gets her out of the hive and the scene plays out much the same way, except the zombie doesn't hide in the ship's landing gear and just jumps into the chopper. These scenes were so blatant and beyond homage that it hurt the overall feeling of the movie and made the writing seem cheap. Not that it needed much help in that regard, because most of the moments not stolen from other films were the worst parts. The more I thought about those scenes, the more of them I noticed. There are even tiny nods to things like Vasquez and Drake with the interactions between Chamber and Guzman. Even some of the heroic sacrifice scenes started to look suspect. Still, if that was the only problem I could've given this a five or six as a popcorn flick, just for the action and how over the top everything was. Despite the lack of character development, it still had that team effect action movies often go for. It was just issue after issue beyond that though. I've already seen a few reviews point most of those out, so won't repeat them, but there was just so much wrong with how things progressed. The pacing issues were also an issue which most likely came down to the run time. I imagine after 'Justice League' people are afraid to tell Snyder to make things shorter, but this was an instance they could've. There are a wide variety of zombie movies, from the typical zombie/horror, to zombie/drama, zombie/action, and even a couple zombie/romance out there. There are far better zombie/action movies to check out. I would compare this one a lot to 'The Horde' (2009) but just because of the feel it attempted, which I think 'The Horde' pulled off much better.Another reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 1 or 2 is it is just a fun action horror movie and you aren't supposed to overthink it. I understand horror has a lot of suspension of disbelief to make it work at times, that we fans often overlook and still enjoy the movie. This movie just had too many of those moments that kept piling up and by the time the lengthy endeavor was over, it was beyond saving. What made it worse is that we know Snyder can do fun zombie flicks because 'Dawn of the Dead' was a great one. Of course, he didn't write that. A good example of where I feel he actually used homage compared to the later scenes he just copied, is the opening credits scene. It felt very 'Zombieland' but had a bit of its own flavor and didn't really feel stolen, it just felt like something he tried to put his own spin on.Long story short: There are plenty of better zombie movies streaming now if you need a fix.",Army of the Dead

There's also so many plotholes and unnecessary subplots that I'll have to spend a day if I want to explain them.

And artistically, this is a beautiful movie.Some positive points about the story are, that it is the first movie with a heist/zombie crossover and that the so-called Alphas are a new Zombie-species that can love, think and coordinate. Also, I found the music on point. The classical music, especially when they opened the safe and the Alpha made a cross through our Hero's plan, was absurd but so much so that it matched beautifully anyways. If it wasn't for the music, you could watch this movie perfectly without sound. The last positive point is that the cast is very mixed. They are not all Americans but also German, French, Mexican and more.In conclusion, although the story wasn't interesting and had a lot of errors, the art behind the movie was beautiful and interesting to watch.",Army of the Dead

Plenty have documented the absurd plot fails from the Zombie horse that can outrun a helicopter, to the fact that 5 people can apparently carry $200M cash between them (that is about 1.6 tonnes).

They could give them money for zombie sample mission. I think, they wanted to add a twist and they gave this decision late. They had to add it later and it just made the plot senseless. There were small and big absurdnesses like that and they really disturb you while you watch. Finally, who is Geeta and why is she so important?

I watched this primarily to hear another one of his amazing scores, as I'm not a huge fan of Zombie films however, being that there have been so many produced and are all pretty much the same; but.. back to the score.. I couldn't really hear it at times!! Compared to Mad Max and Justice league where the score was right up in your face! In this film to me it fell short!! So unfortunately I'm disappointed with the over all mixing of this film! Will say though that the music written for this was very good and very Junkie XL. What little I heard throughout the film.The rest was just another zombie film to me.Gore was great and over the top! Special effects were spot on! The actors performed very well, however some of them seemed to lack experience.Overall, pretty good film. But advice to the sound department.. Junkie XL's score needs to be in your face at all times!

I'm giving it 2 stars but if you like zombie movies & have the time it's worth a view. There's a LOT wrong with it but below are the ones I found most annoying.1. Many reviewers are correct that the daughter storyline is pointless. There wasn't anything in the movie to make her likable or relatable. Lots of screen time for Bautista but his character wasn't interesting and the only reason to root for him is because he's Bautista. It's about 90 minutes of movie with 158 minutes if run time.2. It had to many characters to make a good story for any of them. The zombie king and queen would've been a much more interesting story than the tired action adventure, heist with betrayal or absentee father storylines they went with.3. The biggest sin is it didn't follow its own rules. In the beginning the bitten turned with in seconds. At the end they turned when it was convenient. Bautista didn't turn until he says goodbye to his daughter & Van is able to escape a safe, carry bags of cash out of a nuclear bombed city, find a car, drive to an airport, rent a private plane and then starts to turn when almost to Mexico City! Also I know it's a movie with zombies but realistically he wouldn't have made it out of the underground safe and the radiation would have killed him. Just sayin'.",Army of the Dead

It is drawn out, comically bad, and doesn't have any set of rules or guidelines by which it abides. Some people are nearly instantly changed into zom is after being attacked, others can go as long as it is convenient for the script before changing. Some zombies are bumbling idiots and slow as a turtle, others have ninja speed and agility and the ability to dodge bullets at point blank range. Zombies can Apparently reproduce, have relationships, and are capable of feelings like loss and love? The plot holes are massive and plenty, and I actually found myself getting just frustrated watching it it. Let's not even get started on the fact that again, when it suits the script, people cant make point blank headshots, but the other 90% of the time the ""Heros"" are pulling off long distance, open sight headshots and never miss at those distances. And WTF is up with the fact that some zombies are part robot?! Seriously, this movie is trash. Save 2.5 hours of your life and watch nearly anything else.",Army of the Dead

Starting with the boss sending an awkward and unprepared team.The militar guys unable to follow direct orders. The only two survivors decide to walk away from the vehicle and off to the desert when there's a giant monster chasing them.The 'nerd guy' that has some kind of magical powers to open a super secluded vault in under 30min with just tapping his ear to the doir. He tries to be funny and you just want to punch him on the face.The vault is protected with traps that seriously reminds you to the beginning of the movie Indiana jones and the lost arc.There's some weird vampire vibes mixed with zombies.An extremely selfish daughter that puts everyone at risk to safe a woman, and at the end of the movie, at the scene of the helicopter, they don't bother to show us if she even survives.A kind of 'king' of zombies with her 'queen', having a random baby. Wth was that. Seriously.Oh, and the guy in the vault somehow surviving the radiation on ground zero, and not becoming a zombie for days or whatever took him to cross the desert??...The acting is not very impressive neither, but tbh they didn't have much to work with from the start.The script is really terrible. Everything is predictive and boring. This was such a waste of 2.5h...The music... completely random choice that seemed to be added just to fill the lack of everything else.

Okay, you might say it will have a spinoff made or whatever, but as a standalone movie there was no point of alphas and why they keep hostages instead of directly converting the people, and of what the zombie baby was supposed to be like. This is like how in GoT Night King's scene of converting babies is shown and is never used.There is no scene of showing that the quarantined people are moved out. So, for all we know Geeta's kids are dead. Also, Geeta is presumably dead in the crash and Kate somehow survives?And Tanaka just needed the head, so why did his security detail come to vault at all? Just go to roof already. And if you are coming to the vault then might as well get the money, why leave everyone behind along with the money?What was the point of the multiple timelines theory? Checkov's Gun.How did Vanderohe move out of the vault anyway? If the nuke broke the vault then he should have died in the first place. If the vault was strong enough to survive the nuke then Tanaka could have got his money by sending a crew after the nuke.Why did Tanaka need the the head (and the ability to create an army) anyway? At least mention that he has a contract from North Korea or someone.",Army of the Dead
2929,McCarron_Pictures,CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE HATE - Overall enjoyable film.,8,21 May 2021,"I love the style that Snyder approaches in his films the story telling through his visuals are outstanding. Withing ten minutes of watching Army of the Dead i knew why the outbrake happened, who the characters are and what/why they need to go to ground zero in Vegas. I enjoyed every second of this film with a great cast and entertaining story. I have been a fan of Zack Snyder since Sucker Punch and he has not let me down yet. The way i see it people expect far too much from films nowadays and are setting them selfs up for disappointment from the start no matter the story or plot. I do admit there is a couple flaws and thats why i have only rated it 8/10 though these flaws do not ruin the film so GIVE IT A CHANCE YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.",Army of the Dead

Really hard to do on this movie. Tons of plot holes, characters that weren't really developed or developed poorly and blunders galore. Honestly, Tig Notaro being digitally inserted after the fact to replace Chris D'Elia was the best part of the movie. All in all at the end, I had serious regrets about choosing to watch it in the first place and wished I had just gone to bed early and had some extra sleep.

What the producers messed up on was going overboard with the ""campiness"". It's okay to have a little bit of campiness in a film, but this one takes ""being campy"" to a whole new level. They made it so campy that they ended up making a silly cheeseball comedy movie. And it's easy to know why they made it like that. They wanted to dumb it down and not make it dark to appeal to a broader mainstream audience so they could get big box office like the MCU films.

I see a lot of people speaking like this was a good movie with some bad portions, but I am of the opinion that this is a bad movie with higher production value than most movies of this tier. First, it's way too long, it became an absolute ordeal about halfway through, not for any particular reason - it just wasn't fun (for me). A lot of the plot and dialogue is just corny nonsense. It's like a worse version of Dawn of the Dead. Things like robot zombies, zombie hierarchies, a pregnant zombie - will catch your attention and make you think, ""wow look at all these cool concepts!"" - but that's all they are. Somebody sat down and tried to cram as many cool things as they could into this movie, and none of it needs to make sense or even get explored, because rather than making one good movie, the producers have elected to make several bad movies to cash-in on these cool concepts. I won't get into the nonsensical plot, all that needs to be said is that this movie is a flashy, stupid, soulless film that tries to emulate the ""coolness factor"" of Michael Bay's style of filmmaking, but without anything actually ""cool"".",Army of the Dead

3011,sproudlove,Everything a modern blockbuster should be,8,22 May 2021,"Zack's most emotionally powerful film to date.Overall, it's up there with his best work.Army of The Dead is everything modern blockbusters should be. It is an entertaining ride from start to finish with fun characters, great performances and a pretty well written story.Zack Snyder's god-king visuals are present but they're not as abnoxious as they are in Zack Snyder's Justice League.Dave Bautista is bloody fantastic in this movie. A brilliant performance. Can't wait to see more lead roles from this guy. He can really act. He was given the best material in the film and he executed the hell out of it.Visuals are awesome. Effects were well done. Make-up was phenomenal. The zombies looked really really good. The GORE is insane!This movie is going to be the first in a franchise and this film very skillfully sets up both a prequel and a sequel.However, Zack Snyder has never effectively ended a single film he has directed. All of his ending have been pretty lackluster. His films tend to go on for an extra 10 minutes before finally ending. This is the case with Army of the Dead. There is a specific instance 5 mins before the end of the film where cutting to credits would have made quite the emotional impact. But the film continues on (to only serve the purpose of setting up a sequel) and gives us a bland scene before cutting to black. Zack simply has too much fun making his movies so I think he finds it hard to stop himself from stopping his creative flow. It's the best thing about him but sometimes he trips over himself by being too enthusiastic. I'm a die-hard Snyder fan but I can acknowledge his shortfalls.This movie (like other Snyder films) is also about 10 minutes too long. The film steadily gets better as it goes along and eventually builds into a thrilling final 40 minutes. Unfortunately, the first act of the film is mostly dialogue and some of the characters jusy weren't that interesting.Dawn of the Dead (another Snyder zombie flick) has great characters but only has good action sequences. Army of the Dead has great action sequences but only good characters. Except for Scott Ward (Bautista) who was exceptional.Nevertheless this is a full package blockbuster and I highly recommend it to any action/zombie genre fans.Snyder's having one hell of a year!I'd rank this as Snyder's 3rd best film. Behind Dawn of the Dead and Zack Snyder's Justice League.",Army of the Dead

However, the story delivers on all the elements you expect, leaving some feeling it was too predictable and cliche.I disagree.It is predictable in many aspects, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Without going into spoilers, it satisfies genre expectations with gory goodness, betrayals, and twists aplenty-but the movie drops clues along the way that there's more to what's going on than what the characters know and are focused on.The filmmaking is top notch as well, with the cinematography sometimes feeling like a mix between art house and Hollywood blockbuster.I can understand why it's received a divisive response.

The ending however is too cliche'. Can we have an ending at least humanity to stand on top and have the infection defeated once and for all, despite the tragic ending of the protagonists? At least try to have a bit of hope and human values at the end of the day.Some parts are unnecessarily too long-paced, like the Viva Las Vegas intro and the climax. Illogical storytelling like surviving the nuclear attack has to be necessarily written off.Overall, this is the most enjoyable zombie movie I have ever watched.

Reminiscent of zombielands opening you are certainly pumped after watching it and ready for a fun ride that never really takes off to where your expectations are set. It's still good but not on the same level you are pumped for.The film never take itself too seriously and neither does the cast which makes it all the more enjoyable for that alone. There is some good chemistry between some of the cast as they are soon separated into smaller duos and trios doing there own mini missions in zombie territory but due to the nature of the ticking clock scenario and so much screen time being squandered elsewhere we don't get to fully enjoy too much of this to the film's detriment.There are a number of mystery's, and set ups that unfortunately go nowhere, perhaps sequel bait but doubtful more than likely forgotten about and with a run time this long they could have easily been addressed and yes that run time, half an hour could easily have been snipped off here and there and would not have detracted from the film at all.Overall worth a watch its not the most brain-dead zombie film to watch and I managed to persevere to the end of the film without loosing any interest.

3088,wgcfqyxs,The film is much like this review... too long,4,28 May 2021,"This film was too long.There's 18-22mins of needless exposition. The pacing is just sluggish enough to keep you watching, but really your mind wonders off a bit and you think you missed something important. Nope, no you didn't.Character motivations also don't make a lot of sense and there's very little character development overall as well, even as they keep talking to each other... about nothing.I'd say I get it. It's a zombie movie. The genre is known for gore and grime, not Oscar worthy performances and plot. The issue here is the movie tries to be more than what it is and flounders. None of the characters are memorable save the watcher's frustration with them and their baseless decision making.Whole characters are introduced as being important to the motivation of others and the viewer never learns why- since they're never seen again. Minor spoiler: this is most evident in the end of the movie, which leaves a lot desired.",Army of the Dead

That's should be enough to hate this movie.But there is more... why do you have to crack the safe when owner should be able to help you with the code to open it???! And the most ridiculous scene with no hesitation is the ending... after nuclear blast guy walks out of the ruins in ground zero and walks away like nothing happened???!

Great vfx , great cinematography.But....the STORY LINE ! It had the most bizzare story line for a zombie apocalyptic movie.Highly inspired from korean movie ""Peninsula"". The motto left uncompleted, bizarre character traits. Most surprising for me was Kate was okay with her father killing her mother but she hated him for not consolidating her, running away. You must be kidding, right ?Not a great post apocalyptic movie I would suggest. There was no thrill, nothing. Only one time watch.",Army of the Dead
3109,souravkhaitan-43853,Not something to be proud of having seen it,4,23 May 2021,I am not sure whether Zack was trying to make a movie for martyrs or father daughter or zombie plus Avatar or heist or god knows how many plots got rolled into one and in the end all of them were half baked. The actors really did good but couldnt save it. Its oughts to sink but everything you dont get a chance to redo a movie and make it better.

Zack adds a lot a humor and still manages to keep the characters strong and relatable, specially the women. The movie doesn't end...

Dawn of The Dead (2004) is my favorite movie of all time so naturally I'm a Snyder fan. Not a sequel, but an expansion on Snyder's creativity for the zombie genre. This is Snyder's playground and it is FUN for all viewers. This is definitely more action than horror when compared to Dawn, but you actually forget to compare them since they are so unique in their own ways. THIS is absolutely a sign of prepandemic fun returning. Great film and I can't wait to watch it again next week at home!",Army of the Dead

3125,navneetkr-23104,Worst zombie movie ever.,1,22 May 2021,"The title pretty much sums it up. I mean there are comedic take on zombie movies which have a better plot and have lesser plot holes than this. It starts with a promising scene that might have set the tone for a serious zombie movie and then just goes haywire. The truck drivers have lights on their faces but they can't spot the car in front of them and they have to bicker like a bunch of 10 years old school girls? And the zombies are reproducing now? And how come it's only their chief who gets to mate? And you have contained them with a wall made of containers? That's it ? The team doesn't even react to losing their members. The girl who doubts Mr. Tanaka's man, the rest of the team doesn't even try to rescue her. She doesn't even reveal that the guy was screwing them over. Such a botched up plot line. Just bad make up and stupid growling sound doesn't make a good zombie movie. The daughter has bloody reason to assume that the mother would still be alive and to top that she walks into the sanctum Santorum of the zombies with just a small gun. To be honest, the real villain of the movie was this annoying daughter character. The plot would still hold some meaning if the entire point of the so called heist would have been to get the blood of the alpha zombies. What was the need to hide this detail from them? On one hand you are portraying that zombies react to noise and on the other you use use guns without suppressor. The guy who opens the vault, he does it just by moving the knobs and listening to it and we are talking about a las vegas casino vault. Dany Ocean should have hired just this guy instead of going through all that pain. And perfect headshots on their maiden attempt at shooting something. Girl with the severed head, what was the need for carrying it around? When the audience doesn't connect or sympathise with a movie's characters it doesn't get itself immersed in the movie and that's a clear sign of what a bad movie is. Army of the dead is one such bad movie. Disappointing from Zack Snyder.",Army of the Dead

People are acting as if it was supposed to be an Oscar worthy best movie of the year film but it's a zombie movie. Zombie movies are usually supposed to be action packed fun movies and this delivers. I wasn't expecting great acting or an awesome story but this movie still exceeded my expectations. It was fun, exiting and overly Gory- exactly how I want a zombie movie. However the movie let me down in one aspect. And that was the daughter character. I'm not the only one who absolutely hated her stupid decisions, how she basically got everybody killed and how she was acting as if she was a complete badass when she wasn't at all. This one character let this movie down for me but still I loved it. All the other characters are somewhat believable and you sympathise for so you just have to get past that one horrible character. Overall good movie that unfortunately falls into the cliche of dumb female who thinks she is better then she actually is and gets everybody killed.",Army of the Dead

Even the cinematography is jokes with all the close up shots that done of actors smiling/shooting amusingly.Just too many tropes.

Unfortunately it was just another zombie film. The characters were classic horror movie fill ins (just there to die). The film did have a solid back story. Dave Bautista was pretty great as the lead, I just wished the writers made him a better team captain (he left his two crew mates behind at the safe without even looking back). Ella Purnell's character was annoying (she risked her life to save a woman's life, but when the chopper crashed she didn't even check on her). Tig Notaro was obvious that she was recasted after production ended. Her scenes felt out of place.

Lots and lots off slow motion sequences that nobody asked for in moments of the movie that nobody cares for.My rating was one, tried to change for two, because the cat was cool....A bland script where's unfortunately the main actor looks like an expensive extra.

There are some unusual teases and twists in this movie and I would definitely be interested in seeing what insane ideas Zack Snyder has in store for possible sequels. At the end of the day, I wish people would stop being so absolute about things, I don't think this movie deserves the hate it's been getting.

3193,simonfredkelly,Army of the Dud,3,22 May 2021,"So much potential, so disappointing. . Overly long, unlikeable characters and a nonsensical plot get involved in several uninteresting action sequences. Spoilers ahead. An honoured ex-special forces, down on his luck, soldier is asked to take a team of his choice into the now zombie infested Las Vegas to steal cash from a casino by the casino's owner and super rich guy who wants to recover money he has been compensated for with insurance. Said soldier, Scott, asks no questions and is in. He assembles a team of annoying idiots including a crazy helicopter pilot for the planned escape he doesn't know about yet, a safe cracker for the vault his employer owns, a YouTuber he sees killing zombies and some forgettable stereotypes. Scott mustn't have been able to call any of his old special forces buddies or heard of anyone else trained in combat. Oh well. Fortunately, the Government has left the power on for some reason in Vegas and security around a city of highly contagious zombies is lax but soldier Scott still needs the help of his daughter to get in. She wants to go in and rescue a random mother for, er, reasons. Despite these contradictory goals and having little or no idea about the lay of the land, the team enters the city. Unfortunately, the government are going to nuke the city to rid the world of the pesky zombies, so there's a time limit. Fortunately, the teaming dead don't immediately overpower and kill them, having developed an unexplained hierarchy, with a 'king' and 'queen' zombie. After a warning that gunshots attract zombies, the team immediately begins shooting everything and after a few terrible dialogue scenes, they break into the vault they presumably could have had the code for. At this point they discover that the money was a subterfuge and their employer was just after a zombie head, which they could have picked up with ease near the city entrance. Sadly, I'm not making any of this up and the film gets even dumber and by the two hour mark I had no investment in any of the characters. I was annoyed at the government's tardiness and was willing them to drop the nuke and get the film done. It wouldn't end though and I sat through a zombie martial arts fight and a super dumb rip off of the end of Aliens, shoe horned in for no discernible reason. This film is a dull lesson in excess. Watch the director's remake of Dawn of the Dead, a leaner, meaner and much more entertaining film. Avoid this mess at all costs.",Army of the Dead

This movie really disappointed though. This movie has convinced me that combining ""heist"" with any other left-field storyline/genre just makes for a bad movie.!Army of the Dead was a bloated, trope-filled zombie flick, which keeps well within the genre (of zombie movies being poor productions), except this one had the Hollywood budget..! Yay?Zach Snyder makes what would be a 20-hour brilliant work of cinema/zombie storytelling, and then cuts it to all hell to fit the standard blockbuster time frame..! This movie is no exception. Endless and unrelenting cuts from scene to scene, boring and expected dialogue, rushed plot points, unceremonious execution, etc.Had the movie explored/focused on one of ANY of the aspects/plot lines more, it could've been a much better production. Government conspiracy? Cool. Father-Daughter redemption? Cool. A-team (or Z-team) reunion for ""one last job""? Cool. Intriguing and involved heist/drama? Cool. Zombie-evolution? Cool. VIP-rescue? Cool. Human v Zombie diplomacy/war? Cool. Campy comedic gorefest? Cool. All of the above crammed into a single movie? Not cool..
By the end even I felt like a zombie from watching this mind-numbing 150-minute movie.Pros:
Few good laughs, solid costumes/CGI/make up, decent action (though sparce).Cons: Stoic/impersonal characters, rushed movie with no redemptions nor resolutions, drawn out back stories for unimportant characters.I guess watch it once if you enjoy the zombie or heist genres.

But at the end of the movie the African American man waits out a nuke in a vault walks on foot with money out of the town to find a vehicle and then drive to Utah to rent a plane to fly to Mexico city and in all that time he's been bit by a zombie and just notices it in the plane bathroom.,Army of the Dead

Character decisions such as Kate's pretty much gets everyone killed. Honestly I don't remember the plot as much despite finishing the film 10 minutes ago.While there's a lot of negatives with this film, what I do like is the potential it has when it came to the zombies, the character Dieter, having Tig Notaro completely involved in the film and feel like it despite not interacting with a single cast member since her scenes were shot during COVID, and the action shots. This alongside Zack Snyder's Justice League really highlight the best and worst about Zack Snyder as a director.

The pacing was just fine and the length was spot on, I personally prefer a longer film. If I wanted to be in and out in an hour to an hour and a half I would watch a tv show... I made an account for this review specifically be because these people slashing the film will turn people away that would enjoy it. Apparently Everyone is a professional film maker now based in all reviews, they all know about using cgi or practical effects or how to write a script/ direct... would love to know what they actually do for a living or how creative they actually are. Bottom line, it's a zombie/heist movie and was very entertaining. Will it win awards? Probably not. Will it be a fun evening watching this? Definitely. Cool characters and some great action scenes. I gave it a 9 because yes the characters do make dumb decisions (what movie DOESNT have this??) but that wasn't what frustrated me, it was their lack of urgency, they just moved really really slow.

It has action, comedy, tears, laughter, sacrifice, betrayal and dare I say some interesting possible points of world building if you pay attention. Zack Snyder has done it again. In a world where everyone wants to play safe, at least Snyder has the balls to approach things differently. Loved the opening credits, though Watchmen still stands in front by a small margin. Overall, I hope this isn't the end of this universe. Like with the DCEU, it had great potential. The only downside is that it wasn't released in the cinema in UK as far as I know.

3211,devourpopcorn,A Great Solid Film,8,22 May 2021,"This film definitely is a pretty colorful take on the zombie genre, and it delivers. It's a pretty wild film that doesn't hold itself back when it comes to storytelling.The movie itself isn't really something that adds anything incredibly new into the oversaturated zombie genre, but it smartly uses elements from other genres (drama, heist, etc.) to create something a little more fresh.There are a lot of tonal shifts within the film between drama and humor, but it does a good job at them without making the story feel inconsistent. When the movie is trying to be funny or serious, you will know it.The weakest part of the film is definitely the writing of Kate Ward, the daughter of the main character. She's mostly used as a drama element for Scott Ward but not much else aside from this.Anyway, the movie is a solid 8/10. 7/10 is a reasonable score for this also. It's a fun zombie movie that definitely stands out.",Army of the Dead

I think using the dream lens was very unique and unlike any movie I've ever seen. It never hurt my eyes but I can understand your gripe, it's not for everyone. I love the whole heist cross over with zombie aspects, with a touch of Area 51, leading the audience to believe that the zombie outbreak may have been started by aliens. For anyone who follows TWD, that is a common theory that's been floating out there for years. Zack took that trope and applied it his movie. It makes the movie unique and unlike the same old boring zombie movie. Some think the movie was too long and it seems we (audience) have become prone to studios cuting down movies because they think audiences have short attention spans but we got to know a little backstory for most of all of the main characters, giving the movie a more emotional beat for when each character dies, to be sadden or cheered because they had it coming, unlike most zombie movies... when the characters dies....

The irony is that although the story line combines two classic narratives; money heist and zombies, it doesn't all play out as it seems.

I'll start by saying ""How long?"" It felt like I'd knocked 10 years off my life watching this. I formed no connection at all with the characters, I can't remember their names. All I can remember is that Juice from SOA is in it. Bautistas mumbling acting in this is confusing at best, it's as if even he's realised what a crock he's signed up for. As for the daughter, if she were mine I'd have thrown her into the zombie pit myself. The side story of her trying to save some woman I'd forgot about was pointless. It's basically her fault almost everyone dies. Oh and she survives a helicopter crash with not a scratch on her.. The story is all over the place, I didn't know what was going off. The zombie baby thing had me face palming and groaning like I was one of them.. The last 30 mins is laughable and the ending is a joke.

Interesting plot, zombies, and big budget, sounds great right? If you feel like your eyes need readjusting because of the blurry scenes where things are constantly coming into and out of focus then this is for you! Love Dave Bautista, but his supporting cast was just bad. No character development. Kate, the daughter character, is the true villain of the show and gets almost everyone killed (and survives a violent helicopter crash that killed everyone else in the helicopter). There was no pay off from the heist part of this movie either. Only two people survive from the team, Kate who I mentioned and another radioactive-proof guy who doesn't realize he has been bit and makes it out with three bags of money (walking through a nuclear wasteland first).

I have never left a review but I HAD TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT just to WARN PEOPLE. You will HATE IT. This is 100% honest review.The characters are TRASH! Where do I even begin? The plot is TRASH. Directing is TRASH. I mean, I love Raúl Castillo and Dave Bautista and I watched this for them...I think they are great actors generally but for some reason, their characters here SUCKED! How in the world did you even manage to make great actors TRASHY? Forget about the rest, they ARE PURE TRASH too! Very boring and unimportant. The only chick I liked was killed off from the beginning. The daughter is the worst character of all. She is SOO IRRELEVANT but they gave her so much screen time. She must be a daughter of the producer or something. There's no way she got this role with this basic acting skills.Anyway, DO NOT WATCH THIS! Save time and watch twilight.

3262,pcupid,One of the worst movies of all time,1,23 May 2021,This movie is terrible. Just a ploy by the Netflix marketing machine to stick Zach Snyder's name on the credits to draw viewers. The writer is a 25 year old which explains alot. Synder must have done a quick proof read on the script and waited for his check. Shay needs to improve on his pacing skills. I'm sitting here just waiting for this movie to be over. I am trying to watch it through out of respect for Dave Bautista because I love his talent. I feel bad it was wasted in this movie. CGI and effects deserve some credit tho. Predictable at every corner of the way. One big cliche for heist and zombie films taking the worst characteristics of both genres and turning it into one vomit of a story that rivals the mental stimulation of watching paint dry.,Army of the Dead
3263,eldataluta,Snyder dumbs down an intelligent character to force the incoherent ending,1,23 May 2021,"I enjoyed the first 2 hours of the movie as a bit of fun action with a degree of story. I even glossed past the stupid decisions, like bringing the daughter along.Then came the scene on the rooftop where Lilly is holding the ""Queen's"" severed head. She knows Vegas and how the alpha behaves better than anyone. If she was smart enough to pull out the head because the alpha would react to it, she was smart enough to throw the damn head as far across the roof as she could. This would force the alpha to chase the head away from the helicopter and Lily could've hopped in no problem. Then of course, the dad, the daughter, the pilot, and Lily would all survive. But no, Znyder had to dumb down a cool character to throw in his incoherent ending that has no saving grace to speak of. It's rare a script is ruined this badly.",Army of the Dead

3265,drakta,The things in this film that work were taken from other films.,3,23 May 2021,"I want to address something I haven't seen discussed in other reviews. Many of the scenes that work in this film are stolen from other successful movies. The artwork seems to be stolen from popular video games. Where to begin.For context, this was my wife's movie pick and I looked at my phone for a solid 30% of this movie. So, after you read this, you may notice other stolen scenes. I have no doubt there are more.I'll start with the art. The antagonist zombie and his horse are clearly copied from the Darksiders game franchise. The setting is from Dead Rising game. For those unfamiliar with those video games, a quick internet search will confirm to you what I already know. I am not a lawyer and I dont know how all that works, but it seems like Zach Snyder owes someone a check.I'm going to try to keep this next part short. The zombie tiger is introduced in act 1, and kills Martin (Garret Dillahunt, underrated) in act 3. Did that feel familiar? Thats because that is the hunter/velociraptor arc reveal from Jurassic Park! I was waiting for him to say ""clever girl""!I might have not noticed. But the real crime began before that. I noticed that the whole glowstick in the dark trick was from James Cameron's The Abyss. No big deal. Then one of the nameless heroines is sacrificed, similar, but not identical to the scene in James Cameron's Aliens when they are escaping through the tunnels. I, again, ignore it. I'm am a big Aliens fan, it is the peak of the franchise AND JC peak. Soon after, ZS recycles the exact scene again with yet another sacrifice, this time with grenades.Now this movie has my full attention. So as the helicopter approaches the rooftop of the casino, I know that when they come back, the helicopter won't be there, only to have it return just in time, only to have the pilot killed. Just. Like. In. Aliens. Gotta nuke the sight from orbit, only way to be sure.I see some calling it clichés and tropes. If its all from the same movie, isn't it plagerism?",Army of the Dead

The whole plot is unnecessary as in Tanaka did not really have to lie about the real reason they sent Scott and the team in. Telling them the truth would have more sense. Also, why do these type of movies keep bringing back the one annoying character who never follows what the protagonist says. We need to leave those characters in the 2010s. And not to mention the plot convenience like the team not helping Chambers and just standing there when they obviously had the time, the girl with Geeta was given no introduction so we already knew she was gonna die or Lily not backing up with the queens head.

3306,Jonalixr,"Bold, Fun, Subversive, & Emotional",9,23 May 2021,"Zack Snyder's grand return to the zombie genre proves the director still has so much to offer. In this one film, he simultaneously gave us a fresh take on the fictional concept of the undead and emphasized how they might be used for much needed social commentary.Most of the human characters of this film have personal motives and are not interested in heroics, which is to be expected in a heist film. Kate (Ella Purnell), Geeta (Huma Qureshi), and Lily (Nora Arnedezer) are the exceptions. Even though the rest of the group's goals are self-centered, most of them are likable, and the only ones who aren't are that way intentionally (such as Martin, who is a secondary antagonist akin to Carter Burke from Aliens).Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) and Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) have a playful dynamic, and the fact that they are shipped together by fans is unsurprising. Vanderohe is quite an interesting character by the end, as he raises questions about the true nature of the plot, and hints at the larger universe that Zack is building here. Keep in mind that the zombie virus is confirmed to be of alien origin (plus, there are numerous easter eggs in the movie to pique your curiosity), and you'll have no issue seeing the sci-fi potential of this franchise.The zombies of this movie are split into two categories: shamblers and alphas. Alphas are actual characters, rather than just mindless drones, and the progenitor among them, Zeus, is their ruler. He and his queen, whose canon name has not been confirmed, each prove themselves to be characters worthy of the audience's empathy. The zombie tiger, Valentine, was equally scary and adorable, and her scenes were all fantastic.Now, about the aforementioned social commentary in the film. The movie is ultimately about a group of people who have been screwed over, and are now being used and manipulated by the wealthy & powerful for their own gain. Beyond that, Zack takes multiple shots at the status of the United States and things that go overlooked in our society. The in-universe POTUS is incompetent, people have used the zombie virus as an excuse for their prejudice, and people in power, such as Officer Cummings (Theo Rossi), are often abusive with their authority. There is lots of this kind of stuff throughout the film, and all of it is worth hearing.Ultimately, this movie just hit different, and it's extremely worthwhile. It made me like zombies again and see new possibilities with them. I hope there is a sequel, because this sets up so much and can absolutely be the franchise to push this genre's limits to the maximum. Would absolutely recommend this movie.",Army of the Dead

1. Bad character development.Most of the characters died without even making an impact to the audience.The daughter who was trying SOOO hard to rescue some random character and who's stupid actions basically killed most, if not all, of the members of the team.2. Plenty of scenes that doesn't make sense.For example, that annoying daughter who can't shoot at point blank but perfectly gunned down running zombies like wtf?!Then, the useless daughter survives the helicopter crash while the others simply died. She was thrown off the helicopter and yet she didn't have any serious injury at all.Bullet that can split the alpha zombie's head but not his followers.3. Huge science inconsistency when turning into a zombie.While the majority of the chew toys turned in just a few seconds, one was able to give out his dying speech first before turning. The other one even managed to negotiate to ride a private plane.On a positive note, great cinematography and stunts (although not much can be seen), awesome soundtracks, and I admit that the concept of having a superior class of zombie is actually good.Overall, it was boring and disappointing.",Army of the Dead

3345,kcsuper,Zack Snyder falls short,3,25 May 2021,"Army of the Dead gave us a trailer that charms the viewer into believing that Zack Snyder has encouragingly returned to his directorial roots. I always admire that courage in a Hollywood filmmaker, especially one who is able to maintain a modicum of popularity in their career. 300 and Watchmen are some of Snyder's best work, while Sucker Punch and Batman V Superman left a LOT to be desired.Dawn of the Dead 2004 as far as remakes go, is Snyder's red ribbon winner. He gave us a well written, scored, casted, and SCARY zombie film, which fueled the faith of his fans when we heard he was doing yet another zombie flick. Needless to say, like most others, I expected another winner like Dawn, but got the exact opposite. Here, Snyder gave a lazy, watered down movie with badly written characters and even worse actors to play them. Again, with Dawn 2004, we had likeable and unlikable characters that you equally supported and sympathized with. In Army, every character is throwaway bad, it makes them expendable. Dave Bautista is such a one-dimensional and expressionless actor to the point where you wonder who the hell would ever deem him a worthy actor. He gives us gold with Drax in Guardians, but here he can't attempt to save this stinker.I know this is a zombie film, not an award winning masterpiece, but when the story and the characters (including the zombies) are not given much backstory or substance, it just doesn't work for me. Dawn hit every mark it needed to. This movie misses all but maybe two at best. As far as zombie flicks go, this is a solid C minus. Try harder with your next film, Zack.",Army of the Dead

But her story was horribly written and viewers are left to just assume she died in the crash. But Geeta is just portrayed as a random woman who Kate cares about for some reason. Absolutely no clue why.So many plot holes that don't make sense. Like why not just give them the safe combination instead of bringing a whiny safecracker that doesn't really contribute much to the team.

That is the point.It's all about Götterdämmerung, but despite Wagner and Joseph Campbell references, this movie is not serious and it shouldn't be taken seriously.I actually enjoyed this movie, albeit a little too long.

3372,michaelbarnaud,How to make a movie no one will watch twice,2,27 May 2021,"I have to say, the first 15 minutes are incredibly badass and set up what looks like it will be a great movie.And then the next 135 minutes happened.I am not sure how or why screenwriters keep doing this ""father trying to reconnect with daughter"" thing as the arc of the movie. It never works. Ever. Never. Ever. The whole ""the zombies have a society"" thing is preposterous and cheesy as hell. It would have been much better to leave them as what zombies are: a mindless horde and some are much tougher than others. Cool concept with the idea of an ""original"" and alphas after him and then the further it gets from the original, the weaker the zombies get. Great concept, just don't tell me they are organized. Just please don't. That's like starting the train down the track but right as you do, throw a stick of dynamite in the back and light the fuse. The best zombie movies have always been the ones that don't try to make zombies into characters.Despite all that, you introduce a seriously cool romantic plot twist and suddenly we have something to root for. You proceed to kill the girl in this equation within 10 minutes?! Following that, Batista is the only character that I wanted to live because he is the only one who is likable but he dies too because of his stupid daughter who is, judging by the input of nearly everyone else and myself, the worst and most annoying character in the movie by a country mile.By the time we get to the third act, this thing is a dumpster fire on wheels. Nothing makes sense. The original idea for the mission is completely abandoned, a huge deal is made of getting into this hard to crack safe and once it's opened, its like no GAF about what is inside or is really quick to abandon it after. The ""mole"" is pointless because: why send in a team of people and hope your one mole gets the job done when you could just send in a team of five special ops guys to get the head of one alpha and take it back?The only thing we know at this point of the movie is everyone is going to die based on the calculated way they are getting picked off one by one and Batista is going to die protecting his daughter and making up for his past transgression of killing his zombified widow. Or apparently that is not why she hates him now but don't ask me why she actually does; the reason does not matter and is so insignificant I don't even remember it. Completely forgettable scenes between him and her before that.Sure enough, that is exactly what we get. Also, why not lock the door behind you to buy time when you got to the roof knowing there is a really tough zombie on your trail? Nah let's just leave it wide open.Why would I ever want to want to see this again or recommend it to anyone? How about most of the characters escape with the money they came for, Batista and his unexpected love interest live happily ever after and Greeta meets a horrible end that she deserves? Or at the very least, the daughter is never a major part of the movie and is left outside? At least we have something to roll into that sequel with. Still trying to understand why anyone writing this thing thought the daughter should be the one who lives and everyone else dies. WTF were you thinking with that character?! Didn't you screen this somehow to gauge a response before you rolled with something no one will watch again?You wanna know how you might like this thing?

This girl left her dad to save Geeta, a woman that she had no relation with...other than a bit of friendship I guess (movie doesn't tell us), to get her dad killed at the end.

Because of this we / the Audience don't get a chance to make our own minds up about that character. It feels like the film should of been way longer but they shortened it down like with the music time lapse. The helicopter driver actor doesn't seem sure of who she is, she looks the part but is let down by her acting.Also this film reminds me of fast and furious how they gather the ""squad"" together, but they didn't do it well. When they all where introduced they had personal characteristics but it felt half done.I've also seen how much the budget was for this film ? The effects are create but the scenes are not as good as they could of been. The shots were too blurry for me, at points it strained my eyes.This is first time I've reviewed a film, I'm not a critic, I'm a student in media, I love making films just thought I'd share my opinions

The movie has the obvious double cross climax, where it turns out the Boss's head guy tries to betray all of them. This was so obviously coming the characters in the movie even discuss how they dont trust him and how they should kill him first. Not original in anyway, and also completely pointless.So why lead them on with a casino heist and try to kill all of them in the first place? If all you are after is the head of a zombie, one that greets you at the front gate, why not just hire some mercenaries, tell them the job is for the head, and pay them a million each? There was 0 tactical advantage for the fake heist/betrayal angle, and if you just told them to get the head of queen zombie, mission would have been successful in like 20 minutes.

3459,l-88998,Age rating '18+',10,20 June 2021,"... if you watch a miniature documentary for the film, available on Netflix. After it, I finally realized that the film is primarily focused on the visual. Everything here is dedicated to him. The script is riveted on the knee only so that the author of the movie could somehow fasten together the disparate videos that he wanted to concoct together as part of one movie with someone else's money (Netflix). In fact, I want to, of course, and I do. KinoPoisk, give me some money, I'll shoot something too... h-m-m... well, like in 'Super 8' (2011).I'll shoot a great movie. In short, the place of action of St. Petersburg or Moscow Time. The city was taken over by zombies or bankers. I have to rob the casino or all the banks of the rich people. I gather a group of desperate housewives, well, or thugs (what's the difference). I send them to the inferno of money... Or whatever it is... You have a lot of screenwriters working, I know. Something will be cooked up, and I'll just run around the playground with a hand-held camera. That's what Zack Snyder did, in short. And this is not a fiction. This is exactly what is shown in the short documentary. The sly one. That's why he smiles there all the time, gets high, as if a little boy has once again got his favorite and huge chupa-chups.Okay. I'll give Zack his due. He's always been a sucker for plotting, and he knows it. But in terms of visual art, he has his own talents. This (and Netflix's money) was enough for a couple of introductory videos, good scenes for an advertising campaign (mostly one trailer). And the rest had to be improvised.As a result, we have a relatively expensive movie thrash (this is not banter), shot by a famous director. For understanding, take a look at the page ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) by our director. Further comments are unnecessary. Then two people came together: Zack wanted to shoot just trash for his entertainment (to heal his soul after famous events), and Netflix needed a zombie movie with a famous director in the 'main role', well, in the director's chair. This movie is for watching with popcorn in a chair, perhaps with friends, if they need it...",Army of the Dead
3460,n-19694,Elvis is definitely out of Las Vegas now,10,20 June 2021,"God help him, with the disclosure of the characters-for a film like this, where there is a lot of action and you can immediately distinguish a scumbag from a normal person (well, isn't it clear that the hero Theo Rossi is still a scoundrel, and Ludwig is a funny guy?) this is not necessary. The scene of Vanderoch digging up a barrel of weapons in the desert was enough for me to know that, being a warrior, he was tired of what he was doing and was now trying to get over it, not really wanting to pick up a weapon. A warrior tired of war-everything is clear, why add something else, reveal his hero, if everything is clear - you just need to strain your brain a little. Why would I want to know the full story of Maria Cruz, if when she meets with Ward, it becomes clear HOW she looks at him and why she agrees to this mission.The main thing is that the characters were colorful and memorable. The company is diverse, but it is recognizable and original.

3461,z-06795-57900,Snyder's new Zombie Movie,10,20 June 2021,"I was familiar with Snyder's creations for a long time, starting with his very first film 'Dawn of the Dead', which for me is still in the top 3 best films about zombies. And I was glad to know that Snyder decided to go back to his roots and make a new zombie movie, so to speak. But was it possible to surpass his first film?The synopsis tells about a group of people who came up with a brilliant idea - to steal money in the most dangerous place on the planet, inhabited by a bunch of zombies. Yes, that's what the whole movie is about.This is a kind of typical action movie in the world of zombies, there is no emphasis on screamers, the film will not try to scare you, the only purpose of the film is to delight the viewer with the spectacle, and it does a good job with this.There is no point in talking about the plot and its quality, it is typical for this category of films, flat, direct and predictable. What can not be said about the characters who look colorful and lively, each character stands out and character and appearance, their relationship is even interesting to watch.The most important plus of this film is how Snyder perfectly showed Las Vegas in the zombie apocalypse, the zombies themselves (their appearance and skills) and the action scenes. All this really looks so beautiful that you even stop noticing other shortcomings. And I would even say that this is the only reason why it is worth watching the film.But as in any Snyder film, and here it was not without clips, although they looked beautiful, but that's exactly what I do not like in Snyder's films, beautiful shots with great music, but having no meaning, cut them out, and the film will not lose anything, and the film I remind you goes more than 2 hours.As a result, Snyder shot a typical zombie movie with an excellent picture and a banal plot. In principle, if you watch it purely 'under the beer' and as entertainment, then it will undoubtedly go.",Army of the Dead

Had Martin not decapitated the queen then the Alpha wouldn't have sent all of his minions to where everybody else was. Had all the minions not been sent there... The others would not have died. Now granted... Scott and Maria probably would have died because they would have gone after Kate. But, she's not responsible for the others dying. Martin is totally responsible.That being said the movie was so so. I enjoyed watching it but that's my prerogative. I did not understand the whole robot zombie stuff or the baby plot. But maybe it will be explained later? I don't know. I also was annoyed that it took Van a whole long time to be turned. I did enjoy his banter with Dieter though. As for the whole Geeta plot... I think you can kind of see her body like hanging out of the helicopter... But the scene is so damn blurry I can't really tell.It also irritated me how they're just like stopping at the helicopter to have a chat and a look. It's like get the Hell in the helicopter fly away.

If the film was a tad shorter maybe something like 90 minutes I might of given it a higher rating.

Half of the films plot is because a character we don't really know goes into the city for reasons and her daughter is her friend so she HAS to go in and save her. That character, Greeta(?) Dies at the end, probably, it's not actually shown because screw her who cares. I feel like that whole side plot was forced in so as many characters could die as possible which is extremely frustrating, I don't mind a film not having a happy ending but when the cause is for something/someone that does not matter at all... meeehhhhhhWhile I thought some of the acting, particularly by Kate was really good, there was a lot of fun in it particularly the first half, there was a lot of writing choices that were extremely unnecessary.OHHH and Van surviving at the end, I was really happy about, I liked his character... but then he also dies as well...

Otherwise it's so riddle with problems that it's nearly impossible to get into. The characters are uncharismatic and poorly acted, the plot is riddled with giant gaping holes, and the movie sets up numerous potential plot threads/devices that go nowhere at all and are never mentioned again.The hardest one for me to get over was the fact that the bank heist was just cover for sneaking a mole onto the team to poach the head of a zombie so that the military could engineer it into a weapon to control all of the zombies. If that was the case, why not just send in a full team of highly trained soldiers who are fully briefed on what they need to do, rather than the fake heist BS? And even after the guy has the zombie head, which he achieves quite early on and very close to the entrance (he could've just turned around and safely left) they go on and do the heist anyway. Between that sort of bad writing, the fact that they have a million different types of zombies for no reason, including robots, and the blurry ""never in focus"" approach to directing that Zack took, it was a thoroughly unenjoyable mess.This movie isn't mediocre, it's terrible.

3485,grafingerchristoph,Why Zack Snyder doesnt understand culture,5,30 October 2021,"My final comment to this movie was: ""It´s so bad it´s almost embarassing""And thats not because its a Zombie Movie, or the acting was bad. It´s a decent piece of entertainment. But Snyders understanding of music, culture and cut is just straight out aweful. Coming from the ""Prequel"" Army of Thieves its just an embarrassment for Synder, who claims time and time again he isnt given the freedom he needs. It also just doesn´t use any of its prequels characters beside the sterotypical interpretation of a weird Germanguy. He gets a whole 2,5 h to show just how aweful directing and cut can be.The characters introduction get a whole of 2-3 minutes, sometimes less. The cuts don´t allow any of the atmosphere the scenes might allow to develop any kind of engagement to the story. Instead the movie opts to focus on cheap lines, forcing emotions and every now and then a big explosion (if its TNT or Zombieheads). (Spoilers) The worst thing for me was (almost) the ending scene, playing Zombie from Cranberries, (this time the actual piece and not a cheap cover from The Doors ""The End""), which is about the cruelsome conflict in Ireland and not in any way or form about Zombies. It just doesnt serve the intention of the song in any way.What i did like about the movie was, surprisingly Bautistas performance who proves time and time again, that given the right character he can perfom as an incredible actor. The cast was decent, even given the standard ideas of who might be a ""bad"" or ""good"" guy.All in all this could have been a way better movie, but it does deserve more then 4 Stars given, it is enjoyable at times. Just don´t dig any deeper.",Army of the Dead

Does story even matter anymore or is it all about silly one liners that don't work and movies that try too hard and fail miserably? Hollywood seems to be pumping out a lot of this nonsense lately. The industry is way too saturated with terrible ideas. It doesn't take much to check out some new blood on coverfly and find some good, fresh material.Did the actors even try? The performances were cringe worthy and not even mediocre for an action flick. Casting was terrible. Very disappointed.The plot...well, It was a joke. The big reveal for why they are really there is extremely weak. They didn't need the entire heist aspect at all. It actually took away from what this could have been and was a waste of budget.What did the characters gain in the end? Absolutely nothing. They don't get the money. The woman that one of our protagonists goes to save doesn't survive. Everyone's sacrifice was pointless and for nothing and the only survivor seems to be written in as an afterthought so the film would have a survivor and avoid the stereotypical bleak Stephen King ending that studios don't like. Does the daughter even need to be in this movie? The entire father, daughter relationship/conflict between the two main protagonists just didn't work. It was superficial at best. No depth or development. I didn't care about these characters. Why should I? Seemed like the ending was just written to fit the mold: Action hero dies in the end. Only this time it was needless.The runtime on this film is far too long, and could have been trimmed of an hour worth of fat that had me unengaged and thinking about this first ever review of a film I have ever done and left me asking the entire time-What was the point?Please, do not release the Snyder Cut.",Army of the Dead

3510,filmnineupper,Disappointed as a Zack's fan,6,3 June 2021,"A new Zack Snyder's zombie movie was released. As a fan, I have been waiting for a long time with enthusiasm. This is his second zombie movie since 2004, the last one was Dawn of the Dead, remake of Geroge Romero zombie movie in 1978. Back to the topic, Army of the Dead was an original motion picture, it was about Las Vegas being infected by zombies, the whole zone has been quarantined and is going to be destroyed by a nuclear bomb. A Japanese tycoon offered a job to leading actor Scott Ward, to cash out 2 billions from a casino building in Las Vegas with a team. Moreover, he needs to escape before the bomb hits into the city and not be bitten. However, things are getting worse in some way.In my point of view, I was considerably disappointed because two and more than half hours told merely nothing. However, I would go into the positive side at first, it is obvious that the message of capitalism implicitly covered the movie from the outset, the destiny of every character is caused by money. The richest tycoon hired Scott Ward, who offered small-scale amount of money to the others. In other words, greed is good to die. Zack wanted to criticize evil capitalism. The rich lost their money, by contrast, the poor lost their life. It is obvious in the movie. On the other hand, I particularly appreciate the photography of the movie, such as the scene of the close-up of the zombie queen, the whole shot was out of focus after she went out of the screen.In terms of weakness, it is undeniable that there are few obviously. First, Zack didn't build up any characters in the movie, as well as Scott Ward. The audience would not feel upset or worry about what they encountered. We just see life and death, in spite of the fact that they died tragically. Second, the story was too flat, Scott Ward spent 30 minutes to unite the crew without obstacles in the beginning. In addition, there was one ridiculous scene, in which one of the crew was dying by crowd zombies bitten, it was caused by ""the mole"" who served the rich Japanese. Peculiarly, the one who was dying didn't say anything about ""the mole"" except one word for her lover ""RUN"" before she turned. If you want to kill time, go ahead. If you are expecting something like Dawn of the Dead, you must be disappointed in a way.",Army of the Dead

3515,kevjohn2002,THIS Snyder Cut needs a few cuts,4,8 June 2021,"Army of the Dead is quite a bit of a swing and a miss. The basic problems are that the film commits the cardinal sins of not having a single character that you actually care about, the runtime is far too long (at nearly 2½ hours... is this the longest zombie movie ever?? -*), and the movie's pacing is way off. After the opening sequence and credits, which were flashbacks, there really isn't any action in this ""zombie action film"" for an hour. That might be acceptable if the trailer hadn't painted this to be a fun-filled, non-stop zombie killfest. Suffice to say, AotD will most likely not live up to most people's expectations.SPOILERSThe characters... oh myyy. In between the relatively few action sequences, we're shown a cast of characters who are mostly either walking clichés or straight up ripoffs of, oops I mean homages to, better characters from better films. Anyone who's seen ""Aliens"" will immediately recognize at least two characters right off the bat. These characters not only act the same and die the same as their Aliens counterparts, they even dress the same as them! Beyond that, there's Tig and a German safecracker to provide some much-needed comic relief, a rich and powerful Bad Guy who's primary motive is to get richer and more powerful, a crooked law enforcer who gets his comeuppance, a showy influencer type person who is too full of themself (a relatively newer, yet already tired, entry into the movie trope catalogue) but thankfully turns out to be not nearly as annoying as anticipated, a few selfless hero types, ... and oh lord... THE DAUGHTER! Scott Ward's (played by Dave Bautista) daughter is, quite simply, the absolute worst! There is not a single thing that she does or says that is not on a Jar Jarian level of annoyance. Except Jar Jar was just a bumbling goof, whereas everything she does is intentional. And seeing that her obviously risky actions ended up getting numerous people killed, including her father and presumably the one person whose survival she apparently put above all other concerns, she's objectively much worse than Binks. I do believe she is a failed attempt at creating a 'Mary Sue' by Zack Snyder and his co-writers. Instead, she is the iceberg that would have singlehandedly sank this titanic disappointment, were it not for the movie's numerous other flaws lending a helping hand in the sinkage.Being a fan of Snyder's Dawn of the Dead film, and after seeing the cast and trailer, I'd allowed some hope to build up in my heart and mind that Army of the Dead would be a film that I greatly enjoyed. Not so much. Perhaps the nearly hour-long difference in runtime plays a part in that. This is my biggest entertainment letdown of 2021 so far. But it's only June, and now that films are starting to be released again, albeit at a trickle, there's still plenty of time and opportunity for other candidates to claim that title.* - I just checked. By only a few short minutes, it's the second longest zombie film ever made. The longest one is Dawn of the Dead, the original Romero version.

3525,solomonkamara80,What I expected from a Zombie movie,10,22 May 2021,"I usually don't watch too any zombie movies but this one had me hooked. The intro credit was one of the best I've seen, second to only Watchmen. At first I was taken back by the dream lenz, however, eventually it grew on me and I found it very aesthetically pleasing. Apart from the daughter, every character shines in their own way. Though I think the daughter could've been omitted from the movie, it gave Batista the opportunity to shine as an actor. And I'll say, he outdid himself in this movie and it's easily his best performance on screen. He got to be a badass while showing his acting range with more emotional scenes with his daughter. That's the only reason I tolerate the daughter. Moving on to good characters. The pilot woman was easily my favorite character in the movie, Although she didn't get as much screen time as some others in the movie, whenever she was on screen I was instantly engaged. The bromance between the chain saw user and the Irish man was also well done. One problem I had with the movie was it's length. Because of this I almost gave the movie an 8 out of 10, but I'm seeing way too many comments unjustly bashing the movie for lame reasons like hating Snyder fans (for reals?). That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would say that it's a must watch Zombie movie. The whole Zombie hierarchy with intelligence thing was super interesting. For the first time I felt sorry for the zombies and thought they were in the right to kill Batista crew even though it was all the Soldier implanted by their employer's fault. The zombies had a society almost like a very primitive human tribe. All in all, I'd say watch the movie for yourself and give it a try.",Army of the Dead

Yet not much really happened.4) The acting was pretty bad. No chemistry between the main characters.5) The effects were terrible.6) Storyline had so many plot holes and didn't really explain anything. Like how did the zombies come about? And why are they more responsive than the usual type? No clues.7) No really back story of why 'John from walking dead' wanted to kill the team he went in with?8) The bomb - if it was powerful enough to blow open the safe, it would have most definitely killed the guy inside. In addition, surely the bomb would have also brought the helicopter down, they were so close!

At the last minute, both appear over the edge of the building from below.-The Queen Alien/Alpha General makes it onboard the dropship/helicopter just as it's taking off.Also, two characters barely escape into an elevator and there's vapid elevator music playing. This didn't happen in Aliens -- it actually happened in Deep Rising. Zack Snyder's so creatively bankrupt he actually rips off ripoffs of Aliens! (Side note -- when was the last time you actually heard music in an elevator?)I got excited when I saw that Tom Holkenborg (Mad Max: Fury Road) did the music. By the time the end credits rolled, I couldn't remember an original score at all.Zack Snyder should at the very least never be allowed to photograph his own films ever again. Just looking at this movie reminded me of Battlefield Earth, only exchange endless, nauseating dutch angles for endless, intentionally blurry footage with an incredibly shallow depth of field.If James Cameron can be legally compelled to add ""Acknowledgement to the works of Harlan Ellison"" to the beginning of the end credits of The Terminator, I sincerely think that, if he decided to, he'd have every right to take legal action against Zack Snyder and Netflix for intentionally lifting practically the entire third act out of one of his best movies.This turned out to be the first Zack Snyder film I'd seen in 10 years, after 2011's godawful Sucker Punch. I'd argue that Army of the Dead is worse; Sucker Punch was at least so hollow that it left me numb. Army of the Dead actually made me angry. I refuse to sit through another Zack Snyder film until at least 2031.",Army of the Dead

In several occasions I was able to foresee how a given scene would unravel.Moreover some action shots are poorly filmed and there is a section of the movie in pitch black, so you can't really see anything.The characters are bland and clones of action movie archetypes.There's also a father daughter sob story tossed in the middle of this, and it's just cringe.Bottom line, your usual TrashFlix movie.",Army of the Dead

I mean I couldn't even finish part 2 of the Justice League from Zack and this one is worse than that. I was out at the 20 mins mark. The execution is bad, the camera angles are bad.

I cared when each and everyone of them dies. This movie is very reminiscent of Aliens. There is a character very similar to Paul Reiser's Burke, there is a relationship very similar to Lt. Gorman and Private Vasquez. I was lucky enough to see this movie on this big screen, first movie since covid. Yes, there are a lot of plot holes. Why doesn't the government just drop a bomb on Vegas?

3563,MrHarish,"Fun ride, but didn't stick the landing",6,22 May 2021,"The film has a strong enough start setting the situation up, and slowed down for a moment with the building of the team. Then the film became a bit more engaging as the team got to Vegas and became thoroughly entertaining. Nothing particularly fresh outside of the way the zombies work, and the characters were mostly well acted with the safe cracker being more standout for our family. The action was fantastic at times with strong moments of tension.All in all though, as the ending happened we became frustrated at the awful way they set up the poorest effort in tension and payoff. Abysmal ending. I hate it with a passion because two hours of enjoyment ended up with 20+ mins of head shaking and outbursts saved for d-movies such as ""no, why would you do that?!?"" And ""for the love of all things good, use some BLOODY COMMON SENSE!!""This is the rub. Why would a film not use common sense? It's so obvious why some things shouldn't happen. Also, the inconsistency at the end. No spoilers but how does something affecting absolutely everyone within a certain time then affect someone at the end completely differently? I hate these basic story telling problems.Outside of the mentioned issues, the film was shot beautifully well and it was a fun enough ride. The premise is good and for the most part played out well. I feel with just a bit better editing in some areas the film could have been an 8/10.As it stands with the noted issues it was a frustrating 6/10.",Army of the Dead

The writer and director has no sense of mixing up a thriller movie with a drama punch. What was the movie actually about and what did they focus on no idea at all?? Even the movie title doesn't really suit.The characters were picked good but the action was horrible especially the daughter's character; a pain in the movie start to end. She becomes the hero's for trying to save a not so important character; another big mistake in the movie. If the director had tweaked few of the characters actions and change the storyline a bit it would have been a really great movie.,Army of the Dead
3567,thebishi,Enjoyable until the final act,6,21 May 2021,"While the movie starts off with strong potential, it quickly becomes a satire, being a hack job of Oceans 11 heist film, Land of the Dead and a bunch of other zombie tropes.Poor decision making by most characters, and an annoying ""I will get my way"" daughter makes for several idiotic plot hooks that make little sense.Bautista is one of the few actors in this who gets to carry the plot even though his writing is pretty bad, then again he's also the only character we get to know anything about. Ella Purnell as the daughter is unlikable from the start, and doesn't get much better. ""We have 30 minutes before a nuke obliterates Vegas, guess I'll go out on a random goose hunt across Vegas for a friend who MAY not be dead after 2 days in a zombie infested hellhole."". As I said, making bad choices trope at work.The gunplay is over the top fun like the Expendables, and by god are they expendable. Turn off your brain like a good zombie and enjoy a 2 hour comedy movie with great special effects that on the whole is quite enjoyable as long as you're not expecting anything new to the genre, that thanks to the inclusion of ""Alpha Zombies breeding"" feels like it might actually be trying too hard.",Army of the Dead

Apparently it's possible to survive a nuclear bomb being dropped right on top of you. Awful...just awful.

Fine, but it's exactly the same plot and that makes for a VERY predictable movie. Add in weakly explained story points, poorly developed characters, awkward serious moments, and some heavily overused out of focus cinematography, and you have yourself a pretty blah movie. Positive side is there are some great action sequences, zombies are always fun, a kernel of some good ideas, and Bautista plus a few other solid actors are in the movie.

3601,sachinerbam4351,The occasional mediocrity from Snyder,6,19 July 2021,"I'm utterly disappointed with the final product Snyder has delivered here. The creative freedom was there, the budget was there and there was a great cast; and yet they made a mess out of it. The story is filled with loopholes and some characters, notably the daughter and the Indian mother were massively stupid; but then that's what drives a disaster zombie apocalyptic movie. The character development was miserable. Things to be applauded here though, would be the visuals and performances from Batista and the main supportive cast - Omari, Ana and Tig.",Army of the Dead

There have been so many cult classics in the past that have done it well. This one wasn't. Not even close.If someone told me this movie was directed by the same director that put out justice league I'd have never believed it.Onto the movie, the casting was horrible, the story was poor, there was no character buildup at all, the script was abysmal, any attempt at humor falls flat.At times you feel that this is a spoof of what a really bad zombie movie would look like.Bautista does his bit in his role but is limited by how bad the dialogues and script is. The action has nothing of note that you haven't seen before and is not entertaining. I remember just 10 mins of action being worth watching in a 2.30 hours movie.If you have 2.30 hours today, go for a walk, go for a bike ride, start a game or a new show but please do not watch this garbage.Netflix really has no clue about making movies.",Army of the Dead

Scene movement and structure flowed well and transitions were tight snd well executed. Humor is there, some delivered great, some not. Daughter clichè has been done but can understand that direction due to the story. Speaking of that, new twist on an old and aging genre was great and very well needed.

3614,dpgagnon,Disappointingly Mediocre,5,22 May 2021,"Incredibly mediocre zombie flick with poorly written characters and decent gory zombie action. Honestly felt more like a Bay film than a Snyder one in the worst way. Snyder isn't known for his writing but typically makes up for it with style, but this had hardly anything worth mentioning. Quite disappointing.The plot is threadbare and the characters are awful, especially the daughter character who might as well be the main antagonist given she's the cause of nearly everything that goes wrong plot-wise.At 2.5 hours this is at least 30 minutes too long with tedious stretches of pointless dialog and poor character building (i.e., most of the ""refuge camp"" scenes).Don't waste your time unless you really have nothing better to do. The only redeeming factor for me, and the reason I'm giving it 5/10, is that the action involving zombies is gloriously gory and over the top in a way that I enjoy from dumb action flicks. If it wasn't for the action scenes I would've turned this film off well before the end.Netflix movies are always so disappointing and I don't know why I keep giving them a chance to change my mind.",Army of the Dead

I'd say it's more on par with Z Nation- it doesn't take itself to seriously.There is a lot of world building going on in this movie and it requires the viewer to do a lot of work. In fact a lot of the ""plot holes"" a lot of other reviewers have complained about are part of the plot. Don't get me wrong, there ar upe definitely some plot holes, but the other reviewers clearly either didn't pay attention or are just here to hate on the movie. Aliens, Robots, Zombies, and probably time travel or alternate dimensions. The movie doesn't clearly explain that, but I'm assuming it'll be brought up in the sequel.My main critique is that it felt shallow at times. The acting isn't the best by any stretch of the imagination and leaves a lot to be desired. But then again, it's a zombie movie led by Bautista.",Army of the Dead

It's biggest flaws are let down on the technical side, Snyder's love for the Canon Dream Lens (explaining all that artistic blur which you may be familiar with in the Justice League Snyder Cut's Knightmare scne). Making it feel unwatchable at times in favour for artistic flair.And the dreaded annoyance of the dead pixel (which you can hope will be fixed now post release) will have you wondering if your TV is on its way to being replaced.You're left feeling if these weren't present it would definitely make the film more favourable.",Army of the Dead

The movie isn't cool enough to put this kind of stuff off. There are tons of plot holes. Not character development. Not character depth at all. The narratives are so unexplainable it's hard to believe someone allowed this movie to be shot. The main plot is so badly constructed that the multiple side narratives, as bad as they are, doesn't take too much attention from the many, many illogical moments.

The special effects were good but a good movie doesn't rely solely on CGI. It had it moments but in general it felt rushed and not consistent.

Such a waste of big budget on a movie with terrible writing and basic snyder cut nothing original at all. Just trying there hardest to stuff in as much action scenes as possible with no story line. Like yeah sure lets bring a teenage daughter thats gona run away any time throughout the movie for the hell of it. Oh but wait we ve a another guy with us thats gona ruin our plans for his boss but no one cares enough to keep him in check. And another helicopter pilot thats the only badass thing about her is she smokes cigars like a lollipop. Oh but here is the biggest original idea of the century we MADE THE ZOMBIES SMARTER OMGGG. Was looking for sth fun to watch but ended getting my blood pressure up with a cliche big budget movie. Honestly think 5/10 is a generous rating.,Army of the Dead
3672,gtinister,With his latest zombie movie - Snyder proves that the genius behind 'Dawn of the Dead' was James Gunn.,2,8 June 2021,"James Gunn would have had so much fun writing the script for the concept behind 'Army of the Dead'. Gunn's dark sense of humor and wit is sorely lacking in Zack Snyder's unofficial follow-up to Dawn. Dawn had a script that actually evolved the genre into a modern setting - and contained convincing characters with believable motivations. The characters in Dawn weren't carbon copies of each other. Every single character in Army is presented as guys (and gals) with guns. It doesn't matter what their back story is (we're shown very little of it). They're handed guns and from that point on for the rest of the movie - they miraculously transform into efficient zombie killers. That's the extent of their character development. The characters in Dawn were each fully fleshed out people who are tossed into a circumstance beyond their control - forced to learn to put up with each other and learn to work with each other. Relationships and sub-relationships are born, and as a result you connected with them as you watched them adapt to the challenges of their new existence. And you feel it when they die. Everyone dies in Army - and you don't care about a single one of them.Snyder's new movie is also barely a zombie movie. Dawn wasn't a great zombie movie simply because it had the walking dead in it. Gunn made the effort to set up a believable world in which the dead come back and they present a clear, specific danger to the living. Gunn's script convincingly shows how survivors would be forced to adapt to such a world. And Gunn did it without skirting around logic and common sense. Gunn's world set up rules. If you want to survive in that world - you adhere to those rules. Snyder's Army tosses logic out the door for the sake of setting up a series of action and visual sequences. Snyder repeatedly breaks what little rules he defined. But that sacrifice of logic means the sacrifice of any REAL consequential drama or suspense. You watch characters get killed in Army - one after the other - and it doesn't mean anything. While in Dawn - each character's death is felt by other characters (and by the audience) in a real and often devastating way.And it is that brutal reality presented in Dawn that makes the zombies in that movie feel like a REAL threat. Even when zombies aren't in the scene in Dawn - the audience feels their ominous presence just outside the barricaded doors and walls of the mall. In Army - the zombies feel - ironically - like Vegas recreations of zombies. Like animatronic zombies - they have no weight to them. As if they only exist as moving targets for the people with guns. Monsters in a first person shooter game. Snyder's choice to give them the ability to think and plan and have emotions (and apparently reproduce) ironically only makes them that much more cartoonish. They could very well have been werewolves, or vampires, or aliens.It is obvious Snyder had no inkling of the genius that Gunn brought to Dawn. Because - unfortunately - Army of the Dead is completely devoid of that genius.",Army of the Dead

Also, the leading zombie is played outstanding!Music is okay but the sound effects are good, like the noise that the alfa zombies made. Sound is the most important element of a movie and Army of Dead is fine tuned.Bad stuff
The most annoying character in the movie: the daughter! Why? She is one of the reasons that makes the story bad.The concept is not written in a good way. The binding you need with the characters....is not there.Too much questions that not be answered.Tanaka forget something to tell.There is more to tell but I don't want to spoil anything.

3690,debanjankundu95,Brings nothing new to the table,5,23 May 2021,"One thing that bothers me the most, is that when movies end up revealing more than necessary in the trailer itself. Army of the dead, according to me, suffers from the same movie trope of trying to lure audiences into tuning in for the movie, by giving away a really gnarly, surprising, and kinda effective trailer, but then ends up delivering nothing out of the blue other than the tidbits from the trailer itself.The premise and the zombie Tiger is the only thing that could've surprised viewers while watching the movie, but since that is already stated in the trailer, there's nothing, i repeat NOTHING awe inspiring and jaw dropping about this movie. I really expected it to pack a punch, but what it turned out to be was the same old movie just wrapped in a different packaging. The plot is so predictable and so all over the place, that you don't even feel wanting to stick till the end. To be honest, the first few minutes of the movie was quite impressive including the credits, but then it completely ruins the entire potential the movie had of becoming a Z-horror.Also, all the strength was spent on creating and crafting just this one character of Scott, played by Dave Bautista and the rest of them are just there in the movie. There's no character development, no character arc, no depth to these beings. So you never feel interested or even invested enough in the these characters to care about them.",Army of the Dead

Other then the safe cracker who had a unique spark to him but was somewhat underused.The concept of an oceans 11 esc heist during a zombie apocalypse was a fantastic idea and one which you believe would lend for some new and exciting concepts. And while the zombie tiger was a cool inclusion and the Vegas dancer as a zombie queen was an interesting visual that is kinda where the interesting aspects end.This movie could have been something really interesting but unfortunately it ended up an absolute mess, with uninspired concepts, excruciatingly bland characters and a failed attempt at a father daughter bonding story.But hey it does look pretty good.",Army of the Dead

It did have some fresh ideas like the alpha zombies, zombie tiger, and zombie fetus. However, when you have that many plotlines its hard for any of them to have actual depth.

In almost every story they are the wannabe hero in the entire group, who think they can be one man/woman killing machine even though they have no training, no experience and are just gonna wing it. Same thing happens here. The daughter goes with one handgun to kill the bad guy (s) in their lair to save her friend because her friends have children. What! Why?

Every character is drafted into the group in minutes, each with a couple of 'witty' lines to establish their entire character which is all we ever really get. The obviously evil guy can't even muster up enough energy to keep up the facade and betrays folk straight away but the film forgets about him until he has to reveal his evil plan and then die - so who cares?The token 'sad' moments/conversations that the film denotes with standard 'sad' piano tune are funnier than any of the weak attempts at humour in the script. I like how these conversations usually happen while the people involved are meant to be doing some mission-critical task that is then not shown on-screen cause I guess it's not important even though it's why they're there? So many questions are raised from the get-go but never touched upon:
Why are the military moving the super-zombie?Where'd it come from?What's its goal given it's shown to be smarter than the average zombie?Why didn't the Japanese guy just pay some guys to go in and capture a super-zombie head instead of sending one guy with that objective along with a group of folk who are trying to achieve a completely different goal?It's also the ugliest film I've seen in a long time. You say Vegas, I think *neon*. However, the colour palette for this film is either 'sand' or too dark to tell. So why Vegas? The marketing, bright pink titles and opening credits really played up the Vegas angle but they never do anything with it. Snyder was also the DP on this and it shows. A basic over-the-shoulder conversation doesn't get more interesting because you drank 4 coffees and handheld the camera for it, or y'know for EVERY. SINGLE. OTHER. SCENE. The CGI is also very dated, reminded me of I am Legend mostly.Even the gore doesn't land because either you saw it coming or it looks terrible. It's all I really came for and it's almost non-existent except for 2 notable points and in both cases, it looks so bad you don't feel at all affected. Shaun of the Dead had better-looking gore more often - and it had 1/20th of the budget of this trainwreck.Just a predictable, boring, and ugly piece of work.(Also using Zombie by The Cranberries in the credits should display to anyone how little Snyder understands subtext or subtlety, I mean jfc.)",Army of the Dead

The plot doesn't seem interesting and the movie is paced so badly that I couldn't help myself than to pause at 40min of this movie and wonder how come nothing has happened yet and I'm already exhausted from it.

3775,afs-45565,Zack Snyder and Richard Cetrone as Zeus has redefined the zombie movie.,9,14 July 2021,"I have watched a few times, and each time the movie has lingered in my mind for several days. That is how I judge what I believe to be a great movie- by pondering that world and how it became and the different characters impact in it.To say ""Army of the Dead"" was a great movie would be an understatement. AOTD has reinvigorated/reinvented/revitalized the whole zombie theme.The two different classes of zombies and how the ones Zeus directly infected became Alphas as opposed to the Shambler's was genius! The speed, the terrifying screams, the whole hibernation thing etc. ...just WOW!The scene at 43:52 with the lead zombie, Zeus (played by actor/stunt performer Richard Cetrone) holding the spear on the zombie horseback with the tiger at his feet is like a Frank Frazetta painting. If this movie was out when I was a kid (now I am dating myself) that scene would be an Aurora model kit. It was truly a portrait painted in film. I'm sure that image is going to be printed up by many and presented to Cetrone to autograph it in future comic- cons or similar type venues.Richard Cetrone, an accomplished stunt performer and actor, I believe has captured the greatest zombie portrayal in the history of film. When Frankenstein came out in 1931, a critic said of Karloff's performance that the monster was at the same time both terrifying and pathetic. Cetrone's performance is the same. At times over the top frightening, but then at times crushed and sad as to what becomes of his queen and his offspring. As the leader of his people in that Las Vegas he was doing whatever it took to protect it. Cetrone portrayed such a wide range of emotion in the film without saying a word, and through prosthetics/make up! Cetrone is a modern day Karloff.I would love to see a an origin film of how Zeus came to be. Cetrone and Zack Snyder are a great team and I look forward to watching future projects from both.If anyone who has seen the movie and has not seen the Netflix special on the making of Army of the Dead, I highly recommend it.",Army of the Dead

My main bug bear (that hasn't been said already oddly but then the other issues are more than worthy of everyone's gripes) is that the depth of field is so shallow I thought firstly that something was wrong with my projector. Then once I realised it was the multi Million dollar film at fault and not my low end consumer projector - I got constantly distracted by its specific shallow focus on a particular character, prop or (I think at at many points) a random part of the floor. It felt artificial in many shots, like there was a crude mask drawn over the one thing snyder wanted in focus (like it was an afterthought). I get that some of it was to hide the ""excellent"" job of adding in the pilot recasting at the last minute but still... an annoying film. It annoyed my eyes.",Army of the Dead

Unfortunately it may be the worst Snyder film I've seen. It's worth a watch though if your like this type of movie as i didn't hate it -just indifferent. Makeup and special effects were on point. The storyline is ok ( some interesting things said and some different aspects of a zombified population) and the actors really do the best they can with the script.

We did not see any points of Rajab characters. How to get here. We do not know anything about the lives of the main characters. It had a very weak start and a predictable ending.

Unfortunately, the development of some characters were really disappointing and even annoying. The performances of some actors are what could save this movie from a worse rating. Unexpected scenes in the film caused irritation rather than creating excitement and curiosity by having you at the end of your seat.

I did not expect Zack Snyder to stoop this low and make such a trash movie filled with cliche and boring characters. Kate is a prime example of a really cliche and useless character. She just had to go out of her way and be painfully annoying for no reason, and for what? Because daddy didn't comfort her soon enough right after he had to put a knife on her mother's head because she was turning into a freaking zombie? You'd think in this apocalyptic world people would have become more sensible and understand what it means to make the hardest decisions and live with it. But no, Zack had to include scenes where women become unnecessarily dramatic at the worst time possible. The movie also drags too long with numerous scenes that build up to nothing. Like what's the point of showing the queen zombie was pregnant and the daddy rips a baby out of her gut? Eventually the place was nuked and everybody was dead except for the potential black zombie who got out of the vault beneath the casino (which is also a very dumb plan to lock your friend into a safe room with no back up plan).",Army of the Dead

1/ the woman they rescue from the zombie place: we see her enter the helicopter but what happens with her once inside the helicopter?She is not seen in the helicopter and is never mentioned again2/ 1 guy gets locked up in the vault...a nuclear bomb detonates...and he just walks out again?How did he get the vault open from inside?

puddle. Everything, from the opening scene is just non believable.Don't get me wrong, I love zombie flicks, but this is not a zombie flick. Zombies are in this movie just as a decor. And a cheap and unconvincing decor they are. Everything else, from music choice (bad reworks of some classic songs), filming of the scenes (sloooowwwwmoootiooon scenes are plenty and plenty bad), character choices and their interactions (there is no rhyme nor reason for most of the things that happen in the movie between those characters, I see no motivations in their actions) is just shallow, empty and plainly stupid.For a moment, I thought that the movie is a parody, but there are zero jokes in it (and thank god for that, we sure don't need another action movie riddled with bad jokes to give it some substance). So the movie is taking it self seriously, but in fact it is nothing more than a high budget-cheap feeling/looking-dumpster fire.",Army of the Dead

3854,avsfan-66117,Can you spot the (many) plot hole(s)?,2,24 May 2021,"So many things in this movie do not make any sense. You know when you watch a zombie/horror movie and the characters make the wrong decision at every point? That is this movie. Heads up, this is a long review. Let's start at the beginning...Soldiers who are transporting a zombie away from area 51 veer off the road to avoid an oncoming car. Nothing is wrong with their HMMWV (colloquial: Humvee). Two Soldiers get out, see what their ""care package"" was (zombie hulk) and instead of getting back in the humvee, decide to walk out into the middle of the desert to get away. First, the humvee simply drove off the road and was still operational. They could have just gotten in and driven away. Second, even if the humvee was not operational, up-armored humvees have a ""battle-lock"" feature from the inside. Meaning the occupants can get inside and ""battle-lock"" the humvee so that no one on the outside can open the door. Soldiers know humvees offer protection from threats. The Soldiers would not have walked away from it.The first woman on the team to die was left behind in what appears to be a kitchen. The rest of the team realize she's missing, and at that very moment she busts through the wall fighting off zombies. Not the hulk zombies, the dumb slow kind of zombies. AND THEY WATCH HER DIE. I don't mean she was bitten and immediately killed in front of them. They are pointing their weapons in her direction while she is still fighting them off and they just watch her succumb to the hoard. It makes no sense.The casino owner goes to all this trouble sending in a team of mercenaries to retrieve the cash from the safe but the entire thing is a misdirection. He really wants the head of the zombie queen. Right when the group walks into the zombie kingdom, SHE GREETS THE GROUP so that they could give her an offering so the zombies would leave them alone in the zombie kingdom. Later we learn that the zombie head is worth way more than the money in the safe. And the casino owner has sent other groups in as well who seem to have died right outside the safe. Why not just walk in and, when the queen greets the group, trap her and walk out with her?When the rest of the group is trying to crack the safe, the casino owner's head of security (who went in with the group) and one other girl (the coyote-see below) walk off on their own back to where it all started right outside the gate just to be greeted by zombie queen again. Head of security traps zombie queen and cuts off her head for his boss. Then goes back into casino where the safe is with coyote. Then he betrays the group and locks them in the hotel and reveals the plan all along was for him to retrieve the head and leave everyone else for dead (including the coyote). He leaves and of course he is killed. But when he cut off the zombie queen's head and was standing outside the front gate with just the coyote, why didn't he kill the coyote and walk back out the front gate? He was right by the gate with exactly what he went in for.Speaking of the zombie head, we find out later on in the movie the casino owner is really after the zombie head to study and make some sort of super zombie soldiers. HE IS IN COHORTS WITH THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. Why didn't the United States military send in a large group to get the head? Could've used air superiority for an advantage. Tanks? Apaches? Hundreds of troops? Sophisticated traps? Nope. Let's hire a guy who is going to hire a group of like eight mercenaries to go into the zombie kingdom and send along one guy who is going to betray the entire group and leave them all for dead and then he will bring the head out all by himself. Then the military has to pay this guy to retrieve the head. The military could have done this on their own and not had to pay this guy hundreds of millions of dollars (because remember the head is worth more than all the money that was in the safe and there was a ton of cash in that safe). WHY?Main character takes off in a helicopter from the hotel where the safe is located and leaves the zombie king on the roof. He tells the pilot to take him to the other hotel where he thinks his daughter is (how does he know exactly where his daughter is?) and the helicopter takes off in that direction. Zombie king takes the time to kill another person on the roof while helicopter flies off. Helicopter is flying and in a zoomed out shot you see the helicopter flying and the zombie king is on a horse on the ground IN FRONT of the helicopter. So the helicopter took off from the roof and the zombie king killed someone, ran off the roof, down the stairs (or maybe took the elevator), jumped on his zombie horse and ran across Vegas faster than the helicopter could fly there in a straight line. WHAT?The daughter is insufferable. She forces her way into the group to try to retrieve a friend that was left in the kingdom a few days prior to the group's departure. She ends up separating herself from the group and takes off with a pistol. Somehow she knew exactly where to go, and for some unexplained reason, the friend is still alive being held hostage by the zombie king. A zombie hulk hoard comes and starts running towards the daughter and her friend and she drops like ten of them, one shot one kill all headshots. Incredible marksmanship but it does not add up.Group is attacked while opening the safe. Two people are right outside the safe. First they try to fight off the zombies. Then the German throws the other guy in the safe and closes the safe-FROM THE OUTSIDE. Why not get inside and pull it shut? Why didn't they both just get in the safe at the beginning of the attack?The coyote who gets the group into the zombie kingdom and to the safe steals the zombie queen's head at one point. Zombie king finds out and he's really mad. Coyote holds the head up (zombie queen head is still alive) and points a gun at it. This causes zombie king to hesitate. Coyote does this while main character gets in the helicopter and she tells him to just go. Coyote is standing between zombie king and helicopter. Why not just hold the gun to the zombie queen head and back into the helicopter? Then either shoot it or roll it out to zombie king?Main character, helicopter pilot, daughter, daughter's friend whom she went to retrieve, and zombie king all end up in the helicopter while it races away from Vegas before the nuke is dropped. Zombie king is killed, helicopter crashes. Pilot is dead. Daughter and main character survive the crash but main character is bitten. What about the friend? WE DON'T KNOW. We don't ever see if the friend lived or died. So the daughter ran off and compromised the whole group getting her dad killed in the process and we don't get the satisfaction of knowing whether the friend lived or died.Soldiers that were bitten in the beginning turn into zombies immediately. Other characters take minutes, hours, or days to turn into zombies. No explanation.The guy that survived the zombie attack from inside the safe also survives the nuclear blast and just opens the door safe door. Nevermind the scorched earth (fires still burning) or radiation, not a problem here. He jumps outside the safe with bags and bags of cash and starts walking. Finds a car with the keys in the visor (I have yet to, in real life, meet anyone who keeps their keys in the visor of the car) and drives to the airport. Rents a plane to fly away to Mexico for some reason. Starts looking a little ill. Yep, he's bitten. Surprise surprise. But he didn't turn into a zombie the whole time he was in the safe, or while he was walking across the desert, or while he was driving in the car to the airport, or while he was at the airport.I would like to say to all the reviewers who skewer the writers for the casino owner not telling the group about the boobie traps and not telling them what the code was to open the safe, remember, he WANTED them to die. He was hoping the boobie traps would kill them and hoping it would take a long time to open the safe. That's why he didn't tell them. So I don't think that is a plot hole. The plot hole here is why no one would have asked for the safe's code before going in. They know they are going to need a locksmith (the German) so they bring him along. But no one thought to ask the safe's owner what the code was? Plot hole. Boobie traps were not necessarily a plot hole since the safe owner wanted everyone to die anyways.I think a better story would have just been to have a group of mercenaries decide that they would go in the zombie kingdom and get the abandoned money before the nuke is dropped. That would explain the need for the locksmith. Take the casino guy out of the story altogether. Or, have the casino owner hire them to retrieve the money and stick to that story line. Then get rid of the locksmith. Let the dangers of entering a zombie kingdom be enough without the betrayal of the casino owner. It does nothing to add to the story.",Army of the Dead

S.The obligatory hate for that daughter goes here.,Army of the Dead
3859,leeagray-37622,Some good ideas but ultimately formulaic,5,22 May 2021,"By no means genre defining but if you like Zombie films you'll probably somewhat enjoy this one.There were a few fresh ideas that were introduced but for the most part never fully developed. An early scene which showed dehydrated zombies which supposedly reanimate when they get wet foreshadowed an awesome later scene that just never materialised. To counter that there was a great scene involving the crew trying to move through a crowd of hibernating zombies which was believable, tense and thrilling.Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire was clearly an influence. Zombie animals, intelligent / socialised zombies ruling over a hoard of underlings, the brutal and sudden deaths of key characters, and even a night King and Queen.Despite a decent performance from Dave Bautista his character just didn't feel believable. Oddly the most interesting and empathetic character might have been the antagonist ""Zombie King"". His visceral reaction to losing his unborn child made the character seem more believable and frankly likeable than big Dave's.The duo of the young German (Dieter) and the seasoned American (Vanderohe) was a real highlight. Great chemistry and genuinely very funny. Dieter was also the only character that actually had an arch.Feel empathy for the lead zombieDave Bautista made something out of his tired.",Army of the Dead
3860,ameliaqtj,Good Zombies...horrible daughter,4,23 May 2021,"Ok, so, let's start with the good things about this movie, the Zombies. They look very cool, they have interesting mechanics and honestly, are very cool to watch die. The main group of people, very cool, they flow nicely, they are a great group, I love them. Then theres the daughter, and she ruins EVERYTHING. She's the one who causes the death of basically every good person on the team, all to go back for a person WHO DOESN'T EVEN SURVIVE. Honestly if the daughter wasn't in the movie, it would've probably been so much better. Another thing that doesn't bother me quite as much but still kinda irks me is the weird Zombie baby side story,, it was really, odd and didn't quite fit into the whole story. And one final thing, what's with all the Hispanics dying? Like the first person on the team to die is Hispanic and then, at the end of the movie Van is flying to New Mexico??? Like, I'm starting to thing Zack Snyder has a thing against Hispanics lmao.Anyway TL;DR: Daughter character basically kills off everyone and Zack Snyder might hate Hispanics.",Army of the Dead

The first 40 minutes of the movie are slow and uninteresting. The rest of the movie is exactly what the summary states and that's a bad thing. Nothing is added to further the plot. There are so many plot holes and I cannot express my disappointment enough.The writing was horrible, the character development was non-existent, plot was weak, character motives were misguided at best.Feels like it was written by a 10 year old and does not feel like a Zack Snyder movie at all. There are no set pieces, there are hardly any deaths that matter to you. This movie is a disaster from start to end and I would never recommend this movie to anyone not even to my worst enemy. \I wanted to give this movie a 0/10 but I can't.",Army of the Dead
3871,kingsim,Just watched this and it was terrible,3,22 May 2021,"None of the characters were interesting, the story was terrible. The ""zombies"" weren't really zombies but were super intelligent ones that made alien type noises. The ""zombies"" also had kings and queens. The action wasn't very interesting, the guy you thought would probably betray them, did betray them. Very run of the mill and cliche, even the action scenes weren't very good. A lot of just shooting zombies. The daughter is annoying, everyone makes terrible decisions and I will never watch this again.Firstly Zombies are terrifying when you have normal people trying to survive against them, not mercenaries/marines armed to the teeth.Secondly Super Intelligent ""zombies"" that have kings and queens aren't that interesting. Zombies should be almost mindless, acting on pure instinct who would kill themselves to try and kill you. See 28 Days Later as an example or the opening scene from 28 Weeks Later.",Army of the Dead

It's at 1:55:20 one of them, I think they show up 3 times.I had to search the web to understand why they were there and I might say, if it was a part of an experiment by the government, why not doing terminator? It's the same exoskeleton and should be stronger than the darn alphas.At the beggining, the movie shows the ONE alpha, then he bites other soldiers and they become alphas (so after the second status alpha bites, other people become zombies and not alphas?), where do robot zombies were inserted? There are so many questions.Where is the blond? Why wouldnt they stay in the god damn vault after knowing the nuke was coming sooner? The only smart guy was the german to think of shoving the one black guy on the vault to save him... That is one hell of a cliché, the black guy survives until the end saved by a german lol.It was an entertaining film but there are so many questions. Action was cool, story has plotholes and the stupid daughter plot is just boring. The one thing that people here say it's stupid and I can see a justified explanation is the survival of Vanderohe though the bomb site, he was bit so he might have been resistant to nuclear waste, although, the stupid part is that he was stuck in the vault for so long and didn't turn but Scott turned in less than 5 minutes.",Army of the Dead

3928,creors,Who lit this mess,5,22 May 2021,I had to turn it off for a while because of all the back lighting that was giving me a headache. WTF Zack must not have had the money for a decent director of photography. I've seen high school plays with better cohesion. Disappointed after all the hype.,Army of the Dead
3929,sparshgo,"Cliché, corny, Predictable and WAYYY too many Plotholes",6,23 May 2021,"This movie is definately not a best work by Zack Snyder.....i would even go up to by saying that it is one of the weakest to date
There are way too many Plotholes in this movie, let's start with beginning1. If military and US govt made the first ""Zombie"", why do they need a sample??2. How does the japanese guy knows about the normal zombies and Alpha zombies difference??3. Why didn't he simply told them to get the head of the Queen??4. Why only queen's head and not King's head?5. Why did his security guard went back to vaults?? He could have killed lilly and went back the way they came or he could could have went back without even letting here know.6. And speaking of the way they came in, why the hell they had to go out with the help of helicopter??7. And speaking of lilly, why did she followed scott's team to the vaults?? She could have let them go by themselves like she let geeta go!!8. And speaking of geeta, what the hell is the deal with whole geeta story?? I) why she wanna go in? II) why she took 2 more with her? III) why didn't she left the camp with other refugees? IV) what the hell is that she will find inside and how far she thought she would survive in without weapons? V) did she survived? VI) was all that Kate did went in vein? VII) where are her children VIII) did they survived the nuclear blast? IX) why didn't kate asked her father to simply go with her after they bonded? X) and why the she didn't go out the she came in?9) why didn't the japenese guy gave them the locker password?10) if the japenese guy was working with military, why didn't he arranged an airlift?11) why was he holding a phone in the end? Are the telecom signals still working in the quarantine zone?12) what about the electricity supply?? Why is it still working?13) technically after a nuclear blast, the tempreture of the area afected is increased by thousand folds, how did the guy left inside in the vault in the last, survived??The list can go on and on and on...........
Completely incomplete movie!!!! I don't get how did this movie even got a green signal???Not impressed at all!!!!",Army of the Dead

The daughter Very annoying,1,21 May 2021,"I'm so sorry for my life becoz of sitting to watch this garbage movie, why the most stupid and brainless character should be that important to make the whole movie became all trash.

3934,anchorgupta,"Rubbish, and the daughter is dumb AF.",1,28 August 2021,"The entire movie was a dumb project with exceptionally stupid acting and a story with no logic. The daughter of Dave was an absolute idiot. She is the reason most people in the team died. And if Tanaka just wanted a zombie, then he could have just captured the first zombie and taken him instead of going through with the safe plan. The daughter is so stupid I can't keep ranting abt it. She risked and got most of her team killed because of it, including her dad, and then in the end the lady she saved did not even appear so we don't know whether she was saved or not. Synder should have retired after Justice League sender cut. I seriously hope he never directs anything ever again.",Army of the Dead
3935,mienlh,"Watch the trailer, don't waste time on the movie",3,27 May 2021,"The trailer looks fine, not much hope, but fine. The movie is damn boring disappointing. Give it 2 tries and still can't finish the movie. The illogical script, pointless drama event, nothing to be surprised, poor story detail/twist (at least for the first 1h40m, haven't watched the rest yet)... The only good thing from it is the ideal of zombie society- a very interesting concept. The rest? It's dead like those zombies.",Army of the Dead

3937,allyourbrains,"Disappointing, and some other bad words.",3,26 May 2021,"What a terrible film. Wasted potential, after great opening credits. I liked the first half with its satirical tone and dark humour, then halfway through the plot forgot where it was going. Incredibly unsatisfying, predictable ending and SO many stupid decisions by characters. Zack seems to need his four hour runtime, otherwise he gets stressed and messy? The pilot was the real star of the show. The zombies were great.",Army of the Dead
3938,troyllee,Awful,1,23 May 2021,The dialog is the worst I've ever heard in a movie and Batista is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life. Watching him try to act is unadulterated cringe.,Army of the Dead
3939,jacoballen-74216,"A solid, if bloated zombie movie.",10,24 May 2021,"If not for the final 20 minutes, this movie would've been a 9/10. The opening act of this movie is nearly perfect, but falls into genre cliches in the second half. Still a very enjoyable Zombie movie, as well as boasting a serviceable heist Subplot as well.Well acted on all accounts, even if Bautista's daughter seems to be shoe horned into the plot.",Army of the Dead
3940,imvk-60306,NOT A REGULAR ZOMBIE FLICK,10,22 May 2021,I'm fairly impressed by the world building in this movie. The movie starts off GREAT. Looks like a regular ensemble movie but later after some expositions it just feels different to look back at it. The Universe has started with a banger and Netflix is going to make ton of money out of it.,Army of the Dead
3941,isaamthegreat,Regret watching it,3,26 May 2021,Watched it because of snyder and batista. I expected something good because of these big names but this movie was a disappointment. Only thing good were visuals. Please skip. My day is ruined don't ruin yours.,Army of the Dead

It is a bad move. Not the good bad, but the bad bad. And with that, I just saved over 2 hours of your life. You are welcome. You need more? Ok.. that Zack Snyder wants to take over 2 hours of your life with this movie proves that Zack Snyder hates people and wants to bring about the end of humanity. That previous sentences has a better plot and is more interesting than this movie. This movie is so bad that Zack Snyder's parents should be ashamed. More? Ok... They spent over $70m making this pile of turds. They could have saved some whales or paid some school teachers with that money. Why does Zack Snyder hate whales and school teachers?",Army of the Dead

People discussing screenplay and characterization and writing in the reviews may be mentally disabled. Say it with me morons ZOMBIE MOVIE. And for a zombie movie Fan or not it hit what it needed to! And you'll leave the movie having a good time if you have the expectation you are going to see a ZOMBIE MOVIE.They also added some very cool elements I had not seen before in a zombie movie over all I think if you love Snyder you'll love this movie.And if you are in between like me you most likely will find the movie enjoyable and a fun watch at home in Netflix.,Army of the Dead
