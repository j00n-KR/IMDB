0,CinemaSerf,Gripping story very well told.,7,17 October 2021,"It is interesting to watch this film now, in a week where a British MP has been brutally stabbed to death doing his job, and to maybe ask ourselves a question. What has the killing of a man ever actually achieved? It never makes anything any better. It serves to galvanise both sides and retrench enmities and bitterness that can take many years to wain. This film depicts one such story. That of a man who also passionately believed it was acceptable to take a life. His motives appear demonstrably justifiable as we watch this beautifully shot, frequently harrowing, depiction of the lead up to the atrocity of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919. It is told through the eyes of the assassin - Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal) and over the course of the next two hours, we are exposed to the events that drove a decent man to commit the ultimate sin, and to pay the ultimate penalty. Whilst it does take a little while to get going, Shoojit Sircar develops a story replete with conflicting emotions, that offers a critique on the prevailing imperial attitudes and on the very value of life itself. It clearly, and succinctly, exemplifies the cruelty visited on people who just wanted to be left to govern themselves; and of the shockingly arrogant superiority complex of those who believed these people to be little more capable of such aspirations than pets, or sheep. The film looks stunning - the imagery of India from grand scale to violent aftermath; the settings in London - all add hugely to the gusty integrity of this story. As with so much about the man himself, much is still be be made public about these events and about the true intent of the vice-regal, or British, government in making an example of these unarmed protesters - but this surmising offers an entirely plausible assessment of man's inhumanity to man - and sadly, over 100 years on from this - we appear to have learned little about the merits of killing another human being - friend or foe.",Sardar Udham
1,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Yes, bollywood can make a patriotic film far away from dramatic jigoism like Hollywood Classics Patton and Schindler's List and Sardar Udham is our first impactful attempt.",7,16 October 2021,"Sardar Udham (2021) :
Movie Review -I am not gonna write a regular review for this one which combines things like acting, writing, screenplay, music and direction because i don't really think this is a film made to glorify that hardcore patriotism from India's history. Making a commercial jiongism patterns like 'Border' (1997), 'Uri' (2019), and 'Shershaah' (2021) is easy and safe because you that our massy audience will fall for patriotic emotions and will forgive cinematic mistakes. But making a relevant and thought-provoking film like 'Haqeeqat' is still a dream for new generation filmmakers. Sardar Udham is high-end triggering drama with strong flavour of Shoojit Sircar style. Those who are expecting a quality cinema and are ready to wait for a while are welcome and those who want to whistle and scream during mass sequences are prohibited from viewing this movie. Sardar Udham is typical Shoojit Sircar style slow burn but moreover it attempts to rediscover patriotic biographical genre in Indian Cinema on the level of what Hollywood did with film like 'Patton' (1970) and 'Schindler's List' (1993).Jalianwala Bagh massacre is one of the most brutal events ever happened in the 20th century in any corner of the world. But how many times it has made you feel that pain even today except for Anniversary trends on social media and few glimpses in any freedom fighter's biopic in Indian Cinema? We have seen this particular event in many biopics from Bhagat Singh to Gandhi to Sardar Patel and few more but Sardar Udham is probably the only film which has made a big issue out of it to create an entire plot affected by that terrible masscare. I remember watching Soviet Filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's film which showed one of that Russian Massacre in Brutal manners and who on earth knew that those scenes from a silent film made in 1920s decade would remain the most astonishing massacre scenes in cinema history. Sardar Udham might just become that for Bollywood Cinema. Especially those last 40 minutes where you feel the pain of Udham, a teenager, who didn't really understand what just happened and it kept him torturing for 2 decades. Finally, he took the revenge and yet it feels like a soft punishment because you hate British empire so much that even shooting a man dead in front of 50 people feels so less. British had killed hundreds brutally in Jalianwala Bagh massacre and any toughest punishment in the world can't justify that. Sardar Udham is about this ideology, not a revenge. There are thousands of revenge in the history of India but not all them became universal ideologies.One of the best thing i noticed in Sardar Udham is it shows that fatal state of mind British government during world war 2. You see, World War 2 is one of the major reason behind India's independence but our historians and filmmakers have always overlooked this fact. You gotta know that British saw it coming back what they did to India. In this movie there is a quote to explain this- ""Germany calling. The sun finally seems to setting at British Empire. Like an elephant, Indians never forget their enemies"" and the next two scenes when Udham Singh questions the Law twice, once in Courtroom before Judge and once during investigation in front of detective. Do you remember any Bollywood Film going in such details about ideology and morals? Leave that topic for further arguments later.So, overall Sardar Udham is quite a break from commercial potboilers and there are many reasons to make it a Must See in your watchlist as a true quality cinema lover. However, couple of flaws needs to be bashed equally as i praised good things. The film starts very slow, it looks scattered and irrelevant sometimes but maybe that's because the story of Udham never has enough documents and events available in public domain. I won't say much about acting and other aspects as said in the beginning but for Vicky Kaushal I say one thing that he has completely surrendered himself to director's uncompromised vision. I won't be surprised to see him taking a bunch of trophies home after the award ceremonies next year. Shoojit Sir, you have attempted something revolutionary and respect you for that. Nevertheless, i still say it could have been little better or a certain Classic. It misses that Mark by few inches though. Rest, highly recommended. A deserving tribute to underdog Udham Singh and his Friend, Brother and Idol 'Shaheed Bhagat Singh'.RATING - 7.5/10*",Sardar Udham
2,nadkarnisumeet,Shoojit Sircar's best.,8,17 October 2021,"Sardar Udham review :Of all the movies Shoojit Sircar has made till date, this has to be the most technically brilliant one. Capturing the landscape from Amristar to London, the shots appear like a beautiful painting on celluloid. The art design, recreating the 1930s and early '40s when most of this film is based, is top class. Sardar Udham is also the most unconventional historical movie made in Indian cinema. If you are looking for entertainment or patriotic jingoism here, sorry but this is just not the movie for you!!Indeed, Sardar Udham is a highly realistic and at times, harrowing depiction of the relatively unknown freedom fighter who decides to avenge the Jallianwala Baug massacre. Travelling all the way to London to execute the two officials responsible for the most inhuman act in British India, Udham Singh takes a long time to execute his plan. But he is successful at the end.Narrated non-linearly, the film may get tad difficult for the aam junta not used to such treatment as well as those who are not so well versed with the historical events of that period specially those second world war references and the communists' role in it. Udham Singh's torture scenes in British jail are also extremely discomforting to watch.Vicky Kaushal, in the titular role, delivers his career best performance. This one deserves a National award, no less!! Kirsty Averton as Eileen Palmer, Udham's sympathizer from the local Communist party, is a standout. The other firangi actors are earnest and thankfully, talk in English instead of that oh-so-familiar accented Hindi patented by Bob Christo.Sardar Udham reaches its pinnacle in the last forty minutes dedicated to the Jallianwala Baug tragedy. I have read and seen this event many times before but trust me, was never ever shaken so much!! It is a heart wrenching watch sure to move you to tears.Finally, films like Sardar Udham need to be made and the sacrifice of these great freedom fighters deserve much more attention than just a footnote accorded to them in our school history books.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Sardar Udham
3,DukeEman,A history worth remembering...,8,10 November 2021,An epic historical movie from the viewpoint of an Indian Punjabi Sikh plotting against the British Empire. Stunning production values and a creative story structure that has you wondering the whole time if the protagonist is a revolutionary or a terrorist! Not until you witness the final scene detailing the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that you understand Sardar Udham's violent motive...,Sardar Udham
4,katyayan-12892,Masterpiece,9,30 October 2021,"Review By Kamal KSardar Udham is a biopic based on the namesake revolutionary. The movie tracks his journey as a youngster to the rebel he finally becomes.The narrative can be broadly categorised into three segments, although there is no differentiation from the makers. The first half an hour is the execution. It shows the struggle of Udham Singh to reach London and then proceeds to the fateful day of the assassination.That's when the second segment begins. It is the lengthiest one, focusing on how Udham Singh achieved what he set out to do. It deals with the recce work of Udham and what he did he do over the years until the fateful day.And the third segment deals with the reason for the change of heart in a young Udham Singh. Shoojit Sircar depicts the most gruesome portrayal of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the final half an hour.Vicky Kaushal is the heart and soul of Sardar Udham. He has given it all to the role, which offers him ample scope to show his dramatic skills. The pain in his eyes is palpable when he recollects the injustice meted out to Indian's in India by the British. Similarly, anger and aggression are naturally portrayed.The background score by Shantanu Moitra is decent. The cinematography by Avik Mukhopadhyay is brilliant. The pre-Independence era is exquisitely captured and recreated along with the help of the art department.The film, at 2 hours and 42 minutes will require a patient watch. But I promise you, the experience is well worth it. Recommended!",Sardar Udham
5,SoumikBanerjee25,"Shoojit Sircar, Take a bow!",8,18 October 2021,"""Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all"" - Bhagat SinghWow! What an incredible piece of Cinema I have just been a witness of! I'm truly captivated by Sircar's direction and the way he addressed such a heroic act of patriotism. And I can't convey enough appreciation for representing such a fairly unknown story of the Martyr, Udham Singh; who against all the odds made the impossible. He shook the British empire to its core and sent out a decisive statement against their heinous colonialism.From a technical stance alone, I must admit, this was something very special! I had never seen a historical drama on such an enormous scale before. From the detailed set designs to the astounding Cinematography, the commendable art direction to the world-building; it has every right to be considered as a landmark in Indian filmography. Trust me, supervising any sets with that many people and intricacies; it's easier said than done. And this gets even more fascinating when you consider the restricted expenditures!Likewise, the performances leave quite an impression. Amongst the entire cast, Vicky Kaushal's act indisputably draws our attention the most. Particularly, towards the end. Where, in my opinion; he gives his absolute best. Speaking of the rest of the ensemble, I was amazed to observe such a capable group of foreign nationals playing their roles with utmost affection and integrity!My only criticisms are in regards to the comparatively long-winded screenplay and its Non-linear structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for Non-linear storytelling, but I'm not sure whether it was an absolute necessity in this case.Even though I gotta say, that whole Jallianwala Bagh massacre sequence is no less than a cinematic brilliance. No matter, how tough you deem yourself to be, remember the words; it's gonna break your heart. If it was up to me, I would have probably inaugurated the film with this portion rather than placing it near the climax. That way, I guess the impact would have been far greater.Lastly, I just wanna thank all the people who have contributed to such an ambitious endeavour and I wanna give my regards to Mr Shoojit Sircar as he's done plentiful to denote the atrocities of British Imperialism. Innumerable manslaughters, abscondings, tortures; the British without any question, shares a dark & sinful past with our country and its people.My heartiest admiration goes to all the martyrs and their families who sacrificed everything just to break the shackles and to get our much-awaited Sovereignty & Freedom. And most importantly they did all that while being unified, irrespective of class, religion or Identity.Today's generation should learn a thing or two!",Sardar Udham
6,tushargupta-27286,Freedom fighter,10,25 October 2021,Sardar udham singh movie story is so amazing and patriotic movie must watch this .Freedom fighter movie I Love and I like this movie.New story of freedom fighter movie.,Sardar Udham
7,sameerlodaya,What's happening????,6,16 October 2021,We really can't imagine what's happening in the movieSoorjit has made the movie very technically sound with sharp direction perfect props costumes and locations and great performance by vickyThe movie is too slow and shot in dark colours and backgrounds..the story starts with journey from india to London without any planning execution and immediately in 20 minutes the assassination happens and then the story runs in flashbackThe main negative point is soorjit has not made it in a simple way and one gets confused where and how it's going and the movie travels from here and thereIt should be simple.,Sardar Udham
8,MandalBros-5,CAN'T Review.,10,17 October 2021,"After watching the brutal and heart-wrenching visuals of Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, I can't review this film. And yes, India is yet to receive an official apology from the British Government for the same.That's it.Available on Amazon Prime Video.",Sardar Udham
9,pranayjalvi,Perfect is not just a word for Sardar Udham,10,16 October 2021,"Shoojit Sircar showed us once again how a biopic should be made, and the level of Sardar Udham waa extraordinary. Vicky Kaushal is a rising star and his role of Sardar Udham showed us why he is a great contender for Bollywood's future.A dark tale of an individual, fighting for the freedom of the nation, in a different way, in a different nation is enthralling and at the same time, emotional and captivating as well. With a brilliant cinematography and strong dialogues added with terrific acting, Sardar Udham can be claimed as one of the best biopic on a freedom fighter that has ever been made.Hats off to the team of Sardar Udham, Shoojit Sircar, Vicky Kaushal and the entire cast that brought out such an outstanding example of Indian cinema with a compelling story about the struggles we had for the freedom of our nation. This is truly a remarkable on an international level and an oscar nomination worthy movie.My Rating : 10/10.",Sardar Udham
10,nidhunmoviebuff,Vicky Kaushal's monumental performance does justice to the tale of a legendary freedom fighter!,8,16 October 2021,"Shoojit Sircar delivers yet another nuanced, offbeat yet impactful cinema experience after Vicky Donor (2012), Madras Cafe (2013) and Piku (2015) in Udham Singh, riding on an immense performance from Vicky Kaushal.The biopic tells us the relatively unknown tale of Shaheed-i-Azam ('greatest of martyrs') Sardar Udham Singh, who gunned down one of the perpetrators of the Jalianwala Bagh massacre, Michael O'Dwyer, audaciously in the center of London.A harrowing character portrayal of a man scarred by the massacre of his people, Vicky Kaushal delves deep into the anguish, the motivations and the resolve of the legendary freedom fighter, portraying each stage of his life with dignified conviction.A story that would be unbelievable if it were not true, the film shows us the steely determination of a freedom fighter hell bent on revenge, who embarks on a perilous journey through Afghanistan and USSR to strike at his enemy's heart in London.The film never meanders to jingoistic levels instead quietly yet profoundly putting across the messages of freedom and equality propagated by Udham and a fantastic Amol Parashar who essays the role of Shaheed Bhagat Singh.Director Sircar has taken an unconventional non-linear narrative style, a format rarely used in nationalistic films. He leverages it to astutely put across not just the freedom fighter's perspectives but that also of the British administration.While the British officers are often portrayed as evil, maniacal tropes in most freedom fighter movies, Sircar again refuses to follow the norm. Shaun Scott is terrific as the banal, even dispassionate Michael O'Dwyer while Stephen Hogan is impactful as the detective charged with extracting Udham's confession.Sardar Udham is a firm reminder that our country's freedom was won by a group of men and women who were made of sterner stuff, who sacrificed everything for their motherland.The film, at 2 hours and 42 minutes will require a patient watch. But I promise you, the experience is well worth it. Recommended!",Sardar Udham
11,gk303007,Don't fall for the negative reviews,8,18 October 2021,"I watched this movie on Prime and would say, it was worth an effort from director, creators and of course, actors.It's slow burn but never fall short of the subject matter or the descriptions. Every character is given ample amount of time, every scene is elaborated and the whole focus remains upon the subject. The creators have played the dice to showcase the actual events in reverse order, however, keeping in mind that no sequence remains unsitched.Moreover, I liked the depection of the first part of the 20th century, that is the locations, costumes, habits etc.Saying so, yaa, I did feel that in some places, it could have been a bit fast in pace and skipped a few incidents so as to reduce the time from 2 hrs 45 mins to like 2 hrs and 20 mins here and there. And that's where I would cut 2 points. But, a very good film and definitely watchable. Keep your patience and time with you, and you won't regret it.",Sardar Udham
12,rahul000994,Vicky Kaushal's Sardar Udham Is A Ticking Time Bomb Waiting To Explode !!!,10,16 October 2021,"The film pays tribute to an unsung hero - Sardar Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal), an Indian revolutionary, who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London (in 1940), to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (of 1919). The former British colonial official was the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab (British India) at the time. Dwyer had said the killing of hundreds of protesters during a demonstration at Jallianwala Bagh in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, was justified.First things first - If you are looking for a talky film that can light the revolutionary fire in you, 'Sardar Udham' isn't it. Do not expect hard-hitting dialoguebaazi or emotional outbursts. The pre-independence drama based on true events, is a simmering observation of a man consumed by grief. The protagonist makes numbing pain his strength and silence, his voice. Loss and despair are so overpowering that avenging the barbaric crime he witnessed in his 20's, becomes the only reason for his existence, even 20 years later.Set at the onset of World War II, the film shuttles between past and present. The canvas is massive but meaty source material on the titular character, meagre. None of Udham Singh's chest-thumping slogans or writings (if any) was found. Here was a man, deeply scarred, who went about doing his job quietly. The challenge was to then connect the dots with whatever little information available and get into his psyche. Shoojit Sircar tries to decode the 'why' and not just how he ended up doing what he did. The aim is to understand the emotional arc of an innocent boy from Amristar who wouldn't hold a gun, let alone firing one. What led him to fire at Dwyer from point-blank range and not flee the spot? Was it driven by revenge? Why harbour the pain for two decades and not move on for good? Why is the same person a revolutionary and terrorist for different people?Shoojit SIrcar doesn't take a myopic look at heroism or freedom. His hero doesn't seem invincible or hero-like. Udham Singh didn't hate a man or his country who spurred the massacre. His fight was against the British ideology of conquering others' right to speak and live freely. Through an exhausting runtime of 2 Hr 42 Mins, Shoojit makes us meet Udham, a stoical man on a mission. He moves like a shadow, relentless in his pursuit of Dwyer and freedom from the oppressive British rule. For the longest time, we solely become a spectator of his painstaking journey. We don't feel invested enough. We see him landing odd jobs in London and being the centre of various unremarkable events leading up to the assassination.As much as we anticipate the volcano of his past to erupt eventually, the road to that heart-wrenching climax is tedious. Underplaying is an effective tool as long as it doesn't underwhelm. This film is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode but beware; the wait tries your patience. The intention is to give a lull before the storm treatment to storytelling. Silence is amplified so when Udham's inner turmoil finds an outlet, the impact reaches a crescendo. It's cleverly thought out but the execution yields mixed results. The non-linear, non-verbose narrative struggles to hold your attention even an hour into the movie. The re-enactment of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is unsettling to watch and that is the very reason why this story needed to be told.Vicky Kaushal as Sardar Udham dips his toes into uncharted waters. He tries his best to get unspoken words across but a film like this needed an Irrfan to speak through his eyes. You can trust a seasoned actor to elevate portions that demand stillness. Vicky is remarkable in certain scenes though. A drunk scene in particular, his 20 something portrayal and his climactic conversation with a British investigator extract the best out of him as an actor. Him wondering, ""Mere jawani ka koi matlab bana?"" is heart-breaking. The writing tries to avoid clichés but ends up sounding contemporary instead. Bhagat Singh's Hinglish dialogues like, ""Hum sirf exploitation ke against hai. Humein semi-independence nahi chahiye,"" sound out of place given the setting. The line that stays with you is Udham reminiscing his turbulent past and asking a British officer, ""What were you doing when you were 23?""Sardar Udham's courage never roared. It whispered. This freedom fighter traversed continents, used aliases and lied low throughout his life. He was too possessed by his singular quest for equality to make a noise. If you are as passionately curious about his quiet existence, this film is for you.",Sardar Udham
13,magadalwarmayur,Great film with great emotions but their is catch,8,16 October 2021,The film is great it makes you search udham singh more it will certainly make you cry but the film lacks in its production it should have been given more budget the cinematography should have been much better don't get these things come between watching the film it is great film nontheless.,Sardar Udham
14,sudhakaranakhilan,An addition to the patriotic movies of India,8,20 October 2021,"Shoojit Sircar always stunned us with his beautiful works like Vicky Donor, Madras Cafe, Piku, October, and now he came back with his new one Sardar Udham, a biopic about revolutionary Udham Singh. We all witnessed many films regarding the freedom struggle in India, Sardar Udham also shows the freedom struggles and the colonized vision of the British empire. We can note the storyline in one word because this is the story of revenge. It invites us into 1919; the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Udham Singh's journey to assassin the man behind the massacre, Micheal O'dwyer. The film goes in a non-linear pattern where we are seeing Udham in his fourties and then straight him as a teenager. He planned to kill Dwyer, worked as his assistant but waited for 21 years to take his revenge. This is quite a strange thing because we all have that question, why doesn't he kill him early? The answer is that he wants to take his revenge in public because Dwyer has also done the same. I can remember the face of Udham Singh while he come out from the Caxton Hall when he took his revenge. He doesn't feel any kind of guilty even he smiles when he accompanies the policemen. That was the most memorable moment in the film. The last part of the film is also brilliant where Sircar shows the activities that happened at Jallianwala Bagh. It was so intense, so violent and I hesitate to open my eyes for that 30 minutes long 'massacre scene'. It was so disturbing one. There lies the true intention of Udham Singh to take his revenge. All the technical aspects of the film are top-notch. The length of the film seems a little long even the director can short some 15-20 minutes without affecting the film. Anyway I'm not using this platform for the negatives I like the film very much and it is watchable.",Sardar Udham
15,matrixdukenukem,The third act broke me permanently,10,17 October 2021,"This is not an easy movie to recommend. I was on the verge of turning it off unable to take it any more but out of respect, somehow kept going. Never ever has Jallianwala Baug massacre portrayed this way in history of cinema. This is however the most important film to come out in recent times.Yes this is about Sardar Udham Sign but it is also about millions of Indians who sacrificed themselves for the freedom we enjoy in modern India and take it for granted. It is very intelligently written, the production design is on a level Bollywood hasn't seen in a long long time. The sound design and background score is skillfully done and the editing is just how I like it. Shoojit Sircar has obviously worked with DoP to capture every frame masterfully. Technically this is near perfect.I would've given minus stars but didn't have heart to give it to the marketing department, producers and distributors. This movie should be screened in all the film festivals and has potential to be India's oscar entry for this year. Wake up people.Finally, I just want to say this movie should also be in British high school curriculum. Of course, it's wishful thinking.",Sardar Udham

A Film of the absolute Highest Calibre, every aspect of the craft from Cinematography to Score, Set Design to Costume, Screenplay to VFX is handled with utmost mastery. One of the greatest Tragedies of Colonial India, Jalianwala Bagh massacre is something that is etched into the memory of every Indian but for Citizens of Present generations growing up in a free and secure India, it may feel like just a page in the history book. And the newly renovated, polished and pristine fancy tourism site will probably fail to remind us of the horror but this film will. The scenes will shake you to your core.

17,hxzr-18144,Untold history of one of true Indian revolutionary.,10,18 October 2021,Really liked the story. It's slow but to get the emotions etc. You have to cover each and every aspect in details.There are many such freedom fighters who sacrificeses are not known.,Sardar Udham
18,madanmarwah,"A little long and slow, but still first rate",8,24 October 2021,"Biopics on political revolutionaries of pre partition struggle are not many, and such movies are welcome. Since the canvas of such stories is wide, there may be many subplots and there is comparatively more explaining to do. Additionally there is hardly any scope to include romance, dance, comedy, action, melodrama etc and therefore there is a tendency by the director to end up making a documentary even though it is unintended. Such films invariably have a running time in excess of two and a half hours. A feature film has necessarily to be in a two hour format and entertaining for common audiences. There is therefore a challenge to the director of the movie of this genre.After seeing this film, it is clear that Shoojit Sarkar and Vicky Kaushal are both world class. Both have been doing very well so far in any case. The film is a gripping depiction of the incidents of that period and the locales of Afghanistan, Russia and England are authentically shown. The film is a triumph for the director and his crew for capturing the atmosphere of that time so admirably . The claustrophobic prison cells, the London streets, the factories, the people all ring true. The extended scene of Jallianwala bagh massacre has been shot and presented superbly. The moments after the firing with hundreds killed and injured is poignant, sorrowful and has heart wrenching visuals. Chilling no doubt, it will stay with you long after the movie .The four main characters Uddham, the investigating inspector , Michael O'Dwyer, and Reginald Dyer are depicted realistically all expressing their individualistic points of view.Direction is top class and Vicky Kaushal gets an opportunity to put up a superb performance. There is some memorable top class dialogue spoken both by the British officers and revolutionary Udham.The negative point of the movie is the running time over two and a half hours due to which the film drags at places. It is too long and too slow. The film could easily be reduced by 30 minutes and this must be done if it gets selected for Oscar awards.Some trivia as per the film. Did you know that Udham had a weakness for laddoos ( Indian sweet), he had a girlfriend who was dumb, he took alcohol and got high at times and he took oath on the book "" Heer Ranjha"" in court?",Sardar Udham
19,nagsaptarshi,Sardar Udham- The Untold Saga of a Forgotten Patriot,9,18 October 2021,"Sardar Udham, the latest offering from the ace director Shoojit Sircar is a heart wrenching tale of the sacrifices of one of the forgotten heroes of our freedom struggle- Sardar Udham Singh. It is a poignant saga of a martyr seldom remembered for his valor, determination or devotion to his motherland. India's inability to make biopics sans unnecessary emotions or well researched set pieces is well known. But Sardar Udham breaks the barrier and presents before us a creation that should be hailed for its dogged determination in denying the norms and for depicting a story which needed extensive study, unbiased sentiments and unabashed truthfulness.The cardinal parts of the protagonist's life from during the repercussions of the Jalliwanwala Bag massacre to his eventual execution in the hands of the British imperialists form the core of the story. The nucleus of course is the vengeance he took on the soil of the Britishers. Throughout the journey, we are presented with so many facts hitherto unknown to the most. In an age of History courses taught through FB or WhatsApp posts, director Shoojit Sircar takes a U-turn and works on several important issues deliberately untold before. It takes tremendous courage to portray the political orientation of Sardar Udham or his friend-cum-brother-cum-political mentor Bhagat Singh. The political ideology of HSRA has been depicted without any penchant for being partisan to gain any political mileage for the movie, a common trait these days. Another aspect of the movie is its bravery to show how Indians irrespective of their religions were used to suppress their own fellows during those tumultuous days. Keeping the dialogues mostly in English or Punjabi instead of ludicrously pronounced Hindi by the Britishers adds to the genuineness of intentions of the creator.The film, however, has its own share of flaws. The makeup is not classy and looks artificial at times. The lad who donned the role of Bhagat Singh does not look convincing. The undulating movements of the time frames become monotonous at certain points. Certain unnecessary flashbacks could have been avoided. The runtime of more than 160 minutes is a bit irksome and at least thirty minutes could have been trimmed to maintain the tempo. The climax does not yield enough dividends for the patience held for so long.If we can ignore the minor flaws, Sardar Udham has the potentials to become a classic in the coming years. Vicky Kaushal as the vengeful protagonist is a treat to watch. In a metaphorical scene at the Freedom of Speech squad, he delivers a monologue that knocks you down for his sheer timing and brilliant expressions. Did the director take a dig at something at that scene? Vicky is terrific throughout and he is one reason you should not miss this movie. Stephen Hogan as the detective inspector John Swain is smooth in essaying a tough role that demanded dutifulness and softness. Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh as already mentioned lacks the confidence. Shaun Scott as Michael O'dwyer is believable and Kirsty Averton as Eileen is expressive.The movie has the ideological presence of the great martyr Bhagat Singh throughout and that maybe a good lesson for many who idolize him without having any respect for the ideals he promoted. The massacre scene of Jalliwanwala Bagh is gruesome, horrific and presents the true magnitude of violence inflicted by the Britishers on our countrymen during those days. The scene is long, raw and uncompromising, a train not common in our movie industry where nothing is done without glamorizing. Sardar Udham does not for a moment try to add any glamour to a story which needed truthfulness, honesty and a heart clear of any partisan feelings.Watch this movie if you want to revisit those days. Watch this movie if you consider yourself non-judgmental. Watch this for the man who needs to be championed for his sheer patriotism, unabated spirit of equality and unhindered love for his countrymen.My rating- 9 out of 10.",Sardar Udham
20,madonnicallysony,Long live Udham Singh!,9,16 October 2021,This movie is a masterpiece. Loved that it presented the true facts and was not altered for the sake of commercialism. The last half an hour of the movie is heart wrenching. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre left a deep impact on the entire nation. The movie feels a bit stretched in between as the scenes keep ping ponging between present and the flashback. Vicky Kaushal gives his best performance. This movie deserves an Oscar nomination.,Sardar Udham
21,bhupinder_sidhu,Good concept but bad execution,2,21 October 2021,"I had lot of expectations from this movies but all my expectations gone in vain when I just start watching this movie. I don't why the script & direction so weak, it is very boring & not executed well. You just fail to understand what's going on .",Sardar Udham
22,shumailzafar,PRATIK IS THE BOSS,9,5 November 2021,"I couldn't stop my tear while watching the movie Sardar Udham. I don't think vicky kaushalThankyou so much for doing such film, which will inspire the young generation a lot.",Sardar Udham
23,anikb-87099,A unique presentation!,10,16 October 2021,"When Bollywood makes biopics, they tend to follow that one route --> start from childhood, show him/her rise and then show the events that follow. Shoojit Sircar is different and so are his films including SARDAR UDHAM.This film begins on a different note. It starts from mid way of Udham's life and moves forward from there and what follows is all events being slowly unraveled through investigations and through udham singh's confessions. It takes a different non linear way of presenting the events rather than the stereotypical cliche bollywood style.YES IT IS SLOW BUT YOU DONT HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COMPLAIN! If you are new to watching Shoojit's films dare not complain instead go watch his previous works first but if you are a follower of his films, you wont complain as you know you are well prepared for a film of this pace.Set designs --> havent seen such in Bollywood ever. Straight out of a Hollywood production house it seems like. Brilliant! Vicky Kaushal doesnt really have too many dialogues he's almost like a silent killer. His emotions his eyes do the talking.At 2hr 40 mins, the level of detailing is phenomenal. Making a film with lots of trivia detailing like the radio talking about Irish revolution, WW2 etc is very difficult considering your main topic is different but it sets up the mood right and makes sure you feel you are in the 1930s. Some details about Bhagat Singh's movement are there too.Undoubtedly the most haunting part comes in the last 1 hour. Brace yourselves for the long sequence that comes in the last 1 hour.Vicky as i talked has done a good job! Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh is okayish we have seen better portrayals in other films dedicated to him completely . Banita Sandhu is only in a cameo in a forced love angle that the film could have avoided or i really dont know if it was true.AN UNMISSABLE FILM!",Sardar Udham
24,xrionitx,Bored to sleep,3,17 October 2021,"This was a good opportunity, if the director wouldn't have taken tooo much of cinematic creativity and too many jumps from present to past to future, mixing and ruining the anticipation completely.The ending or the climax was shown in the first one hour itself, and then there are the sequences shown where the director tried to show the backdrops in between, which was pointless! When you tell the reader of a book in the first 10 pages that this person is the killer in the end, then why would you read the book?The technicality of the film, cinematography, coloring, music was good. Just the mixed up screenplay ruined the experience and bored!",Sardar Udham
25,bunnysharman,Not a movie it Its a Movement,10,23 October 2021,Sardar Udham singh first Jai hind long live and about Some might fell it Slow but Excellent Raw cinema by Shoojit Sircar and Vicky Kushal this man lived the character and Cinematography of movie at Next level and Act of Jallianwala will leave u Speechless and Fell honour for our freedom fighter and fell their pain there willing for freedom and it's About proud don't Think about what Other says just go and Watch it For the people u don't know but Had Done many Sacrifice for Independence sad I Don't heard about him only after this movie I know him india so plz see story of Udham Singh For His Immortal Sacrifice.,Sardar Udham
26,hmaravind-24605,This movie made you cry.,10,17 October 2021,Really heart touching movie. Udham singh is great freedom fighter and Vicky Koushal portray that role very beautifully. And special appreciation for director Shojit Sarkar. Good movie. Everyone watch this movie.,Sardar Udham
27,jeetdutta-16586,Once in a lifetime movie,9,17 October 2021,"Shoojit sir made this with his heart and soul. It's an impeccable movie filled wonderful performances, lovely cinematography, gut wrenching sequences and BG scores. The movie could've been edited to less than 2hr 30mins but Shoojit sir decided to show each and every sequence of the movie is been shown in detail. It's made for the class audience who understands the meaning of cinema. This is one of the best biographical drama movie ever made in Indian cinema.Irfaan khan sir must be very proud of Vicky kaushal.",Sardar Udham
28,cooldwijen,Solid 9 and half starrer. Long live the revolution,9,26 October 2021,"It is a slow burner and the generation of 5 seconds reels and tiktok videos won't appreciate such movies. That aside the movie has great cinematography, background score and great acting. The movie is not trying to weigh in on any one side and telling you a story as is.The last half an hour or so is the soul of the movie. The depiction of Jalliawala bagh massacre makes me choked and angry at the same time. I felt so helpless.Such movie should be made as part of school curriculum.",Sardar Udham
29,puranjanbasak,Sardar udham,10,20 October 2021,"Sardar udham is a biographical historical drama directed by shoojit sircar. Here are the positives and negatives:Performances-the performances are epic to be honest. Vicky kaushal has given a lifetime of a performance. He has given it everything literally everything. Starting from expressions to demeaner to dialogue delivery he has given an awards worthy performance. Banita sandhu in her brief period brings the sweetness in the rather melancholic picture. Her eyes are beautiful and expressive. Amol parashar as 'bhagat singh' is lively and lovely.English actors-the english actors also have done a commendable job. Thanks to the casting agency that they hired good english actors in an indian film. Shaun scott and kirsten averton are my favourites. I really liked eileen and udham's chemistry specially in the last scene. Other english characters hv done a good job too.Cinematography-the cinematography is world class. Avik mukhopadhyay has captured it beautifully. He has given a masterclass on cinematography. The handheld camera, the closeups, he has done it wonderfully.Dialogues-if i start talking about dialogues i wouldn't stop so let me just brief it. The dialoges are a revolution in itself. Insightful, deep and tragic at the same time. Vicky has got the best dialogues and he has nailed it.Colour grading-the colour grading is brilliant. The yellow tone used in the punjab scenes representing the fiery attitude during the pre-independence and the greyish blue tone in the english sequences representative of the sunless and lightless world. Its brilliant.Jallianwala bagh massacre-has the massacre been portrayed so brilliantly and been gruesome at the same time? My answer is yes
. This is excellent writing and staging. The sequemce is 20 minutes long but does not feel slack at any moment. Its gruesome, bloody and horrific. Body parts detached, men moaning and screaming in pain, you would get teary eyed for sure.Screenplay and length-who were the people saying that it was long. I didn't feel it for a minute. The screenplay is so beautifully written and staged that you would not want it to stop. The length is proper and just. Those kind of people don't deserve these kind of films.Guilt does not justify crimes towards a country. It may relieve you of the pain but does not justify the crime. Men who dream of greater heights do not rest util death. Sardar udham singh is one just personality. This is one oscar worthy performance. Its a must must watch. I rate it 10 out of 10.",Sardar Udham
30,ajaynkumar,Awsome and amazing masterpiece,10,16 October 2021,In one word its a masterpiece its the whole new concept of cinema amazing storyline and storytelling is amzing and visuals and cinematography is mind blown.,Sardar Udham
31,willard12,Sardar Boredom,4,30 October 2021,"Looks like a blockbuster. Feels like a blockbuster.acks the plot of a blockbuster. This guy gunned down an unarmed old man (men). He's not a hero, he's a coward and an assassin. Form an army and fight your oppressor face to face. Sure, you may lose the battles, and even the war, but you keep your honor. Nothing honorable in terrorism. This douche is no different than the man he killed.",Sardar Udham
32,mayankshukla1404,A Masterpiece!,10,16 October 2021,I just finished watching Sardar Udham streaming on Amazon Prime. To be honest I was a bit skeptical about the film's length and the pacing as brought up in most of the critic reviews. After watching the film I can safely say without a doubt that it is a masterpiece!Sardar Udham proves yet again that Shoojit Sircar is one of the finest storytellers of our times and with this one he has delivered not only his best but one of the best films in recent times. Sircar along with his leading man Vicky Kaushal pays a befitting tribute to the revolutionary freedom fighter Sardar Udham Singh. Vicky Kaushal gives a powerful performance here and is simply stunning in the sequences showing the aftermath of Jallianwala.I was in tears during the last one hour when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is shown. I haven't seen anything this heart wrenching in a long time. The effective screenwriting and brilliant performances keep you hooked inspite of a running time of 162 minutes. Not to forget the background score and cinematography which add on to the brilliance of this film.I really hope this film is elected as India's official Oscar entry next year. Don't miss this one for anything. A soul stirring classic!,Sardar Udham
33,sanjeevanwar,A forgotten hero,9,17 October 2021,"Anwar Says : Sardar Udham a forgotten hero of Indian Freedom Movement, reincarnated by Soorjit Sircar and brilliantly portrayed by the second choice Vicky Kaushal , even the first choice Irfan would have loved it . First 90 minutes I found it a documentary and after that the brilliance of this maestro director unveiled.If Uri was a feather in Vicky Kaushal's cap , this is going to take him near to Naseer and Om Puri , if not parallel. A guy , who considers Bhagat Singh as his idol took 21 years to take revenge by killing General Dyer , who ordered the massacre at Jalianwala Bagh . Udham's 21 years of journey has been seemed in meticulously and his ideology of attaining freedom has been penned in every frame .Beautiful Banita Sandhu expressed everything without a dialogue. The British actors were perfectly handled. Shantanu Moitra background score matches with the period perfectly. A movie must be watched by today's generation, if they want to know more of British era just before independence, thanks to the well researched adaptation of the book 'The Patient Assassin' by Anita Anand.#amazonprime #anwarsays #VickyKaushal #ShoojitSircar #moviereview #movie2021 #UdhamSingh #bhagatsingh #jalianwalabagh #FreedomMovement.",Sardar Udham
34,a_filmcritter,a masterpiece,9,23 October 2021,"By far one of the best biopics in Indian cinema. I'm so surprised Bollywood has come out with a movie about the dark history of Sikhs and a dark movie about revolution and equality. Props to the producers and directors for making this movie. I feel like we need to show the true light about our history in its correct lens.Hats off the creators of this movie; the cinematography, script, screenplay, and makeup/costume were amazing. My only problem was the direction, it could've been a bit more clear with the scene and time changes.Round of applause for Vicky Kaushal. What an actor. He was simply perfect the entire time. Same goes for supporting actors, they all played their characters so well.",Sardar Udham

Everything about this movie is greatNo Bollywood film is going to surpass Sardar Udham for many many decades and on that I can even betA True Masterpiece from Indian cinema
Rest in Peace Sardar Udham Singh Ji Shri Bhagat Singh Ji and all others who sacrificed their lives for our freedom..",Sardar Udham
38,noonoonomore,Amazing acting from Vicky,9,17 October 2021,"From storytelling to cinematography to acting, this movie is brilliant.And may I add that Vicky Kaushal is going to be one the greatest actors in Bollywood history if he keeps this path. He has done some really great works, Masaan, Raman Raghav 2.0, Uri and he never disappoints even in a terrible movie like Bhoot. Hope to see him soon in another awesome movie again.",Sardar Udham
39,atharvagosavi-45998,The Indian Best Film..Deserves Special Attention By Audience Who Always Criticize Indian Content!,10,17 October 2021,"I think this film is in my all time favorite film list. The film is really very perfect at all aspects..actually this film is made for only those who are really serious in watching films_making notes : classy audience. I think everyone should watch atleast this film first 30 minutes and last 41 minutes. Sardam Udham is definitely masterpiece undoubtedly..shoijit sircar never dissapoint his audience.Que -Why this film belongs to the masterpiece category?1) Cinematography - Sardar Udham approach really hearttouching and serious..the set designing and costumes department desrve a grand salute. The film is undoubtedly indian 'The Pianist'
2) Characterisation - Character portrait is speechless. I think the best character portrail in indian cinema after 'vikram vedha'
3) Thrilling Sequences - Everyone know 'The Godfather'. Film has really awesome scenes..one takes and many symbolism too. This film is also like this..if we compare Michael scene in 'The Godfather' with Udham scene in hall killing scene at 30min est. Both scene look a like copy to each other or just amazing. Film pictured really heartfelling yet horrifying scenes at torture in English survellian. Film get more intense at the end like evergreen 'The Shawshank Redemption.Approach - Sardam Udham didn't tell you story it tell you an era and information about the scenario. Many Indian as well as Hollywood films creating false character portrait but this film didn't do it either.Decoding ?? How??This film had many epic scenes. There are many scenes which capture something unnoticable at every time. The quality about the content is we know how the film end..we know what will happen!! But we didn't know Why?? This film tell you why and fulfill your satisfaction.I know I mentioned many the greatest all time top movies above but this film deserve a comparison atleast cause this film is an example to hollywood that our indian films are also matches the hollywood society!!Thank you!",Sardar Udham
40,ajaiswal-40907,Masterpiece!,10,1 November 2021,"A heart stomping, painful yet BRILLIANT movie. A man waited 21 years to take the revenge. Sardar Udham is masterpiece at every single moment. Acting, cinematography, direction, dailogues, bgm you name it. Shows the horrific massacre in jallinwala bagh on 13/4/1919. Best thing about this movie is it doesn't shouts patriotism by just heavy dailogue or emotional songs, its the atmosphere which does the work. It Brilliantly shows the tyranny to british govt towards india & how british govt still bot has apolozised for this horrific incident.Sad part is, indian jury not sending this movie for oscar nomination coz they think it shows hatred towards british, which infact the movie shows the reality of british imperialism & tyrany toward indians & yet jury thinks that ""British bura maan jayengey"" infact brits still have this colonial mindsets towards india. Anyways!A MUST WATCH MOVIE FOR EVERY INDIAN.",Sardar Udham

44,Vikky0007,Great but over stretched,8,17 October 2021,This movie is a benchmark when it comes to storytelling. Only downside was that some scenes are stretched far beyond they should have. Otherwise it was an easy 9/10. Nevertheless one of the best movies on freedom struggle. There are so many stories that should be told. Hope this movie starts some kind of trend but not a frenzy. Great acting and direction. True commentary in the end. We tend to forget what kind of struggles and hardships our veterans and freedom fighters went through. Do not take freedom lightly.,Sardar Udham

Governor of Punjab during 1919Positive Points of the movie👍👍👍👍1) After Uri, a stellar performance of Vicky Kaushal...His expression, his timing, emotion expression was fabulous and touching.....2) Shoojit Sarcar who known for the movies Pink, Madras Cafe had once again added a feather in his cap by exceptional crafting in his direction....3) Ritesh Shah, Shubendu Bhattacharya has well researched the topic and penned down very well.....4) Kudos to the art direction team for recreating the London of 1930's as here, the people who are knowledgeable about the old facts will be pointing out what is wrong.... Here I don't feel such lapse had happened as they able to portay that period......4) Thanks to the team for showing the story of real hero's of our nation.....What I learnt ????1) Riots, wars doesn't make anyone win, it just wins a country but it fails to win the peace of the people....2) Why people like Bhagat Singh, Sardar Udham have to sacrifice their youth when they have their whole life to explore...?? When equality and ones own rights arr deprived, martyrs count will always rise3) Kudos to the soldiers of the current time and also to those unsung hero's of who kept the interest of the nation as their main goal.....Watchable movie...Regret of skipping its theatrical release......",Sardar Udham

54,chitreshgupta,"""Let the world know, I was a revolutionary""",10,20 October 2021,From Writer director Shoojit Sircar comes a movie which has been in the making for the past 2 decades and was earlier planned to release as Irrfan Khan in the lead role. But don't be mistaken and even Irrfan Sir will be smiling from the heavens if he sees what Vicky Kaushal has to contribute to this epic biopic.Vicky Kaushal has been always on my radar of upcoming talented actors in Bollywood ever since I watched Masaan (2015- a must see) which just shook me to the core and made me think of the talent we have outside of Bollywood. He is just tremendous in this role of our National Hero Sardar Udham Singh and plays it with such conviction and passion that you sometimes even forget that you are watching a movie and just get floored by his flawless performance 🎭. He just embodies the character so well that your eyes are just glued to the screen which also makes me come to the Direction of this film which is just breathtaking and goes from one country to another with such ease that you ought to fall in love with the cinematography here done brilliantly by Avik Mukopadhyay. Vicky also goes through a lot of physical acting here which only adds to his multilayered and Nuance performance in the film.Well.Well I have to talk about the British tyranny here without which this review would be incomplete. This movie showcases some of the most visceral and unnerving scenes of Jalianwala Bagh massacre which I have never seen before and a special warning for faint hearted (Caution already given). It will make you uncomfortable and Livid both at the same time and will make you think of the sacrifices made by our predecessors and at what cost we have got this freedom which we often don't realise.Shoojit Sircar does it again and has been doing great movies ever since Vicky Donor came out back in 2012 but this one really marks this as his Magnum Opus and is truly earned. Genre is not a barrier for Mr. Shoojit Sircar as He is not shy in making versatile films with such penacé.One of the best films of the year and India's most technically sound movie to date (Yes I can say this with utter confidence). Only drawback here is the Length of the film which could have been easily trimmed down by 15-20 minutes which would have made the movie more crispier and enjoyable to watch but nonetheless it's a monumental achievement in direction for Bollywood and a special movie to add to your library.,Sardar Udham

59,asifali-on-imdb,My eyes are still numb...,10,23 October 2021,"What a movie! This will certainly make Vicky Kaushal a deserving candidate for an Oscar.It was Heart Breaking. Inhumane. Barbaric.It is funny how we follow British educational system to this date in our countries, and yet I did not read anything about this particular dark phase of our slavery period under the British rule. They must have omitted it. Nobody wants to be remembered by their dark past; but it does help you stay grounded.The movie is about an inhumane and merciless shooting that took place in Amritsar, India, where hundreds of innocent people(gathered peacefully) were shot to death in an open-fire. The scene was really barbaric, and perhaps the first time portrayed so visually gruesome in our movie industry. Bullets flying, parts of body tearing apart, and people being killed left and right--those tried to escape the bloody arena--where gunned down against that wall they tried to jump over. Oh, I have no words to describe it. I cried through out the whole ending. Now, imagine someone pulled the surviving one(in so much pain), being dragged and carried on to nearest medical facility. Amidst such chaos, Sardar Udham was that angel who saved many lives. He plans a revenge, and this is his life-story which many of us aren't even aware of. I wonder why?Have a towel, or a box of Kleenex by your side--cuz you'll be crying a river.",Sardar Udham

Some May have issue with the editing but non linear editing is the current trend and one has to be really focussed to keep track . Vicky kaushal has given his best performance till date but he the only bollywood star who is exceeding his performance from previous movies. Now I am more interested in Mackenshaw biopic. Rest of the cast also did well. My only criticism of the movie is in for of script as in some instances its factually incorrect and historians May give more pointers. Not Sure if Udham j.,Sardar Udham

66,sandeepmalhi-05856,1 star short of perfect because of miscasting Shaheed Bhagat Singh,9,17 October 2021,"Well done movie, sans unnecessary drama. Slow paced, but necessary to depict those factors making it slow to show Shaheed Udham Singh's patience and highly dedicated effort. Vicky Kaushal, josh is very high sir.It is very very daunting to portray certain characters. Taking that into consideration, you need to give a lot of attention to detail portraying/depicting these characters. Knowing this, I was still very disappointed and hurt about one important factor in the movie, the extremely awkward and inaccurate casting of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. Goof- He was hung cropped. And I can't believe they agreed to cast this actor. Huge huge mistake. Took away what could had been really impactful scenes when Shaheed Bhagat was in the frame.. for me personally, this was a huge letdown. Especially when you're portraying the two bravest Sikhs to ever live. Ever..However. Taking that one flaw out, this movie is what Bollywood needs now. Well done to everyone on this project and hats off to Shoojit and Vicky 🙌🏽☝🏾..",Sardar Udham
67,ssscvrce,Vicky and sirkar sir! Hats off,9,20 October 2021,"Vicky you beauty, you have never let things go down in any of your acting. Sirkar sir has executed the emotions of udham Singh very well. Pleasing to watch such movies, and the ending was top notch.",Sardar Udham
68,MAVERICK-WITTY,"A LONG, UNHURRIED RE-CREATION OF A TRIBULIENT SLICE OF INDIA'S COLONIAL PAST, A SLOW BURN, NOT FOR ENTERTAINMENT WITH DIALOG-BAAZI, LAGS IN ACTING & BIT OVERSTRETCHED.",5,5 November 2021,"Sardar Udham is a long, unhurried re-creation of a turbulent slice of India's colonial past, going back and forth from Punjab to London, with a few detours here and there.However, If you are looking for a talky film that can light the revolutionary fire in you with dialoguebaazi or emotional outbursts Sardar Udham' isn't it.Hats off to Shoojit Sircar for picking such an Impactful & Insightful True Story of Shaheed Sardar Udham Singh. But the execution was really bad. Editing was chaotic, Vicky's acting was average at best, Really strange cinematography The movie is too slow and shot in very dark colors and backgrounds and wayy too over stretchedAll the transitions are random and the movie does not feel like a story in any sense. Just a random collection of scenes.I had huge expectations.",Sardar Udham
69,srastogi-90935,A good story poorly told,5,17 October 2021,"Shoojit Sarkar is known for crisp and gripping movies, but this one is far far away from it. It is too long, could easily be condensed from 163 min to 120 min or even lower. Many scenes or incidents have been stretched too long making it boring. Poor editing, even acting by Vikky Kaushal is not up to the mark. Only good thing about it is the sets and recreation of before independence era. You won't miss much if do not watch it.",Sardar Udham
70,tulipwoodland,Bow Down To Shoojit Daa For This Timeless Masterpiece,10,16 October 2021,"Shoojit Sircar's film on India's unsung revolutionary Sardar Udham is a tight slap to the Britishers as it rightly exposes their bigotry and their evil intentions digging down their dark colonial past. Vicky Kaushal is indeed victorious as he will be hailed for this role and yes he delivered a performance of a lifetime. Shoojit da should get all the praises for the flawless direction, the impeccable grand production design those classic Contessas on the vintage England streets to the factories and the docks from that era shown spot on. It literally takes us back to time and shook us by giving a reality check on the Britishers bullying nature. A film that will be cherished for lifetime and should be send to BAFTA and premiered at every British Film Fests. Cheers to the entire team.",Sardar Udham
71,ravi-dadlani,Brilliant! Bollywood has finally come of age.,10,21 October 2021,"Soojit Sircar and Vicky Kaushal's best so far.Incredible movie.We all know what India's official entry to the Oscar's next should be. And it should win 'Best Movie'
A special mention for the Cinematography, Avik Mukhopadhyay is amazing as is the background score of Shantanu Moitra.Keep up the great work. Making Indian cinema proud. Fabulous.",Sardar Udham
72,R0biSh0bi,"Mind blowing, make one about Madan Lal Dhingra now",10,18 October 2021,This is the best adaptation yet without any Bollywood nonsense. Vicky Kaushal is a great actor and this film did the events justice. One of my the great adaptations of Indian history in Indian cinema.,Sardar Udham
73,kushalvesmaker-94286,Oscar Worthy Performance by Vicky Kaushal!,10,16 October 2021,"This movie is a must watch for the Indians who thought freedom was easy and have no education about the hardships our freedom fighters faced for the Freedom of India. Movie has all the perfect aspects to be the best one ever created and without spoiling anything, watch the movie. It is worth your time and disappointment is not a word you'll find regarding this one.",Sardar Udham
74,surajkailase,A great watch,6,16 October 2021,"First half feels little slow but the second picks up the speed and fills the loopholes. Little lengthy but a great watch. All the performances were great, liked the sets as well, detailed.",Sardar Udham
75,BodhisattyaPal,"Breaking the prototype, masterfully!",9,16 October 2021,"""Let the world know, I was a revolutionary""In the recent years we experienced numerous movies, either some over dramatic biopic or extreme patriotic melodrama, are coming out with the same silly prototype to capture a certain portion of audience. Some are decent, some are below average & most of them are unbearable with otherworldly odd vfx and whatsapp status special love songs no one asked for! In this suffocating condition of biographical movies, to break the sinister prototype skeleton, a cinematic revolution was much needed; Shoojit Sircar brought it with a masterstroke named Sardar Udham!Inspite of the promise shown by the film, I didn't expect that it can avoid the typical bollywood biography making formula completely and masterfully! I am not sure what to say and what not about this technically supreme work. From the colour and cinematography to the recreation of historically accurate scenes; from the extraordinary score to the blazing screenplay; everything was so technical that it demands a separate writing.There is no need of any forcibly induced emotional scenes or jingoistic dialogues when you have a strong story in hand and technical men at office. In this type of work, the rawness should be evident to justify the actions. Director did exactly the same. He kept the raw tone intact and treated it with a no nonsense approach.The movie did exceptionally well with some dicision making. Use of original languages and not hindi in abnormal accent was one of the main reason why the movie feels so original. The story telling technique was also authentic. Special mention to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre recreation; it was so detailed, raw and moving that we can feel ourselves there!Vicky Kaushal added another feather in his cap delivering a composed, mature yet breathtaking performance as Udham Singh. Supporting casts were brilliant and apt. The unbiased development of characters was also superb. Actually there were hardly anything to complain about in this masterfully crafted movie.Sircar's Sardar Udham is the only biographical work coming out from Bollywood in recent years, which is able to break the rusty prototype and create a benchmark which will surely bring a wave of making serious movies devoid off the business model approach! Remarkable..",Sardar Udham
76,rohansanwal,You did make me cry in the end.,10,31 October 2021,Best part of the movie is that Jallianwala bagh massacre is in the end which keeps in that mode and mood hours of the movie.Vicky Kaushal and all the white actors are superb and the casting is great.,Sardar Udham
77,afranshourov,A little reminder to stay away from 1* giving reviewers,10,24 October 2021,"Its understandable that the movie is almost 3 hour long, and if you don't like it then there are 2 reasons1) you already know the history and expected something more well written and scripted that you are not delivered and its understandable. But let me assure you, the rest of world who didn't know the detail is quite horrified to get a glimpse of the ending.2) you are trash watcher who would rather finish a season of ""little things"" than watch a 3 houuuur movie. That's why its ""boring"" to you.",Sardar Udham
78,aumesh-10866,Story of a revolutionary but with a poor story telling,5,16 October 2021,"The story of a freedom revolutionary who waited 21 yrs to take revenge against Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. The first 2 hrs lacks complete story telling, dull with poor screenplay. Last 45 mins is the entire crux of the movie n last massacre scene is extremely painful to watch.My ratings 5/10.",Sardar Udham
79,rashedazad,What a presentation!!,9,20 October 2021,What a presentation of the story! It can be a model for learning for many of directors. It is definitely a all-time classic film of India. The only weakness is the Bhagat Singh's character. A strong actor needs to be requested for that small role.,Sardar Udham
80,bizzarebrajesh,I want it in the Oscars.,10,17 October 2021,"The direction, acting and most importantly the cinematography is at it's best. Yes, no one said about how well the cinematography is of this film. Everything just everything is just perfect.I liked the flashbacks the most and how well it's shown in the movie. Not just Vicky, every actor is just nailed. It's the power of powerful direction.Trying very hard not to give spoilers. Watch it.",Sardar Udham
81,ronaldo_matrix,"PATRIOTIC , EXQUISITE AND GRITTY ARE JUST WORDS, IT WILL MAKE YOU SAD AND LIVID!!!",9,20 October 2021,From Writer director Shoojit Sircar comes a movie which has been in the making for the past 2 decades and was earlier planned to release as Irrfan Khan in the lead role. But don't be mistaken and even Irrfan Sir will be smiling from the heavens if he sees what Vicky Kaushal has to contribute to this epic biopic.Vicky Kaushal has been always on my radar of upcoming talented actors in Bollywood ever since I watched Masaan (2015- a must see) which just shook me to the core and made me think of the talent we have outside of Bollywood. He is just tremendous in this role of our National Hero Sardar Udham Singh and plays it with such conviction and passion that you sometimes even forget that you are watching a movie and just get floored by his flawless performance 🎭. He just embodies the character so well that your eyes are just glued to the screen which also makes me come to the Direction of this film which is just breathtaking and goes from one country to another with such ease that you ought to fall in love with the cinematography here done brilliantly by Avik Mukopadhyay. Vicky also goes through a lot of physical acting here which only adds to his multilayered and Nuance performance in the film.Well.Well I have to talk about the British tyranny here without which this review would be incomplete. This movie showcases some of the most visceral and unnerving scenes of Jalianwala Bagh massacre which I have never seen before and a special warning for faint hearted (Caution already given). It will make you uncomfortable and Livid both at the same time and will make you think of the sacrifices made by our predecessors and at what cost we have got this freedom which we often don't realise.Shoojit Sircar does it again and has been doing great movies ever since Vicky Donor came out back in 2012 but this one really marks this as his Magnum Opus and is truly earned. Genre is not a barrier for Mr. Shoojit Sircar as He is not shy in making versatile films with such penacé.One of the best films of the year and India's most technically sound movie to date (Yes I can say this with utter confidence). Only drawback here is the Length of the film which could have been easily trimmed down by 15-20 minutes which would have made the movie more crispier and enjoyable to watch but nonetheless it's a monumental achievement in direction for Bollywood and a special movie to add to your library.,Sardar Udham
82,abhishekrathour-29501,A treat for the indians !,10,5 November 2021,Movie was totally built on true stories of Jallianwala bagh massacre. Vicky kaushal did an amazing job. I just loved him. The tone was serious. And the end scenes are just heart breaking. A must watch for every indian.,Sardar Udham
83,cinematicsandy,Awards sweeping attempt,8,16 October 2021,The enormity of the effort that would be required to recreate another era deserves all accolades.Shoojit Sircar has delivered again I would say. And I hope there's more to come from him.Vicky Kaushal now you hold your own place in Bollywood - I would like to see you succeed and explore your full potential. Keep the Josh High!I appreciate the team that made this movie possible. Very few Bollywood movies impress me.,Sardar Udham
84,sonusabir12,A stellar masterpiece that the whole world should watch,10,26 October 2021,"In popular culture, most of what I could remember on Bhagat Sigh was Ajay Devgan singing ""Des mere, des mere, meri shaan hein tu"". Ajay Devgan walking like a macho man arm in arm with his friends talking about patriotism in a visceral sense.The Bhagat Singh that we see in Sardar Udham is a vigorous young man who identifies himself as a revolutionary socialist, who wishes to free the entire world of imperialism and oppression.He is shown as a humanist who talked at length about the difference between the violence inflicted by revolutionaries and terrorists, about symbolic acts which could make the oppressors realise about the oppression they are committing, and not with an intention to hurt anyone.The movie stands out as the best movie I have watched on India's independence movement. It shows the spine-chilling and heart-wrenching absolute horror of the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh.It has amazing narration and cinematography intensifying the struggle and transformation of the orphan Udham Singh from a naive lad to a staunch revolutionary.The non-sequential narration of the story actually abstracts many a detail from the viewer, but it essentially shows the core emotions that the protagonist goes through.The governor Dwyer is not shown a demonic villain but a man who is philosophically flawed by the ideology of his colonial times.Udham Singh's experience of the massacre is the central theme of the movie and it is extraordinarily portrayed.",Sardar Udham
85,nithinjayram,A perfect biopic,10,16 October 2021,"Brilliant filmmaking. Shoojit Sarcar has done it again. Good depiction of Jallianwala bagh massacre. A bit slow and long, can be tolerated.

Have read just few line in our textbook of history in our school on that tragic incident. Have not heard about Udham Sing and his lone revolution against British rule and protest this massacre.Yes! This is unexpected cinematic experience to me and credentials should give the director to his brilliant narrative on the lone Udham Sing. Production design and Cinematography is excellent. More than the 'inner landscape' of tragic event would have appreciate by critics.I thing Sardar udham will on the run to Academy award.,Sardar Udham

Grief, sentiment and emotions were well presented. The cause of the braveson, Sardar Udham Singh has been highlighted in a very noble way.And foremost, the message was straight, clear and sharp, 'Britain owes an official apology for the nuisance they made in this beautiful land and for the barbaric loot of our wealth and it should be repatriated with all the very same efforts made, to carry it to Buckingham!'I wish and I hope strongly, all those were involved in these destruction, must and shall not find peace in afterlife!Thank You Amazon Prime and Team 'Sardar Udham' for a brilliant projection which never had any fault.

Applause for that to Srijit Sircar. His entire crew has done tremendous work. From now I'm looking forward to see such beautiful work again . No song has in it ; I'm bit of dissatisfied, may be, it doesn't urged any song. Still it's hit.After watching the scene of Jalianwala Bagh massacre, my respect towards the freedom fighters including our real hero as in army has accelerated more than 100 times. Conversely hate has gradually increased towards the bloody demonic Britishers ; how brutally murdered our sisters n brothers, created river of blood. In my views, What Udham Singh had done in their own territory is absolutely right. Tit for tat. I watched the whole film with the great touching of my heart. I loved it.Every characters are looking quite convincing in their role except Bhagat Singh. This character could be a little better. Doesn't suit that guy who has been casted for it. Anyway, Vicky's acting is quite hard to follow ; so natural. Nailed it. Others are also very good.My rating for this film 10/10.To you,
Go for it, it's a good film extremely worthwhile.",Sardar Udham

I was very much in the movie due to its relatively less vocal or dialogues typish and much of its scenes speaking the history of the Jallianwala Wagh Massacre. Also i was astonished to see (in the ending of the movie) that England has not apologized for that heart wrenching cruelity on Indians done in that insane, never forgiving act.But totally an awesome movie to watch.

And they say-
We got freedom from the wheels.They can narrate the history on their own but the contributions of martys like Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh, Netaji and many many more great warriors of the nation can not be erased.

120,ar-reviews,"Powerful movie, great direction, soulful acting",10,16 October 2021,"A slow burning yet so powerful story telling. The movie tells the tale of a man's pain and his road to justice. The road is long, slow, meticulous and painful. A lesser human would have given up and started looking for normalcy in their life.Makers of the movie did great justice to the tale by not adding any usual bollywood elements of dancing and singing and absurd fight scenes. Vicky was fantastic in the role as Udham Singh.For the reviewers who are giving a 1 star review complaining about the movie being slow, its a true story that spanned decades. You cannot pace it up by adding cheap thrills and still do justice to what really happened. We need to appreciate true history in our art, otherwise everything is going to become Bal Narendra tales down the line.",Sardar Udham

Vicky Kaushal has relived one of the greatest revolutionary Sardar Udham so realistically that it makes me feel as if I was actually moving through that period along with him.

In the movie Sardar Udham said at one point that people know about Jallianwala Baugh very less, because it's written in the some corner of the page and that's it.

The director, the editor and the cinematographer have done an excellent job. Amol Parashar is outstanding and the audience will be left hungry for more.

Top acting performances and very terrifying scenes make this movie one of the best of this year.,Sardar Udham

157,davewadam1982,Masterpiece,9,17 October 2021,"For those who found this film boring, Coolie No. 1 is also available on Amazon Prime. Enjoy.This is exceptionally well executed, gut wrenching and never bowing to commercialisation or expectations. As a Brit myself, it was sobering to watch my ancestors shown in all their racist, colonial and bigoted reality (a country's most shameful acts are always left out of their history books, so my history books were only 5 pages long).Vicky Kaushal cements his greatest role yet, with a multi-layered performance so hypnotic, he dazzles whenever he's on screen.Fantastic movie.",Sardar Udham
158,abhrp,A slow start but a haunting end.,10,16 October 2021,"Sardar Udham Singh starts slowly, jumping timelines and taking time to lay the groundwork for the second half and climax of the movie, and the payoff is a haunting and gut-wrenching movie watching experience.Despite our history books containing very scarce information about Sardar Udham Singh, the movie does a commendable job of outlining his character and also establishes his camaraderie with other freedom fighters of the time.But it's the second half of the movie that will stay with you. I don't remember watching any movie or documentary that has done justice to what happened on that infamous day of April 13, 1919. A crowd of innocent, unarmed men, women and children were mercilessly fired upon by the white supremacists of British imperialism. That the British are yet to tender an official apology for this crime against humanity proves that the evil of racism and supremacist ideology is well and alive.The movie also a makes a smart but subtle point of how the British were fighting the scourge of Nazism in Europe while at the same time enslaving millions of Indians and trampling upon their rights, while having no shame in asking for Indian soldiers to fight their enemies in Europe.The writing of the movie deserves a special mention as it does not resort to jingoism or song and dance to make a point for patriotism.This is by no doubt Vicky Kaushal's best performance till date. He carries the whole film and by the end of it becomes the character.Personally, have never cried watching a patriotic movie, but I couldn't stop my tears at the Jallianwala Bagh scene. And it is not anger that you feel, it's a kind of helplessness and sadness, and shock that humans can think of so little of other humans just because of their skin colour and a false sense of superiority that they think it's justified to massacre them in this manner.",Sardar Udham
159,adithehunk-pikul,Reflected history in the best way they could.,9,17 October 2021,Absolutely heartbreaking reality of jalianwala bagh massacre. And the awakening of a freedom fighter.

160,rkashyap621,An excellent movie with highly remarkable treatment to the story,10,23 October 2021,"Shoojit sircar has always provided us the raw reality on screen and this time he elevates it onto another level. The movie has a run time of about 160 minutes which may look like a bit stretch, but I would say it was a necessary risk to add the proper depth to encapsulate the historic event without any compromisation.The final act of this movie provides us with the brutal and heart clenching visuals of Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. The scale and the depth in which they have captured the horrific event is truly phenomenal.The cinematography and music are beatiful and goes hand in hand throughout the movie, which makes sure to transport us into the time the incident took place.Vicky Kaushal has given his best performance to portray Sardam Udham singh.It would have been even great if we would have been able to experience this movie on the big screen of theatre.Kudos to the whole crew for making such a great attempt in making this wonderful movie.",Sardar Udham
161,jk0223,Potential wasted,5,23 October 2021,This movie had the potential to be very engaging. It felt too dragged out. Could've been wrapped up in 2hrs. Great acting and direction too but the screenplay and background score dampened the overall experience.,Sardar Udham

Shoojit Sircar - The man who's taking Hindi Cinema to next level. Don't know what kind of magic he has in his craft, one just cannot let go his movies. His movies stay with you even after it has ended. The Writing, Cinematography, Background Score, Production Desgin, cannot find a single flaw. Same for Vicky Kaushal's performance. His silence, his eyes, his expression, everything. This was a demanding role, and Vicky excels it. Even the supporting cast are so natural in their performance. All kudos to the Captain of the ship to not letting this film from become Filmy & Caricature. Such a Beautiful Piece of Art!",Sardar Udham

172,sujit_kumar,Phycology and emotion behind Udham's actions,9,17 October 2021,"The movie narrates the phycology and emotions behind Udham's actions. The primary reasoning of the British to rule India and other parts of the world is to ""Make them civilized"" is something that is so intriguing. Hard to believe that the world was contained with their lame justification. Vicky Kaushal is amazing as ever in his role of Udham Singh.",Sardar Udham
173,LaltooBan,Important story needed to be told,5,25 October 2021,"Decent movie. Brilliant cinematography. Foreign actors were very well integrated into storyline.Editing sucked. Need patience & concentration to watch the movie.Couple of issues,
1. Length at 2.45 hrs was a bit indulgent, could hv been trimmed by 20-30 mins. Maybe OTT gave the luxury.2. Editing was chaotic, esp. In first half, switching timelines every other scene. It got annoying to say the least.3. Jallianwala baug scene was gore, grotesque which being true is fine. But it got repetitive & dragged on for 45 mins losing viewers attention span.",Sardar Udham
174,ananyomukherjeeslg,Best Indian movie made on life of a freedom fighter till date,9,21 October 2021,"Goosebumps; brilliant representation of history. Unlike any Indian movie made on freedom struggle or life of any freedom fighter, this one has actually captured the context, personal evolution and ideology of a freedom fighter instead of representing a larger than life image full of patriotic fervor and bravado. This is a gem of modern Indian cinema and hats off to Soojit Sirkar. Excellent work.",Sardar Udham
175,tkmce2008,Biopics don't get better than this...,10,18 October 2021,"Shoojit Sircar returns with his dream project; Sardar Udham. Shoojit shuffles between two genres primarily: Slice of life & Biopics/Historical films. Udham belongs to the latter. Sardar Udham is the story of Udham Singh, a revolutionary known for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The film follows Udham from the day before the massacre to the day he is hanged to death. The meticulous planning he puts in place to orchestrate the assassination is phenomenal!With Shoojit Sircar at the helm, you are guaranteed something extraordinary at the very least. Sardar Udham exceeds expectations with a scintillating Vicky Kaushal in the lead. There are no words to describe his committed performance. His character is a man of few words but his expressions and actions speak volumes (post massacre scenes). The era in which the film is set (from 1919 to 1940) is perfectly captured & one can't praise the cinematographer, #avikmukhopadhyay enough for his beautiful work. The supporting cast do not have much to do but they fit in perfectly. We do not have any cringe worthy Hindi speaking Brits like other pre-independence set films.Sardar Udham is a masterpiece. It is one of the most authentic; well researched biopics made till date in India and it adopts the non-linear narrative in the best possible way. It saves the massacre bit till the very end for effect. There isn't a better depiction of the same onscreen. The horrors of that incident reverberate even today. Sardar Udham moves at a snail's pace; something the film calls for. So build up your patience and savour this biopic that you will not forget anytime soon.",Sardar Udham
176,earockz,A masterpiece,9,16 October 2021,"This movie shouldn't go unnoticed.Other than a historical drama based on the Jallianwala Bagh incident, I didn't know much about the movie. But it turns out as the movie which made me cry unlike any other movie before.This is undoubtedly a top-notch quality movie with brilliant making and performance. Every single frame shown, all the dialogues delivered takes you deep inside the soul of the story.Hats off to the director. From Vicky Donor, Piku, October, now Shoojit Sircar has reached a Mel Gibson level direction. (I'm not kidding). The massacre of Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, was only a one-page article in my textbook. But the way they narrated, easily took me back to that period and understand their plight. The incredible, horrific, cinematic expression of that tragedy will always remain in my mind. I highly recommend everyone, not to miss this piece of art.This movie should not go unnoticed.",Sardar Udham
177,jagjeetsingha1,Quite disappointed,7,18 October 2021,A big salute to Sardar Udham Singh .But movie doesn't really concentrate on showing the whole journey of sardar udham Singh. Rather the movie pace is over slow. It just failed to provide information about how he came to know about Russia. The director was really committed to show that he did everything on his own only. Rather it is true . But you skipped all the journey in the meanwhile.,Sardar Udham

185,nishantiitb,"Utterly boring, slow and very average acting",1,20 October 2021,Rarely you will find a movie with 9+ imdb rating. I was expecting some once in a decade kind of movie but it was a big disappointment.The role does not suits Vicky Kaushal who is better for a protagonists friend's role as he did in Sanju.Not even a single scene which can give you goosebumps barring few minutes of Jallianwallah massacre scene. Did not had the patience to watch the full movie so quitted at 2 hrs. I am very sure nothing would have changed in the last 35 minutes.The reviews are not genuine and are based on patriotic sentiments similar to the reviews given for Sushant's last movie Dil Bechara.,Sardar Udham

He took the revenge for the Jalliawala Bagh Shooting in which thousands of people and children were killed and many were gravely injured just for the peaceful gathering which was found dangerous by General O Dyer.,Sardar Udham
188,alfazsheikh-39101,Great!,10,17 October 2021,There can't be such a well made cinema than this. It will leave you in tears. Don't have more words to describe it. Vicky Kaushal's career best with Shoojit Sircar's great filmmaking. Just watch it!!,Sardar Udham
189,shloksmartj,No words can define.,10,16 October 2021,Nothing can describe such good performance I did loved the acting of Vicky kaushal in this film too though I just have watched 2 films of his and even after the film ended infact now I am confused what was the real and full name of Sardar Udham.,Sardar Udham

191,shekharwidu,Average and mediocre performance,1,16 October 2021,"I had some good expectations with this movie .Very disappointed
With the movie .No justice done.Things were already clear half of the movie was running in flashback.Missing touch of kesari and the legend of Bhagat Singh.It seems Bollywood wants to rebuild its image from
Charas and ganja to patriotism, heroine smack to patriotism..
These days it has become a fashion of making a movie on patriotism .",Sardar Udham
192,vardhanu-12932,This movie deserved a wide theatre release.,10,1 November 2021,It would have been great to watch the movie in a theatre. This movie was also denied to be nominated for the Oscars for showing the British in bad light.

194,poulaminitd,Vicky Kaushal did a great job however the length of the movie is bit too long,5,23 October 2021,I am giving 5/10 rating here only because of the hard work Vicky Kaushal had put in otherwise I had felt some scenes are unnecessarily long and repetitive. 70% of the movie being in English ( although the Irish and English actors had acted so naturally and did commendable work) had reduced the charm of the movie being Indian/Hindi. In addition to it some of the scenes of Jaliwanwala massacre were repeated and though he tried to bring resemblance of Nolan's work it lacked the completeness. Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh was not convincing as he often was going back to his TVF accent from the fake Punjabi accent he tried so hard. Overall the movie was a good watch but it could have been sped up and some stories like what happened to him in Russia etc could have been elaborated instead of putting him in snow for such a long duration at a same spot with no striking incident.,Sardar Udham

196,ravinbhandari-16210,"Inaccurate representation of non-sikhs in Jallianwala bagh in ""Sardar Udham""",10,7 November 2021,"Very well made movie - no doubt. But in the scenes of Jallianwala bagh, the movie director showed mostly Sikhs with turban in the bagh. We can see only a couple of non-sikhs in the big gathering. Seems like this is inaccurate representation. In my opinion many hindus were also present in the gathering. In fact my own grandfather, a non-turban wearing hindu punjabi, who lived about 4 km away from the Bagh, came to attend the gathering. Not only the sikhs, but hindus also have been contributors to freedom fighting in a very large number in India. Even though there is above overlook by the director, I would still gave 10 to IMDB rating for this movie.",Sardar Udham

207,sleppyash,All in all a good movie,7,9 November 2021,Giving an honest review i think that this movie is one of the best bollywood movies in a long time.The story was interesting and the visuals were stunning. I do have a few critics on this movie.First and foremost i and many other people think that the movie was long .Second i think the choice of people for some of the characters were just wrong eg. Baghat singh and the crew and the Jallianwala Bagh scene just looked like a set. The movie was not rushed and all in all i think it is a good movie.,Sardar Udham
208,dixitsandeep,No words! just speechless. Better than Titanic,10,21 October 2021,"Amazing Movie. Very realistic depictions of events. Though key act of the movie is realistic depiction of the shocking massacre but film has also shown the attitude of many British people of that time, ""Ruling India is Whiteman's burden"". It also highlight's the character of Dwyer in detail. And not to mention had shown all that Udham would have gone through.In showing realistic depiction of history, it's only comparable to Titanic but the subject far better than Titanic.",Sardar Udham

Very realistic depiction of horrors of Jaliyawallan Baug massacre is shocking and disturbing.They way Udham Singh interrogation is shown and how Dawyer murdered is thrilling...
And yet movie is Entertaining and gripping.Only Comparable to Titanic in authenticity and Depiction of a true event.It's surely and Oscar Candidate.",Sardar Udham
210,soumik-1007,Oscar Alert,10,18 October 2021,"I can't review this movie, it should win the ultimate award if there is no dwyer in the panel.It was barbaric and british not even felt guilty for the massacre. The truth has shown in this movie.",Sardar Udham
211,fr_sidd,Good cinematography but extremely slow and boring,5,23 October 2021,"Very very slow and long movie. This movie could've been made as a 20 mins documentary but it was a big drag on.Furthermore, very ordinary acting by Vicky Kaushal.Really don't understand the high ratings here.",Sardar Udham
212,khan-fardeen330,Movie loses the plot more than once,7,29 October 2021,"The movie reminded me of a German movie that had similar editing, The last days : Sophie Scholl but Sardar Udham was very hard to follow due to bad editing with constant change in timeline ( a bit like Shahid and Sonam's Mausam). In addition to this, the English extras did a poor job. Vicky Kaushal's acting was far from perfect and this definitely was not Shoojit Sircar's best work. Courtesy editing, the director and cinematographer manage to save the movie more than once in the first half. The storytelling improves in the second half but not enough to save the movie entirely. Rated it +1 for the in detail account of the massacre and the events that followed.TLDR - The movie is definitely not worthy of an Oscar entry but if you are a South Asian you should probably watch it.",Sardar Udham
213,chintul-shah,Brilliant!,9,18 October 2021,"What a movie!When in school I learnt about the Jalianwala Bagh incident, I always felt such hatred and angst towards what had happened. This absolutely brilliant depiction had me in tears. What a performance by Vicky Kaushal! And Shoojit Sircar, impeccably made movie! I seldom watch and love Bollywood, but Vicky Kaushal was something that I looked forward to seeing.Watch this to just have a grasp on what horrors occured and what it might have felt to be there.Top notch story telling and Performances.",Sardar Udham

216,abhi_singh98,"Ae mere watan ke logon, zara aankh me bhar lo paani!",8,17 October 2021,"As an Indian history nerd and cinephile, I have been dying for a movie to portray the era leading up to Indian independence without the lens of Bollywood patriotism or Gandhi's way of looking away from anything violent and show exactly what happened.This movie (mostly) set in the early-to-late 30s in Imperial Britain manages to do so on many fronts. Ongoing revolutions against the British empire, the rise of communism in the eastern Europe and the impending World War II set the backdrop for the movie. O Dwyer's proud speeches on his leadership, Churchill's cold-heartedness, Bhagat Singh's ideology and Gandhi's relentless fight can all be found in parts.On the technical front, the set design and cinematography are nearly flawless, while the sound design and the lighting really help these ""troubling"" times come to life. The attention to detail you see in each scene is encouraging to say the least.The direction of proven creator Sircar really shines in this gloomy affair. The timeline he chooses to show different events is extremely effective. The acting is great throughout. Vicky's portrayal of a man staring at death in the past, fighting alone in the present for even a slightly better future, is impeccable. While his scenes with Bhagat Singh give an insight on the playfulness of their brotherhood, his trying and failing efforts to re-build his organization is disheartening and his interactions with O Dwyer are absolutely gut wrenching. The acting by supporting cast is also amazing, especially the actor portraying O Dwyer.The massacre itself is captured in all its brutality. The leading circumstances to the inhumane order, followed by the aftermath straight form the eyes of a certain Udham is likely to give you nightmares, and for good reason.On negatives, the movie might be too long for its own good, but in my opinion it utilizes that time really effectively. Maybe some unnecessary scenes which don't move the plot could be cut but I am really nit-picking here.In conclusion, to anyone who happened to read this, I hope you can dedicate 3 hours of your time to this story of a common man standing up to his circumstances. I believe you won't be disappointed!",Sardar Udham

They may brush their atrocities under the rug, but they're still there and should be exposed everywhere to truly educate the world about what really happened.They Express and project their moral high-ground everywhere. But, they were just as brutal, if not worse, than any despicable regime we have seen since.And, such atrocities continue to occur under the rationale of one ideology or another.Nothing can justify such actions.

Watch it for the story you dumbfcksStupid people like these are the reason why Bollywood used to make meaningless extra jingoistic commercial Biopics well thank god for New age directors like Shoojit Sircar and actors like Vicky Kaushal, that seems to be changing !!!Perfectly executed Movie and they managed to perfectly portray the Essence of Indian Independence movement without being overly jingoistic

It's simple, raw and will make you weep the entire last 30 mins.It presents the fact as it is, cinematography is top notch (no less than any hollywood movie), Shoojit Sircars direction never disappoints.

227,mtshashwat,A well known story presented in a brilliant way.Worthy of an academy award .,9,16 October 2021,"We all know about Sardar Udham Singh ji and the Jallianwala Bagh . I have been to Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar . I have seen the bullet marks embedded on the wall ,seen the narrow passage, heard about how people even jumped into the well to save them , heard about the story multiple times, heard about the courageous act of Shaheed Sardar Udham Sigh .When I heard that this movie is available in amazon prime I thought this will be another movie filled with some jingoism and the typical Bollywood touch of exaggeration. But it is new, it is really a brilliant piece by Shoojit Sircar , especially the details it has got right, how the radio in the background is telling the events of the WW2 , the representation of the curfew imposed at the time of massacre , it's brilliant. Most importantly the conversation feels realistic as it is in British English and not in some form of anglicised Hindi 😅 which we have been used to hearing in most of Bollywood movies. The last few minutes of the movie stays with you , makes you think again ,what did it cost us to get our freedom back .Most importantly the phrase ""white Man's Burden "" , kept coming in the movie and kept on reminding you what it was actually. This is really a wonderful creation and the character of Martyr Sardar Udham Singh is portrayed brilliantly by Vicky Kaushal , a true versatile actor which Bollywood needs desperately. All in all a must watch movie.",Sardar Udham

I wonder who approves such scripts that have no thrilling moments in it. Vicky Kaushal plays mute through most of the film with couple of expressions. Manoj Kumar would have made a better film based on the life of Sardaar Udham Singh in the 70s. Indian film makers these days just make films that are biopic with some patriotic jingoism.

255,gsingh-89939,Watch it as a biopic and you will fall in love!,10,28 October 2021,"First things first. If you are a fan of linear story telling, this movie is not for you! If you are prepared to shilly-shally between timelines, there are rarely any movies that you would find that meet this magnum opus. The movie has numerous moments of brilliance, but the third act is its USP. The sequence will be remembered in the history of cinema as one of the most accurate and moving acts of all time! The acting, the set and the melancholy music complement the tone of the reel marvellously. Finally we have an Indian patriotic movie sans the shouting and the slogans, but is a slow burn, much like the life of the revolutionary it pays homage to! Worth every penny and second!",Sardar Udham
256,muktikant-90975,A Patient Assassin,9,17 October 2021,"The movie captured national movement, 1919 massacre, movements of HSRA and especially life & journey of Uddham Singh perfectly. It is a gem jem that bollywood produced in recent years. The blue filter fits the movie. The editing and cut scenes are top notch. Movie is 2.45 hr long. It is slow paced but carry the essence of the movie. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the aftermath is so so realistic, I can't remember any other bollywood movie that portrays the scene accurately. It can be compared to the opening scenes of Savings private Ryan. A prefect tribute to late Irrfan Khan. India should Nominate this movie for this year Oscar.",Sardar Udham

274,somak-mukherjee,Inspiring and haunting. One of the best of the year.,8,16 October 2021,"The biopic follows Indian revolutionary Udham Singh's journey from the aftermath of the horrifying Jallianwala Bagh Massacre to him assassinating it's perpetrator Michael O. Dwyer to his capture and death. The writers Ritesh Shah and Shubhendu Bhattacharya have created a non-linear screenplay that goes back and forth several times from the present to the past, while this worked to a large extent, it's perhaps a bit overused to being exhausting after a point. Technically the movie is almost flawless, rarely have I seen such exemplary cinematography and production design in a bollywood movie that is neither grand or over the top but just accurate, and that's absolutely what was needed here. Shantanu Moitra's score is beautiful and haunting at times. Shoojit Sircar the Captain of the ship yet again delivers, but perhaps the ship's main engine is the wonder boy Vicky Kaushal, who delivers his career best performance yet, he literally breathes life into a character that many of us were unaware of. Irrfan was supposed to play this role, and I'm sure he is somewhere there very proud of both Vicky and Shoojit. In the end would just like to salute the spirit of Udham Singh, may his fight for freedom and justice inspire us present generation to make a change. Inquilab Zindabad!",Sardar Udham

If it was not for lack of available documents/papers, it can be showed to school students as NCERT books seriously need some updates. It is a must watch and a fitting tribute to Udham Singh ji.",Sardar Udham
278,mailpat,Masterfully Crafted. It should be India's entry to Oscars,10,18 October 2021,"For people who usually rave about the craft direction and acting of Hollywood movies. This masterpiece from Shoojit Sircar is a must watch, maybe several times. A biography so well told, it rivals the best biographies made by anyone. A story about an unknown freedom fighter told extremely well, in an non-linear fashion, which Hindi movie watchers wouldn't be accustomed to. Everything about the film is 100/10 brilliant. Screenplay, art direction, editing, action, costumes, casting, sound track, topped by a brilliant performance by Vicky Kaushal. All put together into a superb masterpiece by Shoojit. The effort taken to create London and India of early 1900's, the cars, buildings, costumes, the props and the attention to detail ranks with the best in the world. The central premise (Jalianwala Baug Massacre) around which the film is based on, is chilling, brutal and realistically executed. You really feel the raw pain, shock and grief of Udham Singh when he's in Jalianwala Baug, and then you understand his resolve and determination to avenge the dastardly act after 21 long years. It should be the only contender from India for Oscars 2022. An unknown story, fabulously told. Take a bow Shoojit Sircar.",Sardar Udham
279,singhakshay040,Fire the Editor.,4,18 October 2021,"I really enjoyed the scene where he carried half dead people to the makeshift hospital.

Not your typical bollywood flix . It is a really impactful attempt to show the barbaric and brutal attack on jallianwala bagh and it's aftermath through the perspective of a person who's been there in that aftermath . I lost all hope when it came to bollywood films but this masterpiece proved me wrong , it proved if you have good storytelling , acting and music (best thing is there is no song in this film and the background score is very good ) you can make good content even in bollywood .",Sardar Udham
282,harshmastermind7,Oscar worthy Indian movie!,10,23 October 2021,"Wow, I've never thought I would ever see an Indian movie that is so marvelously made that it would make me say that it's the best Indian movie made yet. Let me say simply if this movie was an American movie then it would have had 8-9 Oscar nominations(Not overexaggerating)!Sardar Udham provides the exact blueprint about how a historical period movie should be made. Personally, I think movies like Border and Gadar spoiled the movie makers and audience about how a historical movie should be made. It stays close to historical facts, particularly the ideological commitments of our revolutionaries. The vision of India sans jingoism, refreshing indeed.The technical aspect of the film was on a whole another level altogether. The production design, costume design, cinematography, background music (not a single Bollywood song), and set designs are astounding. Truly a landmark in Hindi Cinema and the gold standard to beat in Indian cinema!Last 30 mins...Goosebumps GUARANTEED.",Sardar Udham
283,stephanroa,"Motivation, Courage and Patience aka Udham Singh",9,25 October 2021,"Movie speaks directly on the point without making lengthy. Highly capable to hit hard and up to the mark on audience whether you are aware of the Jalianwala incident or not. It's can be literally seen on the face of the main character of the movie, that he has experienced something beyond words or as he said in movie ""He saw death that night and all strangers became his known."". Director has done an exceptional work on research and development. You don't see such kind of work coming from Bollywood, thanks to OTT (Amazon prime) to make this happen.",Sardar Udham

288,dashsiddhant,"Let the world know, Udham Singh was a revolutionary",10,24 October 2021,"""Let the world know, I was a revolutionary""In the recent years we experienced numerous movies, either some over dramatic biopic or extreme patriotic melodrama, are coming out with the same silly prototype to capture a certain portion of audience. Some are decent, some are below average & most of them are unbearable with otherworldly odd vfx and whatsapp status special love songs no one asked for! In this suffocating condition of biographical movies, to break the sinister prototype skeleton, a cinematic revolution was much needed; Shoojit Sircar brought it with a masterstroke named Sardar Udham!Inspite of the promise shown by the film, I didn't expect that it can avoid the typical bollywood biography making formula completely and masterfully! I am not sure what to say and what not about this technically supreme work. From the colour and cinematography to the recreation of historically accurate scenes; from the extraordinary score to the blazing screenplay; everything was so technical that it demands a separate writing.There is no need of any forcibly induced emotional scenes or jingoistic dialogues when you have a strong story in hand and technical men at office. In this type of work, the rawness should be evident to justify the actions. Director did exactly the same. He kept the raw tone intact and treated it with a no nonsense approach.The movie did exceptionally well with some dicision making. Use of original languages and not hindi in abnormal accent was one of the main reason why the movie feels so original. The story telling technique was also authentic. Special mention to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre recreation; it was so detailed, raw and moving that we can feel ourselves there!Vicky Kaushal added another feather in his cap delivering a composed, mature yet breathtaking performance as Udham Singh. Supporting casts were brilliant and apt. The unbiased development of characters was also superb. Actually there were hardly anything to complain about in this masterfully crafted movie.Sircar's Sardar Udham is the only biographical work coming out from Bollywood in recent years, which is able to break the rusty prototype and create a benchmark which will surely bring a wave of making serious movies devoid off the business model approach! Remarkable..",Sardar Udham

Inspired by authentic life events of Indian Liberation fighter Sardar Udham Singh. One of best movie I ever optically discerned, So authentic not any nonessential things, Cringe Patriotic Dialogues, Nationalistic Musical composition integrated at the cost of cinematic liberbity. Just the story of a man Whose aim was to take Kill Something What was the Abaft the death of his Hundreds of Countrymen. Since I optically canvassed #VickyKaushal in Masaan I ken there was something special in this man and I became his astronomically immense, but this time he surprised me everybody by giving one of the best performance in the history of indian cinema. It doesn't seems akin to he's acting he looks so authentic, Impeccable, Effortlessly he has distributed such arduous performance. The Jalian wala bag Massacre Track of the movie is the most heartbreaking Emotional scene in the history of indian cinema. Especially that scene Where Udham is Shouting "" Is anyone alive "" looking around for availing Wounded ones with Hundreds of dead bodies lying down made me cry. The background score is great, Kudos to Soorjit Sircar For such a brilliant direction. Writers Deserve the appreciation for inditing The authentic things not integrating any Massy Things Make it Better Than All the Biopics Made in Bollywood till Now.

But Hat's off to all the people behind this movie for showing this in such a cinematic way. Couldn't stop crying for last 45 minutes.

315,ishanibhatia,Indeed a masterpiece!,10,24 October 2021,Was holding up really well until Vicky Kaushal breaks down while picking up bodies of the dead. It's really hurtful to see that India still didn't get an apology from Britishers for that barbarous massacre.,Sardar Udham
316,dsarkar-91893,We really need this type of movies,9,16 October 2021,"There are two important aspects that we could recall or know from this movie. I (as I don't know about others) was not aware of so many facts about such a great hero of our struggle for independence. Our history text books told us just the name of Udham Singh and may be a small para on Jallianwala Bagh massacre, however never highlighted that this can surpass any other genocide of the world history in terms of brutality, yes even if we consider about the Nazi days in Europe. This movie will definitely give an opportunity to young India to understand the scenarios during the colonial rule.Our historians (or the history books) always granted importance to few selected leaders and younger generation may not be aware that thousands of people were subjected to inhuman torture and sacrificed their lives for the sake of the country's freedom.So thanks a lot, to the director for these great initiatives and rating is for that. We badly need this kind of movies to communicate to our new generation as well as rest of the world that what Britishers did to us. The details of the set created were great and acting in general were commendable. However, there were few prolonged scenes, repetitive and may be repulsive for some of us, which could have been avoided by reducing the length of the movie.",Sardar Udham

This is what happened nearly a 100 years ago. That people could be so cruel. And how they can just forget and move on while the ones which went through just continue to suffer. The apology, it's still remaining. Honestly do they not know of existence of stories like these? I'm so curious as to what they teach their children in schools, this is outrageous.This may be shallow but when I saw the trailer I wanted to watch the movie because ofcourse I was curious about the history but also because of the beauty of london during that era and the cinematography (which I must say did not disappoint). While I did enjoy seeing the buildings and the how london was depicted. I did not feel any Indian places lacking in beauty anywhere. And that's the beauty of this movie. The colour toning and cinematography is just soo beautiful that it's visually pleasing to see the movie.It was soo worth it! Even though I stretched watching one movie to three days.",Sardar Udham

This is a masterpiece from Soojit Sircar. Vicky Kaushal has done a mindblowi job. This is an extremely disturbing film and in the last 40 minutes, there aren't much dialogues.Avik Mukhopadhyay is the cinematographer and I think this movie has become the best Bollywood movie ever made in terms of cinematography. The frames are so well made.",Sardar Udham
350,Pratik_vasani,Must watch movie for every British kid.,10,16 October 2021,"First of all I pay my utmost respect to veer bhagat singh and sardar udham singh.Technical aspects of this movie-
The screenplay--It's gripping because it is non monotonous.Cinematography - its perfect for the events shown. The events were even darker and monstrous than shown in the movie. The dark tone of the movie reminds us about the dark fates our VEER SWATANTRA SENANI smilingly embraced as a result of which we are living a colourful and joyous life. The shooting of the movie is very raw and realistic, it successfully enables us to imagine the circumstances at that time.Acting - Vicky kaushal, take a bow. Next national award for best actor doesn't go to Vicky kaushal and the national awards loose their credentials for me. All the supporting cast were perfect.I would specially mention about the mentions and presentation of veer bhagat singh in this movie, its very short like not more than 3 minutes, but we get an insight of his personality and philosophical aspect better than we get in the ajay devgan film, I love that movie but we have to give we're credits are due.At last the hero of this movie sujeet sirkar, I wasn't expecting anything less than this.A very well made movie.",Sardar Udham
351,theburaiwala,Masterpiece again,10,17 October 2021,Sujit Sircar again create a masterpiece.. you can feel the movie.. real biography.. classic.. This movie shows different types of efforts to get freedom from British who just enjoying killing people to make threat.,Sardar Udham
352,ebinsemmanuel,Masterpiece,10,22 October 2021,Uddham Singh is one of the unsung heroes in the history of Indian freedom struggle. Sardar Uddham is a film inspired by his struggles.The film is not ready to compromise on its content and quality. It can claim to be the best making film I have seen in recent times. Vicky Kaushal's performance as Sardar Uddham is excellent.The last hour of the film.. I don't know how to describe it. The audience will sit for an hour not knowing whether what they see in front of them is imaginary or real.. That whole hour will be a total freeze..The climax of the film shows that a lot of documents about Sardar Uddham are still unpublished. Real life is not brought to the screen in the same way. It has cinematic elements. But the film will never disappoint the viewer.. Another epic film in Indian cinema...,Sardar Udham
353,rebanta94,Journey through Sardar Udham's eyes,10,17 October 2021,"As a movie, it may not deserve 10. I would say a 8 possibly. But it's necessary we should give it 10, if 1 cr people of India rate it 10, it might attract British audience too and who knows we might get an official apology too (highly unlikely though). Hope for the best.",Sardar Udham

359,iamsilentwinner,Sardar udham based on true story,10,30 October 2021,"It's really good movie at all.Should be nominated for the Oscar in my point of view because it is one of the best movies in Oscar's category. The movie contain's Action, violence, emotions, feelings , One's love towards his nation and many more. The movie had the scenes that is more than enough for making anybody emotional .The location's the movie Is perfect. Movie is little bit big almost 2 hours 43 min. Doesn't contain any song which means it is totally focused on the event happened on 13 April, 2021 in Jallianwala Bagh,Punjab.Suggestion: I think Once should watch this movie because it show's the struggle of independence and the hard work of Shaheed udham singh also know as Sher Singh.",Sardar Udham
360,jessgill-12218,Revolutionary,10,31 October 2021,"This is what youth needs to know and understand our history of India. There is so much more to our history, this is what needs to be taught in school not just Gandhi's stories. LIVE LONG REVOLUTIONARY.",Sardar Udham

May this generation atleast acknowledge this hero for whom we've got a somewhat free life. Please watch this movie for our heroes deserve it, and so does the actor,the director and every single person involved for this stunning creation.",Sardar Udham
362,lekhrajsharmalalit,Probably the best movie depicting the era of British colonialism in India,10,29 October 2021,"This movie is truly a depiction of what it must have been during the so called 'empire' of the British. Many were running and crying while others standing to protect them. I didn't want to watch it first, but as I kept diving in, I felt like being burdened with more and more responsibility. Responsibility of realization, responsibility of celebration, responsibility of acceptance, of the sacrifice we made, of the sacrifice my own grandfather, my own great grandfather made. I must not forget what was brought upon them. My responsibility has suddenly increased from just living for others to make a better world to work for it not just live, to put the true effort I have been avoiding. This was the impact of the movie. It brought me the true feeling of being a part of the rebellion, a rebellion for justice, freedom, equality, even though I contributed nothing in it.Movie especially in the second half told me the feeling of carrying the weight of thousands on shoulder in probably the best way possible.The movie kept me engaged and showed me how brutal the force were at that time, the dark times. No fancy words! I was captivated the whole time. Before this, the only movie about Indian struggle I liked the most was Kranti (1975), despite belonging to the Generation Z (being born in 2001). Now I put this movie equal to that movie.I will like to end this review with a quote of Michael O'Dwyer from the movie itself which relates to a controversy related to this movie you can find on Internet [Hint: Oscar Awards Nominations]. He said,""This is one thing I like in Indians, they are always eager to please!""
Let it not be true anymore. Live for the nation...Jai Hind!!",Sardar Udham

BUT, the last 30 mins, will shake everyone who loves his country, mind you the movie though based on a tragic Indian historical event, this will impact everyone who never want to be ruled by anyone.Thank you Maker's for bringing my childhood days of history classes and most importantly awakening the patriotism in best way ever.SardarI Udhamm Singh ji deserved this tribute...Acting wise Vicky kaushal is on fire and Amol parashar ...Man we needed little more screen time from you, you were unbelievable...Way to go....

388,bighneshm,Poor execution disappoints,2,16 October 2021,"Although the movie is based on the true story of a freedom fighter which is touching, yet the execution lacks understanding of 1920-45 era.The actor playing Bhagat Singh was constantly delivering dialogues which belonged more in a post 2000 era and not a true depiction of the way people would speak during 1920/30s.The clothing, hats accessories worn by Vicky Kaushal do not match the period or financial situation of a migrant working in factories. Skinny ties and ""load Lena"" do not belong in that era.",Sardar Udham

392,harshsaxena-17071,"I once said, ""Bollywood could never make a historical movie as impactful as 'Schindler's List'."". Shoojit proved me wrong.",10,17 October 2021,"Let me begin by telling you that I saw ""Madras Cafe"" few years back and never thought that Shoojit could make a better movie than that, it seemed THAT perfect to me. However, I was wronged, when saw ""Sardar Udham (2021)"" on Amazon Prime, and was struck deeply by the silent-to-the-world aftermath of Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, which is rarely discussed in History Books but shown loud and clear in the movie. I can't do justice in this small review with limited words about how perfectly the time period between 1920s to 1940s is shown in the movie. The sets, backgrounds, incidents, screenplay, dialogue and costumes are so well researched (this thing is missed in most bollywood historical movies), I praise everyone who were behind it. Vicky Kaushal gives his 100% and successfully justifies great ""Shaheed Udham Singh"" ji. Other than him, rest of the cast are also impactful.Now, coming to the core story, the best thing about ""Sardar Udham"" is that it not just tells you a story and gives you a 'history lesson', but makes you ask questions about everyone's actions involved, and through its non-linear story, gives you answers of them one by one. This makes it A MUST WATCH!Lastly, I want to say that this movie matches the level of Spielberg's Schindler's List, which is hardest to match (also, which is my favorite movie). Hats off to Shoojit and team!",Sardar Udham

He went to the gallows to be a martyr. It's a pity we don't celebrate this hero.Every Indian should watch this movie and every school and college should play this movie for the students.

It's really tough to review this movie after my heart plunged into an ocean of emotions. Anger & apathy filled my heart. This film makes us feel not worthy of the Freedom we enjoy today. The film generously portrays the anger of Shaheed Udham Singh for the evil and ruthless acts of the British Empire during 2 centuries they looted India . A must watch movie for awakening the INDIAN in you. A HUGE REMINDER to the criminal acts of the FILTHY BRITISH during the historic Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 & also to all those INDIANS who still work for the British.

You actually start feeling exhausted watching the aftermath of Jallianwala Bagh massacre scene. It made the point across. If only watching for few extra minutes can makes us feel exhausted. How would have Udham and other people would have felt.Jallianwala Bagh massacre scene and its aftermath almost felt like a horror movie, Udham who is now in this almost never ending cycle of death and destruction and wants to make everything right, and help everyone but he physically can't.Vicky Kaushal is GOAT and acting all across was very good and authentic to it's time. Thank god, they choose good English actors. Amol Prashar was great as Bhagat Singh, who actually looks like some one in his early 20s and not a grown man who looks atleast 40.Cinematography and Background score was top notch. Set design was amazing. Overall technically movie was 10/10.When they even showed children getting shot, in the most horrific yet realistic way. That's shows the guts of the producers. Thank you Mr. Lehri.Last but definitely not the least. Shoojit Sircar, you are a genius and the empathy you showed in the movie, really shows you character in real life.

413,pushandam,Sardar Udham - The best film made in 2021,9,19 October 2021,"This film has to be the best work of Shoojit Sircar's career without any doubt. The story telling that the director and the writers Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Ritesh Shah adopted was very unique and gripping. We have seen in Bollywood whenever films are made on India's freedom struggle or depicting the life of any freedom fighter the approach is quite different. Too much of jingoism is usually fed to the audience in the name of patriotism. But this film is completely different and not for a second will take that road. Top notch cinematography, very authentic visuals of the 1930-40s London will only make the film too realistic and grounded. Overall this has to be the best film made in India this year. Hats off to the entire team for pulling this off.",Sardar Udham

That ending scene was so long to the point of the feeling of frustration, as if it's in perpetuality and this hell will never end.The bird's eye view shots of the Indians from the shrubs coming out all lively in the glowy sunset, to the cold busy streets of London, to the amassed dead bodies at the ending, bruh I'm speechless I'm literally speechless.Best INDIAN FILM I'VE WATCHED SINCE 3 IDIOTS.",Sardar Udham
423,Aritra_Biswas_2020,Highly exaggerated,1,19 October 2021,"Miles away from reality. Worst pick of script by Vicky so far. Shoojit tried his best to show that all the protests only took place in Punjab, Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh & few other Punjabis were the only protestors(!!!). Only 2 or 3 events like the incident of The Jallianwala Bagh massacre are likely to be historically correct. Rest of the movie can be considered as a good drama. Nothing more. The mention of ""Based on true events"" has nothing to do with the movie.Alerts: Don't get confused by the paid critic's reviews & 9 out of 10 rating, it may disappoint you.",Sardar Udham

I hope I don't hear anything close to this for the rest of my life.There have been only three different media across everything to make me weep like a baby: Happiness (manga), Terror in Resonance (Anime) and Sardar Udham.If not as a foreign film entry than as an independent entry for Best Picture.

Some are decent, some are below average & most of them are unbearable with otherworldly odd vfx and whatsapp status special love songs no one asked for! In this suffocating condition of biographical movies, to break the sinister prototype skeleton, a cinematic revolution was much needed; Shoojit Sircar brought it with a masterstroke named Sardar Udham!Inspite of the promise shown by the film, I didn't expect that it can avoid the typical bollywood biography making formula completely and masterfully! I am not sure what to say and what not about this technically supreme work. From the colour and cinematography to the recreation of historically accurate scenes; from the extraordinary score to the blazing screenplay; everything was so technical that it demands a separate writing.There is no need of any forcibly induced emotional scenes or jingoistic dialogues when you have a strong story in hand and technical men at office. In this type of work, the rawness should be evident to justify the actions. Director did exactly the same. He kept the raw tone intact and treated it with a no nonsense approach.The movie did exceptionally well with some decision making. Use of original languages and not hindi in abnormal accent was one of the main reason why the movie feels so original. The story telling technique was also authentic. Special mention to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre recreation; it was so detailed, raw and moving that we can feel ourselves there!Vicky Kaushal added another feather in his cap delivering a composed, mature yet breathtaking performance as Udham Singh. Supporting casts were brilliant and apt. The unbiased development of characters was also superb. Actually there were hardly anything to complain about in this masterfully crafted movie.Sircar's Sardar Udham is the only biographical work coming out from Bollywood in recent years, which is able to break the rusty prototype and create a benchmark which will surely bring a wave of making serious movies devoid off the business model approach!

441,dh-67387,Outstanding movie,9,6 November 2021,"Don't get played by the paid critics who are saying negative words such a outstanding movie just for some money. As a person who loves movie, I would suggest everyone should see this movie. The level of production and acting seen is movie could be a Oscar winning performance. Though, it is being politically rejected by some censor board accusing that too much off hatred that is why they didn't proposed this movie to Oscar-These are peoples who play politics with such a great movie. I think that this movie is Shoojit Sircar's one of the masterpiece. Kudos to everyone who are associated with this movie. Everyone did their role perfectly which can be seen in every scenes.",Sardar Udham

443,divyatomer-19305,Overall fine..watch-able !,9,16 October 2021,Overall Vicky kaushal has done justice to the role..he always does that .. but the plot is too slow .. the story telling and putting the plots in unusual is too time consuming...it doesn't brings a sense of curiosity though..but the last scenes are up to the mark ..the pain of the scenes and loss to us as an Indian can be actually felt... was a good shot !

447,arijitbakshi-18522,Perfect Tribute for a Real Hero,10,18 October 2021,The film dipicts very part of Udham Singh's life in such a beautiful manner you never feel u are missing anything. Especially the scene of 1919 jalliwala bagh incident is cinematically so perfect you can feel the pain of the people in that in ident. True colour of Vicky Kaushal's perfect prenonsiation in punjabi makes you feel the moment so closely and how Udham singh would have felt being in that moment. Coustumes of Vicky ksushal has been so carefully identified and understood it makes justification to the role. At the end what was needed to be shown was really meaningful where Udham singh feels his Friend Bhagat Singh and follows his path of life and ideology is the perfect act of showing our Freedom fighters real contribution and last but not the least what has been the whole moto of his life was it meanginguly or not was perfectly shown in the movie.,Sardar Udham

449,siddhshah-30517,A Slow But Brilliant Detailed Vicky Kaushal Film,9,18 October 2021,"Sardar Udham is a film which needs to be seen with a lot of patience and heavy heart. The film is 2 hours and 42 minutes long and had many moments which could have been shown in a span of 5 to 10 minutes but the director increased the duration so with more and more of that sequence, the audience can actually feel and live the journey. The best & the most horrifying part of the movie is the Jallianwallah bagh massacre. The way it is shown in the film its very horrifying and disturbing. Vicky Kaushal gives his lifetime best performance in this film. Overall, Sardar Udham is a film that is not for everyone but the people who love artistic films will just completely love it.Rating- ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2.",Sardar Udham

461,hzara-32516,Shoojit Sircar's brilliant cinema makes this worth watching!,9,18 October 2021,"Have grown up reading about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in school and hearing the infamous mention of this piece of history, in many a patriotic film, but never ever, I imagined the brutality of the bloodbath, the massacre, so vividly and in such a horrific way, as it is shown in Shoojit Sircar's Sardar Udham. It makes you sit up and realize and understand the enormity of all that happened on a dreadful day. The 15-20 minutes of the Jallianwala bagh sequence is disturbing, to say the least, with thousands of bodies piled up, blood everywhere, people moaning in pain, and Sardar Udham shouting in angst - koi Zinda hai (is anyone alive)? Is enough to send chills down the spine and give you goosebumps. That one scene will definitely stay with you for a long time, leaving you teary-eyed and tugging at your heartstrings! It makes you feel helpless, fills you up with rage, makes you want to go down on your knees and pray for the people suffering and empathize with them!No doubt, there have been many patriotic films that leave a mark on you but somehow I felt, one way or the other, it always got bogged down by the eternal Bollywood-ism of loud music or unnecessary dialogues, trying to make the film or the protagonist larger than life, but Sardar Udham strictly refrains from toeing the treaded Bollywood line! It is unrelenting, non-apologetic in its premise of showing the true events, as is, without taking too many cinematic liberties. Shoojit Sircar's grip on the screenplay is so taut, that even at 2.45 hours of screentime, you cannot take yourself away from it all. Helping him in this is the wonderful cinematography of Avik Mukhopadhyay, which sets the tone for the film. Be it the misty Punjab farms, the snowcapped Russia, the bloodbath at the JB, everything lends authenticity to the plot.Vicky Kaushal's given a stellar performance from being a young boy unable to fathom what's going on to becoming totally stoic after seeing so many deaths to being totally focussed single-mindedly about avenging the JB massacre, in other words, he need not even ask - how's the josh? He practically lives Sardar Udham and fills you up with josh with his measured performance. Amol Parashar, Banita Sandhu, and Kristy Everton make an impression too, even though their roles being small.As said earlier too, Sardar Udham does not tread the familiar line, hence you do not have any gora talking in anglicized Hindi and all, (thank God and Shoojit) and thus you have Shaun Scott and Stephen Hogan again bringing authenticity to the table.Sardar Udham has a lot to offer in terms of the narrative, the cinematography, the action and it impacts you deeply and leaves you in a contemplative mood, long after you finish watching the movie. As Sardar Udham says ""probably for you JB is a footnote, written somewhere in fine print"" it was the same for me too until Shoojit Sircar decided to bring it on the canvas in such an explicit way, that now am able to comprehend and acknowledge the tragedy that was Jallianwala bagh in all its brutality!Sardar Udham is one movie that you are not going to forget in a hurry! Go for it!",Sardar Udham
462,hanokgangya,Great Movie 🎬,10,19 October 2021,"It's a very inspirational movie which shows the true efforts of revolutionaries.

476,abhisheksahu-04325,Not just a regular bollywood biopic,9,21 October 2021,"Sardar Udham Singh, A movie made for cinephiles did justice to the story and the brutality that needed to be shown on screen, I am glad it did not go through our sensor board otherwise the rawness would've subsided. I can't talk enough about it, the cinematography was the factor that attracted me the most after I watched the trailer but when I went into the movie, every single thing was just perfectly synchronized, the production, the score, the screenplay, the direction, the acting every single thing just made this a perfect treat for me and I think for most of the movie lovers. I've heard people found the first part slow but I think it was at a suitable pace, more speediness could've made it another Bollywood masala movie which was not good for the story it was pursuing. I remember when I first saw Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, I was just fascinated with everything even when it was ""Bollywoody"" sometimes, but this one just surpassed it. Kudos to the making team and specially Shoojit Sircar and love for Vicky Kaushal.",Sardar Udham

499,mohammadmahdiasgarinia,The Truth Always carrying pain...,8,21 October 2021,"Well, I have a lot to say about this movie:
1. I loved this movie very, very much, even though it was long and some of its scenes sometimes made you tired, but not tired of moving the film forward ,No, you'd be tired of all the cruelty you're seeing.2. Vicky's act was great 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 was extremely cheesy and classy with proper re-action and act-to-fit and just very good himself into the role
3. The director had come to inform about the oppression that had been inflicted on his people, and this oppression was inflicted not only on the People of India, but also to the entire population of the Middle East, including Iran,afghanistan,... during World War I and II, which he displayed very well and, of course, painfully.And he had the right choice in choosing the actor, I think and Vicky had played really well and had replaced Irfan Khan to fill somewhat well ...
P. N: Irfan Khan was supposed to be starring in the film, but his illness caused him to not do the film.4. The first half of the film is a little slow and bored, but the second half of the film while being very painful and sad, so if you don't have the heart to see the heartbreaking scenes don't see!!I'll add something, friends who saw Rang de basanti from Aamir Khan and liked it, they'd definitely like this movie because the space for the two films is about the same as everyone.Finally, if you're not interested in the historical-political genre, this movie is no good to you.Thanks.",Sardar Udham

The climax of this story was the not the assassination but it was what happened on that day. Amazing Acting by Vicky Kaushal, made the person feel connected to the story. Great direction as well. Some people are saying that film moving back fourth with time was bad, but I like it because that made the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh the highlight of the story. And don't think it is boring because there was not much action it, be patient because that man also waited 21 years. I think it is the closest thing we will get to see what happened on that awful. It will also helps people experience and understand what happen at Jallianwala Bagh and how it happened. The film and had great teaching and quotes from revolutionaries. I would encourage youngsters to watch this movie to not only know what Udham Singh did but also to and learn from the wonderful ideology of Bhagat Singh and Udham Singh.",Sardar Udham

Even the thought of the struggle people were put through during the British rule makes me sad. It's hight time Indians and Pakistanis realise that freedom struggle is the same for the both. We are just divided by the borders,other than that we fought for the same thing. Wonder how British supported their rule in India for 200 years and did this massacre and never even apologised to India and Pakistan.

But this one was just a waste of time.Half of the movie is silent. From the beginning, we get him walking in the snow for about 10 minutes with no commentary. In the climax, there's just people in interrogation rooms being asked the same questions in 10 different scenes, them saying a predictable NO. At the end we just see people being shot, and dead. The ending legit lasts for 20 minutes. He is then hanged. This is the most, by date, boring movie I've ever seen.

579,sanjivashukla,A Spielbergian Saga of an Indian Revolutionery!,9,17 October 2021,"This one is Shoojit Sarcar's magnum opus without doubt!Spielbergian in scale and craft, Sardar Udham is an unblemished cinematic experience and a blood-chilling saga of the making of a revolutionery.Though Shoojit's script reflects a sincere care for researching the character and the infinite ordeals of Ram Mohamed Singh Azad, this movie to me is a masterclass in filmmaking, more than anything else.The screeplay is deft, toggling meaningfully and creatively between time periods, traversing effortlessly through Amritsar, Russia and London, on the shoulders of the masterly Vicky Kaushal. Never mind that momentary compulsion of Shoojit to make Bhagat Singh clarify the difference between a terrorist and a revolutionery!You can watch Sardar Udham for its climax alone - probably among the most disturbing and gut-wrenching massacre sequences ever filmed in Indian cinema. Richard Attenborough's Jaliawala bagh sequence in Gandhi must have dwelled for long in Shoojit's head.Must watch!You'll be shocked to realize how thanklessly brazen have we become in handling our freedom.",Sardar Udham

Overall it is the emotional journey and I am sure this movie is not for everyone by saying that not everyone going to like it but the main reason to make this movie was to tell the story and show to the world what Udham Singh did for his country India.

618,mohammadasjad-31866,I am Proud Saheed udham Singh,10,18 October 2021,"It is interesting to watch this film now, in a week where a British MP has been brutally stabbed to death doing his job, and to maybe ask ourselves a question. What has the killing of a man ever actually achieved? It never makes anything any better. It serves to galvanise both sides and retrench enmities and bitterness that can take many years to wain. This film depicts one such story. That of a man who also passionately believed it was acceptable to take a life. His motives appear demonstrably justifiable as we watch this beautifully shot, frequently harrowing, depiction of the lead up to the atrocity of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919. It is told through the eyes of the assassin - Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal) and over the course of the next two hours, we are exposed to the events that drove a decent man to commit the ultimate sin, and to pay the ultimate penalty. Whilst it does take a little while to get going, Shoojit Sircar develops a story replete with conflicting emotions, that offers a critique on the prevailing imperial attitudes and on the very value of life itself. It clearly, and succinctly, exemplifies the cruelty visited on people who just wanted to be left to govern themselves; and of the shockingly arrogant superiority complex of those who believed these people to be little more capable of such aspirations than pets, or sheep. The film looks stunning - the imagery of India from grand scale to violent aftermath; the settings in London - all add hugely to the gusty integrity of this story. As with so much about the man himself, much is still be be made public about these events and about the true intent of the vice-regal, or British, government in making an example of these unarmed protesters - but this surmising offers an entirely plausible assessment of man's inhumanity to man - and sadly, over 100 years on from this - we appear to have learned little about the merits of killing another human being - friend or foe.",Sardar Udham

659,sumantahistory,Let the world know about the British Cruelty & Brutality.,10,23 October 2021,"Thank you Mr. Shoojit Sircar for presenting the brutality of the Britishers over the Indians in such a fantastic way of story telling and vision. The world should know that those rebels were not terrorists, they were freedom fighters, fighting for their birth rights.",Sardar Udham
660,baghelg-35467,Must watch movie for every Indian youngster.,10,23 October 2021,"Detailed explanation of jalia wala bagh open fire.And how udham singh contributed for our nation by standing shoulder to shoulder with baghat singh and othrr freedom fighters, this movie will let you know about that how and what kind of situations that was faced by our Indian citizens before independence.",Sardar Udham
661,the_take,"A history told beyond numbers, names and dates. Fully unadulterated",10,23 October 2021,"The movie is perfect. For the impatient ones watching the movie, it will tell you the story of the killing of Michael O Dwyer in first 30 mins. But at this point the movie starts to raise doubts, is this killing, is just a revenge, or an act of terror or a revolution? Right at this point some background of Udham Singh, working with Bhagat Singh is shown where Bhagat Singh defines what's a revolution. Udham Singh is arrested on the spot and a formal investigation starts in the movie, which shows more background on the events that lead from Jallianwala Bagh Massacre till this day.The movie shows how Udham Singh, having multiple chances to kill Michael O Dwyer, won't kill him just like that. He tries to understand O Dwyer's views, on how he felt about the Jallianwala Bagh, was it justified, with having a concealed gun in his hand and Dwyer casually drinking. The movie drop hints on PTSD faced by Udham Singh adds another dimension to the tragedy of the survivors.The best part of the movie is the sequence in which events are shown. It does shows the actual brutality but at the very end of the movie so as to not overwhelm the viewers with anger and anguish right from the beginning and give viewers a chance to see the real Udham Singh.The movie makes perfect sense in today's world, where mob-lynchings are getting comfortably justified rather than considering it as an act of terror. There is an urgent need of publicising adopting the right ideology of Bhagat Singh, and letting the people decide if there is unnecessary fear being instigated in the society by some people who then take advantage of this fear Or if the society is actually inspired.Thanks.",Sardar Udham
662,gopib-65307,The movie I always dreamt of,10,23 October 2021,"What a great tribute to the casualties in such a massacre in the history is India. Since the day, I studied in my books, I always wondered why there isn't any tribute for it. This is such a marvelous work by the team, I could feel each and every little instance that i studied about it. I could feel the emotion of my teacher while he taught us. The peaceful protest turned into the great massacre in the history of Indian farmer protest. For me, 1919 was a year to be remembered due to this massacre.It was such a pleasure to watch a movie which i randomly switched to, and turned out to be the one I always wanted to watch.""Jalianwala Bagh""
The story, screenplay, dedication of the team and the hardwork of the actor can be felt in every bit of the movie.A must needed and wonderfully screenplayed movie!!Great time watching ""Vicky Kaushal"" in such a role.

But Shoojit Sircar and the producers decided to go ahead with a dull, boring and sloppy screenplay. The result is a film that looks like a documentary film.

The movie is perfectly directed by the director and the way of presenting the story in front of us is resplendent. What a unique presentation.I don't know why some people didn't like this masterpiece even though it is a Hollywood level movie.It looks like high-level production, they showed us exactly the 20th-century atmosphere whether it is in England or India doesn't matter, it looks real and believable. Even they didn't compromise on Typer, they used old Typer in one scene as same as 20th-century. The director profoundly showed us this movie especially the last hour was too emotional. I just cried when I was watching the anguish of people and Sardar Udham in this last hour. I felt all this happening in front of me, such a realistic it was.This movie deserves more appreciation.",Sardar Udham

Its written everywhere, we hear from our parents, maybe grandparents about the stories of past. But have you experienced it? Have you experienced the intensity, the pain, the fear, the struggle of people who were forced to become slaves mentally, if not then physically. And the people who try to just fight for their freedom gets torchered brutally. You won't connect with that experience if you won't feel the way they did. And this movie would make you feel like that. Whoever you are, Indian or not, Just watch this movie. Watch how people torcher people, see how the people can become the most heinous animal. Make this movie so popular that even Britishers watch it. Consider it as your moral responsibly. This is a story that's needed to be told.",Sardar Udham
686,amaanshaikh-80154,Excellent work 💯,10,29 October 2021,"Vicky Kaushal is at the right age to play characters over extended timelines. He tackles the hard stuff confidently; you can feel his angst as Udham narrates the 1919 massacre, over visuals that show him as a young boy. Nevertheless, the sheer responsibility of the role seems to burden the actor. He shines in the unexpected bits, picking up a laddoo delightedly or confessing surprise with: ""Tussi jante ho?""""",Sardar Udham
687,prithwirajs-83270,Nice storytelling and breathtaking visuals,7,29 October 2021,"The storytelling in this movie is non-linear. It means they did not tell us the story in the actual sequence of the events rather they started by showing us the aftermath of the Jaliyan wala bagh massacre and through flashbacks showed the incidents which took place before the massacre. They showed the Massacre scene in the last. The story has developed very well throughout the whole movie but the speed of the movie is very slow. The visuals of this movie is of very high quality, comparable to the Hollywood movies. Oppressed India and old London has been portrayed very well in this movie. The visuals in the last massacre scene is on another level. The bgm used in this movie gave each scene more depth ,intensity and thrill and worked so well all together. But the problem with this movie , as per my point view, is the lack of intense acting and dramatic scenes. It lacks imaginative scenes and dialogues. It portrayed the incidents as it is and added no masala to it. If it was a documentary, then it's ok. But as it is a big-screen movie, little spicy drama is expected. There are not lot of impressive acting scene excluding the court room scene and massacre scene in the end. All over this movie deserve a high rating because of its compelling storytelling, impressive visuals , great direction and top-notch background score. But this movie is not for all kinds of audience because most of the lines are in British English and patience is needed to go through the storyline of the movie and slowly understanding every scene. Inspite of being patriotic, this movie does not contain any high level fighting scene and will not create any josh in you. It is emotional movie in the end to make us feel what our ancestors went through to give us freedom so that we don't use it in vain.",Sardar Udham
688,chakma-85225,Speechless,10,29 October 2021,One of the best movies based on historical events. The thirst for freedom runs in every human's blood. The right to live as a free human being in equal terms is what the world should strive for.,Sardar Udham

I hope, some good director makes a really good movie on our great revolutionary Udham Singh.Two movies made on our great revolutionary Bhagat Singh, namely, Shaheed and ""The Legend of Bhagat Singh"" are very well-made.

727,arpanjshah,Over 100 years and India is still waiting for an official apology from British government for Jallianwala Bagh massacre,10,18 October 2021,"Be prepared to go back in time - 100 years.Be prepared to witness the genocide by British.Be prepared to witness Shoojit Sircar and Vicky Kaushal produce their life's best work.I didn't go in with much expectations but at the end of the movie I was speechless, felt angry and yet proud of the Sircar and Vicky to take today's generation in the time they have barely even heard about in History books.The research Sircar has done is evident - from the sets to the level of details he presents. Editing is top notch. Background score is haunting. Cinematography is on par with some of the best war movies produced. 30 minutes in one would forget if this is an Indian Bollywood movie or an international movie - that too directed by an Indian director. Its that damn good.Part of me was glad that the movie didn't start with the Jallianwala massacre because I wasn't ready for it. May be because it has been portrayed in several movies by now. But by the end I was proven wrong. Never ever has the story of what unfolded on that dreadful day in 1919 been told with this boldness. It's not for faint hearted. But it's a must see for every Indian.Don't read those reviews from guardian. News18 and others. They are trying to bring down a masterpiece as they don't want the world to see the genocide British government officials committed and went unpunished for a century.It's been 102 years since then and as the movie says at the end we Indians are still waiting for an official apology from British government.Must watch for every Indian living on the planet. Even if you are not an Indian watch it to witness the brilliance of the character and atrocities the nation and its citizens had gone through in just a slice of what was the freedom movement.Thank you Sircar and Vicky for the brilliant masterpiece. You guys are leagues ahead than the junk Bollywood has been producing last decade.",Sardar Udham

731,Stnerol,Glorification of a vengeful killer,3,7 November 2021,"There is definitely a potential for a good film here. There is an interesting history at bottom, fine production values, and it is not as bombastic as might be expected.However, as the film progresses it becomes clear that its sole purpose is to glorify the titular character, who is really rather flat and single-mindedly ideological. Had I looked up the meaning of ""Sardar"" in advance of watching, I might have known better what to expect.And so, in lieu of complexity and depth, the whole thing ends up looking mostly like a capitalization upon feelings of vengefulness and nationalistic pride. The aftertaste is not great. Might I suggest a re-watch of the Gandhi film instead?",Sardar Udham
732,sarkar-ko1995,Amazing movie and fabulous acting,10,30 October 2021,I'm just amazed after seeing this movie. Level of movie is so high that any word would be not enough to describe this movie. Acting is of another level.,Sardar Udham

Some great shots of Russia, UK and rural India but really strange direction and cinematography. All the transitions are random and the movie does not feel like a story in any sense.

739,barutibikram-162-573837,Cinematic Masterpiece.,10,20 October 2021,"Seldom comes a cinema so deeply engrossing, the latest directional venture by Shoojit Sircar is the finest tribute to the life of Sardar Udham Singh. This multilayered and heart wrenching film is easily one of the best movie of this decade. The movie works in multiple parallel story lines, and it has been skilfully intertwined with the final act. It starts at a slow pace, putting the characters at its locations and giving the audience a chance to feel the same emotion and frustration young Udham was feeling. Shoojit Sircar lets the audience connect to this journey, without spoon feeding the gravitas of the circumstances. The circumstances are itself powerful and patiently directed. Thanks to the mesmerising cinematography. The color palettes and set design transports the audience into the WW1 era. It speaks volumes about the hard-work and dedication the technical team has gone through to recreate that bygone era. The background score by Shantanu Moitra was cherry on the cake. The music was used so subtly that it never overpowered the essence of the act, but in a way dissolved in the anger and pain of Sardar Udham. The theme music named "" Time to meet my friend"" which was played in a couple of scenes was extremely heartbreaking. And finally the acting. Vicky Kaushal is magnetic in this movie. His eyes did most of the acting. What a great actor he is! Outstanding! He truly engulfed the soul of Udham Singh, with his extremely resilient yet powerful performance. His desperation, his laughs, his anger was naturally moulded in this movie. It is without any doubt his best performance, even surpassing his acting in Masaan. The British actors are meticulously selected and each one of their performance needs a mention. Shaun Scott as Michael O'Dwyer is brilliant. His dialogue delivery was top notch, making this version of Dwyer believable. Stephen Hogan did a commendable job. The acting was on flow and natural as if real investigation was being carried out. Kirsty Averton's role is minimal. I wished to see her more in other movies.As the film moves to the last 40 min, the movie sets on a roller coaster. The scenes were deeply emotional and tragic. Perhaps such kind of portrayal of Jallianwala Bagh massacre was never filmed in Indian cinema. Shoojit Sircar didn't cuts the scenes. He lets us to fully take on to the upheaval. As the movie close to end, I was devastated. I was numb to the core realising the actual pain and trauma those people had witnessed on that fateful day. Watch Sardar Udham, not just for its history, but for its near perfect execution on screen and to witness the greatness of Ram Mohammad Singh Azad.This movie will surely take away multiple awards in its bag. This is the film of this year and will find itself in the list of best International movies of 2021. Go, experience this art yourself.",Sardar Udham
740,kdheeraj012,Incredible,10,18 October 2021,"Truth presented in a remarkable way.

744,harnekchera,An important chapter in a long fight for freedom!,9,17 October 2021,"Heart wrenching, dark and emotional portrayal of a complex character who had many other aspects to his life not touched upon here. Rather than a biopic it delivers snap shot views of defining periods of his life and what drove his singular focus to avenge one of the most horrific events in British Empire history. Excellent directing and production gave the Udham Singh story the loneliness and isolation I sadly think he endured during his short life. A true revolutionary whose story will now be known more widely.",Sardar Udham

748,swatisinghaks,One word : Masterpiece,10,19 October 2021,"This is not a movie, it's an emotional journey of a young lad based on research and facts gathered over 20 years. His growth, bravery and grit captured by Shoojit Sircar is once in a lifetime work that one gets to see. Cinematography is class apart dare I say better than most Hollywood movies. Deserves a whole lot of praise. I caught myself saying wow unknowingly at the colors portrayed on the screen.All the actors are well casted and have acted to the tee. No heavy dialogues, no chest thumping music and no urgency after all it's a journey of 20 years.If you have patience, you will absolutely go back and re-watch it that's how good this cinema is.Last 1 hour you feel an impending doom coming but when it hits you, it leaves you numb and heart broken.In the end, I don't want to disrespect the main actor by talking about his acting as it's class apart.Last but not the least "" What were YOU doing when you were 23"" ?

749,raghurj,Patriotism doesnt need to be loud until it is.,10,23 October 2021,"This movie in totality redefines indian way of potraying the life of a revolutionary, in a film. The storytelling deeply and convincingly conveys the real story of Udham Singh without the usual melodrama. The art direction is rock solid capturing the early 1900s. Such detailing is splendid but not unexpected from Shoojit Sircar.Vicky Kaushals best work to date and he will have to try too hard to do better.The supporting cast couldnt have been more real than reel. The foreign nationals in the film thankfully were well accented and not made into the usual animated characters with atrocious dialogue deliveries we most often see.The massacre so unforgivingly shot, it truly drills in the motive and the perseverance into our minds what Udham Singh had in his heart to kill.A masterpiece.",Sardar Udham

Shoojit Sircar has done a brilliant job. Even if the movie revolves around Shaheed Udham Singh, each character has been given their own space. Bhagat Singh's character does not overshadow the character of Udham Singh and the balance between both the characters is very well done. The depiction Jallianwala Baug Massacre was something no one expected. The aftermath of the massacre really made me cry. It made me furious and justifies Shaheed Udham Singh's actions. Even after more than 100 years, the story and scenes of the massacre sends chills down our spine. Hats off to the entire team for creating such a brilliant masterpiece that shows the younger generation the untold story of one of the prominent freedom fighters of this country.",Sardar Udham

762,goluufageria,Best,10,10 November 2021,"""Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all"" - Bhagat SinghWow! What an incredible piece of Cinema I have just been a witness of! I'm truly captivated by Sircar's direction and the way he addressed such a heroic act of patriotism. And I can't convey enough appreciation for representing such a fairly unknown story of the Martyr, Udham Singh; who against all the odds made the impossible. He shook the British empire to its core and sent out a decisive statement against their heinous colonialism.From a technical stance alone, I must admit, this was something very special! I had never seen a historical drama on such an enormous scale before. From the detailed set designs to the astounding Cinematography, the commendable art direction to the world-building; it has every right to be considered as a landmark in Indian filmography. Trust me, supervising any sets with that many people and intricacies; it's easier said than done. And this gets even more fascinating when you consider the restricted expenditures!Likewise, the performances leave quite an impression. Amongst the entire cast, Vicky Kaushal's act indisputably draws our attention the most. Particularly, towards the end. Where, in my opinion; he gives his absolute best. Speaking of the rest of the ensemble, I was amazed to observe such a capable group of foreign nationals playing their roles with utmost affection and integrity!My only criticisms are in regards to the comparatively long-winded screenplay and its Non-linear structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for Non-linear storytelling, but I'm not sure whether it was an absolute necessity in this case.Even though I gotta say, that whole Jallianwala Bagh massacre sequence is no less than a cinematic brilliance. No matter, how tough you deem yourself to be, remember the words; it's gonna break your heart. If it was up to me, I would have probably inaugurated the film with this portion rather than placing it near the climax. That way, I guess the impact would have been far greater.Lastly, I just wanna thank all the people who have contributed to such an ambitious endeavour and I wanna give my regards to Mr Shoojit Sircar as he's done plentiful to denote the atrocities of British Imperialism. Innumerable manslaughters, abscondings, tortures; the British without any question, shares a dark & sinful past with our country and its people.My heartiest admiration goes to all the martyrs and their families who sacrificed everything just to break the shackles and to get our much-awaited Sovereignty & Freedom. And most importantly they did all that while being unified, irrespective of class, religion or Identity.",Sardar Udham
